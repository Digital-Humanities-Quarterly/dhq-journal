            </p>
            <p>You might also want to look at the <a href="ssTest/staticSearch_report.html">build report</a>
                from the staticSearch build process.</p>
            
            <p>This is the index page for the Static Search test data set. This data set is designed
                to cover a range of different input document types and configurations in order to
                test a variety of scenarios the codebase needs to handle, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nested folders.</li>
                <li>Documents with and without ids (this has one).</li>
                <li>With and without titles (this has one).</li>
                <li>Good range of HTML elements providing scope for testing context stuff.</li>
                <li>Foreign languages and non-latin stuff such as Japanese.</li>
                <li>Hyphenated terms, single and double, such as one-way street and hard-to-process sequences.</li>
                <li>Apostrophes in various positions, including leading, trailing, and word-internal.</li>
                <li>Names, both in sentence-initial and sentence medial positions. Fred Bloggs and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley are examples.</li>
                <li>Numbers such as 25, 2,302, and 3.14159, or currency amounts such as £4,500 or ¥9,000,000.</li>
                <li>Items that should not be indexed (such as line numbers attached to poetic lines).</li>
                <li>Constrained contexts which should delimit keyword-in-context ranges, such as table cells.</li>
                <li>Inline elements whose boundaries should be ignored when indexing.</li>
                <li>Fragment ids for specifying anchor links from KWICs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are three poems, two Victorian and one Japanese (about cicadas). There are also two documents
            with tables, one of which deals with liquor consumption in British Columbia, while the other has numbers
            such as 1783 and percentages such as 73.58%. One of the poems includes the phrase <q>summer day—our day</q>, 
            and if we follow that to the next line we get <q>our day Was clouded</q>, which should be indexed/found 
                in this document, but not in the source poem, where lines are boundary contexts. The apostrophes document
                is an excerpt from Martin Porter’s site (note the curly apostrophe in his name).</p>
            
            <p>The word <em>artichoke</em> appears here and in one other document, but it is included in the 
            test stopwords list so it should not be indexed or retrieved.</p>
