            <p>The following is a segment of Martin Porter's discussion of apostrophes in English for the Porter2 Stemmer:
                <a href="http://snowball.tartarus.org/texts/apostrophe.html">http://snowball.tartarus.org/texts/apostrophe.html</a>, included here as it provides good examples of apostrophes (for instance, <q>o'clock</q>, <q>O'Reilly</q>, etc.).
            </p>
            <p> The text is unchanged, but it has been slightly re-encoded (<code>p</code>s instead of <code>br</code>s, for instance).</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>[...]</p>
                <p>In English orthography, apostrophe has one of three functions.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It indicates a contraction in what is now accepted as a single word:
                        <i>o’clock</i>, <i>O’Reilly</i>, <i>M’Coy</i>. Except in proper names such forms
                        are rare: the apostrophe in <i>Hallowe’en</i> is disappearing, and in
                        <i>’bus</i> has disappeared.</li>
                    <li>It indicates a standard contraction with auxiliary or modal verbs:
                        <i>you’re</i>, <i>isn’t</i>, <i>we’d</i>. There are about forty of these forms in
                        contemporary English, and their use is increasing as they displace the full
                        forms that were at one time used in formal documents. Although they can be
                        reduced to word pairs, it is more convenient to treat them as single items
                        (usually stopwords) in IR work. And then preserving the apostrophe is
                        important, so that <i>he’ll</i>, <i>she’ll</i>, <i>we’ll</i> are not equated with
                        <i>hell</i>, <i>shell</i>, <i>well</i> etc.</li>
                    <li>It is used to form the ‘English genitive’, <i>John's book</i>, <i>the horses’
                        hooves</i> etc. This is a development of (1), where historically the apostrophe
                        stood for an elided <b><i>e</i></b>. (Similarly the printed form <b><i>’d</i></b> for <b><i>ed</i></b> was
                        very common before the nineteenth century.) Although in decline (witness <i>pigs
                            trotters</i>, <i>Girls School Trust</i>), its use continues in contemporary
                        English, where it is fiercely promoted as correct grammar, despite (or it might
                        be closer to the truth to say <i>because of</i>) its complete semantic redundancy.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>For these reasons, the English stemmer treats apostrophe as a letter, removing
                    it from the beginning of a word, where it might have stood for an opening
                    quote, from the end of the word, where it might have stood for a closing quote,
                    or been an apostrophe following <b><i>s</i></b>. The form <b><i>’s</i></b> is also treated as an ending.</p>

          <p>This additional paragraph contains a couple of other test items for the tokenizer, including a word containing a combining diaeresis (U+0308, for issue #164). For this we have invented a word which must use a combining diacritic rather than a precomposed character because the precomposed character does not exist; this helps to avoid inadvertent composition. The word puc̈ist is made up for this purpose, along with the word puq̈uist.</p>
