                <h1 class="texte">1. How Do Cryptic Crossword Clues Work?</h1>
                <p class="texte" id="p1"><span class="paranumber">1</span>Whereas a “simple” crossword clue is merely a definition, a cryptic clue is a more sophisticated puzzle typically consisting of two parts: a definition and a set of codified instructions for building the solution. These components are woven into a phrase or sentence which has its own internal logic usually unconnected with the actual answer, intended to mislead the solver. This is a recent example from a <em>Guardian</em> crossword: </p>
                <blockquote id="q1">
                    <div class="textandnotes">
                        <ul class="sidenotes">
                            <li><span class="num">2</span> “Cruciverbalists” (crossword compilers) are customarily known by pseudonyms, a tradition which goes back to the earliest days. The same compiler will often publish under distinct pseudonyms in different publications.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                        <p class="citation">Amending pub sign, add in Cook’s vessel (7,5) <br />(Nutmeg<a class="footnotecall" id="bodyftn2" href="#ftn2">2</a> 2017)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="paragraphesansretrait" id="p2">The answer is <em>PUDDING BASIN</em>, an anagram of “pub sign add in,” defined by “Cook’s vessel.” The instruction to decode an anagram is provided by the word “amending.” The complete clue suggests perhaps the addition of HMS Endeavour to a pub signboard. The words comprising the “constructor” (my term for instructions for constructing the answer) are purposely obscured by their distribution across a phrasal boundary. Here is a second example: </p>
                <blockquote id="q2">
                    <p class="citation">Guard dog kept within sight (6) <br />(<em>Daily Telegraph</em> 2002)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="paragraphesansretrait" id="p3">The definition here is the first word alone. The “constructor” can be explained thus: put a word for “dog” (CUR) inside a word for “insight” (SEE) to create <em>SECURE</em>, which can be glossed as “guard.” The coherence of the familiar phrase “guard dog” confounds the solver’s attempt to separate the constructor from the definition, as does the fact that the word “sight” is a noun in the context of the whole clue, but a verb when used as part of the constructor. Other types of cryptic clues exist, but this type (definition with instructions for construction) is the most common in modern cryptic crosswords and will be the focus of this article.</p>
