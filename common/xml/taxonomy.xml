			<!-- DEFINITION CREATION AND REVIEW NOTES: -->

			<!--Original definitions drafted by R. B. Faure and Benjamin Grey 06/2022. The definitions are largely from the xml id of each entry and are supplemented with the revised/alternate terms. -->

			<!-- Review process involves checking a random sampling of articles tagged with the keyword (approx. 5) against the proposed definition. In situations where definition seems inadequate, further clarifications were added (or subtracted). A key part of this process involves checking the other keywords used to tag the article so that each definition remains a unique category. -->

			<!-- Articles which are the cause of a change to the definition should be indicated as a comment for the purposes of later review. Review process begun 07/22. -->

				<head>About the DHQ topical categories</head>
				<p>DHQ has created a set of topic identifiers to help identify the subject areas
					of DHQ articles: both to assist readers in discovering articles on specific
					topics, and also to assist in identifying commonalities between articles.
					These identifiers do not attempt to provide a fine-grained mapping of all
					possible knowledge areas or anticipate all possible future subject areas
					for DHQ articles. They are more of a pragmatic attempt to map out the
					current subject domains within which DHQ articles are clustered. </p>
				<p>The initial version is based on an analysis of several sources: <list>
						<item>keywords used by the annual Digital Humanities Conference (both
							proposed by presenters and provided by the organizers)</item>
						<item>keywords provided by DHQ article authors</item>
						<item>the DHQ editors' own observation and analysis of the existing
							collection of DHQ articles</item>
					</list> Drawing on these materials, the DHQ editors assembled an initial
					list which was then reviewed for duplicates and synonyms, and then reviewed
					again to consolidate similar topics (such as "mobile applications" and
					"mobile design"). Because in many cases differences of terminology reflect
					discipline-specific usage, we have retained multiple descriptors for each
					topic area, grouped together under a single identifier. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<head>Usage and expansion</head>
				<p>Each DHQ article contains in its metadata one or more identifiers which in
					turn reference items in this taxonomy. These topic areas will be used in
					several ways within the DHQ publishing system: <list>
						<item>in the DHQ search interface, to enable readers to search for
							articles on a particular topic area</item>
						<item>to generate a topic index that groups together articles by topic
							area</item>
						<item>to support a "find similar" feature that generates for each
							article a list of other articles that share some or all of its
							topic areas</item>
					</list>
				</p>
				<p>When an article is accepted for publication, its authors are prompted to
					choose appropriate topic identifiers from the DHQ list, and they may also
					propose new topical identifiers. Authors may also include one more more
					authorial keywords, which might be more specific (for instance,
					discipline-specific subject areas or terms). Authorially assigned keywords
					are immediately included in the article metadata. Proposed additional topic
					identifiers are reviewed by the DHQ editors at regular intervals and added
					to the formal list as appropriate. At intervals, the DHQ editors will also
					review authorially assigned keywords and determine whether additional
					identifiers are needed.</p>
