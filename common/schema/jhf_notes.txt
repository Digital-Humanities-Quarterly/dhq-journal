Schema development notes

**********************
General Work and File Info

Current versions:
DHQauthor-TEI.xml: the ODD file
DHQauthor-TEI.rng: the schema


State of play:
--the current ODD and schema are valid and include working DHQ metadata and creative commons license info.
--all appropriate DHQ features should be valid
--some content models are still too inclusive but this may be OK


***************************
Changes made to target encoding

These are differences between the original DHQ markup and the new TEI-DHQ markup.


Metadata:

<DHQauthor> ==> <dhq:


<name> in <DHQauthor> is now <author_name>

<label> in <bibl> is now @label on <bibl> 






****************************
Changes required to processing


Only display @label on <bibl> when it appears inside <listBibl>







**************************
Notes and questions

Do we still need to have the issue title in the metadata for the article, since that's managed now in the TOC file?

Punch list from header

Header
DONE: add controlled value list for @type of <idno> in the <publicationStmt>
DONE: add <dhq:articleType>
DONE: need to permit Creative Commons element inside <availability> (substitute for required <p>)
Done: add <dhq:family> within <dhq:author_name> in <dhq:author>


Body
DONE: need to require @rend on <quote>
DONE:[p is permitted in figure] need to provide for captions in figures (use <p>?)
DONE: [p is permitted in table] need to provide for captions in tables
DONE: fix problem that table requires more than one row

DONE: remove figure from <cit>
DONE: remove <egXML>
DONE: change <example> to use <head> instead of <label>
DONE: remove <address>
DONE: [@label is now an attribute on bibl] make <label> required first child of <bibl>
make @xml:id required on <bibl> in <listBibl> in <back> (Schematron?)

DONE: make <teaser> and <abstract> unavailable in ordinary <div> currently in model.divlike; perhaps instead should simply be children of <front>?

More tightly constrain contents of:
label (shouldn't have <figure>, <formula>, or <graphic>)
ref (shouldn't have <figure>, <formula>, <graphic>, <list>,  <example>, <table>, <stage>)
title (shouldn't have <figure>, <formula>, <graphic>, <list>,  <example>, <table>, <stage>)
DONE: list (probably shouldn't have <dateLine>, <figure>, <dateLine>, <salute>
said (shouldn't have <figure>, <formula>, <graphic> or <table>
bibl (shouldn't have <figure>, <formula>, <graphic> or <table>)

stage (shouldn't have <figure> or <table>; should be semantically limited?)
name (currently macro.phraseSeq; shouldn't have <figure>, <formula>, <graphic>, <bibl>, <address> - should be semantically constrained)


date
foreign (shouldn't really have anything in it except PCDATA)
hi (shouldn't really have anything)
term (shouldn't really have anything)
emph (shouldn't really have anything)
email (should only have an email address)

Anticipated issues:

DONE: need PCDATA within <cit>?
treatment of <term>, <called>, v/v rendition
need to think about <eg>, <example>, 

Philosophical questions:
-should we try to eliminate elements from places where they will/should not be used (e.g. model.global) or tolerate them on the principle that we may need them and can avoid misusing them? Examples: within <label>, elements permitted include <figure>, <graphic>, <address>; within <name>, elements permitted include <graphic>, <code>, <title>, <bibl>, etc.

Schematron
-check the contents of <quote> based on @rend (paragraphs not allowed in "inline", and "inline" quotes not allowed directly in <div>)
-check for required @xml:id on <bibl> in <listBibl> in <back>
-check for accuracy of values of @xml:lang
