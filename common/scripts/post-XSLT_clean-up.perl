# 	$PROGRAM_NAME < IN.xml > OUT.xml
#
# effect
# ------
# This routine reads in a file from STDIN (which *could* be anything,
# but *should* be well-formed XML) and writes out a version of the
# same file (to STDOUT) that has been altered:
# * Redundant CDATA marked sections (defined as those that have
#   neither ‘<’ nor ‘&’ in their content) changed to just simple
#   text nodes.
# * The prolog and 1st start-tag have been re-written to use three
#   particular xml-model PIs and a particular set of namespaces, out-
#   put with particularly nice whitespace to make it readable.
#
# Notes
# -----
# 1) No actual XML parsing takes place, so this routine will also
#    change things that look like CDATA marked sections that are
#    in comments or PIs. (While the same is technically true of the
#    prolog, since by definition it only occurs before the 1st start-
#    tag, it is not much of a problem.)
#
# 2) This routine reads in the entire input file (as a single line)
#    at one time. So if you have *very* large input files, you may
#    run out of memory. (The largest article file in DHQ is < ½ MiB,
#    so this should not be a problem at all on any modern computer.)
#
# 3) If speed is becoming a problem, you can make this program much
#    faster by removing the “Use English;” and its dependencies
#    (i.e., change “$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR” to “$/” and “$ARG” to
#    “$_”). Reducing the entire program to just 6 lines:
#    | #!/usr/bin/env perl
#    | undef $/;
#    | $_=<>;
#    | s,<!\[CDATA\[([^<&]+?)\]\]>,$1,g;
#    | s,^(<\?xml[^-][^>]+\?>)\s*(<\?(xml-model|oxygen)[^>]+\?>)+\s*<TEI[^>]+>,$1\n<?xml-model href="../../common/schema/DHQauthor-TEI.rng"    type="application/xml" schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" ?>\n<?xml-model href="../../common/schema/DHQauthor-TEI.isosch" type="application/xml" schematypens="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"?>\n<?xml-model href="../../common/schema/dhqTEI-ready.sch"     type="application/xml" schematypens="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"?>\n<TEI xmlns=      "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"\n     xmlns:cc=   "http://web.resource.org/cc/"\n     xmlns:dhq=  "http://www.digitalhumanities.org/ns/dhq"\n     xmlns:html= "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"\n     xmlns:mml=  "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"\n     xmlns:rdf=  "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">,;
#    | print;
#    cuts execution time to ~59% what it is now. (Adding my usual
#    echo before each execution reduces that advantage to ~71% of
#    time it takes now.)
