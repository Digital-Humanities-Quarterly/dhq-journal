<!-- This file is used by title_index.xsl to filter out the words we choose not
    to use when sorting alphabetically. The current choices are from the
    Chicago Manual of Style.
    The trailing space is required (they function as word boundaries) as there are
    titles that begin with 'a' that would then have their initial word ignored for
    sorting. [CRB] -->
