                  <p>Melissa Terras hales from Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, and ignored computers until her final year
                of her undergraduate MA, in History of Art and English Literature at the University of Glasgow (1998). 
                Discovering the Internet (and something that she was good at) led to an MSc in IT (Software and Systems), 
                also at Glasgow in 1999. In 2002 she completed her doctorate at the University of Oxford, which was a 
                joint project between the Department of Engineering Science and the Centre for the Study of Ancient 
                Documents, on using image processing and artificial intelligence to try and "read" the Roman documents
                from Vindolanda.</p>
                  <p>Melissa then spent a year at the Royal Academy of Engineering, as assistant manager of the Policy
                    unit, providing impartial advice to the UK government on matters scientific. Now at University
                    College London, she is a lecturer in the School of Library, Archive, and Information Studies on 
                    Internet Technologies, Web Publishing, and Digital Resources in the Humanities. She is acting 
                    Secretary of ALLC (2005/6) and an Officer of the Association for Computers and the Humanities 
                    (2005-8), as well as being involved in other consultancy activities within the Digital Humanities
                    field. She is interested in computational techniques which would allow research in the Humanities
                    that would otherwise be impossible.</p>

         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>This editorial reflects on developments to DHQ and the ways we can assess impact and

            <p>In its second issue, DHQ discovers the power of viral marketing.</p>

      <body>
         <p>Welcome to the second issue of DHQ. It is difficult, at this stage in a journal’s
            progress, to monitor uptake, success, or readership. Where can we start? The launch of
            DHQ was emblazoned across various discussion lists (such as <ref target="http://www.princeton.edu/humanist/">Humanist</ref>, <ref target="http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/discussion">Digital Classicist</ref>, <ref target="http://listserv.uleth.ca/mailman/listinfo/dm-l">Digital Medievalist</ref>,
            <ref target="http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?a0=tei-l ">TEI-L</ref>)
            and featured on many blogs (such as <ref target="http://grandtextauto.gatech.edu/">Grand
                Text Auto</ref>, <ref target="http://www.stoa.org/">Stoa</ref>, and personal blogs
            from those within the digital humanities community). DHQ is pointed to from the Digital
            Humanities entry on <ref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital_humanities">Wikipedia</ref>, linked to by over <ref target="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=link%3ahttp%3a%2f%2fwww.digitalhumanities.org%2fdhq%2f&amp;btng=search&amp;meta= ">40 different home pages</ref>, and has been saved and tagged by 90 different
            individuals on <ref target="http://del.icio.us/url/723fc5626023597778345bc4297699a6">del.icio.us</ref>, suggesting we have reached thousands of potential readers.</p>
         <p>Still, with the comments feature yet to be enabled (we are still building the back end
            of the site, and this experiment of a journal will continue to evolve with each issue)
            it is difficult to gain a feel for opinions regarding the journal — save from those
            individuals which have taken the time to email the editors directly with their
            congratulations. Comments on del.icio.us generally raised one question about our format:
            <ref target="http://del.icio.us/url/723fc5626023597778345bc4297699a6">Where is the RSS
                feed?</ref> And we are pleased that this issue features this functionality, alerting
            you when we have added new content to the journal (which we plan to do even between
            issues).</p>
         <p>So far so good, even if the digital humanities community can be viewed as being fairly
            small, fairly insular, and fairly unlikely to reach out to wider academic and
            technological sphere. We at DHQ hope that we will eventually reach a wider audience (and
            trust our readers will help us do so), introducing the type and range of activities the
            digital humanities community is interested in, and featuring energetic, novel, and
            interesting articles on a variety of research, making use of all the Internet
            technologies at our disposal.</p>
         <p>One of the papers in this, our second issue, has already done just that. Dennis G. Jerz's
            <ref target="/dhq/vol/1/2/000009/000009.html">Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will
                Crowther's Original <title>Adventure</title> in Code and in Kentucky</ref>, was
            posted on the test site for proofreading a few weeks before launch, when one of our
            editors featured an advance mention of it on his blog. A few days later, it was picked
            up by the gaming community on a popular discussion list (<ref target="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.int-fiction/browse_frm/thread/607acaf1a279d4dd/bd53b672a185d177#">rec.arts.int-fiction</ref>), garnering comments such as <q>HOLY MOLY!</q> and <q>It
                    is clear on a single reading that this is the most important single paper ever
                    written on the history of interactive fiction</q> ­ before it had even been formally
            published. It doesn’t stop there: the paper went on to be featured on <ref target="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/13/maze_of_twisty_littl.html">Boing
                Boing</ref> (a <q>directory of wonderful things</q> which is read by hundreds
            of thousands of readers), then being mentioned on <ref target="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/14/011230">Slashdot</ref>,
            the popular technology-related news site. (We are pleased to report our servers survived
            being <q>slashdotted</q> so far, which is perhaps the best load test we could
            wish for). Shortly after, it featured on <ref target="http://www.metafilter.com/63774/say-xyzzynothing-happens">Metafilter</ref>,
            a community weblog that anyone can edit with a vast readership, where comments included
            <q>What academic research should aspire to be</q> and <q>I can feel a new LOLCATS
                meme coming on. (I can haz mint-cake?)</q>. On the eve of publication, we have had a
            request from a local Kentucky newspaper wishing to republish the paper (which our
            publication terms willingly permit). This paper has legs.</p>
         <p> In addition, publication on DHQ has made the original game available again for a new
            audience. When the preprint version of this article became available on the internet in
            August 2007, <ref target="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/adv_crowther.zip">Matthew
                Russoto</ref> modified Crowther's source code so that it will compile for today's
            computers. <ref target="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/pc/adv_crowther_win.zip">David
                Kinder</ref> made a Windows executable version. The colossal cave lives again.</p>
         <p>Of course, this is due to the contents of the article: Will Crowther's classic computer
            game <title>Colossal Cave Adventure</title> created the text-adventure game genre, and
            this paper details new evidence discovered when unearthing Crowther's original source
            code (in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike, on a Unix server), which was
            thought lost. The original game is compared to the real Colossal Cave in Kentucky, with
            some surprising insights into the structure and history of the game. The contribution of
            this article to gaming history, given the popularity of games with the type of people
            who read Slashdot or Boing Boing or Metafilter, is assured. Yet the popularity of this
            article, even before publication, also indicates how work in digital humanities, and
            publications in <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title>, can reach
            beyond our disciplinary boundaries, and provide interesting, entertaining, and
            academically rigorous contributions to a general reader beyond the usual digital
            humanities suspects.</p>
         <p>We hope other articles in this issue tickle readers in the same way. Some useful
            connections emerge between Jerz's article and Eric Eve's analysis of the challenges of
            interactive fiction design, both of which present a thematic perspective grounded in a
            detailed view of the structure and coding of the game. Steve Anderson examines the
            emerging digital practices and techniques that distinguish the digital avant garde, and
            David Hoover argues for the critical and interpretive value of text analysis.</p>
         <p>We also hope that the success of this article indicates the importance and benefits of
            publishing in DHQ. We encourage you to continue with us in this experiment: submit,
            review, and enjoy.</p>
