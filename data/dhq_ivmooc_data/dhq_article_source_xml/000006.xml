                  <p>Joseph Raben is a professor emeritus of English at Queens College of
				the City University of New York, where he taught for 30 years. Before that he was a
				teaching fellow at Indiana University and an instructor at Princeton University. He was
				awarded a B.A. with honors at the University of Wisconsin and a Ph.D. at Indiana
				University, where he minored in folklore under Stith Thompson. His bachelor's honors
				thesis was on pronunciation as revealed by rhyme schemes in American folksongs, and his
				doctoral dissertation studied folk speech in Scott's novels. After graduating from
				Wisconsin, he worked as an engineering aide on the construction of the Hanford Engineer
				Works, and then entered the Army, where he was trained in spoken Japanese and served in
				Tokyo as an editor of translations in the Allied Translator and Interpreter Service,
				attached to GHQ. In this service he translated documents used in the war crimes trials.</p>
                  <p>At Queens he developed an interest in using computers in humanities research and in 1966
					founded the innovative journal <title rend="italic">Computers and the Humanities</title> to provide a
					platform for younger pioneering scholars to publish their research. He both edited and
					carried a large share of this journal's publication chores for 20 years. Among its most
					useful features was a semiannual <title rend="italic">Directory of Scholars Active</title>, which informed
					practitioners around the world of recent applications of computer technology to
					humanities and related social science problems. These notes he cumulated into a print
					volume, <title rend="italic">Computer-Assisted Research in the Humanities</title> (New York: Pergamon Press,
					1977). In 1978 he founded the Association for Computers and the Humanities and served as
					its president for two years before turning it over to younger successors. During this
					same period, he helped to organize several international conferences at the University
					of Southern California, Grinnell College, Dartmouth College, Rutgers University, North
					Carolina State University and Auburn University. He also presented papers at many
					international conferences organized by others and represented humanities computing at
					conferences organized by groups within the computer industry, such as the ACM, the
					American Federation of Information Processing Societies, the International Federation
					for Information Processing, and the American Society for Information Science. He
					organized special interest groups at several MLA conventions and within the ACM. He was
					an invited lecturer at academic institutions all over the United States, Canada, and
					Western Europe, and in India, China, and Japan. Much of the same effort was contained in
					articles published in a variety of journals, along with his contributions to Shelley
					scholarship, some of it based on the manuscript materials in the Bodleian Library.</p>

         <p>The launching of an online journal like <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities
			Quarterly</title> represents much that is positive about the current status of our
			community and much that still must be accomplished. It is satisfying to see a totally
			online scholarly publication, especially one that seeks to fill the niche created 40
			years ago by <title rend="italic">Computers and the Humanities</title>, a repository for
			information on the evolving relationship between humanistic endeavors and computer
			technology. That the technology this new journal employs is also the one that it studies
			can be counted as a step forward. At the same time, however, the absence of parallel
			publications in other sectors of humanities research is a measure of the distance still
			to be traveled before computer publishing is regarded as fully equal to the book and the
			print journal.</p>
         <p>Underlying the status of online publication as an inferior medium is probably the concern
			on the part of potential contributors that appearance in electronic media is not as
			highly regarded by the gatekeepers of tenure and promotion as the traditional hard-bound
			book and the article offprint, at least in the humanities. In the survey of attitudes
			among chairs and deans of all academic disciplines I organized in 1980, long before even
			the Internet had developed, much less the World Wide Web and the widespread availability
			of personal computers and laptops, the opinion of only half the respondents was in favor
			of treating online publication, even with all the traditional safeguards of peer review
			and editorial control, as earning the same credit toward tenure and promotion as was
			provided by traditional publication. How much the balance has tilted in favor of the
			newer technology has not (to my knowledge) been measured recently. A study of language
			departments conducted by the Modern Language Association is mentioned below. </p>
         <p>This reluctance to provide wider and less costly access to humanities scholarship
			represents a disjuncture with the expectations of the potential audience for this
			information. The generation of students in our graduate schools today has already become
			completely at ease with computers and online communication. Even in their non-academic
			activities, theses students rely increasingly on computers for access to information of
			almost every sort. In their academic activities they download electronic information to
			such an extent that their instructors must plead for at least the partial use of print
			media. Now, with the drive promoted by Google to scan the contents of several major
			university and public libraries, the time is drawing close when very few reasons will
			remain to argue the superiority of books and print journals over online databases. Thus
			the arguments for directing publishing scholars toward the devious route of publishing
			new material in print, only to have it then scanned for online access become
			increasingly illogical. </p>
         <p>The time it will take for the academic establishment to recognize the value of online
			publication is a function of its willingness to accept the replacement of a system that
			has seemed to operate relatively well until now. Books and print articles have been the
			stairs leading to the tenure, promotion, higher salaries and reduced teaching loads that
			are the system’s rewards for scholarly industry. When deans and even chairs are
			incapable of evaluating the content of such publications, they have been able to rely on
			the number of a candidate’s publications, their substance, the prestige of their
			publishers and (to a limited extent in the humanities) the number of times they are
			cited elsewhere. </p>
         <p>With understandable ergophobia, these administrators do not eagerly anticipate learning a
			new system without these comforting means of measuring accomplishment. The latest
			newsletter of the Modern Language Association announces that <quote rend="inline">40.8%
				of departments in doctorate-granting institutions report no experience in evaluating
				refereed articles in electronic format, and 65.7% report no experience in evaluating
				monographs in electronic format.</quote> How daring must a pioneering candidate for
			tenure and/or promotion be to risk career advancement in this dangerous environment? </p>
         <p>
            <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title> therefore strikes out a new
			path for humanities scholarship. The journal’s long-term success may well establish a
			pattern followed by humanities journals devoted to topics other than the application of
			the technology. If so, future issues may need to consider the consequences of that wider
			adoption of this publication mode. And future articles in this space can consider the
			implications of our impact on the evolution of academe.</p>
