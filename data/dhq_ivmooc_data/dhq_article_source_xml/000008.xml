                  <p>Joseph Raben is a professor emeritus of English at Queens College of
				the City University of New York, where he taught for 30 years. Before that he was a
				teaching fellow at Indiana University and an instructor at Princeton University. He was
				awarded a B.A. with honors at the University of Wisconsin and a Ph.D. at Indiana
				University, where he minored in folklore under Stith Thompson. His bachelor's honors
				thesis was on pronunciation as revealed by rhyme schemes in American folksongs, and his
				doctoral dissertation studied folk speech in Scott's novels. After graduating from
				Wisconsin, he worked as an engineering aide on the construction of the Hanford Engineer
				Works, and then entered the Army, where he was trained in spoken Japanese and served in
				Tokyo as an editor of translations in the Allied Translator and Interpreter Service,
				attached to GHQ. In this service he translated documents used in the war crimes trials.</p>
                  <p>At Queens he developed an interest in using computers in humanities research and in 1966
					founded the innovative journal <title rend="italic">Computers and the Humanities</title> to provide a
					platform for younger pioneering scholars to publish their research. He both edited and
					carried a large share of this journal's publication chores for 20 years. Among its most
					useful features was a semiannual <title rend="italic">Directory of Scholars Active</title>, which informed
					practitioners around the world of recent applications of computer technology to
					humanities and related social science problems. These notes he cumulated into a print
					volume, <title rend="italic">Computer-Assisted Research in the Humanities</title> (New York: Pergamon Press,
					1977). In 1978 he founded the Association for Computers and the Humanities and served as
					its president for two years before turning it over to younger successors. During this
					same period, he helped to organize several international conferences at the University
					of Southern California, Grinnell College, Dartmouth College, Rutgers University, North
					Carolina State University and Auburn University. He also presented papers at many
					international conferences organized by others and represented humanities computing at
					conferences organized by groups within the computer industry, such as the ACM, the
					American Federation of Information Processing Societies, the International Federation
					for Information Processing, and the American Society for Information Science. He
					organized special interest groups at several MLA conventions and within the ACM. He was
					an invited lecturer at academic institutions all over the United States, Canada, and
					Western Europe, and in India, China, and Japan. Much of the same effort was contained in
					articles published in a variety of journals, along with his contributions to Shelley
					scholarship, some of it based on the manuscript materials in the Bodleian Library.</p>

      <body>
         <p>The feature we are introducing in this inaugural issue of <title rend="italic">Digital
			Humanities Quarterly</title>, called <title rend="quotes">Issues in Humanities
				Computing</title>, is one end of a road that began forty-five years ago in the old
			Reading Room of the British Museum. (The other end of that road is the <title rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Humanities and Social Science Computing</title>, which
			I am organizing with Vernon Burton under the auspices of the National Center for
			Supercomputer Applications at the University of Illinois and scheduled to be published
			by Idea Group in 2008.) My immediate impetus to consider computers as a means of solving
			a scholarly problem was the difficulty I experienced in locating the significant echoes
			of Milton’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> that Shelley had embedded in his
			<title rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound</title> in order to enhance its resonance as
			a master statement of poetic truth. Once back at Queens College, the quest for
			assistance from computers led to the IBM Watson Laboratories in Yorktown Heights, New
			York, where the language group, relieved of responsibility for creating machine
			translation but not formally dismissed, created for me a crude mechanism for locating
			some of those echoes.</p>
         <p>That initial effort was reported in September 1964 at what was probably the first
			conference on computers and humanities research, the so-called Literary Data Processing
			Conference organized by Harry Arader of IBM and chaired by Stephen M. Parrish of Cornell
			and Jess B. Bessinger of NYU. Among the other speakers, Roberto Busa expatiated on the
			problems of managing 15 million words for his magnum opus on Thomas Aquinas. Parrish and
			Bessinger, along with the majority of other speakers, reported on their efforts to
			generate concordances with the primitive data processing machines available at that
			time. In light of the current number of projects to digitize literary works it is ironic
			to recall Martin Kay’s plea to the audience not to abandon their punch cards and
			magnetic tapes after their concordances were printed and (hopefully) published.</p>
         <p>My discovery of the number of scholars from around the country who were engaged to some
			extent in using computers for humanistic research inspired the thought that we should
			keep in touch with one another, and after two years I persuaded IBM to fund what at
			first I called <title rend="italic">Computers and the Humanities: A Newsletter</title>.
			Even after original articles started to come in and this publication was exalted to the
			status of a scholarly journal, it maintained as a primary function the exchange of
			information in this new and perilous environment. I have been told that our biennial
			<title rend="quotes">Directory of Scholars Active</title>, later compiled into a
			book published by Pergamon Press, helped many recent initiates into humanities computing
			to find their footing and locate collaborators. Even more satisfying was the knowledge
			that several young assistant professors, coming up for tenure, succeeded in retaining
			their grip on an academic career by publishing in the pages of CHum. An offprint on the
			chairman’s desk or the dean’s, looking as dignified as one from any of the older
			established journals, reportedly had the weight to outbalance the strangeness of the
			activity that had attracted these young persons.</p>
         <p>By 1975, Bob Dilligan of the University of Southern California, co-editor of a Keats
			concordance, offered to organize a conference as a sequel to one held two years
			previously at the University of Minnesota, and being there on sabbatical, I helped with
			that effort. That involvement led, in turn to my participating in the organization of
			similar conferences at Dartmouth and Rutgers. Sensing a need to broaden our view of
			humanities computing and recognizing the growth of databases as a resource in their own
			right (rather than as simply the raw material of concordances), I began a series of
			International Conferences on Data Bases in the Humanities and Social Sciences at
			Darmouth, Grinnell and Auburn at Montgomery. The growing number of attendees at these
			conferences seemed to require a permanent organization to sponsor them, and in 1978 I
			convened the session at the annual MLA meeting that created the Association for
			Computers and the Humanities. After two years as president, I turned that operation over
			to Mary Dee Harris and then Nancy Ide, so that younger people could gain whatever
			academic credit they could through that position and so that the operation would have an
			independent stature.</p>
         <p>When New York suffered its financial crisis in 1974, and it was no longer possible to
			publish under the aegis of Queens College, I entrusted the journal to two commercial
			publishers, neither of which saw much importance in either humanities or humanities
			computing and treated this publication with consequent lack of concern. In 1984,
			therefore, I took early retirement and set up my own small publishing operation in
			Sarasota, Florida. I was thus able to publish several collections of essays on databases
			in the humanities and social sciences and to start up two new journals, <title rend="italic">Computers and the Social Sciences</title> (later combined with the
			<title rend="italic">Social Science Computing Record</title>) and <title rend="italic">Computers and Translation</title> (renamed <title rend="italic">Machine Translation</title> and published now by Springer). Like so many small
			businesses, this one proved less than financially viable, and by 1987, I had sold off
			the various titles and returned to my more congenial academic environment.</p>
         <p>In this situation I am now able to concentrate on the encyclopedia project and the
			“op-ed” page of DHQ. It is our hope that this feature will provide a forum for
			discussion of the larger issues that confront us as we continue our effort to bring
			computer technology up to what we consider its proper status in academe and scholarly
			activity. The initial offering is my own take on the problem of achieving the same
			respect for online publishing that is held now by print. My hope is to set a tone of
			serious reflection that will be adopted by those who submit future contributions to this
			section of the journal.</p>
         <p>Rather than brief comments, we are hoping for thought-out and substantially developed
			opinions on all the aspects of our developing discipline. Responses to these discussions
			are equally welcome and will be tagged to establish a continuous flow along evolving
			threads. Of course, publication will depend on the approval of the Editorial Board. A
			few possible topics are suggested below, but we hope these will prompt contributions on
			a much wider range of issues and questions.</p>
