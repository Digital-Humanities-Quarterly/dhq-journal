               <title rend="italic">The New Edition of the Letters of Vincent Van Gogh on the
                        Web</title> is a review of the web edition of the complete authorial
                    correspondence of the 19th century Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh published by
                    the Van Gogh Museum and the Huygens Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy
                    of Arts and Sciences in 2009. While the print version, published by Thames
                    &amp; Hudson in the same year, received ample attention in the specialized
                    and generalist press, the web edition enjoyed less publicity; this review
                    considers the added value of the web version.</p>

            <div>
                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>The <ref target="http://www.vangoghletters.org/">digital edition of the life
                        correspondence of the 19th century Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh
                        (1853-1890)</ref>, published in 2009, is the result of a collaborative
                    project between the <ref target="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?lang=nl">Van Gogh
                        Museum</ref> — the main holder of Van Gogh’s correspondence — and the <ref target="http://www.huygensinstituut.knaw.nl/">Huygens Institute of the Royal
                        Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</ref>.</p>
                <p>Although the sources in question — a corpus of 902 letters — date back to a
                    relatively recent past, this scholarly edition is the tail of a long chain of
                    cultural reading and re-reading of Van Gogh’s letters, extracts of which were
                    already being published in the 1890s, immediately after the artist’s death, with
                    the first print edition appearing in 1914. Of all the preceding publications,
                    what makes this scholarly enterprise particularly interesting for the readers of
                        <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> is that it is the first complete edition of
                    Van Gogh’s correspondence to have been published in digital form and made
                    available on the web.</p>
                <p>Hence in the present review we ask, What does digital form mean in this case of
                    hybrid (print/web) production? How was the whole edition produced? Does the web
                    incarnation make a difference? What added value, if any, does it bring
                    about?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Books with a Digital Backbone</head>
                <p>It is noteworthy that the digital edition — intended here in the wide sense of
                    the full set of software, programs, scripts, electronic marked-up texts, digital
                    images — represents the backbone not only of the web edition, but also of a
                    refined printed edition; indeed, quoting the editors, the print edition would
                    not exist in its present form without its electronic matrix, which is much more
                    that just the counterpart of its paper version: <quote rend="block">By 2004
                        changes in the world of publishing and the rapidly growing potential offered
                        by electronic media had caused the steering committee to reconsider, and it
                        was decided to publish the large, all-encompassing edition digitally. This
                        does greater justice to the immense volume of material and the complex of
                        interrelated layers of information, and gives visitors to the site more
                        options and more ways to use the edition. For the very significant numbers
                        of people we believe would prefer to study or enjoy the letters by reading
                        them in the <q>traditional</q> manner, there is an accessible, fully
                        illustrated print version, with brief notes; <emph>the content derives
                            directly from the scholarly web edition</emph> [my emphasis]. This
                        five-volume edition appears — at the same time as the present web edition —
                        in three languages: English, Dutch and French.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>This new complete print edition of Vincent van Gogh’s letters was distributed
                    worldwide as British edition (slipcased with a CD-ROM of the letters in their
                    original languages, mainly Dutch) by <ptr target="#thames2009"/> in 2009. It
                    encompasses more than two thousand pages in six heavy volumes of translucent
                    paper, the first five of which include the corpus of translated letters where
                    each main text section is beautifully laid out in one or two columns and
                    accompanied by editorial side notes, relevant small illustrations (art works in
                    the form of paintings and etchings that Van Gogh mentions in his correspondence
                    or that the editors imply are referred to by the Dutch author), and some
                    facsimiles of the letters in full page (generally only when a sketch by the
                    artist occurs). The letters, each of which is preceded by some introductory
                    material, are grouped into chronological sections marking certain segments of
                    Van Gogh's life.</p>

                        On the right, an example of a typical page layout taken from volume 1. On
                        the top between the two black lines: location, date, addressee and letter
                        identification number. On one column: content of the letter translated into
                        English. In the centre: illustration of an artwork mentioned in this letter
                        by Van Gogh captioned by corresponding name of artist and title. On the
                        right hand side: editorial notes.</head>
                </table>
                <p>In addition, the whole sixth and last volume collects rich contextual information
                    featuring, among other elements, editorial commentary, genealogies, maps and
                    plans, and a technical glossary. This acts as a sort of access resource to the
                    other volumes by including a comprehensive and detailed set of indices: an index
                    of authorial works, divided into an index by title and indices ordered by the
                    work’s classification number organised by type (paintings, x-rays and
                    photographs of paintings, works on paper and sketches); index of other artists’
                    works, and a separate index of sketches in the case of Gaugin’s; index of
                    photographs, documents, periodicals and literary works; index of biblical
                    quotations (subdivided into relevant books and sections); index of people, in
                    general and by correspondent (the majority of the letters are addressed to Van
                    Gogh’s brother, Theo); and index of places. The latter includes subdivisions of
                    cities into relevant locations by type (e.g. cathedral or tower); interestingly,
                    art exhibitions are also marked as distinct references within locations.</p>

                        London in the index of places.</head>
                </figure>
                <p>Therefore, the indices in the print edition are available only in the final
                    volume, where occurrences are expressed by volume number followed by page
                    number/s.</p>
                <p>All the components that make up the six-volume publication are also available on
                    the web edition. Their inclusion in the web edition — possibly with the
                    exception of the index of locations, which is less granular on the web — is
                    always comprehensive, rather than selective as in the print version, and is
                    enriched by further interconnected material. Indeed, starting from the text
                    view, the web edition includes the following additional components: the texts in
                    original language (mainly Dutch, in few cases French and English),<note>Despite
                        the fact that the letters are available in all original languages, it does
                        not seem to be possible to search letters by language in the search
                        form.</note> the diplomatic edition and, not only some, but all the
                    facsimiles.</p>
                <p>It also seems that at places the web edition contains some diversified or
                    entirely new material: for example, in letter 282, the illustration of the
                    artwork <title rend="italic">Sorrow</title> by Vincent van Gogh is available
                    only as black and white reproduction of the relevant lithograph in the printed
                    edition volume 2, while on the web, its coloured impression is also reproduced:
                        <title rend="italic">F 929 / JH 129</title> (click on the <q>artworks</q>

                    example is the drawing entitled <title rend="quotes">Reader</title> by the
                    artist and Van Gogh’s friend Anthon Gerard Alexander van Rappard; in the books,
                    the relevant illustration is reproduced rather small only along the text of
                    letter 178, while on the web, we find it under the artworks tab of both letters
                    the notes of which mention it: 168 and 178.</p>

                        in this edition — can be traced on the web in the notes of two different
                        letters (168 and 178) as shown in the search results above. Both letters on
                        the web include the relevant illustration (reproduced here on the left),
                        while in the books, it is included only once (in letter 178) possibly for
                        space or aesthetic reasons.</head>

                <p>A more systematic case of selective rendering in the books that was integrated on
                    the web by additional information is the content of the captions of artworks
                    (many institutions and private individuals made image material available to the

                <head>The Editorial Model behind the Web Edition</head>
                <p>A more detailed analysis of the components that make up the web edition reveals
                    how its features support a fruition process that is rather distinctive from the
                    reading process facilitated by its print form. Those mechanisms offered by the
                    web, such as pointers to a textual note in the books functioning as active links
                    on the web, are obviously exploited in the web resource in question. However,
                    the functionalities associated with the objects making up the edition are
                    amplified in its digital form in a manner that goes far beyond the emerging
                    conventions of academic web publishing. Indeed, the richness of an easy-to-read
                    interface in the web edition derives from the ability of its designers both to
                    understand and render the integrity of the editorial model behind it. It is
                    precisely the full appreciation of this model that lays the added value of the
                    web edition where, possibly, the intertextual dimension of the man Van Gogh as
                    writer, reader and artist all in one stands out even further than it does in the
                    book form (or in a physical exhibition; see <ref target="#figure10">Figure
                        10</ref>.) To the attentive reader the evidence of the underlying structure
                    of such editorial model is easily revealed.</p>
                <p>To start from the reading panels, the editorial model is manipulated so as to
                    create a sophisticated interplay across all components of the edition which
                    results in a flexible choreography compared to the fixed layout of the books:
                    the balance lays much less in favour of the translated text as core of the
                    edition.</p>
                <p>While reading one of the letters, for instance, the viewing panel on the left can
                    be set to display any of the selected components of the edition – i.e. original
                    text, diplomatic edition (truthful to the level of line endings), facsimile,
                    notes, and artworks — and be vertically aligned with one or more — depending on
                    the screen size — panels of the same kind on the right.</p>

                    namely names, references to artworks and literature — is visibly linked to the
                    relevant index of other letters where the same element is mentioned or
                    discussed.</p>

                    <head>The artworks by Jean-François Millet were very much appreciated,
                        copied and loved by Vincent van Gogh. Evidence of this is that fact that the
                        artist is mentioned in 179 of his letters. As shown above, from a note in
                        one of the letter we can reach the index of these references with only one
                        click.</head>
                </figure>
                <p>This is the case not only for explicit and recognisable proper names but also for
                    general referencing strings. The reader can mouse over such strings to get a

                        edition (only published on the web). Pointers to editorial notes are

                        between, for instance, referring strings in the original text and referring
                        strings in the translated texts – or simply that an editorial decision was

                <p>The editorial strategy adopted to interpret, classify and filter the thick
                    contextual and textual information encompassed by Van Gogh’s letters emerges
                    even further while using the advanced search form and while examining its
                    structure. As for the print indices briefly described above, each search field
                    reveals the complexity of a thoroughly-planned editorial enterprise. For
                    example, this edition distinguishes references to the Bible from general
                    references to other kind of literature, the correspondence with numbering
                    sequences of previous editions (namely, De la Faille and Hulsker’s) was
                    recorded, one can identify authors by forename or surname, and their work by
                    title. The corpus of letters is divided into sixteen chronological periods.</p>
                <p>As an engaging puzzle, the auto-completion of the search fields clarifies all
                    this and tells more about what the editors decided to do or what the web
                    publication was supposed to privilege or focus on.</p>

                        across search results by speeding up the discovery of the relevant letter
                        and by avoiding useless steps of direct consultations.</head>

                        exhibition (23 January — 18 April 2010) where over 35 original letters,

                        rooms. Although the physical vicinity of these objects allows the visitor to
                        grasp the intimate connection between the content of the letters, the life
                        of the painter, its readings and artistic production, it still deals with a
                        sort of demonstration, a very enjoyable but somehow restricted narrative
                        thread compared to the ones one can expand, reconstruct, deconstruct and

                <head>Collaborative Nature, Best Practices and Open Source</head>
                <p>The collaborative project behind the publication of the current edition started
                    officially in 1994. During its lifecycle, the project engaged other national and
                    international initiatives relevant to Van Gogh studies by opening up its
                    development to an interdisciplinary framework, establishing cooperative efforts
                    of various kinds (between individuals and, more importantly across institutions
                    at the international level, from museums, galleries and auction houses to
                    libraries and archives), and using lessons learned through past endeavours. The
                    open and collaborative nature of the work is evident when we examine the web
                    form of the edition where the production choices include the adoption of
                    scholarly standards in text encoding and the full endorsement of open source
                    software.</p>
                <p>Starting from the text, once edited within a word processor in the first place,
                    each letter was automatically converted into an XML document by adopting the
                    community-based <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/">Text Encoding
                        Initiative (TEI) guidelines</ref>. Furthermore, the dedicated TEI schema
                    developed for the edition was enriched with some of the solutions conceived and
                    made public by another project also aiming at structuring and editing
                    correspondence: the <ref target="http://www.kantl.be/ctb/project/dalf/">Digital
                        Archive of Letters in Flanders</ref>.</p>
                <p>Based, therefore, on an extensive use of best practices in text encoding, the Van
                    Gogh TEI XML letters include a defined set of metadata for each letter (e.g.
                    number, date), its full transcription in the original language, its translation
                    into English, relevant notes (including textual notes), and the connection
                    between text and manuscript images — in brief, the full electronic backbone
                    which is then rendered both in print form as content of the books and in digital
                    form on the web.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, as hinted at above, the web edition is complemented with a series of
                    interconnected data sources. Indeed, the editors compiled various databases
                    containing the physical descriptions of the letters, data about the
                    illustrations, and information about the people mentioned by the Dutch painter
                    in his correspondence. The integration between the TEI document compiled for
                    each letter and such complementary material is obtained by recurring to two
                    programmes developed in <ref target="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</ref>,
                    an open source programming language.</p>
                <p>Besides the XHTML rendition, such integration between the document level and the
                    contextual databases becomes evident, as seen above, while using the indices or
                    the search facility as well as while encountering some para-textual information
                    accompanying the letters. For example, the captions of the illustrations or the
                    textual notes with references to artworks could not link back to the relevant
                        <hi rend="italic">index locorum</hi> without such integration. Indeed, two
                    Ruby programmes were developed to generate an index from the TEI XML files as
                    well as from the relevant database sources, and to perform dynamic searches
                    prompted by the user on the resulting index. The search index itself is built by
                    recurring, yet again, to another open source software: <ref target="http://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</ref>.</p>
                <p>Moving to the digitisation process itself, the 902 surviving letters under study
                    have undergone a process of physical conservation against decay (e.g.
                    deacidification, repairs, controlled storage) and digitisation within the <ref target="http://www.metamorfoze.nl/en/">Netherland national Metamorfoze
                        programme</ref>, a collaborative effort supported by the National Library
                    and the National Archives of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The image processing and zooming facility on the web edition is also based on an
                    open source programme known as <ref target="http://mike.teczno.com/giant/pan/">GSV image viewer</ref>, a javascript driven user interface, coupled with
                    the <ref target="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick
                        suite</ref>, also a free and GNU GPL compatible software to manipulate
                    images. The result is an image interface for the letters facsimile which behaves
                    very similarly to the Google Map interface: indeed, high-resolution images much
                    larger than the screen can be panned and zoomed by fetching tiled sections on
                    demand, while minimising the loading effect on the network, since only portions
                    of the facsimile are effectively visualised at any given time. It has to be
                    noted that three servers are behind the architecture which supports the
                    visualisation of the facsimiles.</p>
                <p>To conclude, thanks to a rather strategic institutional collaboration spearheaded
                    by the <ref target="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?lang=nl">Van Gogh
                        Museum</ref> and the <ref target="http://www.huygensinstituut.knaw.nl/">Huygens Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and
                        Sciences</ref> — renowned institutions in the field of scholarly publishing
                    of literary and historical texts — this new edition is the example of a
                    successful marriage between thorough editing processes and responsible
                    professional production of a rich electronic resource, which in fact is
                    attractive to a wide audience. It fulfils the highest scholarly standards while
                    at the same time being open to anyone with a web connection and some curiosity
                    towards the genial mind that was Vincent van Gogh’s. Such openness could have
                    possibly gone further by envisaging the possibility of users interacting with
                    this resource. At present, the web page section entitled <q>Updates</q> is empty
                    and does not contain any feedback mechanism, but instead promises that this
                    hybrid edition will record changes in both the web and print edition. It is
                    possibly too much to aim for, but that now that Van Gogh’s correspondence is all
                    skilfully edited, searchable, and beautifully integrated with all sorts of
                    contextual material and free to read online, one would think that the next step
                    could be to make it free to write and comment on. The Van Gogh Museum is not
                    insensitive to the issue and, though separate from the scholarly edition, has
                    already set up a blog: <ref target="http://www.vangoghsblog.com/">http://www.vangoghsblog.com/</ref>.</p>
                <p>Could have he known, Van Gogh, that after more than a hundred years his passion
                    would have become true heritage of his beloved ordinary women and men?</p>
