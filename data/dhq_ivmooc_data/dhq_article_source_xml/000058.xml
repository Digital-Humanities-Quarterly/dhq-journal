            <p>Interface design was the uppermost concern when I set out to
                create a suite of programs for the Society of Early English and
                Norse Electronic Texts (SEENET) to facilitate the display of its
                TEI-compliant documentary and critical editions of medieval
                texts. From its inception, my project has been shaped by the
                tremendous potential of electronic textuality to redefine our
                experience of what it means to possess and read a text. This
                poster demonstrates these programs and surveys the principles
                that have given rise to their creation. </p>
            <p>The SEENET interface project has been carried out as an
                iterative process moving between (1) identifying the broad
                parameters of questions that readers might be tempted to ask of
                a text and (2) shaping an electronic <foreign xml:lang="fr">mise en
                    page</foreign> that will engage a reader’s inquisitive eye,
                promoting curiosity and thus the development of new insight and
                knowledge. The process of developing such an interface has led
                to the articulation of a set of axioms that have guided my work:
                    <list type="unordered">
                  <item>Seek tight coordination in the display of text and
                        facsimile image</item>
                  <item> Incorporate visual cueing to guide/reinforce reader
                        attention</item>
                  <item> Provide unobtrusive, but handy, analytical
                        tools</item>
                  <item> Promote ease of navigation – build in linkages that
                        are likely to answer and/or provoke a reader’s
                        curiosity</item>
                  <item> Work in one visual space for text and images – no
                        windows or frames, no scrolling when possible</item>
                  <item> Supply information at likely points of need – avoid
                        overload, expose what the text <q>knows</q>
                        selectively</item>
                  <item> Keep decoration to a minimum: no chrome, don’t frame
                        the view, don’t let the tools distract or
                        overwhelm.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p> In addition to demonstrating programs designed to display
                documentary and critical editions of Piers Plowman (which
                serves as the locus for all examples shown), the poster
                 describes programs written to permit electronic markup of
                facsimile images of the medieval manuscripts as well as programs
                that assist editors in the TEI-compliant markup of documentary
                and critical texts. </p>
