The argument contributes to a recent theoretical and practical discussion of â€œquestsâ€ù by scholars of games studies such as Aarseth 2004, Juul 2005, Tosca 2003, and Tronstad 2001. I build upon and revise these theoristsâ€™ understandings by approaching a â€œquestâ€ù as a goal-oriented activity in which players undertake a journey in search of meaning. By demonstrating similarities between the literary traditions in which quests are central and the practice of digital game design, I argue that quests can be better understood theoretically and more productively used in the classroom if meaning and action are regarded as complementary design principles instead of conflicting impulses. A revised understanding of quests can help to mediate between games and narratives by showing strategies by which game designers have created meaningful action, often in ways that are either unconsciously similar to or inspired by the literary traditions of mythology, epic, and romance. Specifically, game designers can use level design to create labyrinthine spaces that encode thematic implications, in the tradition of literary allegory. If these symbolic spaces are coordinated with significant obstacles and challenges, the apparent conflict between meaning and action can be resolved through engaging gameplay that allows players to enact a range of thematic ideas, contributing to the ongoing replay value of a digital game. I also suggest ways in which this understanding of quests can allow literature teachers to plan assignments where students transform literary narratives into interpretative quests taking the form of digital games. As a paradigmatic example, I describe one such assignment, in which my students adapted episodes from Pynchonâ€™s The Crying of Lot 49 into design documents and prototypes, and I suggest some theoretical implications of its results for other instructors. By adapting works of literature into quests, students learn to discover and create meaning through the active exertion of cognitive and imaginative effort rather than absorbing it passively."	aarseth1997 | aarseth2000 | aarseth2004 | alonzo2006 | bateman2005 | bolter1999 | campbell1949 | cowart1977 | davis1998 | elder2006 | erickson1996 | eskelinen2004 | fable2005 | frasca2003 | frye1957 | kelly2004 | gee2004 | kucklich2996 | glassner2004 | jenkins2004 | juul2005 | king2003 | kimbrell2006 | losh2006 | mendelson1978 | montfort2003 | neugebauer2006 | natkin2006 | novak2005 | propp1968 | pynchon1964 | rollings2003 | ryan2001 | salen2004 | szulborski2005 | tosca2003 | tronstad2001 | ulmer2002 | vogler1998 | zimmerman2004	13	"VandeCreek, Drew"	2007	"Webs of Significance: The Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project, New Technology, and the Democratization of History"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Lincoln/Net (http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu), a product of the Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project at Northern Illinois University Libraries, represents a new type of historically oriented digital library resource. Like many other digital libraries, it contains a large amount of searchable primary source materials. Like a number of other historically oriented online resources, project staff have organized Lincoln/Net around a specific topic, in this case Abraham Lincolnâ€™s life and times in antebellum Illinois. In addition to Lincolnâ€™s own papers, the projectâ€™s databases contain resources shedding light on his context, including letters, diaries, and publications prepared by his peers. Unlike most historically oriented digital libraries however, the project Web site also includes a wealth of multimedia materials, including image, sound, video, and interactive map resources. But Lincoln/Net is perhaps most unique in that it furnishes its users with an extensive set of interpretive materials. This approach suggests that historians may play an expanding role in the development of digital libraries. It can also provide them with a badly-needed means of communicating with an audience beyond their own scholarly community and students. This communication can facilitate what one digital history pioneer has described as the â€œdemocratization of history,â€ù as defined by an expanded user group enjoying primary source materials and using them to engage in historical thinking ."	about2006 | about2006a | ayers1999 | bates2003 | bass1999 | becker1932 | bender1986 | bender1994 | borgman2000 | britton1997 | brown2001 | cobb1997 | cole1994 | cox1997 | delaney1999 | friedman2005 | geertz1973 | ghapery2004 | green2001 | greenberg1998 | haskell1977 | haskell1984 | hay1894 | haywood1998 | hinton1860 | historynet2006 | hunt1997 | jessop2004 | karamanski1990 | kelley1978 | kornblith2001 | mabry | meulen2003 | minkel2003 | murray1997 | novick1988 | oed2006 | plewe1997 | public2006 | rosenzweig2003 | shiroma2000 | tenopir2004 | songster1850 | thomas1999 | west2003 | woods1995 | zhao2004	14	"Patrik, Linda E."	2007	Encoding for Endangered Tibetan Texts	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"For over a thousand years, Tibet has preserved and translated ancient Buddhist Sutras from India, keeping the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and meditation alive long after it died out in India by the 12th Century. Recent efforts to digitize materials from this textual tradition offer opportunities to broaden the circulation of rare materials to the exiled Tibetan scholarly community, but also suggest conceptual challenges arising from the complexity of the texts and their inherently multimodal character.

Although there are similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted literary analysis, the development of tools for the express purpose of encouraging scholars to play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into potentialities. For the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question of interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are better understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some objective in mind. The procedures for making sense of texts provide for their own interpretation: they are not only instruments for discovering meaning but also reflections on making meaning."	benabou1987 | bens1980 | bergens1999 | braffort2006 | braffort1984 | khmelev2001 | mcgann2001a | oulipo1998 | motte1986 | olsen1993 | oulipo1988 | queneau1961 | queneau1964 | queneau1965 | ramsay2003 | reggiani1999 | rockwell2003 | schmid2006 | sinclair2003b | starynkevitch1990	16	"Raben, Joseph"	2007	"Tenure, Promotion and Digital Publication"	Digital Humanities Quarterly			17	"Flanders, Julia | Piez, Wendell | Terras, Melissa"	2007	Welcome to Digital Humanities Quarterly	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"A welcome to DHQ from the editors, with a brief summary of the journal's development and goals."		18	"Raben, Joseph"	2007	Introducing Issues in Humanities Computing	Digital Humanities Quarterly			19	"Jerz, Dennis G."	2007	Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original Adventure in Code and in Kentucky	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Because so little primary historical work has been done on the classic text computer game Colossal Cave Adventure, academic and popular references to it frequently perpetuate inaccuracies. Adventure was the first in a series of text-based games (interactive fiction) that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and story, typically in a fantasy setting; these games had a significant cultural impact in the late 1970s and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will Crowther based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an occasion for narrative encounters and as an aesthetic masterpiece of logic and utility ; however, previous attempts to assess the significance of Adventure remain incomplete without access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's original source cave. Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a backup of Woods's student account at Stanford, and documents an excursion to the real Colossal Cave in Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther, Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions. Real locations in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod and an axe head) correspond to their representation in Crowther's version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had expanded the game to include numerous locations that he invented, along with significant technical innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory). Sources that incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are sourced thinly if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during the 1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976. The original game employed magic, humor, simple combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly expanded. While Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real cave, his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to improve the gameplay."	aarseth1997 | aarseth2001 | adams2007c | adams2007a | adams2007b | anderson1985 | anderson1990 | au2000 | au2002 | bennahum1998 | bloom2002 | briceno2000 | brucker2005 | brucker1976 | brucker2005a | brucker2005b | buckles1985 | cadre2004 | cahill2001 | carter2002 | chaplin2007 | cordella2001 | costikyan2007 | crowther1976 | crowther2001 | crowther2007 | crowther1975b | crowther1977 | dalenberg2004 | dalenberg2006 | dibbell2002 | douglass2006 | douglass2007 | eskelinen2001 | freeman1975 | gamespy2002 | gilbert2005 | gilbert2007 | gillogly1977 | hafner1994 | hafner1996 | harrington2007 | herz1997 | howell1990 | hutcheon1988 | jerz2000 | jerz2002 | jerz2005 | juul2001 | juul2005 | keller2007 | kidder1981 | kraley2004 | knuth1998 | lawrence2002 | levy1984 | mann2003 | mann2004 | mcgonigal2008 | montfort2003 | murray1997 | nss1994 | nelson2001 | oneill1990 | park1994 | plotkin1995 | poole2000 | raymond1996 | robinett2000 | rothstein2002 | ryan2001b | selfe2007 | schwartz1999 | toomey1990 | turkle1995 | vanvleck2001 | wilcox1990 | wilcox2002 | woods2006 | woods2007	110	"Eve, Eric"	2007	All Hope Abandon: Biblical Text and Interactive Fiction	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Among the alternative kinds of narrative opened up by computer technology, one of earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the text adventure or adventure game), which first came into being in the 1970s. Text-based interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial success in the 1980s until it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots in computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature. Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, All Hope Abandon, explores aspects of Biblical Studies through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several examples from All Hope Abandon will be given, and instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end."	anderson2006 | bates1997 | berg2004 | brasslantern2007 | cadre1998 | coyne2003 | crowther1976 | dollahite2005 | donahue2002 | downing2000 | elliott1993 | eve2002 | eve2004 | eve2005 | firth2007 | granade2007 | hooker1991 | jasper2005 | jerz2000b | jerz2000c | jerz2001 | kopteltsev2006 | lee2006b | lott2004 | maher2005 | maher2006 | marcus1993a | marshall1989 | meier1994 | montfort2003 | montfort2003b | morgan2006 | moyise2001 | nelson1997 | nelson2001 | nelson2007b | nelson2007a | nepstad2006a | nepstad2006b | ong2002 | powell2006 | raif2007 | reed2005 | rhoads1982 | roberts2006 | roberts2007a | roberts2007b | roberts2007c | shiovitz2004a | shiovitz2004b | short2007a | short2007b | stevens2001 | vaniersel1998 | vansina1985 | watts2000 | woods2005	111	"Anderson, Steve F."	2007	Aporias of the Digital Avant-Garde	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This article maps two divergent trajectories within a narrowly defined sphere of short-form, time-based digital media created between 1995 and 2005. These works are considered in relation to the historical avant-garde - particularly the Structural film movement of the 1960s and 70s - and analyzed as responses to a range of cultural concerns specific to the digital age. The analysis identifies movement toward two terminal points: first, a mode of remix-based montage inspired by open source programming communities and peer-to- peer networks; and second, the emergence of a mode of imaging termed the digital analogue, which foregrounds the material basis of digital production."	bukatman2003 | cae2001 | cae2002 | crary1990 | darley2000 | enzensberger1974 | greenwald2004 | james1989 | kittler1999 | krauss1993 | lunenfeld2000 | manovich1999 | manovich2001 | marks2000 | nichols1991 | weibel2002 | willis2005	112	"Hoover, David"	2007	"The End of the Irrelevant Text: Electronic Texts, Linguistics, and Literary Theory"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The close study of literary texts has a long and illustrious history. But the popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just at the time that widely available electronic texts were making traditional analytic tools easier to apply and encouraging the development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without claiming any simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the dominance of Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory. Certainly both an introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic approach and literary theories deeply influenced by ideas about the sign's instability and the tendency of texts to disintegrate under critical pressure minimize the importance of the text. Using examples from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a return to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what corpora, text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship attribution can reveal about meanings and style. The recent resurgence of interest in scholarly editions, corpora, text- analysis, stylistics, and authorship suggest that the electronic text may finally reach its full potential."	addison1694 | biber1995 | bnc2001 | boswell1791 | bosworth1898 | bradford1647 | burrows2002a | burrows2002b | burrows2007 | chomsky1975 | chomsky1986 | chomsky2000 | cooper1840 | davies2007b | dickens1858 | faulkner1978 | fish1980 | goldfield2006 | golding1955 | griffith1896 | halliday1981 | hoover1999 | hoover2004a | hoover2004b | hoover2004c | hoover2006 | hoover2007a | hume1748 | louw1993 | mcgann2004b | more1914 | morris1895 | pope1715 | sampson2005 | shillingsburg2006 | sinclair2003a | sinclair2004 | stubbs1996 | swift1726 | trillin1998	113	"Terras, Melissa"	2007	DHQ in the Public Eye	Digital Humanities Quarterly	This editorial reflects on developments to DHQ and the ways we can assess impact and readership.		114	"Priani SaisÃ_, Ernesto"	2007	Revista Digital Universitaria: A Workshop of Digital Editing at the Universidad Nacional AutÃ_noma de MÃ©xico	Digital Humanities Quarterly	The Revista Digital Universitaria (http://www.revista.unam.mx) at the Universidad Nacional AutÃ_noma de MÃ©xico (UNAM) is an experimental digital magazine that serves as a workshop of digital editing at the university.

Individual visual experts (like connoisseurs) do not share some grand and undividable cognitive cataloguing system; they are attentive to piecemeal visual discernments and the patterns in which these occur in reality. In conventional scholarly communication sophisticated tools to discuss perceptual patterns are lacking. This paper not only proposes a theoretical model of visual knowledge accumulation, but also describes a practical implementation, Art.Similarities, which is designed as a prototype of such a sophisticated tool. Using a custom-made interface it records visual behavior: the non-verbally expressed visual similarity judgments of distributed individuals. Users can be assigned to groups according to the qualities of their judgments. These qualities may be distilled from emerging similarity patterns. The implications of individual judgments in different user groups may vary considerably. Emerging patterns can be assessed both according to human analysis and statistical procedures. Most studies on art evaluation are attentive to either the characteristics of works, or the characteristics of observers. In this study both are considered as interdependent entities consistently."	aberer2004 | ahn2006 | attneave1950 | baca2005 | barrett1989 | batschmann1986 | bearman2005 | bra2004 | bush1945 | chen2005 | eakins1999 | elkins1999 | finch1974 | goodman1988 | heylighen1999 | huijsmans1999 | hutchins1995 | peter2000 | jorgensen1999 | kirsch1984 | loran2006 | lynch2001 | nauta1993 | nauta2001 | oreilly2006 | panofsky1970 | ross2004 | salomon1996 | santini2001 | shatfordlayne2002 | sierra2007 | stahl2006 | stubenrauch1993 | tufte1998 | unsworth2001 | vygotsky1976 | wenger2002 | wolfflin1950 | wyman2006	120	"Piez, Wendell"	2008	Something Called Digital Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Are the Digital Humanities only a concession to fashion, and as such a sign of decline?

The Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (Heml) was begun six years ago to explore how disparate historical materials on the Internet can be navigated and visualized, and for the past four years has used an XML data format defined in W3C Schemas. This format aims for conforming data that can be quickly parsed but provide a variety of facets on which to search for historical materials. While the project's graphical visualizations are in some respects successful, they have revealed some deficiencies in the underlying data format: it ought to provide for nested events, it ought to represent relations of causality between events and it ought to express the varieties of scholarly opinion about the attributes of events. By encoding the Heml data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to undertake these improvements. Moreover, an RDF-encoded Heml process provides easier access to CIDOC-CRM data into Heml events. Finally, a historical RDF language would simplify the discovery of references to historical events in digitized texts, thereby automating a growing network of historical information on the Web."	allen1983 | carrera2002 | carrera2005 | clark1992a | crane2006f | drucker2004 | nakahira2007 | robertson2002 | robertson2004 | robertson2006 | smith2002a | thaller1991	127	"Rydberg-Cox, Jeffrey A."	2009	"Digitizing Latin Incunabula: Challenges, Methods, and Possibilities"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Incunabula, or books printed before 1500, are extremely difficult and expensive to convert to digital form. The primary challenges arise from the use of non-standard typographical glyphs based on medieval handwriting to abbreviate words. Further difficulties are also posed by the practice of inconsistently marking word breaks at the end of lines and reducing or even eliminating spacing between some words. As such, these documents form a distinct genre of electronic document that poses unique challenges for conversion to digital form. From 2005â€“2007, the Preservation and Access Research and Development Program at the National Endowment for the Humanities funded a study to explore methods for digitizing these difficult texts. This paper describes some of the results of that project. The work described in this paper was completed by the Approaching the Problems of Digitizing Latin Incunables project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Division of Preservation and Access. The material in this paper is drawn from the project application, internal technical reports, grant project reports and the project descriptions included in and . Much of this work was inspired by Ross Scaife and his work building a corpora of Latin Colloquia. I am deeply grateful for Ross's comments, advice and support.

In defining our needs and goals for a digital edition, we discuss what our project has in common with other digital editions of literary works, but how the oral, traditional nature of the poetry creates special requirements as well.

First, we hand-code default inheritance hierarchies in the KATR formalism, treating inflectional exponents as markings associated with the application of rules by which complex word forms are deduced from simpler roots or stems. The high degree of similarity among verbs of different conjugation classes allows us to formulate general rules; these general rules are, however, sometimes overridden by conjugation-specific rules. This approach allows linguists to gain an appreciation for the structure of verbs, gives teachers a foundation for organizing lessons in morphology, and provides students a technique for generating forms of any verb. Second, we start with a paradigm chart, then automatically remove common parts and redundant morphosyntactic property sets (columns), combine similar conjugations (rows), and generate the KATR theory that produces a complete table of forms for a set of lexemes. This second approach automatically determines principal parts (for Latin, we verify that there are four), groups inflection classes into super-classes, and builds full paradigm charts."	anderson1992 | blevins2005 | blevins2006 | corbett1993 | evans1989 | finkel2002 | finkel2007a | finkel2007b | finkel2009a | wikipedia2009a | matthews1972 | stump2001 | zwicky1985	133	"Bamman, David | Crane, Gregory"	2009	Computational Linguistics and Classical Lexicography	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Manual lexicography has produced extraordinary results for Greek and Latin, but it cannot in the immediate future provide for all texts the same level of coverage available for the most heavily studied materials.

The word finish is just not part of the deal for the Linguistic Atlas Project in either sense. However, granting agencies must ask what do you want money for this time? and, from this viewpoint, the Atlas Project consists of a series of particular tasks or experiments, each one of which is capable of being finished in both senses of the word. This paper discusses the reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables, as they relate to the sequence of tasks that make up the larger Atlas Project. There are no once-and-done, permanent solutions. The largest humanities computing projects require continuing care and maintenance, and the best way forward is to create some sort of stable institutional setting for large projects that will provide continuity and baseline resources for the work."	kirk1991 | kirk1992 | kretzschmar1988 | kretzschmar1992 | kretzschmar1994 | kretzschmar1996 | kretzschmar1996b | kretzschmar1997 | kretzschmar2002 | kretzschmar2002b | kretzschmar2003 | kretzschmar2006 | kretzschmar2005a | kretzschmar2005b | kretzschmar2004 | mcsparran2006 | lee1993	139	"Sewell, David"	2009	"Itâ€™s For Sale, So It Must Be Finished: Digital Projects in the Scholarly Publishing World"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Since the early 1990s, theorizing in the digital humanities has often celebrated open-endedness and incompletion as inherent qualities of digital work. But a scholarly publisher undertaking preparation and sale of digital objects cannot altogether dispense with traditional notions of deadlines and completion if those publications are to enter the dual marketplaces of peer review and institutional purchase. The Electronic Imprint of the University of Virginia Press was funded in 2001 with the goal of bringing born-digital scholarly projects under the aegis of the same review and marketing system that applies to books. In this article I describe how we defined the criteria for done-ness in creating two very different projects, a born-digital edition of Herman Melvilleâ€™s Typee manuscript and a conversion of the letterpress Papers of George Washington into a digital edition. Our experience suggests that it is possible to categorize different genres of digital creations based on the extent to which intrinsic criteria for â€œdone-nessâ€ù can be applied to them, and that decisions about completeness are always subject to extrinsic factors as well, such as budgetary constraints and the pressures created by competition and the evolution of standards."	bryant2000 | bryant2006 | flanders2007b | landow1991 | landow1992 | jackson1976 | crackel2007 | pierazzo2007 | wikipedia2007	140	"Brown, Susan | Clements, Patricia | Grundy, Isobel | Ruecker, Stan | Antoniuk, Jeffery | Balazs, Sharon"	2009	Published Yet Never Done: The Tension Between Projection and Completion in Digital Humanities Research	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The case of the Orlando Project offers a useful interrogation of concepts like completion and finality, as they emerge in the arena of electronic publication.

Within this ecology, it is instrumental and indeed valuable to consider particular tasks and stages done, even as the capacities of digital media push against a sense of finality.

Text Mining Gender Difference in French Literature	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"In this study, a corpus of 300 male-authored and 300 female-authored French literary and historical texts is classified for author gender using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation SVMLight, achieving up to 90% classification accuracy. The sets of words that were most useful in distinguishing male and female writing are extracted from the support vectors. The results reinforce previous findings from statistical analyses of the same corpus, and exhibit remarkable cross-linguistic parallels with the results garnered from SVM models trained in gender classification on selections from the British National Corpus. It is found that female authors use personal pronouns and negative polarity items at a much higher rate than their male counterparts, and male authors demonstrate a strong preference for determiners and numerical quantifiers. Among the words that characterize male or female writing consistently over the time period spanned by the corpus, a number of cohesive semantic groups are identified. Male authors, for example, use religious terminology rooted in the church, while female authors use secular language to discuss spirituality. Such differences would take an enormous human effort to discover by a close reading of such a large corpus, but once identified through text mining, they frame intriguing questions which scholars may address using traditional critical analysis methods."	argamon2003 | artfl2008 | joachims1999 | koppel2002 | olsen2004 | olsen2005 | philomine2007 | stein | joachims2008 | tannen1994 | schmid2006	143	"Argamon, Shlomo | Cooney, Charles | Horton, Russell | Olsen, Mark | Stein, Sterling | Voyer, Robert"	2009	"Gender, Race, and Nationality in Black Drama, 1950-2006: Mining Differences in Language Use in Authors and their Characters"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Machine learning and text mining offer new models for text analysis in the humanities by searching for meaningful patterns across many hundreds or thousands of documents. In this study, we apply comparative text mining to a large database of 20th century Black Drama in an effort to examine linguistic distinctiveness of gender, race, and nationality. We first run tests on the plays of American versus non-American playwrights using a variety of learning techniques to classify these works, identifying those which are incorrectly classified and the features which distinguish the plays. We achieve a significant degree of performance in this cross-classification task and find features that may provide interpretative insights. Turning our attention to the question of gendered writing, we classify plays by male and female authors as well as the male and female characters depicted in these works. We again achieve significant results which provide a variety of feature lists clearly distinguishing the lexical choices made by male and female playwrights. While classification tasks such as these are successful and may be illuminating, they also raise several critical issues. The most successful classifications for author and character genders were accomplished by normalizing the data in various ways. Doing so creates a kind of distance from the text as originally composed, which may limit the interpretive utility of classification tools. By framing the classification tasks as binary oppositions (male/female, etc), the possibility arises of stereotypical or lowest common denominator results which may gloss over important critical elements, and may also reflect the experimental design. Text mining opens new avenues of textual and literary research by looking for patterns in large collections of documents, but should be employed with close attention to its methodological and critical limitations."	argamon2003 | bldr2005 | joachims1999 | koppel2002 | parallel_gpdt | philologic2007 | philomine2007 | ruiz1998 | svm_light | weka3 | zanni2003 | zanni2006	144	"Horton, Russell | Morrissey, Robert | Olsen, Mark | Roe, Glenn | Voyer, Robert"	2009	Mining Eighteenth Century Ontologies: Machine Learning and Knowledge Classification in the EncyclopÃ©die	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The EncyclopÃ©die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert was one of the most important and revolutionary intellectual products of the French Enlightenment. Mobilizing many of the great â€“ and the not-so-great â€“ philosophes of the 18th century, the EncyclopÃ©die was a massive reference work for the arts and sciences, which sought to organize and transmit the totality of human knowledge while at the same time serving as a vehicle for critical thinking. In its digital form, it is a highly structured corpus; some 55,000 of its 77,000 articles were labeled with classes of knowledge by the editors making it a perfect sandbox for experiments with supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we train a Naive Bayesian classifier on the labeled articles and use this model to determine class membership for the remaining articles. This model is then used to make binary comparisons between labeled texts from different classes in an effort to extract the most important features in terms of class distinction. Re-applying the model onto the original classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about the consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the Encyclopedists. Finally, by applying this model to another corpus from 18th century France, the Journal de TrÃ©voux, or MÃ©moires pour l'Histoire des Sciences & des Beaux-Arts, new light is shed on the domain of Literature as it was understood and defined by 18th century writers."	anderson1984 | andreev1999 | blanchard2002 | brian1998 | hand2001 | hoyt1965 | lecatsiomis1999 | lough1973 | morrissey2001 | proust1995 | schwab1984 | witten2005	145	"Meehan, Sean Ross"	2009	"Text Minding: A Response to Gender, Race, and Nationality in Black Drama, 1850-2000: Mining Differences in Language Use in Authors and their Characters"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"A response to the Data Mining cluster, exploring the role of machine learning in textual study."	birkerts1994 | gates1987 | hayles2002 | mcgann2001a	146	"Rettberg, Scott"	2009	Communitizing Electronic Literature	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Electronic literature is an important evolving field of artistic practice and literary study.

In this article, we ask questions concerning the texture and shape of this emerging economy of attention. We do not take a position on the efficiency of new technologies for delivering educational content or their efficacy of competing for usersâ€™ time and attention. Instead, we argue that the emerging social media provide new methods for choreographing attention in line with the performative conventions of any given situation. Rather than banning laptops and phones from the lecture hall and the classroom, we aim to ask what precisely they have on offer for these settings understood as performative sites, as well as for a culture that equates individual attentional behavior with intellectual and moral aptitude."	bauerlein2007 | benjamin1986 | billinghurst2002 | kiyokawa2007 | ccs2007 | cole2007 | crary1999 | edmundson2008 | goffman1981c | harry2008 | lanham1997 | lanham2006 | liang2005 | meyrowitz1985 | munsterberg1909 | bachler2005 | simmel1971 | thaler2008a | thaler2008b | winner2009	150	"Earhart, Amy | Ives, Maura"	2009	Introduction	Digital Humanities Quarterly		unsworth2006 | zorich2008 | udl	151	"Robinson, Peter M.

These questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent of digital methods has both focussed and widened the contests around these concepts. The essay reviews some of these questions, with examples drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the two George Bushes, from editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer, Dante, and of Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United States.

Despite evident progress in devising sturdy and responsive standards, images, and tools, stubborn problems persist in several key areas that are explored here through an overview of issues that arise as the William Blake Archive acquires images, prepares them for reproduction, and makes them available for manipulation by its users. Editing electronic images in so unsettled and unsettling an environment generates the provisional success â€” weak success â€” that is utterly characteristic of X-editing, electronic scholarly editing in our time. Our dependence on current technology and the expertise of others is not a remediable condition. We must play the game as it presents itself, making the compromises that are necessary, and move ahead."	bielstein2006 | blake1995 | claburn2008 | cerf2008 | child2006 | eaves2006 | blake1988 | fuchs1972 | howard2006 | jaschik2008 | mihm2006 | misic2003 | misic2002b | misic2002a | preston2005 | robinson1993 | thomas2007a | waal1985 | wikipedia | eaves1996	153	"Price, Kenneth M."	2009	"Edition, Project, Database, Archive, Thematic Research Collection: What's in a Name?"

And how do the conceptions inherent in these choices of language frame and perhaps limit what we attempt? How do terms such as edition, project, database, archive, and thematic research collection relate to the past, present, and future of textual studies? Kenneth M. Price considers how current terms describing digital scholarship both clarify and obscure our collective enterprise. Price argues that the terms we use have more than expressive importance.

The study was conducted during a 2007 advanced Shakespeare course at the University of Central Florida that focused heavily on a new historicist approach to studying literature. In this paper we first establish the theoretical foundation for this particular approach to literary studies, then discuss more in-depth how the collaborative, inter-connective nature of wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the concealed assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or narrative. We also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology allowed our students realize some of the stakes in describing history for the present. In other words, having students create wikis based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeareâ€™s works developed an implicit awareness of motives for doing history. We also show how employing open source technology in a localized classroom setting can assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical apparatus and studentsâ€™ experience of meaningful connections to material. On a larger scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the humanitiesâ€™ disengagement from the real world that many have been suggesting of late."	brent1997 | calandra2005 | davidson2008 | davis2001 | davis2002 | desilets2005 | dwight2003 | farabaugh2007 | fulbrook2002 | jameson1981 | hilton2006 | lanier2006 | martin2008 | mason2007 | pennell2008 | radway2004 | read2007b | robinson2004 | schroeder2008 | schultz2001 | shakespeare2005 | stanley2005 | trimbur1989 | ulin2007 | weiner2007 | zuern2004	164	"McDonough, Jerome"	2009	"XML, Interoperability and the Social Construction of Markup Languages: The Library Example"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The past decade has seen XML widely adopted within a variety of communities, including the digital library community. While it now plays a critical role in the infrastructure of many digital library operations, XML's promise of interoperability of data across systems and organizations has not been fully realized within digital libraries. The reasons for this are not primarily technical in origin, but social, and relate to the cultures of XML's designers and XML language implementors, and a failure on the part of the digital library community to grapple with the sociotechnical nature of XML and its implementation. Possible strategies for addressing these issues of interoperability might include reduction of the flexibility afforded by specific XML-based markup languages used by the digital library community, and an increased focus on standardizing translations between various communities of practice use of such markup languages."	akrich1992 | bosak1997 | bosak1998 | bosak1999 | dilauro2005 | goodger2001 | hillmann2005 | hurley1999 | irs2007 | keith2005 | kendall2007b | kott2006 | littmann2006 | loc2006 | loc2008 | nelson2005 | renear2001 | seaman2003 | shirky2005 | shreeves2005 | berkeley1997 | bray2006 | wwwc1999a | wwwc1999b	165	"Svensson, Patrik"	2009	Humanities Computing as Digital Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This article presents an examination of how digital humanities is currently conceived and described, and examines the discursive shift from humanities computing to digital humanities.

The avatar is typically described as our second self in the virtual world of the game. The paper challenges this theory, suggesting that the avatar is better understood as a set of possible interactions, and proposes a second concept, the avatari. If the avatar is our second self, the avatari is the rebellious figure on the screen that we cannot quite control, and that jumps into the pit, gets hit by the enemy, or otherwise fails despite our best efforts to succeed. Conceptualizing video games in terms of the avatar and avatari enables thinking about video games via a more sophisticated and productive model of interactivity than many of the existing paradigms."	aarseth1997 | aarseth2004 | bolter2000 | booth1983 | breukelaar2002 | duguid1996 | evans1996a | heidegger1996 | klein1975 | kucklichs2007 | lacan2004 | lara | manovich2001 | mcluhan1964 | morabito1986 | murray1997 | norman1988 | rabinowitz1998 | rehak2003 | ryan2001 | stephenson2000 | turkle2005 | wark2004 | wark2007 | williams1997 | zizek2004	167	"Ruecker, Stan | Radzikowska, Milena | Sinclair, StÃ©fan"	2009	Designing Data Mining Droplets: New Interface Objects for the Humanities Scholar	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"In this paper, we describe the design of a number of alternative interface droplets that are intended for use by humanities scholars interested in applying data mining and information visualization tools to the task of hypothesis formulation. The trained droplets provide several functions. Their primary purpose is to encapsulate the results of the software training phase. They can be saved for future re-use against other collections or combinations of collections. They can be modified by having the user accept or reject features identified by the data mining software. Finally, they can also contain choices for how to display and organize items in the collection. The opportunity to develop a new interface object presents the designer with the challenge of effectively communicating what the tool is good for and how it is used. This paper outlines the design process we followed in creating the visual representations of these interface objects, describes the communicative strengths and weaknesses of a number of alternative designs, and discusses the importance of the study of new interface objects as the means of providing the user with new interface affordances."	bederson2001 | bumgardner2005 | dillon2001a | feldman1997 | gibson1979 | hascoet1998 | hockey2000 | horn1998 | horton2006 | karvonen2000 | kirschenbaum | nielsen2000 | pirolli1996 | plaisant2004 | ramsay2006 | ramsay2003 | rodden2001 | ruecker2006 | ruecker2005 | ruecker2003 | shneiderman2001 | small1996 | unsworth2005 | unsworth2004 | vicente2002 | weiss2005	168	"ZÃ¶llner-Weber, AmÃ©lie"	2010	Ontologies and Logic Reasoning as Tools in Humanities?	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"In this article, we evaluate approaches using logic reasoning applied to an ontology for literary characters. The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario. Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce with solely logic constructs. Furthermore, information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of logic reasoning. At the moment, to the authorâ€™s knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in literature studies, have been published. Existing approaches show promising results in modelling information in humanities. Therefore, further research should be directed to make ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more popular and applicable in the humanities and literature studies."	antoniou2003 | baader2003b | baader2003 | benjamins1999 | berthold2003 | charniak1985 | cimiano2006b | farrar2002 | fisher2006 | gomez2004 | greimas1971 | gruber1993 | haarslev2004 | halpern2005 | jannidis2004 | lungen2007 | mccarty2005 | meister1999 | nardi2003 | nieragden1995 | noy1997 | noy2001 | noy2003 | pl1991 | propp1968 | puppe2000 | racer2005 | renear2006a | shirky2005a | sirin2007 | smith2007 | stevens2000 | tsarkov2006 | veltman2004 | ziegler2004 | zw2006a | zw2006b | zw2007a | zw2007b | zw2008	169	"Kraus, Kari"	2010	Conjectural Criticism: Computing Past and Future Texts	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology. The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. Computation is here broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression. The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the written word and the emerging field of biohumanities."	abrams1953 | aitchison2003 | bell1999 | bentley1732 | berg2001 | borgman2007 | bottero2001 | cameron | carroll1992 | ceruzzi1998 | darwin1871 | fishbane1989 | franklin2001 | goodman1976 | greg1924 | grier2005 | grivelet1956 | gross2001 | hall1913 | hoenigswald1963 | hoenigswald1987 | housman1921 | johnson1765 | jones1948 | kac1999 | kay2000 | kenney1974 | kirschenbaum2008 | kraus2002 | lanham1991 | mahood1957 | manetti1993 | mcgann1991 | mcleod1983 | nisbet1991 | ohara1993 | ohara1996 | oppenheim1964 | poole2002 | ramsay2003 | ramsay2008 | rye2003 | salemans1996 | searls2001 | steiner1998 | sewell1952 | spolsky2002 | stoppard1997 | tarrant | tedlock2000 | thacker2004 | thomas2007b | welsford1966 | woolfson2005	170	"Terras, Melissa M."	2010	The Potential and Problems in using High Performance Computing in the Arts and Humanities: the Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH) Project.	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"e-Science and high performance computing (HPC) have the potential to allow large datasets to be searched and analysed quickly, efficiently, and in complex and novel ways. Little application has been made of the processing power of grid technologies to humanities data, due to lack of available large-scale datasets, and little understanding of or access to e-Science technologies. The Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH) scoping study, an AHRC-funded e-science workshop series, was established to investigate the potential application of grid computing to a large dataset of interest to historians, humanists, digital consumers, and the general public: historical census records. Consisting of three one-day workshops held at UCL in Summer 2006, the workshop series brought together expertise across different domains to ascertain how useful, possible, or feasible it would be to analyse datasets from Ancestry and The National Archives using the HPC facilities available at UCL. This article details the academic, technical, managerial, and legal issues highlighted in the project when attempting to apply HPC to historical data sets. Additionally, generic issues facing humanities researchers attempting to utilise HPC technologies in their research are presented."	adams1995 | anderson2001 | ahds2004 | ahds2005 | ahds2006 | ahrc2006a | bbc2004 | blaikie2005 | brodlie2004 | burnett1980 | campop2006 | crocket2006 | davies2005 | davies2006 | dillon2001b | dunn1946 | dunn2009a | ep1996 | fleury1956 | fure2000 | garrett2006a | garrett2003 | gutmann1977 | higgs2005 | hc1992 | hc1994 | hc2006 | holmes2006 | huntington2007 | impedovo1993 | inman2002 | itic2003 | iso2005 | katz1972 | kingston2006 | lloyd2004 | mansfield2006 | mcgraw1989 | mcgraw1990 | mills1989 | newcombe1988 | nitsch2006 | nicholas2006 | perkyns1991 | perkyns1993 | prdh2000 | reid2006 | riedel2007 | robey2006 | sauleau2005 | schurer2002 | shadbolt1990 | stallings2005 | stallings2008 | terras2006a | tilley2003a | tilley2003b | tillot1972 | ucl2006a | ucl2006b | warwick2008a | winchester1970 | winkler2001 | woollard1997	171	"Ainsworth, Peter | Meredith, Michael"	2010	"e-Science for Medievalists: Options, Challenges, Solutions and Opportunities"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Medievalists typically resort to parchment for primary research and when editing their sources. Not always accurately catalogued, manuscripts copied onto animal skins may have started life in the same workshop but over the centuries have become dispersed, coming to rest in libraries all over the world; bringing these together entails travel, microfilm purchases and reassembly and collation of the data within reach of a microfilm reader. These unwieldy machines afford only moderate scope for exploring single manuscripts at close quarters. High-resolution digitisation yields not just better surrogates in full colour; it allows for the development of additional research tools using image compression and manipulation, and new modes of representation, e.g. juxtaposed display of several related witnesses. This paper outlines research questions underpinning the development of an electronic tool for viewing, transcribing and manipulating manuscripts; it moves on to show how the viewer can be adapted for access from remote sites, to compare and annotation one or more witnesses (interactively and in real time), and for use as an integral part of an online edition. Finally, it explores how it can be deployed for use on projects taking knowledge outside the academy: in museums, galleries and other public spaces."	ainsworth2010b | kiernan1997	172	"Gold, Nicolas"	2010	Service-Oriented Software in the Humanities: A Software Engineering Perspective	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Software Engineering, as a sub-discipline of the broader field of computer science, is concerned with the production, use, and maintenance of large, complex software systems. On first inspection, the set of managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for collaborative data sharing, but also the modelling, capture, provenancing, and replay of the research (and possibly creative) process itself. This paper examines, from the perspective of a software engineer relatively new to the digital humanities, how the recent developments in service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new approaches to digital enquiry in the arts and humanities. The first part of the paper presents a brief history of software engineering, with particular reference to the aspects that have led to service-oriented architectures. In the second part, the paper offers some thoughts on how certain aspects of service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new kinds of computer-based research and practice in the arts and humanities. It also introduces important national initiatives in this area, such as the JISC e-Framework programme for Higher Education."	bennett2001a | bennett2001b | brereton1999 | brooks1987 | deroure2008 | dunn2007 | ieee1990 | iso2002 | jisc2007 | kernighan1988 | kotsiopoulos2003 | krafzig2004 | lientz1980 | naur1969 | oasis2007 | parnas1972 | peltz2003 | swanson1976 | syed2006 | szyperski2002 | cnmat2007 | kavantzas2005 | whitbread2007	173	"Unsworth, John"	2010	The Making of Our Cultural Commonwealth	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Reflections on the ACLS Commission on Cyberinfrastructure		174	"Sporton, Gregory"	2010	"The e Prefix: e-Science, e-Art & the New Creativity"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"What does it mean to put an e ahead of a concept?

Far from simply denoting that it might be done with computers (and, indeed, what isn't today), Sporton argues that beyond the effect of explaining this is something to do with technology, there is an emergent e-culture that reunites the arts and sciences after two hundred years of separate development within the academy. An e-Culture emerges that reflects the values, opportunities and restrictions of Internet as a research environment.

It concerns the ways in which live creative practices produce media traces that are fractured across screens and networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and their records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these highly mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions between the live event and the recorded document. That is, the discourses, technologies and practices (if we may separate these) of e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between events and their archives, they enact the liveness of archives as they are accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series funded by the A&H e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to investigate how e-Science technologies might inform new understandings of space and time for distributed, creative research practices. Arts and technology researchers from the UK, US and Japan met to generate, analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed practice-led research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships produced between time-based, live events and their immediately mediatized traces. This paper investigates those performative fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that the potentialities and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of practice-based research: from the politics of surveillance to the aesthetics of video compression, from the ethics of multidisciplinary collaboration to the theoretical implications of mixing video time and space with the time and space of the performance event."	ahds2006 | ahrc2006a | bergson1912 | birringer1999 | bolter2000 | butler1999 | century2005 | connolly2002 | delahunta2002 | derrida1995 | dixon2007 | flynn2002 | galloway2008 | giannachi2007 | gibson1979 | haraway1998 | imperiale2000 | kittler1999 | leatherbarrow2002 | manovich2001 | melville1994 | phelan1993 | rye2009 | poindexter2002 | ricoeur1999	177	"Borgman, Christine L."	2010	The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and infrastructure â€” all of which are necessary for achieving academic recognition. As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are called to action with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?"	ainsworth2009 | adho2009 | anderson2004 | JacobsAndWalsh2004 | arxiv2009 | arzberger2004 | atkins2007 | atkins2003 | ayers2003 | bailey2005 | baker2009a | bates1996a | bates1996b | bates1993 | bates1995 | bell2009 | bollen2008 | borgman1999 | borgman2000 | borgman2007 | borgman2009a | borgman2008 | borgman2007b | buckland1991 | case2006 | cclearn2009 | choudhury2008 | choudhury2007 | crane2006f | crane2007a | crane2001 | creative2009 | cronin2005 | foundation2005 | david2003 | davidspence2003 | odh2009 | manifesto2008 | doaj2009 | doar2008 | drucker2009b | duguid2009 | ebird2009 | edwards2007 | ecai2009 | eprints2010 | foster2009 | friedlander2008 | friedlander2009 | frischer2009 | galison1997 | gray2005 | gray2002 | greenstein2004 | hamma2009 | hey2009a | hoofnagle2009 | hypercities2009 | iath | ivanhoe2009 | jaschik2008 | jaschik2007 | jpmc2000 | jsah2009 | kanfer2000 | king2006a | bollen2010 | board2005 | lynch2002 | lynch2003a | lynch1995 | mahoney2002 | manovich2009a | marchionini1994 | mass2006 | mith2009 | monastersky2005 | nctm2009 | ninch2002 | nunberg2009 | oecd2007 | oerc2009 | olson2000 | oaip2009 | opencontent | opencit2009 | opened2009 | panstarrs2009 | pea2003 | crane2009d | poe2001 | presner2010 | presner2009a | pb2009 | reedijk2008 | committee2002 | rpe2009 | rice2008 | rome2009 | samuelson2009 | scheiner2004 | sc2009 | swaw3c2009 | save2009 | sherpa2009 | siegfried1993 | sloan2006 | smith2002c | stone1982 | src2009a | src2009b | szalay2008 | educause2009 | effect2009 | facts2005 | thierstein2009 | tibbo2003 | thl2009 | ukrc2009 | ucgbs2009 | ukda2009 | ucps2009 | unsworth2006 | vanhouse2004 | vectors2009 | whalen2009 | wiberley2003 | wiberley1994 | willinsky2006 | willinsky2009	178	"Hedges, Mark"	2010	Grid-enabling Humanities Datasets	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The term grid-enabling is sometimes (or even often) used without a clear idea of what is meant.

It is argued that awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field. The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a flythrough of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails. The second part is an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities.

These encoding experiments reflect the diverse nature of the artifacts and represent a critical assessment of the effectiveness of present encoding practices for the multidimensional and pragmatic aspects of authorial drafts. Thus far, it seems that the TEI has yet to offer a convincing theoretical model and adequate practical solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally present in manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general. Our conclusion is that there is a potential conflict between the linear and hierchical nature of current formal language systems such as XML, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing process. In such cases we may have to rethink present models of document modeling, and to develop, within an adequate epistemological framework, a new theory of digital text."	austin1976 | barolini2007 | bart2006 | bauman2005a | benozzo2004 | brockbank1991 | burnard2005 | burnard2007 | burnard2010 | bushell2007 | buzzetti2002 | cerquiglini1989 | ciotti2005 | edelman2006 | ferrer1995 | ferrer2002 | formigari2001 | giaveri1993 | gigliozzi1998 | giuliani2006 | hockey1988 | johnsen2007 | langacker1987 | lebrave1991 | lernout1996 | lisa2004 | magrelli1996 | martiradonna2004 | mcgann2001a | mckenzie1986 | mordenti1992 | morras1999 | pierazzo2007 | pregogine1988 | renear2005 | schreibman2002a | shillingsburg2006a | sornicola2005 | sperber1996 | tennison2009 | vanhoutte2003 | vanhoutte2006 | vetter2003 | zeller1975	183	"Schreibman, Susan | Hanlon, Ann M."	2010	Determining Value for Digital Humanities Tools: Report on a Survey of Tool Developers	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"While the purpose and direction of tools and tool development for the Digital Humanities have been debated in various forums, the value of tool development as a scholarly activity has seen little discussion. As a way of filling this gap, the authors conducted an online survey of developers of digital humanities tools in March 2008. The survey focused on their perceptions of their work, how they felt their tool development fit into a structure of academic rewards, and the value of tool development as a scholarly pursuit. Survey results indicate that tool development is indeed considered a scholarly activity by developers, but recognition of this work and rewards for it lag behind rewards for traditional scholarly pursuits (such as journal articles and book publication).

Information science, long the academic frame of archival programs in the U.S. and elsewhere, currently allows for considerable co-expansion with digital humanities innovations when we consider the possibility of digital libraries, digital archives, and web-based collections integrating a humanist approach to display and users' interactivity with cultural objects. This paper reviews a workshop dedicated to charting the relationship between digital humanities and archival scholarship, as well as the opportunities to refine curricular and theoretical development in these two disciplines.

After work with community development corporations on the East Coast, Plotkin entered graduate school in urban history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. During this period in the early nineties, Plotkin had a job with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and then collaborated on the development of the forum that became H-Net. In addition to standards and protocols about new communication technologies, face-to-face relationships grew out of online exchanges, often with lively disagreements about the direction of H-Net. Plotkinâ€™s own broadening use of digital tools prompts her concluding reflections on historiansâ€™ continuing need to use the Internet to overcome physical and intellectual fragmentation, and how the Internet has democratized the field of history."	achtenberg1974 | guernsey1997 | hoffman1986 | jensen1971 | jensen1983 | marcus1996a | urban1975 | plotkin2003 | staley2002 | urban1972 | young2009a	187	"Portela, Manuel"	2010	"The Machine in the Text, and the Text in the Machine"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The Machine in the Text, and the Text in the Machine is a review essay on Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the Literary (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame, 2008), by N.

It comes not only with presumed technology or infrastructure, but also with certain assumptions, discursive patterns, and models. This paper analyzes these critically and advocates a humanities-based notion of cyberinfrastructure, not necessarily built on a science-and-engineering paradigm or exclusively grounded in existing humanities infrastructure. It is argued that we need to maintain a critical stance while simultaneously engaging in the exploration of research issues and technologies. There is often a gap between the material details of infrastructure and underlying, foundational ideas, and it is suggested that a model based on conceptual cyberinfrastructure and design parameters can be one way of connecting the ideational level with actual implementation.

These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation."	anderson2008 | anderson2007a | carden | griethe2006 | jones2008 | knorr1990 | lochlann2010 | latour1986 | lynch1988 | maceachren2005 | porter1995 | shneiderman2005 | skeels2008 | wells2008	192	"Butts, J.J."	2011	Missed Connections: The Collective Novel and the Metropolis	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This essay argues that the urban collective novel serves as an important modernist precursor to network narratives. The collective novel is a literary form, particularly popular during the 1930s, that explores a wide context through a decentered narrative. Previous discussions of these novels have focused on them as exemplars of modernist form in proletarian literature. However, this essay shows another origin for the form in concerns about the metropolis and mass culture that complicates our understanding. Drawing on examples from novels by John Dos Passos, Daniel Fuchs, Albert Halper, Josephine Herbst, William S. Rollins, Jr., and Josephine Herbst it shows how these texts offered not only radically ambivalent assessments of networked existence but often a pessimistic view of the possibilities of political community, extending at times to specific critiques of communist politics. In its conclusion, the essay draws links between these novels and the cinematic network narratives that became popular in the first decade of the 21st century."	bakhtin1981 | barbusse1969 | barth1980 | ben2004 | benjamin1968 | benjamin1978a | bordwell2007 | brevda1996 | burger1984 | burrows1999 | carver1975 | castells1996 | chabot1997 | clark1982 | cohen2003 | cowan1982 | cowley1969 | debord1994 | decerteau1988 | denning1996 | dospassos1953 | dospassos1960 | durkheim1997 | farrell1936 | federalwritersproject1984 | federalwritersproject1982 | foley1993 | fuchs1961 | gelfand1975 | halper1933 | halper1934 | halper1937 | halper1970 | hanley2004 | hapke2001 | harding2003 | hart1980 | hardt2001 | hardt2004 | herbst1939 | hicks1935 | hicks1974 | howells2001 | huyssen1986 | inarritu2006 | jameson1997 | jameson1988 | jameson1981a | krafchick1988 | krupnick1979 | latour2005 | ludington1980 | lukacs1971 | maine1988 | lang1927 | sherman1933 | fincher2010 | capra1936 | mumford1938 | norris1986 | oconnell1997 | pizer1982 | rabinowitz1991 | rollins1934 | sandel1996 | scott2006 | seaver1930 | sharistanian1984 | simmel1964 | singer1995 | gaghan2005 | stott1973 | szalay2000 | soderbergh2000 | trotsky1971 | vidor1928 | wagner1979 | wald1978 | walzer1992 | weber1978 | weimarrepublicsourcebook1995	193	"Gage, Molly"	2011	"Winesburg, Ohio: A Modernist Kluge"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This article argues that Sherwood Andersonâ€™s Winesburg, Ohio, while it cannot be considered a text straightforwardly concerned with technology, offers a modernist version of the story cycle that anticipates the delocalized and highly structured interconnections facilitated by the network. Unlike todayâ€™s seamlessly embedded networks, however, the prototypical form depicted in Winesburg, Ohio functions as a kluge, an ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole . Andersonâ€™s kluge augurs network technology and therefore suggests that the form loomed large in modernistsâ€™ mind. However, Winesburg, Ohio illustrates the networkâ€™s propensity to foster usersâ€™ inner alienation while enabling their unprecedented connection and thereby warns against the antagonistic quality of the networkâ€™s rhizomatic structure."	andersons1966 | anderson1919 | bakhtin1984a | bakhtin1984b | barthes1974 | bassett2006 | benjamin2002 | benjamin2004 | bordwell2006 | broun1919 | castellucci1998 | castells2004 | cayton2007 | chambers2006 | ciancio1972 | cowley1960 | dunne2005 | enniss1990 | faulkner1938 | frost1942 | fussell1960 | galloway2007 | galloway2004 | gniadek2005 | granholm1962 | halliwell2004 | haraway2004a | hayles1999 | hemingway1972 | howard2008 | ingram1971 | jones1919 | kazin1982 | love2008 | marcus2008 | masters1915 | mchale2006 | mencken1966 | nagel2001 | oed | rideout1962 | shaviro2003 | sontag1966 | spencer1969 | spiller1972 | sproull1991 | stouck1969 | suvin1972 | toomer1988	194	"Beal, Wesley"	2011	Network Narration in John Dos Passosâ€™s U.S.A. Trilogy	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Wesley Beal examines John Dos Passosâ€™s U.S.A. trilogy (1930-36) to read its complex form â€” what the author once referred to as a four-way conveyor system â€” as an intricate networking scheme, and considers it as an archive of early network thinking. Contrary to traditional readings of U.S.A. that discuss its formal properties in terms of dispersal and the supposedly ruinous disconnections of modern life, the paper argues that the interplay of these formal fragments results in a semiotic web that drives Dos Passosâ€™s narrative strategy toward a totalizing vision of the nation and, indeed, history. Bealâ€™s paper deals with the progressive widening of network figuration in American modernism to think the very politics of national space, and in focusing on the machinic dynamics of Dos Passosâ€™s form, the article establishes network discourses as the organizing principle of several pre-digitization modes of production, including Fordism and the modern corporation."	bordwell2008 | bourne1916a | cowley1936 | cowley1936a | denning1997 | dospassos2000 | dospassos2000a | dospassos2000b | irr1998 | jameson1971 | josephson1997 | kadlec2004 | ludington1980 | phillips1992 | sartre2004 | sartre1995 | sinclair1997 | tichi1987	195	"Piez, Wendell"	2011	Impractical Applications	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The question of how we justify digital humanities to unknowing or skeptical audiences cannot be disentangled from how we justify studying the humanities in an era of anxiety and doubt regarding the pursuit of anything without supposedly practical aims.

The article argues that Stein first sees language as data that human beings are compelled to parse in even the most contextless and semantically noisy frameworks, which shapes the purpose and form of Stein's notoriously difficult prose poem, Tender Buttons; the ease with which meaning can be exchanged emphasizes the importance of the ways in which a given meaning is selected from a set of possible meanings rather than interpreted or revealed. While this may simply reiterate the mode of Tender Buttons in different terms, the paper's crucial intervention is in its positioning of the chance selection of significance as the mode of signification that animates her wartime memoir Wars I Have Seen. Like words in the poem, political identity in occupied France is unstable and waits to be parsed in the act of encounters with others and with history. In her narrative's foregrounding of and experimental play with the conventions of memoir, Stein discovers the shifting nature of her main character (herself) in a series of ruminations and chance meetings; an early version of the network narrative emerges in the nodal structure of the story that undermines chronological and nationalist frames of signification."	hazlitt1944 | bbc1945 | bush1945 | castells2000 | dydo2003 | times1944 | greenspan1999 | gonzalez2004 | meyer2001 | norton2004 | schwenger2001 | shannon1949 | shenk1997 | solomons1896 | stein1974 | stein1990a | stein1974a | stein1984 | vandusen1996 | whittier1999 | whittier2001 | wikipedia_surrender | will2004	197	"Beal, Wesley | Lavin, Stacy"	2011	Theorizing Connectivity: Modernism and the Network Narrative	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Introduction to the Theorizing Connectivity cluster.	bell2002 | bourne1916a | landow1994	198	"Kashtan, Aaron"	2011	Forward to the Past: Nostalgia for Handwriting in Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Claims of the supposed disappearance of materiality in digital culture often entail a nostalgic reimagining of the supposedly embodied, personal or creative aspects of earlier writing technologies, including handwriting. Although handwriting was never a fully embodied writing technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often characterize it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not only in critical literature but also in contemporary graphical media such as video games. Two recent Nintendo DS games, Scribblenauts (2009) and The World Ends with You (2007), represent two alternative modalities of such nostalgia for handwriting. Scribblenauts claims to fully restore the creative properties of handwriting, but inevitably fails to do so. By contrast, TWEWY claims to offer not handwriting itself but a digital- and DS-specific equivalent. Therefore, it opens up possibilities for critical reflection on the past meaning of handwriting and on the future of the values that handwriting has come to symbolize."	alt2002 | barton2008 | birkerts2006 | bolter2000 | boym2002 | brown2010a | derrida1982 | dibbell2001 | drucker1997 | eskelinen2001 | eve2007 | galloway2006a | gitelman1999 | harpold2009 | jerz2007 | johnston1939 | kashtan2011 | kirschenbaum2008 | marion1993 | mcgill1997 | mcmahan2003 | mcshea2010 | montfort2004a | montfort2005 | munroe2009 | myers2003 | neef2006a | plamondon2000 | oed1989 | tanenbaum2009 | thornton1996 | tringali2009 | whalen2008a | wikipedia2010a | wikipedia2010b	199	"Engberg, Maria | Bolter, Jay David"	2011	Digital Literature and the Modernist Problem	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"What is the status of digital literature in contemporary culture? Many scholars and practitioners assume that digital literature constitutes a contemporary avant-garde, which does its work of experimentation outside or in opposition to the mainstream. The notion of the avant-garde might seem thoroughly out of date in a consideration of the digital future. Important theorists (e.g. Huyssen, Drucker) have argued that the avant-garde is no longer viable even for traditional media and art practices. On the other hand, the avant-gardes of twentieth-century modernism made claims about the function of art that remain surprisingly influential today â€“ within the art community and within popular culture. As Peter BÃ_rger and others have discussed, an important division grew up in modernism on the question of whether art should strive for formal innovation or for sociopolitical change. Avant-gardes of the twentieth century took up positions along a spectrum from pure formalism (e.g. the Abstract Expressionists) to overt political action (e.g. the Situationists). While the digital literature community is in general committed to formal innovation, some are critical of this commitment, in part on the political grounds that (technological) innovation has become a byword for the digital culture industry. Although the modernist problem is still apparent in some digital art and digital literature today, writers such as Jason Nelson seem to be moving beyond that dialectic."	aciman2009 | bigelow2008 | biggs2007 | burger1984 | coover1992 | drucker2005 | eloai2010 | foster1996 | gallix2008 | greenberg1960 | koskimaa2010 | mcnamara2007 | marinetti1909 | miller1998 | pressman2008 | raley2002a | ranciÃ¨re2004 | rettberg2008 | ricardo2009 | rich2008 | rosenberg1968 | rosenberg1996 | stefans2000 | wardrip2009a | zuern2009	1100	"Ulmer, Gregory L."	2011	Avatar Emergency	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The original usage of avatar referred to the incarnation or human appearance of a deity, particularly Vishnu, in Hindu mythology. The term was adapted to cyberspace to name oneâ€™s online persona. This usage has come to include every aspect of oneâ€™s online representation, from the icon on a blog, or an email signature to the figure one plays in Second Life. Avatar, then, is a practical point of entry for theorizing the emergence of the new identity experience of electracy, that is supplementing and displacing selfhood, the identity formation of literacy. Playing oneâ€™s avatar is to electracy what writing an essay is to literacy. The point addressed in this essay is that an avatar is not merely the appearance of oneâ€™s representation, since through interactivity and even telepresence, I am t/here with my image. What is it to be/have an image? The answer begins with noting the literal meaning of the avatar in Sanskrit: Descent. Vishnu has descended (taken on embodiment) nine times, to correct a disordered world condition. This essay initiates a review of the cultural archive to see what is known already about our question (representations of descent). It is perhaps obvious, considering the prominence of Christianity in our heritage, that the West accumulated a huge amount of information about becoming body. Two examples are referenced in this introductory piece: Krishna and Orpheus."	abrams1971 | agamben2007 | arendt1978 | blanchot1981 | britt2008 | detienne1978 | huizinga1950 | mcluhan1992 | ovid1999 | pound1996 | virilio1997 | virilio1999 | virilio2003	1101	"Kashtan, Aaron"	2011	Because It's Not There: Ekphrasis and the Threat of Graphics in Interactive Fiction	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Existing scholarship on interactive fiction (IF, also known as the text adventure) tends to treat it as a video game genre and/or as a category of electronic literature. In this essay I argue that IF can be understood as participating in traditions of visual prose and ekphrastic textuality, insofar as IF consists of room and object descriptions which direct the player to visualize the things they describe. Unlike traditional ekphrastic literature, however, IF also asks the player to take practical actions in response to the images he or she visualizes. During the commercial era of IF, ekphrasis was the most effective means available of providing players with immersive visual experiences. However, graphical video games have now surpassed IF in this area. Therefore, in order to justify the continued existence of IF, contemporary IF authors have been forced to conceive of the visuality of IF otherwise than in terms of the logic of transparency. One strategy for doing this, exemplified by Nick Montfort's game, Ad Verbum, is to abandon visuality almost entirely and emphasize IF's linguistic and textual qualities. An alternative strategy, exemplified by Emily Short's game City of Secrets, is to assert that IF is visual in a non-transparent way, because IF offers visual experiences which are user-generated rather than pre-rendered."	aarseth1997 | baggett1994 | blank1980 | bolter2003b | bond2006a | chang2004 | chatman2004 | dibbell2001 | douglass2007a | drucker2002a | eve2007 | gaudreault2009 | heffernan2004 | hollander1995 | ingold2000 | jerz2007 | koelb2006 | krieger1992 | loguidice2004 | loizeaux2008 | mccloud1993 | mcgann1991 | mitchell1990 | mitchell1994a | mitchell2009a | montfort2000 | montfort2005 | nelson2001 | salen2003 | schwenger1999 | short2000 | short2002 | short2003 | short2008 | short2009 | wettlaufer2003 | whalen2008b | wikipedia2009 | wolf1997 | wolf2002	1102	"Burgess, Helen J. | Hamming, Jeanne"	2011	New Media in the Academy: Labor and the Production of Knowledge in Scholarly Multimedia	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Despite a general interest in exploring the possibilities of multimedia and web-based research, the humanities profession has been slow to accept digital scholarship as a valid form of intellectual endeavor. Questions about labor, peer-review, and co-authorship often arise in academic departmentsâ€™ attempts to evaluate digital research in the tenure and promotion process. In this essay, we argue that these tensions stem from a general misunderstanding of the kinds of work that goes into producing scholarship in multimedia form. Multimedia work, we suggest, places scholars in an extended network that combines minds, bodies, machines, and institutional practices, and lays bare the fiction that scholars are disembodied intellectuals who labor only with the mind. We argue that while traditional ideas of what counts as scholarship continue to privilege content over form, intellectual labor over physical labor, and print over digital media, new mediaâ€™s functional (and in some cases even biological) difference from old media contributes to a double erasure, for scholars working in multimedia, of both their intellectual contributions and their material labor."	aarseth1997 | andersen2004 | ball2004 | bolter2000 | burgess2003 | coover2002 | coover2008 | drucker2002b | easterling1992 | grusin1996 | gutierrez | hansen2000 | hansen2006a | haraway2004b | hayles1999a | hayles1999 | hayles2002 | hayles2005 | hockey2000 | hocks2003 | ifbook | kendrick2001 | kirschenbaum2008 | kittler1999 | latour1993 | latour1999 | mccarty2005 | mcgann2004b | markley2001 | mitchell2008 | mitchell2003b | ogorman2005 | ogorman2006 | pickering1995 | strain2003 | strain2004 | tuana2001 | vannatta2005 | wardrip2009b	1103	"Greenspan, Brian"	2011	The New Place of Reading: Locative Media and the Future of Narrative	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Locative technologies hold out the promise to transform literary space in all of its dimensions, including its represented spaces, reading interfaces, and the very spaces within which literature is produced and consumed. Yet, despite the growing use of location-based technologies, authors and readers alike have been slow to take to site-specific narrative due to limitations inherent in both the current design of locative media systems and our received notions of what constitutes the narrative experience. This paper argues that new mobile reading platforms in general are altering conceptions of literary space in highly conflicted ways, by radically expanding the sites where narratives can be accessed and experienced even as they reinforce a residual notion of literary reading as a sedentary and decontextualized experience. Locative media likewise hold out the promise of increased mobility and contextual awareness, but confront several cultural and technological factors preventing such an enhanced emplacement of narrative, factors that current performance-oriented approaches cannot fully address. At the level of cognitive engagement, the conditioned expectation of being transported to a remote fictional world interferes with readers' appreciation of the locative narrative's close ties to the real world, as well as the contextual effects it elicits by means of transportation through the actual world. At the technical level, the discontinuous algorithms of place that inform the architecture of most locative media systems hinder the perception of narrative patterning and flow across more extensive spaces. Locative media thus operationalize the spatial tension between conventionally sedentary modes of literary engagement and new modalities of mobility, a tension that is constitutive of our present mediality. The study concludes with a discussion of StoryTrek, a next-generation locative hypernarrative system designed to enable more complex, dynamic and fluid modes of embodied narrative spatiality. By encouraging the user to actively form complex narrative links between real and fictional spaces, StoryTrek enables utopian forms of spatial play that neutralize both the spatial limitations of current locative media design and the sedentary reading practices that continue to structure the experience of digital literature."	amazon | barr2008 | benton2000 | bernstein2003a | bherer2009 | bogost2007 | boluk2011 | bull2005 | eaket2008 | emmott1998 | evans2010a | galloway2010 | gerrig1993 | giles2009 | green2004 | greenetal2004 | greenspan2011 | harvey2000 | hayles2005 | hight2010 | khaled2010 | klima2006 | knowltona | knowltonb | lovlie2009 | marin1984 | miall2001 | micallef2003 | mitchell1996 | murray1997 | ong2002 | philips2007 | pope2006 | pressman2007 | proboscis | raley2010 | rober2006 | rothbauer2009 | rueb2005 | rueb1996 | ryan2004 | ryan1980 | schafer2010a | spellman2004 | whitson2008	1104	"Cayley, John"	2011	Writing to be Found and Writing Readers	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Poetic writing for programmable and network media seems to have been captivated by the affordances of new media and questions of whether or not and if so, how certain novel, media-constituted properties and methods of literary objects require us to reassess and reconfigure the literary itself.

Part one of the essay presents a brief analysis of recent experiments in writing to be found with Google, making some claim that such writing may be exemplary, that its aesthetic and conceptual engagements are distinct, and that there is something at stake here for the literary or rather for certain practices of literary art. After very brief discussion in part two of some broader implications of writing with the Google corpus and its tools, part three addresses more examples of writing to be found, and introduces a collaboration with Daniel Howe, The Readers Project, many processes of which engage with writing to be found in Google and making use of its tools."	battelle2006 | beckett1995 | beckett1964 | bosker2010a | bosker2010b | diski2011 | goldsmith2003 | howe2011a | lethem2007 | michel2011 | montaigne1910 | nunberg2009 | shields2010 | wardrip2009a | watts2010	1105	"Gochenour, Phillip H."	2011	Nodalism	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This paper focuses on the use of the trope x is like a node in a network in works of critical theory, and shows it to be an indicator of a larger discourse, nodalism, that has its origins in 19th century neuroscience and Associationist models of mind.

This paper grows out of a sense that digital pedagogy is too frequently conceived in terms of instructional technologies. Technology, at least in its electrified forms, can be a limiting factor in imagining how humanities instruction can be digital: something to get your hands on, to deal with in dynamic units, to manipulate creatively. What might an electronically-enabled pedagogy look like if we pulled the plug?

Furthermore, the author outlines a visionary scope for the digital humanities and offers a personal visionary statement as the endpoint to the article series."	barron2010 | bell2007b | bey1991 | bogost2010 | borgman2009 | burke2000 | cch2009 | chan2010 | cohen2010b | cong2011 | cordell2010 | coyne1999 | cronin2010 | davidson2008 | davidson2011 | donoghue2008 | drucker2009c | drucker2009b | earhart2011a | eisenstein1979 | entman1993 | fitzpatrick2009 | fitzpatrick2010b | forster2010 | franklin2008 | gailey2010 | galison1997 | higgin2010 | hine1995 | hine2003 | ichass2010 | ihde1990 | ippolito2009 | jankowski2009 | kirschenbaum2010c | kirschenbaum2008 | kirschenbaum2010f | knorr1999 | liu2004a | liu2011c | livingstone2003 | livingstone2009 | martin2003 | mccarty2003a | mcpherson2009 | nakamura2006 | nakamura2010 | noble2001 | nowviskie2010c | nowviskie2010d | nussbaum2010 | parks2011 | parry2010 | prescott2010a | prescott2010b | price2011 | raben1991 | rafael1994 | ramsay2010b | ramsay2011a | ramsay2011b | repko2008 | rockwell2002 | rockwell2010 | rockwell | rodgers2010 | romanyshyn1989 | ross2009 | ross2010a | sample2010a | sample2010b | scheinfeldt2010b | schreibman2004a | shanks2008 | scout2006 | sinclair2010 | silver2006 | sturken2004 | svensson2008 | svensson2009 | svensson2010 | svensson2011a | terras2010 | trettien2010 | turner2006a | unsworth2010 | weber2005 | winner2004 | woodward2009 | zorich2008 | humanities | atkins2003 | digging2011 | simpson | manifesto2008 | manifesto2009 | ucosc2007 | hastac | tamu | presner2009a | presner2009b | unsworth2006 | white2011a | williams2010 | wikipedia_dh | smith2009a	1113	"Ciccoricco, David"	2012	"The Materialities of Close Reading: 1942, 1959, 2009"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This article identifies some of the popular and historical contradictions inherent to the very notion of close reading digital literature, and puts forth an updated conception of what the author argues continues to be a vital practice of literary study.

In order to understand its role in supporting the fieldâ€™s development and acceptance, SSHRC commissioned a survey of the larger Humanities and Social Scienceâ€™s community to understand the issues related to DHâ€™s development and acceptance and the types of activities that should be funded. The survey results suggest there is reason for optimism regarding the growing acceptance of digital methods, resources and tools and electronic dissemination as instructors, researchers, and students are using and publishing in digital outlets and creating and employing digital recourses, methods and tools andventuring into new research fields. This trend is likely to continue as students and younger scholars continue to embrace the digital in all aspects of their personal and professional lives. However, this optimism should be tempered to some extent as students and junior faculty are still less likely than associate professors to present and publish their digital-oriented research for a variety of reasons. The fieldâ€™s more senior faculty can mentor their junior colleagues and students to this end and shape salary, tenure and promotion policies to recognize and reward these efforts. Finally, issues remain around the amount of funding required for the initial development and ongoing sustainability and relevance of digital resources and may become more critical over time. Granting agencies will need to evaluate their funding role in this regard."	adho2011 | adho | archer1999 | computers | computing | babeu2011 | borgman2009 | cfi2010 | cfhss2011 | conway2010a | csstc2006 | flanders2009 | glaser1967 | guthrie2008 | hackett2005 | harley2010 | hoover2011 | shakespeare2010 | juola2008 | kirschenbaum2010c | kretzschmar2009 | marshall1999 | mccarty2011 | mckie2002 | mla2002 | mla2003 | mla2010 | neh2010 | odh2010 | pannapacker2011 | pkp | price2010 | ramsay2011b | ramsay2011c | network2010 | reside2011 | scholars2011 | schonfeld2010 | schreibman2010 | siemens2002 | spiro2010 | sshrc2010 | mellon2011 | unsworth2007 | winter1999 | wwp_seminars	1115	"Wu, Yung-Hsing"	2013	"Kindling, Disappearing, Reading"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Where will all the books go? A version of that question has occupied commentary about Amazonâ€™s Kindle since news of its release first made its way to public attention in September 2007. Posed out of curiosity, excitement, as well as trepidation, the question includes anxiety about the re-invention of reading embodied by new features and the intricacies of downloading policy. In this essay, I focus on disappearance for the ways in which it indexes concerns about the Kindleâ€™s material impact on reading. Tracking these concerns, I turn to three major moments in the Kindleâ€™s biography in order to emphasize Amazonâ€™s investment in mimicking the transcendence associated with reading and the ways in which this investment is met, and at times exceeded, by readerly desires to possess that transcendence. That the very name Kindle should occasion parallels between e-reading and book burning, that Jeff Bezos should claim unobtrusiveness as the deviceâ€™s exemplary feature, and that Amazonâ€™s unannounced deletions of Orwellâ€™s 1984 from thousands of Kindle libraries should meet with such ire, makes visible the two ideologies of reading â€” on the one hand, the invaluable (because ephemeral) force of reading and on the other, reading as a relation of ownership and agency â€” that stand in both an uneasy and profitable tension for Amazon and its reader-consumers."	customer1996a | customer1996b | customer2010a | customer2010b | amazonkindle | amazon2009 | amazon2000 | gaiman | handler | morrison | brain2009 | anonymous2010 | arnold2009 | atlantic2010 | basten2009 | bella2010 | benjamin1969 | bezos2009 | birkerts1994 | boblenx2010 | bolter1999 | borenstein2007 | bordieu1984 | bremner2008 | carr2011a | carrieb2009 | catcher2011 | cook2010 | edwards2011 | fulton2011 | gonsalves2008 | heller | herdener2008 | higby2009 | hilbert2009 | jean2009 | jimiwine2007 | john2011 | kafka2010 | kdbrewer2011 | kimberly2009 | king1980 | king1985 | king2006 | king2010 | king2010b | king2009a | lascowicz2008 | lee2009 | levy2007a | manco82_2011 | mastrangelo2011 | mcgann1991 | mcmillan2010a | mohns2008 | nom-de-nick2011 | partin2011 | poppabear2010 | postcall2009 | rodgers2007 | king.com2009 | striphas2010a | striphas2010b | swaty2011 | swystun2011 | tate2011 | tharp2009 | theis2008 | thurrott2010 | thurrott2007 | turiya2008 | vonray2009 | white2009 | whitearrow2010a | whitearrow2010b | wickham2009 | wilson2007a | wolfe2008	1116	"Mostern, Ruth | Gainor, Elana"	2013	"Traveling the Silk Road on a Virtual Globe: Pedagogy, Technology and Evaluation for Spatial History"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This article describes the authorsâ€™ experience teaching college students how to use Google Earth to create atlases of historical Silk Road journeys.

Moreover, comic books are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication. The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with other complex documents studied by humanistsâ€”illuminated manuscripts, artistsâ€™ books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake, letterpress productions like those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated childrenâ€™s books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media. Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML vocabulary for encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and related documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for developing CBML, reviews the various content types found in comic book publications, provides an overview and examples of the key features of the CBML XML vocabulary, explores some of the problems and challenges in the encoding and digital representation of comic books, and outlines plans for future work. The structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial and textual elements."	aldama2009 | abbott1986 | barnes2012 | bendis2001 | bigjim1976 | bullpen_bulletins1970 | burgos1941 | avengers_v3_27 | avengers_v3_34 | capitanio2010 | carlin2005 | carrier2000 | cockrum1964 | conway1976 | coogan2006 | crown1967 | david2008 | diliddo2009 | drucker2008 | drucker2009c | eisner1985 | emad2006 | fantastic_comics24 | flanders2005 | foom1973 | gibbons2009 | gordon2007 | grit1969 | hatfield2005 | highsmith1993 | hoffmann1988 | huebner2009 | ics1968 | jacobs2007 | heer2008 | x-men17ms | x-men17 | captain_america_193 | kunzle2007 | kuskin2008 | lee1941 | lee1961 | amazing_fantasy_15 | amazing_spider-man_5 | lee1963 | lee1966 | tos084 | captain_america_111 | lee1969 | lee2007a | llull1990 | matz2004 | mclain2009 | mccloud1993 | mcgann2001a | moldoff1940 | moore1987 | moretti2000 | morrison2000 | norton2003 | pratt2009 | ranker2007 | rust2008 | selznick2007 | captain_america_1 | soundTEI | sperbergmcqueen2000 | tei.ch23.2010 | tei2010 | thomas1964 | wanzo2009 | whitson2007 | bray2008 | wright2001	1118	"Holloway-Attaway, Lissa"	2012	Beyond Representation: Embodied Expression and Social Me-dia	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The contemporary digital media ecology is one of convergence and hybridity. As virtual and technical interfaces intersect in increasingly complex formulations, the ability to identify organic vs. technical forms has become problematic. Virtual environments predominate within everyday cultural practice arguably limiting real or unmediated human experience. The advent of social media artifacts and networks in particular â€” those that create fusions of personal experience and communal activity and that support and broadcast user-generated content as a foundation for media productions of real-life â€” have made organic bodies and personal experience difficult to discern. Extending Mark B.N. Hansenâ€™s model for identifying embodied experience within contemporary mixed reality culture, I argue that embodied expression is more, not less, present in the contemporary media age. Organic expressions, those that emanate from primal, tactile, and motile forces and that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at the core of many social media artifacts circulated within the networks of contemporary culture and operating outside the aesthetics of traditional semiotic representation. Recovering the organic body and foregrounding its presence in such media asserts the functional non-aesthetic principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in those dependant on documenting the minutiae of real-life under-represented in mainstream and traditional media. As personal and public spaces collide, situating the me or the embodied subject within production is problematic. I identify such embodiment within contemporary social media, particularly on YouTube, to illustrate that the human body does not operate from a position of erasure within social media networks and artifacts, and its expressive value is therefore central in much current user-generated me-dia."	aarseth1997 | andrews2003 | barlow1996 | bolter1991 | bolter2001 | bolter2003a | bruns2008a | burgessandgreen2009 | cayley2006 | hansen2006a | haraway1991 | hayles1999 | hayles2002 | jackson1995 | landow1992 | lange2009 | lanham1993 | lessig2004 | montfort2005 | murray1997 | petersandseier2004 | raley2002a | snickarsandvonderau2009 | stefans1999 | strickland2002 | thacker2004 | uribe2004	1119	"Bellamy, Craig"		The Sound of Many Hands Clapping: Teaching the Digital Humanities through Virtual Research Environment (VREs)	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"At the core of the work done within the digital humanities is a difficult interdisciplinary relationship between the at times divergent cognate fields of computer science and the humanities. This paper will explore some of the characteristics of the digital humanities and examine some of its hard interdisciplinarity relationships. It is the contention of the author that one of the central epistemological challenges within the field is to empower students to successfully manage the thorny interdisciplinary relationship intrinsic to technology and the humanities. Without understanding and managing this relationship, there is a danger that student projects lapse into exceedingly reductive pragmatism or overly theorised clumsiness. The author will suggest a model where this hard-interdisciplinary relationship may be taught and assessed through the critical use and analysis of digital objects within the framework of a Virtual Research Environments (VREs)."	auselit2011 | beane2007 | bowman2011 | busa2005 | bush1945 | crane2011 | davidson2007 | deegan2011 | eaquaproject2011 | engelbart1962 | finerolls2011 | goldberg2007 | maciuka2011 | nelson1965 | ramsay2011b | mccarty2005 | price1979 | rockwell2011b | rockwell2009 | tlg2011	1120	"Evens, Aden"	2012	Web 2.0 and the Ontology of the Digital	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"While much valuable scholarship on the digital focuses on particular artifacts or historical processes or subcultures, this essay offers a preliminary treatment of the digital in general, proposing that the digital has its own ontology, a way of being, and that this ontology is manifest in the technologies and human relations that define and surround the digital. In particular, the digital places a central emphasis on abstraction, and digital artifacts and culture demonstrate this ontology of abstraction even while remaining concrete. The kinds of social structures grouped under the label Web 2.0 exemplify the materialized abstraction of the digital, and this essay points out the formal and technical features of the digital that carry the abstract nature of the binary code into the human relations and behaviors of Web 2.0."	bruns2008b | drucker2001 | galloway2006b | hansen2004a | hayles1993 | kirschenbaum2008 | lanier2010 | liu2004 | manovich2001	1121	"Bradley, John"	2012	"Towards a Richer Sense of Digital Annotation: Moving Beyond a ""Media"" Orientation of the Annotation of Digital Objects"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Digital technology often gives us the chance to re-conceive common scholarly practices with the humanities, and one of these is the practice of annotation. Whereas many in the digital humanities look at annotation through the lens of social media, in this paper we consider annotationâ€™s already established function in scholarship: to support the development of an interpretation of a body of material. It begins by applying a â€œsoftware applicationâ€ù perspective to annotation and it notes that personal annotation sits at the nexus between the publishing application of the material being annotated, and an interpretation development application that aims to support the readerâ€™s thinking. Once this application orientation is taken up, it becomes evident that it is useful to re-conceptualise aspects of annotation beyond the annotation-of-media focus which the World Wide Web has encouraged in all of us. The paper does this by considering annotation in an application that is not media oriented in nature, Northwestern Universityâ€™s WordHoard, and it explores some of the significance of annotation where the applicationâ€™s data model â€“ with its inherent semantic significance â€“ is available to be annotated. There is a growing interest in thinking of the WWW as a delivery mechanism for software applications rather than merely for documents, and thus many of the issues that this paper raises could apply to the work of web-oriented developers too."

After reviewing the ways in which anamorphosis has been deployed as a philosophical tool for investigating digital media in terms of human phenomenology, specifically through the criticism of Espen Aarseth and Mark Hansen, this paper analyzes how contemporary videogames like Sonyâ€™s Echochrome series, levelHead by Julian Oliver, and Mark ten Boschâ€™s forthcoming Miegakure technically, aesthetically, and conceptually explore anamorphic techniques. While The Ambassadors is famous for its anamorphically skewed skull, a classic memento mori, we propose that the anamorphic effects of videogames can be more accurately described as a memento mortem mortis: not reminders of human mortality, but of a nonhuman the death of death. By foregrounding the impossibility of ever fully resolving the human experience of computational space, the memento mortem mortis in these anamorphic games gestures toward experiential domains altogether indifferent to human phenomenology to create allegories of the beyond."	aarseth1997 | bogost2012 | bolter1999 | bryant2010 | caillois2001 | clark1998 | damisch1995 | deleuze1986 | friedberg2006 | galloway2006a | hansen2006a | harman2002 | harpold2009 | henderson1984 | iwata2011 | kirsh1994 | lacan1998 | mccormick2011 | meillassoux2008 | mitchell1994b | nideffer2007 | oliver2009 | pliny | panofsky1996 | seaman2000 | sony2008 | tenbosch2011 | thacker2010	1123	"Rockwell, Geoffrey | Organisciak, Peter | Meredith-Lobay, Megan | Ranaweera, Kamal | Ruecker, Stan | Nyhan, Julianne"	2012	The Design of an International Social Media Event: A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities (Day of DH) is a community documentation project that brings together digital humanists from around the world to document what they do on one day, typically March 18. The goal of the project, which has been run three times since 2009, is to bring together participants to reflect on the question, Just what do computing humanists really do? To do this, participants document their day through photographs and commentary using one of the Day of DH blogs set up for them. The collection of these journals (with links, tags, and comments) is, after editing, made available online. This paper discusses the design of this social project, from the ethical issues raised to the final web of journals and shares some of the lessons we have learned. One of the major challenges of social media is getting participation. We made participating easy by personally inviting a seed group, choosing an accessible technology, maintaining a light but constant level of communication prior to the event, and asking only for a single day of commitment. In addition, we tried to make participation at least rewarding in formal academic terms by structuring the Day of DH as a collaborative publication. In terms of improvements, we have over the iterations changed the handling ethics clearances for images and connected to other social media like Twitter."	ambulance2010 | life2010 | humanities2011 | words2010 | ayers1993 | ayers2003 | clement2008a | crane2006f | hockey2000 | holt2003 | mahoney2009 | mccarty2005 | mccarty1991 | suda2010 | taylor2005 | texttiles2010 | voyeur2010 | wordpress2010	1124	"Stephens, Paul"	2012	From the Personal to the Proprietary: Conceptual Writing's Critique of Metadata	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The past decade has seen a remarkable proliferation of new works of constrained and appropriated writing that prominently incorporate, and in turn investigate, metadata schemes. I argue that these works ought to be of considerable interest not only to critics of contemporary avant-garde writing â€” but also to media theorists, librarians and textual scholars. By emphasizing classification protocols, conceptual writing makes an implicit case for the interrelationship of these fields. Each of the four main books under discussion here â€” Tan Linâ€™s Seven Controlled Vocabularies, Craig Dworkinâ€™s Perverse Library, M. Nourbese Philipâ€™s Zong! and Simon Morrisâ€™ Getting Inside Jack Kerouacâ€™s Head â€” draws upon pre-existing textual archives. In doing so, these books suggest that processes of data storage, classification and transmission are key to how poetry is created, recognized and disseminated. Conceptual writingâ€™s attention to information classification protocols offers not only a critique of contemporary models of authorship, but also of contemporary frameworks of personal agency and intellectual property."	adorno1974 | amerika2007 | andrews1984 | beaulieu2007 | belgrad1998 | belknap2004 | benzon2010 | boon2010 | bourriaud2002 | bowker1999 | boyne2006 | brown2009e | calvino1988 | coolidge1982 | davidson2004 | drucker2010 | dworkin2011 | dworkin2009 | dworkin2010 | eco2009 | evans2010b | fitterman2009 | place2009 | fitterman2011 | gordon2006 | gilliland2008 | goldsmith2009 | goldsmith2008 | goldsmith2005 | graham2009 | heller-roazen2002 | hunt2009 | kerouac2007 | kirschenbaum2008 | lessig2008 | lin2007 | lin2010a | lin2010b | lin2010c | lin2010d | lytras2009 | manovich2001 | mcgann2001a | mcleod2011 | mcneely2008 | meltzer2006 | moorekerouac | morris2010 | morris2009 | morris2005 | morris2011 | block2001 | perec1997 | perloff2010 | philip2008 | ramsay2004 | saint-amour2011 | sante2007 | silliman1987 | shanken2004 | snelson2010 | stephens2009 | timmons2010 | vesna2007 | weinbren2007 | whitelaw2008 | wright2007	1125	"Causer, Tim | Wallace, Valerie"	2012	Building A Volunteer Community: Results and Findings from Transcribe Bentham	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This paper contributes to the literature examining the burgeoning field of academic crowdsourcing, by analysing the results of the crowdsourced manuscript transcription project, Transcribe Bentham. First, it describes how the project team sought to recruit volunteer transcribers to take part, and discusses which strategies were successes (and which were not). We then examine Transcribe Bentham's results during its six-month testing period (8 September 2010 to 8 March 2011), which include a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of website statistics, work completed by the amateur transcribers, as well as the demographics of the volunteer base and their motivations for taking part. The paper concludes by discussing the success of our community building with reference to this analysis.

The significance of this assemblage becomes further evident when it is considered in relation to how the Internet is increasingly perceived: no longer as a neutral medium but as an ecosystem defined by netwar, software arms races, and the possible evolution of low forms of artificial life."	adhikan2010 | arquilla2001 | barns2006 | carr2010 | carr2010b | cheong1996 | davis2009 | deleuze1987a | dyson1997 | falliere2011 | gross2011 | hogland2006 | jackson2008 | johnston2008 | johnston2009 | johnston2010 | mcmillan2010b | menn2010 | mills2010 | obama2009 | parikka2009 | schiller2007 | suarez2008 | suarez2008b | suarez2010	1127	"Rosenbloom, Paul S."	2012	Towards a Conceptual Framework for the Digital Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The concept of a great scientific domain broadens what is normally considered to be within the purview of science while identifying four such domains â€“ the physical, life, social and computing sciences â€“ and suggesting that the humanities naturally fit within the sciences as part of an expanded social domain.

Drawing on a combination of primary and secondary sources of information, including the Preserving Virtual Worlds project (an academic investigation into viable models of preservation for videogames and 3D virtual worlds based on a series of archiving case studies) and the results of a game documentation survey conducted by Donahue, we examine how players are taking responsibility for collecting, managing, curating, and creating long-term access to computer games.

It explores Siemens' early training and involvement in the field that is now known as digital humanities. He recalls that his first experience with computing was as a video gamer and programmer in high school. He had the opportunity to consolidate this early experience in the mid-1980s, when he attended the University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the department of English where he undertook, inter alia, formal training in computing. He communicates strongly the vibrancy of the field that was already apparent during his graduate years (up to c. 1991) and identifies some of the people in places such as the University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Oxford, and the University of British Columbia who had a formative influence on him. He gives a clear sense of some of the factors that attracted him to computing, for example, the alternatives to close reading that he was able to bring to bear on his literary research from an early stage. So too he reflects on computing developments whose applications were not immediately foreseeable, for example, when in 1986 he edited IBM's TCP/IP manual he could not have foreseen that by 1989 TCP/IP would be firmly established as the communication protocol of the internet. He closes by reflecting on the prescience of the advice that his father, also an academic, gave him regarding the use of computing in his research and on his early encounters with the conference scene."		1132	"Unsworth, John | Welsh, Anne | Nyhan, Julianne | Salmon, Jessica"	2012	Postmodern Culture and More: an Oral History Conversation between John Unsworth and Anne Welsh	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"John Unsworth recounts that he first became involved with computing in the Humanities c. 1989 as a new faculty member at North Carolina State University where he was hired to teach post-World War II American literature. He and his colleagues wanted to set up a new journal as only one other journal existed in that area. They were introduced to the recently released LISTSERV software and the first issue of the journal was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was called Postmodern Culture and twenty-two years later is still published by Johns Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed electronic journal in the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior colleagues were in favour of it and, as a junior faculty member, his participation in it. He recounts that was not able to avail of formal training in computing but he did have technical knowledge of computing, mostly picked up while procrastinating on this PhD. By the early 1990s he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused on electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and non-academic projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia where he directed the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the wide range of people and projects that he worked with and that it was around this time that he became involved with the community now known as digital humanities. He reflects in detail on the first digital humanities conference he attended in Paris in 1994 and concludes by discussing some of the changes that the advent of the Web has heralded."		1133	"Short, Harold | Nyhan, Julianne | Welsh, Anne | Salmon, Jessica"	2012	Collaboration Must Be Fundamental or It's Not Going to Work: an Oral History Conversation between Harold Short and Julianne Nyhan	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Harold Short recounts that his interest in Computing and the Humanities goes back to when he was an undergraduate in English and French at a university in the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). There, whilst undertaking summer work in the library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450 people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late Antonius Ampoli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised them. He closes by discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars into and out of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have had an impact on digital humanities centres."		1134	"McCarty, Willard | Nyhan, Julianne | Welsh, Anne | Salmon, Jessica"	2012	"Questioning, Asking and Enduring Curiosity: an Oral History Conversation between Julianne Nyhan and Willard McCarty"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This interview was carried out with Willard McCarty on Tuesday 27th March, 2012 in University College London. He recounts that his earliest encounter with computing was in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkley where he worked with semi-automated scanning equipment for the Alvarez high-energy physics projects. After his dreams of becoming a physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. There he did not have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. So, he learned to programme on the job with help from a talented physicist turned computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft). His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the University of Toronto where he worked on the Records of Early English Drama project whilst undertaking a PhD on 17th century non-dramatic poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic support role at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Toronto, where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's College London. In Toronto he was keenly aware of the staff-faculty divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that the role brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a lasting influence on him. So too, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada he was able to undertake a research project on Ovid's Metamorphosis. He closes the interview by reflecting on his early involvement with the conference scene and people who have influenced him, from academics to his calligraphy teacher Lloyd Reynolds."	bessinger1965	1135	"Rockwell, Geoffrey | Nyhan, Julianne | Welsh, Anne | Salmon, Jessica"	2012	Trading Stories: an Oral History Conversation between Geoffrey Rockwell and Julianne Nyhan	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This extended interview with Geoffrey Rockwell was carried out via Skype on the 28th April 2012. He narrates that he had been aware of computing developments when growing up in Italy but it was in college in the late 1970s that he took formal training in computing. He bought his first computer, an Apple II clone, after graduation when he was working as a teacher in the Middle East. Throughout the interview he reflects on the various computers he has used and how the mouse that he used with an early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the mid-1980s he was attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was accepted on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in Philosophy, he spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This resulted in the building of text analysis tools and their application to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, as well as some of the earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the digital humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of influences that shaped and inspired his early work in the field, for example, the Research Computing Group at the University of Toronto and their work in visual programming environments. In 1994 he applied, and was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he reflects that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth of digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one."	raymond1993 | rockwell1998 | rockwell1999 | rockwell1994 | bradley1994	1136	"Gibbs, Fred | Owens, Trevor"	2012	Building Better Digital Humanities Tools: Toward broader audiences and user-centered designs	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Despite significant investments in the development of digital humanities tools, the use of these tools has remained a fringe element in humanities scholarship.

The results of the study reveal the variety of users interested in digital tools as well as their enthusiasm, reactions, and frustrations, including the expectations and confusion that has created barriers to tool use and to the wider adoption of new research methodologies.

It will then examine the apogee of intra-Biblical linking systems in the Thompson Chain Reference Bible, particularly its chain-referencing system for thematic linking between texts. Finally, it will use this mature print technology to consider the state of the hyperlink in current Web-interfaces. It will show that while in many ways modern attempts at a dynamic hyperlink surpass this elaborate linking system in functionality, in a few key functions this old print technology out-performs what is commonly and readily available in current Web-browsers. In pursing this comparative analysis we aim to demonstrate the importance of understanding the organization and navigational structure of the codex in designing digital reading environments that will meet and surpass the affordances of print."	brusilovsky2001 | dyck2008 | foys2007 | gibson1993 | herbert1941 | inke2012 | kirkbride | nave1896 | newman1658 | olivetree | saenger1999 | tam1997a | tam1997b | thompson1908 | truran2007	1138	"Chen, Anna"	2012	In One's Own Hand: Seeing Manuscripts in a Digital Age	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"As museums increasingly place archival materials on display, a body of scholarship has emerged to provide practical advice for staff about exhibiting handwritten documents. However, there has as yet been little scholarship that problematizes the exhibition of manuscripts and the responses they elicit from their audiences. This essay, then, investigates the cultural perception of handwriting as an inherently unique and authentic embodiment of its writer, the assumption of which lies behind its display. Through a series of close readings of responses to the sight of the autograph, I examine the ways in which handwritingâ€™s association with the human body has been historically shaped and interpreted; its current function as a locus for concerns about the loss or degradation of corporeal identity in an increasingly technologized world; and how multimedia museum exhibitions of handwritten documents â€” as digitally manipulable surrogates of original artifacts â€” expose, complicate, and break down the oppositions in this cultural discourse. Ultimately, I argue, digital interactives are part of a new exhibitionary paradigm, which not only offers new ways of considering an artifactâ€™s essential meaning, but also refines and redefines our understanding of human effort, intentionality, and embodiment in a digital age."	allyn1987 | antrim2009 | ballard2006 | barraclough1988 | bearman1996 | bedos-rezak2000 | benjamin1978b | bolter1999 | bosshard1994 | bowen1993 | brannock2009 | brazer2001 | brenner2009 | brown2006c | callender2002 | cannon2000 | casterline1980 | clanchy1993 | cohen2010d | cotter2010 | darvick1985 | defense2007 | dekeyser2006 | dierking1998 | testbed2003 | dilevko2003 | dutka2002 | everhart1989 | foucault1980 | foucault1990 | gaur1992 | gordon1994 | griffiths2003 | grusin2006 | halliwell2003 | haraway1997 | haraway2004a | hayles1999 | harvard1987 | harvey1996 | hedstrom2002 | hedstrom2006 | heidegger1992 | henning2006 | hill1986 | keene1998 | kemp1997 | king2009b | lenoir2002 | levenson1998 | light2010 | macdonald1998 | madigan1930 | manovich2001 | mccutcheon1925 | mellor2002 | miller2010a | mintz1994 | morris1995a | morris2006 | morrissey1991 | neef2006b | vandijck2006 | nicholls2003 | olyanova1929 | ong1982 | osborne1997 | otoole2006 | pearce-moses2008 | ponot2002 | prior2003 | reagan2003 | rice1927 | reed1995 | rigg1905 | rose1994 | rothenberg1995 | rothstein2008 | schwartzburg2010 | sell2010 | shaddy2000 | silver1967 | sinon2010 | stevenson1994 | snyder1990 | swade1998 | tedeschi1997 | thomas1998 | thornton1996 | waldby2000 | weil2002 | williams2012 | witcomb2006 | wolfe2009 | woodward2003	1139	"Tabbi, Joseph"	2012	Graphic Sublime: On the Art and Designwriting of Kate Armstrong and Michael Tippett	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This critical essay was written for the Prairie Art Gallery catalogue presenting Kate Armstrong's and Michael Tippett's Grafik Dynamo! Its argument, implied in the catalogue version, can be stated explicitly in the present scholarly format, namely that narrative, associated with the development of the modern novel in print, is distinctly unsuited to literary arts produced in and for the electronic medium. Narrative in the Dynamo! is not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into question. The same holds for the place of argumentation in critical writing. The Dynamo! develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and by the popular and literary narratives it samples; the essay develops similarly, in blocks of partly autobiographical, partly analytical text. Propositions emerge not sequentially or through feats of interpretation, but at the moment when a block of text encounters a cited image from the Dynamo! Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of contemporary fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative was only ever a mode, one among many and not necessarily the dominant mode, in print literature itself. References are made to Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, to Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear, non-sequential narratives by Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are as open to innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter. In this context, Graphic Sublime also introduces a major, as yet unpublished novel from the early 1970s by Phillip Wohlstetter, Valparaiso."	andrews2006 | armstrong2008 | armstrong2005a | armstrong2005b | bouchardon2012 | greene2006 | latour2010 | mccloud1994 | shteyngart2001 | tabbi2011 | wohlstetter	1140	"Walker, Alison Tara"	2013	The Boundless Book: A Conversation between the Pre-modern and Posthuman	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Digital humanities and medieval studies share a long history, beginning with one of the first large-scale digital humanities projects, which was carried by Father Roberto Busa using IBMâ€™s Literary Data Processing Center. Why then, do many scholars of historically-minded fields consider digital humanities to be a â€œhelping disciplineâ€ù instead of a full-fledged area of study in itself? Beginning with the above question, this paper explores the ways in which scholars need not use the digital humanities to update historical disciplines or vice versa. By examining the pre- and post-print histories of the book, and interrogating the ways in which reading technologies and interfaces link the past and future of the book together, the past and present histories of reading coalesce and offer scholars novel ways of approaching many different disciplines that engage with the digital humanities."	exeter3501 | egerton2572 | harley3244 | harley5237 | harley5311 | beatie1967 | bolter2000 | brantley2009 | brown1993 | caie2000 | camille1997 | chaucer2008 | chun2006a | keenan2006 | crane1991a | darnton1996 | derose1991 | delany1991 | deleuze2004 | friedlander1991 | flanagan2006 | britishlibrary2009 | gitelman2004 | glick2005 | graham1991 | grotans2006 | hansen2004a | hayles2000 | hockey2004 | jackson1995 | jackson1997a | landow2006 | manovich2001 | mcdonough1967 | page2002 | shillingsburg2006 | strickland2003 | strickland2002 | strickland2002a | younghae	1141	"Harpold, Terry"	2012	The Underside of the Digital Field	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This essay takes as axiomatic that the subject of new media â€“ which in other contexts we call the user, the reader, the writer (or in institutional contexts, the researcher, the teacher, the studentâ€_) â€“ is a subject of language. This subjectâ€™s engagements with media and, by way of media, with other subjects, are determined by relations founded on language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the social bond of discourse. I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital field, particularly as the field shifts towards a more unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing, can be described in relation to the graphs of Lacanâ€™s four discourses â€“ of the University, Master, Hysteric, and Analyst. I conclude that deliberate reflection on structures of our research and pedagogy, mapped by the graphs, may lead us beyond the confidence games of the master and the University â€“ on and by which our inquiries are founded and oriented, but also narrowed â€“ to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose collaborations are more productive of new forms of knowledge."	aarseth1997 | alcorn2002 | arfi2010 | benveniste1971 | bogost2006 | bolter1991 | bolter1999 | bolter2001 | boluk2009 | boucher2006 | bracher1994 | bryant2008 | bush1991c | carelman1969 | cayley2004 | cayley2010 | clemens2006 | coover1992 | dor1998 | ducrot1979 | engelbart1963 | evans1996a | fink1991 | fink1995 | fink1997 | freud1904 | freud1909 | freud1915 | freud1917 | freud1937 | freud1955 | glazier2002 | glazier2006 | gold2012a | grigg1993 | hansen2004a | hansen2006a | harpold1994 | harpold2008 | hayles2005 | hayles2008a | jackson1995 | jackson1998 | jakobson1990 | joyce1995 | joyce2001a | joyce2001 | kirschenbaum2008 | kirschenbaum2011a | kittler1997 | kittler2008 | kurzweil2005 | lacan1958 | lacan1966 | lacan1971 | lacan1972a | lacan1972b | lacan1973 | lacan1991a | lacan1991b | lacan1993 | lacan1998a | lacan1998b | lacan1998c | lacan2001 | lacan2006 | lacan2007 | lacan2011 | landow1992 | landow1997 | landow2006 | lanier2011 | lennon2009 | liu2010 | manovich2001 | manovich2010 | memmott2001 | miller1990 | moulthrop1991 | moulthrop1999 | nelson1990 | nelson2010a | newman2004 | nobus2005 | nusselder2009 | parker2001b | perelman1969 | pluth2007 | quackelbeen1994 | saussure1966 | schroeder2008a | ulmer1989 | ulmer1994 | ulmer2003 | ulmer2005 | vanhaute2003 | verhaeghe1995 | wegner2011 | zizek1998 | zizek2006a | zizek2006	1142	"Roman, Belinda"	2013	An Agent-based Model for the Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The Humanities now confront a new era in cultural representations â€” the digital age. As a consequence, our approach to culture may be modified because technology allows us to now visualize our thoughts and theories using digital and computing techniques. This research focuses on merging humanities research with computational sciences to explore the processes involved in culture dynamics. We present an interdisciplinary approach that combines literary studies, economics, and agent-based modeling (ABM) and give details of how literature maybe used as a data set that can be translated into a dynamic Java-based simulation of human interactions constructed around Game Theory. Our model of Cross-Cultural Cooperation is designed to study culture at various levels of granularity simultaneously in order to show how micro-behaviors might lead to macro outcomes such as cultural group formation. We present one experiment based on the literature of discovery and conquest in the U.S. Southwest translated into the language of ABM. Additionally, we explore the role of space, time, and population-size in this process and offer a discussion of possible future directions for this type of research. The creation of our simulator of cultural exchange between individuals of differing cultures allows researchers to experiment with ideas about first and ongoing contact and speculate with â€œWhat if?â€ù scenarios."	cervantes | unitednations | census | academia2001 | harper | insula1999 | aschenwald2002 | alessio1978 | arias2002 | archivo1958 | axelrod2006 | bandelier1910 | berry2011 | bancroft1889 | bolton1916 | boyd2005 | castano2004 | cavalli2000 | cavalli1981 | chipman1992 | cochinos2000 | cederman2005 | craddock2008 | dawkins1978 | dawkins1999 | duaine1971 | flint2012 | gabora1997a | gabora1997b | hammond1977 | hammond1953 | holland1998 | howlett2011 | jaramillo2004 | kessell1989 | morfi1967 | mignolo1999 | mignolo1995 | mitchell2009b | obregon1928 | ortiz1984 | ortiz1972 | ortiz1994 | ortiz1969 | page2007 | sando1992 | sando1982 | sando1976 | schroeder1965 | simmons1993 | slingerland2008 | sperber2006 | sperber2007 | thrapp1991 | toro1944 | valcarcel2010 | vazquez2004 | velez1777 | wilson2001 | weddle1985 | winship2009	1143	"Drucker, Johanna"	2013	Performative Materiality and Theoretical Approaches to Interface	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This article outlines a critical framework for a theory of performative materiality and its potential application to interface design from a humanistic perspective. Discussions of the materiality of digital media have become richer and more complex in the last decade, calling the literal, physical, and networked qualities of digital artifacts and systems to attention. This article extends those discussions by reconnecting them to a longer history of investigations of materiality and the specificity of media in critical theory and aesthetics. In addition, it introduces the concept of performative materiality, the enacted and event-based character of digital activity supported by those literal, physical conditions, and introduces the theoretical concerns that attach to that rubric. Performative materiality is based on the conviction that a system should be understood by what it does, not only how it is structured. As digital humanities matures, it can benefit from a re-engagement with the mainstream principles of critical theory on which a model of performative materiality is based. The article takes these ideas into a more focused look at how we might move towards integrating this model and critical principles into a model of humanistic interface design."	surname2009 | abbott2009 | anderson2010 | austin1962 | barthes1974 | baudry1978 | beardsley1966 | benveniste1971 | bolter1991 | bowers1964 | buchler1940 | butler1999 | bynum2011 | byrne1998 | card1999 | carruthers1990 | carruthers1998 | cha1981 | cilliers1998 | clarke2009 | coole2010 | coward1977 | culler1997 | drucker1994 | drucker2009d | fish1980 | foucault1972 | fuller2003a | garrett2000 | gell1992 | genette1980 | glaserfeld1995 | gleick1987 | hayles2002 | heim1987 | jenks2006 | kirschenbaum2008 | hoffman1989 | holland1996 | holland1999 | krug2000 | landow1994 | delany1991 | laurel1990 | levi-strauss1956 | maturana1987 | mcgann2003 | mcgann2001a | mckenzie1999 | parikka2011 | paul2007 | saussure1959 | silverman1983 | thrift2007 | waldrop1992 | wikipedia_history	1144	"Cordell, Ryan"	2013	Taken Possession of: The Reprinting and Reauthorship of Hawthorne's Celestial Railroad in the Antebellum Religious Press	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"In this article, Cordell demonstrates the transformative possibilities of large-scale digital archives for literary history and bibliography. Focusing on the recently-uncovered reprinting history of Nathaniel Hawthorneâ€™s short story, The Celestial Railroad, in the nineteenth-century press, the article demonstrates the central, shaping influence of religious readers and editors on Hawthorneâ€™s early career. Cordell shows how the best traditional bibliography of Hawthorneâ€™s works could be dramatically altered after only a few weeksâ€™ work in digital archives of newspapers, magazines, and books, and using relatively simple search tools. Such tools not only expanded the number of known witnesses of the text, but also uncovered numerous paratexts: introductions to the story, articles reviewing or referring to the story, sermons derived from the story, etc. This social text of The Celestial Railroad, Cordell argues, lay buried amidst millions of pages that accumulated in the nineteenth century and required modern tools to be uncovered. The article also discusses how digital interpretive tools can help make better sense of such enlarged bibliographies. By comparing multiple printings of The Celestial Railroad using the Juxta Collation tool from NINES, Cordell argues that textual fluidity can tell modern readers much about how texts were understood by their original publishers and readers. The many changes to and discussions of The Celestial Railroad, for instance, indicate that the tale was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but nonetheless deployed as a weapon in denominational debates."	anonymous1869 | anonymous1861 | anonymous1855 | anonymous1851 | anonymous1850 | anonymous1845 | anonymous1843a | anonymous1843b | belasco2011 | brown2004 | bryant2011 | clark1978 | clement2011 | conway1902 | conway1882 | cordell2012 | cordell2012b | crowley1974 | d1847 | earhart2011b | finn2011 | fisher1874 | flanders2009 | garvey2006 | griswold1847 | hawthorne1987 | hawthorne1846 | hawthorne1844a | hawthorne1843a | hawthorne1843b | hawthorne1843c | hawthorne1843d | hawthorne1843e | hawthorne1843f | hawthorne1843g | hawthorne1843h | hawthorne1843i | hawthorne1843j | hawthorne1843k | hawthorne1843l | hawthorne1843m | hawthorne1835 | hawthorne1836 | hawthorne1844b | hawthorne1860 | hawthorne1850 | kazin1997 | little1843 | mcgann2001a | mcgill2003 | moretti2005 | mueller2012 | ngram2012 | nord2004 | nunberg2010 | nunberg2009 | raabe2011 | tanner1846 | thomas2011 | thorne-murphy2010 | tuveson1968 | walsh2008 | weeks1826 | wood1855 | midnight1843 | signs1843 | visit1843 | christian1848 | evangelist1852 | advocate1869	1145	"Arriaga, Eduard A. | Sancho Caparrini, Fernando | SuÃ¡rez, Juan Luis"	2013	Modeling Afro-Latin American Artistic Representations in Topic Maps: Cubaâ€™s Prominence in Latin American Discourse	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Artistic representations of African-descendant cultures in Latin America, the Hispanic Caribbean, and the Hispanic World have emerged as the outcome of multiple exchanges, inventions, and cultural coexistences. Such representations take part of a network where cultural, ethnic, social, artistic, literary, and racial information circulates, giving shape to centers with multiple connections at different scales. In accordance with this, the main aim of this article is to demonstrate how Cubaâ€™s predominance for the representation of such cultural pattern is not only based on the significance of particular artistic figures, but also on the connectivity that the island as a cultural node has with respect to the â€˜globalâ€™ network of African and African-descendant representations. In order to achieve this aim, we carry out two main tasks: a) network analysis looking at related concepts such as centrality, connectivity, betweenness, modularity, etc., through a methodology that takes into account topic-map analysis and the use of Page Ranking Algorithm [the algorithm used by good part of search engines such as Google] as the basic formula to filter and organize information; b) local analysis of two nodes that take part of Cubaâ€™s cluster in order to compare the results of the analysis of networks with a more socio-literary analysis that focuses on detailed reading of some of their messages (works, paratexts, prologues, interviews, etc): NicolÃ¡s GuillÃ©n and Alejo Carpentier. As matter of conclusions, we evaluate not only our findings with regards to Cuba but also the methodology as a contribution to the field of the Digital humanities and its practices of analysis."	adoum1946 | aguirre1959 | alegria1954 | amado1953 | amorim1947 | aragon1949 | arozarena1954 | asante1988 | auguier1971 | balagas1931 | bandeira1948 | barnet1971 | blanco1945 | boti1930 | branche2006 | carpentier1932 | carpentier1967 | carpentier1977 | cavallisforza2005 | Coulthard | decosta-willis2000 | deleuze1977 | depreste1984 | depreste1984b | droguett1946 | duncan2005 | ehremburg | feijoo | castro1943 | finn1988 | fox2006 | fox2002a | garciacanclini1990 | caturla1962 | garshol2006 | glissant1981 | tunon1947 | guillen1952 | guillen1957 | handelsman1999 | hays1948 | hughes1948 | jackson1982 | jackson1984 | jackson1997 | jahn1969 | kesteloot1967 | schewer1946 | alfaro1946 | levy1995 | lewis1983 | rego1947 | marinello1937 | marquez | estrada1967 | melon1947 | neruda1947 | ortiz | perezfirmat2003 | poniatowska1985 | ruffinelli1985 | roumain1971 | ercasty1971 | said1978 | salazar1930 | sedarsenghor1966 | sosa | unamuno1942 | vandijk1977 | vasconcelos1930 | vitier1970	1146	"Clement, Tanya | Tcheng, David | Auvil, Loretta | Capitanu, Boris | Monroe, Megan"	2013	Sounding for Meaning: Using Theories of Knowledge Representation to Analyze Aural Patterns in Texts	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Computational literary analytics that include frequency trends and collocation, topic modeling, and network analysis have relied on rapid and large-scale analysis of the word or strings of words. This essay shows that there are many other features of literary texts by which humanists make meaning other than the word, such as prosody and sound, and how computational methods allow us to do what has historically been a more difficult method of analysis â€” trying to understand how literary texts make meaning with these features. This paper will discuss a case study that uses theories of knowledge representation and research on phonetic and prosodic symbolism to develop analytics and visualizations that help readers discover aural and prosodic patterns in literary texts. To this end, this paper has two parts: (I) We describe the theories of knowledge representation and research into phonetic and prosodic symbolism that underpin the logics and ontologies of aurality incorporated in our project. This basic theory of aurality is reflected in our use of OpenMary, a text-to-speech application tool for extracting aural features; in the flow we coordinated to pre-process texts in SEASRâ€™s Meandre, a data flow environment; in the instance-based predictive modeling procedure that we developed for the project; and in ProseVis, the reader interface that we created to allow readers to discover aural features across literary texts. And (II), we discuss readings of several works by Gertrude Stein (the portraits Matisse and Picasso and the prose poem Tender Buttons) that were facilitated by this work."	mary | barthes1978 | becker2006 | bernstein1998b | bolinger1986 | chow2012 | clement2008b | clement2012 | cole2011 | davis1993 | derrida1991 | drucker2011 | flanders2009 | hrushovski1968 | jolas1929 | mcgann2005 | meyer2001 | monk1998 | murphy1991 | ong2002 | peterson1996 | plamondon2006 | pound2007 | salkind2011 | sapir1929 | saussure1916 | shrum2007 | smolinsky2006 | soderstrom2003 | sowa2000 | stein1988a | stein1988b | stein1988c | stein1990b | turner1905 | tsur1992 | unsworth2002 | schork1998 | watson2005	1147	"Wharton, Robin"	2013	"Digital Humanities, Copyright Law, and the Literary"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Embedded in the rich textual record of international copyright law, we often encounter a quaint, and perhaps naÃ¯ve definition of the literary around which the law has crystallized and which has the potential to influence the work of all digital humanists, whether they think of themselves as literary scholars or not. The first part of this article explores how a relatively narrow definition of the literary as a category of high or belletristic cultural production has informed the contours of U.S. copyright law, in particular. Section 101, Title 17 of the United States Code expressly defines literary works as any works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied . US courts have, however, often employed a narrower, more commonplace understanding of the literary as an aesthetic category when sorting artifacts or content into other legally more significant categories such as idea, expression, criticism, parody, and satire. The second section of the article considers some of the potential implications and consequences of the current regulatory structure for the work of digital humanists. Judges engaging in a fair use analysis more often than not expect scholarship to come packaged in print monographs written in academic language aimed at an audience of disciplinary specialists. When they encounter scholarly artifacts that depart from those formal expectations and draw from pre-existing work, judges are less likely to find the use of pre-existing work is fair and therefore non-infringing. Finally, the article examines whether the literary as a category should be abandoned altogether, or whether digital humanists might productively redefine the literary as part of a strategy for re-imagining the institutional and legal regulations that govern academic work."	baker1879 | graham2006 | blanch2006 | boateng2011 | boyle1996 | boyle2008a | cambridge2012 | castle1998 | copyright1831 | copyright1870 | feist1991 | folsom1841 | herrington2001a | johns2009 | kelly2003 | kirsch2010 | kurtz1986 | latour2010a | lessig2004a | leval1990 | liu2011c | mla2012 | oed2012 | patterson1991 | price2008 | ramsay2011a | ramsay2011b | schofield2010 | shipley1986 | shipley2007 | stowe1853 | suntrust2001 | surwillo2007 | copyrighted2010 | constitution | vaidhyanathan2001 | woodmansee1984	1148	"Finn, Ed"	2013	Revenge of the Nerd: Junot DÃ_az and the Networks of American Literary Imagination	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Junot DÃ_azâ€™s writing actively questions the boundaries between genre and literary fiction, aesthetics and politics, and English and Spanish, using a framework of multiple linguistic, formal and cultural registers to establish an authorial presence that defies critical categorization. DÃ_az arrived explosively on the U.S. literary scene with his second book, the novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. The multi-generational story of a Dominican American family overshadowed by a brutal dictatorship and the challenges of forging a new life in the United States earned many accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. I read DÃ_azâ€™s transgressive blending of genre and linguistic registers as a reverse colonization that calls into question the demarcations of American ethnicity as well as the racial politics of nerds. My argument uses DÃ_az as both an object of study and a paradigm for the potential of a hybrid digital humanities methodology. The complex cultural translation that DÃ_az asks his readers to perform creates a middle ground where Caribbean history, language politics and the class and ethnic tensions of immigration collide with the nerdy core of the mainstream American imagination."	anon | bautista2009 | bourdieu2007 | bourdieu1993 | bourdieu1996 | brouillette2007 | bucholtz2001 | cespedes2000 | chien2004 | diaz2007 | eder1996 | eglash2002 | english2005 | finn2011 | finn2012 | fisher2008 | flournoy2008 | fogle2010 | glissant1989 | glissant1997 | guillory1995 | hanna2010 | hanson2007 | hendrickson2008 | hills2002 | jenkins2002 | jenkins2008 | kakutani2007 | latour2005 | librarything | mcgurl2009 | mittell2009 | moretti2007 | novelrank2011 | okie2008 | quantcast2011 | reinert2008 | roychoudhuri2010 | saez2011 | saez2007 | scott2007 | smith2009 | striphas2010 | striphas2011 | torres2007 | wasserman1994 | white2011 | yworks2011 | zaurino2007	1151	"Kirschenbaum, Matthew"	2013	"The .txtual Condition: Digital Humanities, Born-Digital Archives, and the Future Literary"	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"In 1995 in the midst of the first widespread wave of digitization, the Modern Language Association issued a Statement on the Significance of Primary Records in order to assert the importance of retaining books and other physical artifacts even after they have been microfilmed or scanned for general consumption. A primary record, the MLA told us then, can appropriately be defined as a physical object produced or used at the particular past time that one is concerned with in a given instance (27). Today, the conceit of a primary record can no longer be assumed to be coterminous with that of a physical object. Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all sorts are also now, indisputably, primary records. In the specific domain of the literary, a writer working today will not and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, because the basic material evidence of their authorial activity â€” manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals â€” is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm. This essay therefore seeks to locate and triangulate the emergence of a .txtual condition â€” I am of course remediating Jerome McGannâ€™s influential notion of a â€œtextual conditionâ€ù â€” amid our contemporary constructions of the literary, along with the changing nature of literary archives, and lastly activities in the digital humanities as that enterprise is now construed. In particular, I will use the example of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland as a means of illustrating the kinds of resources and expertise a working digital humanities center can bring to the table when confronted with the range of materials that archives and manuscript repositories will increasingly be receiving."	committee2002 | derrida1995 | duranti2010 | ernst2002 | ernst2011 | grossman2010 | hall2011 | howard2011a | howard2011b | keathley2010 | larsen2009 | lavoie2004 | mcdonough2010 | mcgann2006 | mla1995 | morris1998 | parikka2011 | ridener2009 | ross1999 | smith1998 | stauffer2011 | theimer2012 | thibodeau2002	1152	"Frangos, Mike"	2013	The End of Literature: Machine Reading and Amitav Ghoshâ€™s The Calcutta Chromosome	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Digital humanities discussions of distant reading, machine reading or not-reading have often turned on a depiction of the field of literary production in which individual texts and authors recede in importance as units of analysis. At the same time, the question of what is specific to the literary in discussions of electronic textuality, or the digital literary, has been under-analyzed. This article contributes to theorizing the digital literary by way of an analysis (or close reading) of the role of machine reading in a postcolonial science fiction novel by Amitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome. This novel participates in the imagination of electronic textuality and digital forensics at a moment when the imagined possibilities of the digital archive were of intense interest to both cultural critics and literary writers. The figure of the writer of vernacular literature in the novel, I argue, brings together the text's interest in both electronic textuality and the subaltern archive, thus establishing the stakes of the digital precisely on a revamped role for the literary in the context of globalization. As such, Ghosh's novel provides a useful opportunity for re-considering proposals for distant reading in relation to world literary studies and postcolonial criticism."	apter2003 | brown2009 | brown2005 | chakrabarty2007 | chambers2009 | doane2002 | eagleton2008 | ghosh2001 | ghosh1994 | ghosh1998 | ghosh2002 | ghosh2004a | ghosh2004b | hayles2008 | huyssen2003 | joshi2002 | kirschenbaum2008 | kirschenbaum2007 | moretti2006 | moretti2000 | moretti2007 | north1994 | ranciere2009 | ranciere2004 | su2011 | viswanathan1989	1153	"Sample, Mark L."	2013	Criminal Code: Procedural Logic and Rhetorical Excess in Videogames	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Criminal Code: Procedural Logic and Rhetorical Excess in Videogames explores the code of two videogames, suggesting that reading game code is a fruitful way to enrich our understanding of videogames and the culture they represent.

Second, through a quick survey of the use of literature in digital humanities project. Thirdly, through a specific examination of TEI and character rendering as digital humanities concerns that necessarily engage with the literary.

I also argue that such assessments are essential to recognizing the ways in which feminist digital literary studies have impacted the field of digital humanities. Drawing on recent work in technology studies and feminist theory, the essay problematizes simplistic celebratory claims and troubles the idea that simply saving womenâ€™s work in digital form is enough. I conclude with a set of reflections on the impact of shifting ideas about the value of feminist work and theory in both public and scholarly contexts. This includes a proposal that more established scholars proactively highlight the feminist interventions that they make and that all digital literary scholars consider increasing access to not only the work of women, but to the technologies that are integral to that access as well."	balzas2000 | bauerrhoades1996 | beck1998 | bianco2012 | booth2008 | brown | brown2005 | brown2010 | brown2007 | buzzetti2009 | craig2011 | davidson2008 | earhart2012 | ezell2010 | flanders2006 | flanders2007 | flanders2011 | flandersfiormonte2007 | flanderswernimont2010 | flower1994 | fraiman2008 | fraser2009 | freshwater2003 | hall2003 | haraway1991 | juhasz2010 | juhasz2011 | kaplanrose1993 | ketelaar2006 | latour2004 | latour2005 | liu2011 | liu2012 | mcpherson2012 | orlando1997 | orlando2007 | peck1993 | renear2001 | rooney2006 | rowe-finkbeiner2004 | rosser2005 | schaffer1998 | skloot2011 | smith2007 | spiro2012 | steedman2002 | travitsky2009 | wajcman1991 | wajcman2010 | wwp	1157	"Marino, Mark C."	2013	Code as Ritualized Poetry: The Tactics of the Transborder Immigrant Tool	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The Transborder Immigrant Tool is a provocative mobile phone app by the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) that provides sustenance to border crossers by leading them to water and guiding them with poetry.

The EDT present the project as an artistic disruption of the tired national political theater staged at that border.

The central role of the curator has been further emphasized with the rise of the curator as artist and the institutional and physical limitations of museum spaces. We argue that there are important alternative spaces of meaning to be developed between object and audience. Digital curating, in particular, allows for greater audience participation, both by expanding the potential audience and by allowing visitors to navigate through the virtual galleries under their own direction. We contend that by facilitating the site visitorsâ€™ creation of their own visual arguments, a new level of audience participation in visual analysis â€” indeed, in a fundamental intellectual and intuitive aspect of curating â€” is made possible. We explore how digital resources can be modified to allow for that contextual sense of making a visual argument through arrangement.

It attempts to reinscribe the body in ekphrastic practice by adding touch to the abstracted visualism of the eye, and emphasize defining features of the ancient usage: orality, immediacy and tactility. What I call the digital ekphrasis with its emphasis on enargeia, its strong connections with the ancient definition, and on the bodily interaction with the work of art, conveys an aesthetic of tactility; digitalis=finger. By tracing and elucidating a historical trajectory that takes the concept of ekphrasis in the ancient culture as a starting point, the intention is not to reject the theories of the late 1900s, but through a reinterpretation of ekphrasis put forward an example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could challenge or revise more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities. In this context â€˜the digitalâ€™ is not only a phenomenon that could be tied to certain digital objects or used as a digital tool, but as an approach to history, with strong critical potential. The aim is to show that one of the most important features of our digital culture is that it offers new perspectives â€“ not only on current technology â€“ but also on literary, cultural and aesthetic historical practices."	ryan2001 | alcock1994 | drucker2009 | kashtan2011 | aceti2005 | wands2006 | zanker2003 | mcluhan1964 | bartsch1989 | oxford1996 | bruhn2000 | stewart2006 | bolter1996 | mcgann2001 | piper2009 | hayles1999 | hansen2004 | hansen2006 | maguire1981 | classen1993 | crary1990 | jay1993 | huhtamo2006 | morris1995 | weddle2010 | becker1995 | bodard2011 | bolter1999 | carruthers1998 | carruthers2008 | carruthers2010a | carruthers2010b | classen2005 | cluver1997 | crane2004 | denham2010 | dunn2011 | eidt2007 | engberg2007 | guillory2010 | grau2003 | hayles2006 | heffernan1993 | hewlettkoelb2006 | huhtamo2008 | krieger1992 | longinos1991 | marinetti1924 | mitchell1995 | mitchell2007 | paterson2007 | kennedy2003 | quintilian1953 | scarry1999 | scholz1998 | simanowski2011 | spitzer1962 | vasaly1993 | webb2009 | yacobi1999 | yates2010 | zanker1981	1162	"Portela, Manuel"	2013	Theoretical Permutations for Reading Cybertexts	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Theoretical Permutations for Reading Cybertexts is a review essay on Markku Eskelinen, Cybertext Poetics: The Critical Landscape of New Media Literary Theory (London: Continuum, 2012), and C.T. Funkhouser, New Directions in Digital Poetry (London: Continuum, 2012). Both books engage new media works and practices in ways that are transformative of the conceptual apparatus and tools of literary theory and literary analysis. Moving between the deep analysis of the Funkhouserâ€™s and the high-level abstraction of Eskelinenâ€™s will give readers an exhilarating sense of just how new media is changing our aesthetical experience and our way of thinking and writing about the textual experience. Markku Eskelinenâ€™s Cybertext Poetics and C.T. Funkouserâ€™s New Directions in Digital Poetry set new standards for the theory and analysis of digital texts. Eskelinenâ€™s groundbreaking book synthesizes his research of the last decade into a theory for the new media textual condition with profound implications for the entire field of poetics. Through Eskelinenâ€™s transmedial reframing of the operative categories of the field, it becomes clear how certain universals of literary theory have been in fact strongly dependent on a limited corpus of print-based situations. Funkhouserâ€™s close readings of digital poetry are also deeply informed by a hands-on poetics of digital writing and reading practices on the web. Building on his historical account of computer poetry , his main concern here is to analyze the multimedia and programmable specificity of post-WWW digital poetry. Eskelinenâ€™s permutational descriptions of the narratological and ludological variables involved in ergodic and non-ergodic works, and Funkhouserâ€™s close attention to the signifying dynamics sustained by the variability of programmable forms extend the critical landscape for thinking about literary poiesis, digital and otherwise."	aarseth1997 | bootz2010 | cayley2012 | cayley2011 | ciccoricco2012 | flores2010 | eskelinen2012 | funkhouser2007 | funkhouser2012 | hayles2008 | hayles2012 | johnston2011 | memmott2011 | schafer2010 | simanowski2011 | gendolla2011 | stefans2011 | wardrip2008 | wardrip2009	1163	"Poole, Alex H."	2013	Now is the Future Now? The Urgency of Digital Curation in the Digital Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"In their seminal report, Our Cultural Commonwealth (2006), the American Council of Learned Societies underscored the need for scholars engaged in digital humanities work to leverage their access to data both to expand their audience to the general public and to generate new research questions. Now is the Future Now? argues that the progress made in digital humanities toward these goals has depended and will depend not only on digital data, but also on their appropriate curation. The article defines digital humanities, data, so-called Big Data, and digital curation. Next it examines digital curation initiatives in the sciences and in the humanities that occurred before the release of Our Cultural Commonwealth. It then considers and evaluates the digital curation work undertaken in the sciences and in the humanities after the reportâ€™s publication. In theory and in practice digital curation has benefited substantially from practices developed and tested first in the natural sciences and subsequently adapted for and extended in the humanities. Finally, the piece explores the future work necessary to facilitate symbiosis between digital curation and digital humanities. Collaboration and cooperation, transcending geographical, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries, data sharing, policies and planning, education and training, sustainability â€” all remain pressing issues in 2013."	abbott2008 | alvarado2011 | council2006 | arms2008 | arms2007 | atkins2003 | baker2009 | beagrie2004 | beagrie2006 | becker2009 | bell2009 | berman2010 | blanke2009 | bollier2011 | borgman2009 | borgman2012 | boyd2012 | buckland2011 | carlson2011 | carlson2007 | chin2004 | choudhury2010 | cohen2012 | constantopoulos2007 | cragin2010 | creamer2012 | crosas2011 | crow2002 | economic2010 | eynden2010 | flanders2012 | flanders2007 | fraistat2012 | friedlander2009 | gold2010 | goodman2009 | green2008 | hank2009 | hey2009 | higgins2008 | higgins2011 | hockx-yu2007 | data2009 | johnston2012 | karasti2006 | kim2011 | king2007 | kirschenbaum2010 | kornbluh2008 | lee2007 | lesk2010 | lord2003 | lynch2003 | lynch2008 | lyon2009 | mccarty2012 | miller2012 | myers2005 | science2009 | board2005 | foundation2005 | nature2009 | ogburn2010 | pannapacker2013 | piez2011 | prom2011 | pryor2009 | taskforce2009 | research2009 | rusbridge2007 | rusbridge2005 | schofield2009 | shorish2012 | spiro2012 | steinhart2012 | stodden2009 | svensson2010 | svensson2012 | swan2008 | uhlir2010 | unsworth2009 | vardigan2007 | wallis2008 | walters2009 | skinner2011 | waters2007 | weibel2009 | whitlock2010 | whyte2010 | willford2012 | witt2009 | yakel2007 | zimmerman2008 | zorich2009	1164	"Crymble, Adam | Flanders, Julia"	2013	FairCite	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Within the digital humanities, there are many approaches to citation.

However, there is also broad agreement that citation practices need scrutiny and perhaps rethinking. The issue arises with particular force when we consider how to cite digital humanities projects and tools. Standard citation practices do not provide good precedents for making visible the contributions of project personnel in these highly collaborative efforts.

Instead of reaching fixed endings, such works also tend to be of indefinite length or at least suggest indefinite possible combinations. I argue that the impact of such works can instead be found in how one attempts to work through their underlying grammar, based on limits in the algorithms that generate the content â€” not those limits themselves, but how their outlines come to be known. Repetitively iterating through these works simultaneously upholds the chance nature of the epiphenomenal occurrences while also illustrating the sameness of the underlying algorithm over time, creating a future-oriented interpretive arc. I examine two works that play off of this technique in different ways: Nick Montfortâ€™s Taroko Gorge, a poetry generator which uses random generation to distill the essence of its objectâ€™s possibility, and the action role-playing game Torchlight, which attempts to elevate chance beyond a mere gameplay mechanic and toward an ethic."	aarseth1997 | andrews2004 | bloch1986 | bogost2006 | bogost2007 | bulhak2000 | chun2008 | ciccoricco2007 | codedoc2002 | douglas1989 | douglas2004 | eklund2010 | geniwate2008 | hayles2008 | howe2011 | james2009 | liu2004 | magnhildoen2011 | mallarme1987 | manovich2004 | marino2006 | marino2010 | montfort2003 | montfort2009a | montfort2009b | montfort2010 | perloff1991 | raley2006 | rettberg2008 | roubaud2005 | runic2009 | ryan2006 | seaman2001 | wardrip2009 | wylde2004 | xangela2003	1166	"Roberts-Smith, Jennifer | DeSouza-Coelho, Shawn | Dobson, Teresa M. | Gabriele, Sandra | Rodriguez-Arenas, Omar | Ruecker, Stan | Sinclair, StÃ©fan | Akong, Annmarie | Bouchard, Matt | Hong, Marcelo | Jakacki, Diane | Lam, David | Kovacs, Alexandra | Northam, Lesley | So, Daniel"		Visualizing Theatrical Text: From Watching the Script to the Simulated Environment for Theatre (SET)	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The Simulated Environment for Theatre (SET) offers an alternative to static, two-dimensional visualizations of theatrical text by modeling the process of moving from text to performance in the Western, text-based tradition of live theatre production.

All three parts of the interface can be edited; edits in any individual section appear in the others; and all three can be played back simultaneously. While emphasizing that the traditional medium of theatrical performance is the actorâ€™s body moving in time and space, and providing a digital analogue for that medium, the system also frees users from the limitations of the single, time-bound spectatorâ€™s perspective.

I would like to argue for a better balance between the how and the what of DH - for a qualitative turn of sorts away from an interest in gaining and making accessible more information only, to an interest in also making sense of and understanding that information.

This paper traces the steps taken in a collaborative research project that aimed to analyze newspaper coverage of a high-profile murder trial, which occurred in New York City in 1873. A corpus of approximately one-half million words was produced by converting original print sources and image files into digital texts, which produced a substantial rate of OCR-generated errors. We then corrected the scans and added document-level genre metadata. This allowed us to evaluate the impact of our quality upgrade procedures when we tested for possible differences in word usage across two key phases in the trial's coverage using log likelihood ratio . The same tests were run on each dataset â€“ the original OCR scans, a subset of OCR scans selected through the addition of genre metadata, and the metadata-enhanced scans corrected to 98% accuracy. Our results revealed that error correction is desirable but not essential. However, metadata to distinguish between different genres of trial coverage, obtained during the correction process, had a substantial impact. This was true both when investigating all words and when testing for a subset of judgment words we created to explore the murderâ€™s emotive elements and its moral implications. Deeper analysis of this case, and others like it, will require more sophisticated text mining techniques to disambiguate word sense and context, which may be more sensitive to OCR-induced errors."	archerforthcoming | arlitsch2004 | ayers2013 | baron2009 | dunning1993 | eder2013 | hitchcock2013 | holley2009 | kagan2009 | kilgarriff2001 | knoblock2007 | lopresti2008 | mcintyre2010 | moore2004 | nelson2010 | nelson2012 | newman2006 | obrien2010 | paquot2009 | powell2004 | rayson2000 | rice1993 | stein2006 | strange2010 | strapparava2008 | svensson2010 | tanner2009 | walker2010 | wiebe2005 | williams2011 | yang2011	1169	"Breure, Leen | Hoogerwerf, Maarten | van Horik, RenÃ©"	2014	Xposâ€™re: A Tool for Rich Internet Publications	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Internet technologies are gradually reshaping the function of traditional scholarly publications. There is a growing tendency in some disciplines to publish a digital paper together with supplements such as images, videos, 3D-models and underlying data. More information requires a better usability in terms of overview and finding information, which has led to new features in journals and thus to modifying and extending this genre. These so-called enhanced publications or rich internet publications have various physical forms: PDF documents with embedded interactive models, HTML files enriched with hyperlinks to contextual information and with facilities to highlight information in the text, or aggregations of documents and other resources linked together through metadata which make them findable for semantic search engines. However, many of the originally print-based journals, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, are still rather conservative in format and offer hardly any opportunities for enhanced publishing, which leaves room for some form of self-publishing, perhaps as addition to a regular journal article. In this paper we introduce the Xposâ€™re tools for authoring and displaying an interactive multimedia scholarly publication, which may be created as a digital companion to a regular journal paper and published, for example, on the author or institutionâ€™s website in order to share related research products and to achieve greater visibility. We also report about practical experiences with this software in a few research projects. The Xposâ€™re software (see: http://xposre.nl/software/) comprises a Flash-based document reader and a set of extensions (plug-ins) that extend the basic functionality of this text browser. The extensions are used to display specific types of multimedia that provide additional functionality, such as viewing images, videos and interactive maps. The input text is XML based, which not only guarantees a durable and flexible encoding of content, but also allows automatic rendering in different formats according to the preferences of users and the limitations of their hardware. In addition, the XML source can be easily transformed to an RDF resource map to meet the requirements of the semantic web. The document reader generates output in HTML, in two flavors, namely a slide based version that uses JavaScript, and a plain HTML text (single page), which is most suitable for printing and which can be used to create e-books. This plain HTML text can also be displayed in a format similar to that of scientific journals through the Xposâ€™re HTML Reader, which has more features than the automatically generated slides and which can be highly customized by the user."	alsudani2009 | aalbersberg2012 | bentum2009 | bernard2002 | borgman2007 | breure2011 | dietrich2012 | dillon1989 | dyson2004 | force11 | gerber2009 | hunter2007 | jankowski2009 | kjellberg2010 | lagoze2007 | nimwegen1999 | pettifer2011 | phillips2009 | puschmann2012 | santosa2011 | tatum2011 | wouters2012 | ziegler2011	1170	"Suzuki, Takafumi | Hosoya, Mai"	2014	Computational Stylistic Analysis of Popular Songs of Japanese Female Singer-songwriters	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"This study analyzes popular songs composed by Japanese female singer-songwriters.

In this study, we applied new methods of computational stylistics to the lyrics of the songs.

Particular attention is given to Morettiâ€™s uptake of Immanuel Wallerstein, to his controversial critique of close reading, and to the variety of digital-humanistic methods that comprise Morettiâ€™s quantitative formalism. Most valuable as an artifact of literary-critical history rather than a how-to guide or theoretical treatise, this hodgepodge of essays is at its best as an audacious and defensive academic memoir tracing Morettiâ€™s transformation into a digital humanist. As Moretti champions the broad explanatory power of quantitative literary analysis, he overestimates the scientific objectivity of his analyses while undervaluing the productively suggestive stories of doubt, failure, and compromise that lend nuance and depth to his hypotheses.

We propose applying this framework to the design of a spoken word archive, with the aim of designing a digital tool that is optimized for the documented practices of scholars. We propose that listening and annotation are key activities of humanities scholars performing literary criticism of audio recordings. Taking the SpokenWeb poetry project as an example, we discuss how designing a web-based tool with these key activities in mind could facilitate close and critical engagement with recordings of spoken poetry.

Together these phenomena downplay the professional skills needed to successfully manage a project while suggesting that project management is necessary only in the beginning stages of an endeavor. They may even give the impression that scholarship in the digital humanities is inherently ephemeral. Through a case study of project management practices at the William Blake Archive, which began publishing electronic scholarly editions in 1996, this essay details the challenges and rewards of managing an established digital humanities project. Managers of mature projects may be called upon to oversee expansions in scope and mission, research and recommend new features and tools, grow or shrink the number of project staff, seek out alternate sources of support when early grants run out, maintain continuity as collaborators join and leave the project, and develop new workflows and procedures to reflect these and other changes."	bamboo2013 | system2012 | burgess2013 | croxall2011 | plans2012 | eaves2013 | eaves2006 | eaves2012 | fiormonte2010 | dhcenter2013 | kirschenbaum2009 | kirschenbaum2008 | leon2012 | mcgann2013 | nelson2012 | nowviskie2012 | scholars2012 | nowviskie2010 | pitti2004 | price2012 | ramsay2004 | scheinfeldt2012 | shaw2012 | siemens2010 | ucbconference2013 | vankleeck2012 | project2012	1175	"Portela, Manuel"	2014	Multimodal Editing and Archival Performance: A Diagrammatic Essay on Transcoding Experimental Literature	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"The aim of PO.EX: A Digital Archive of Portuguese Experimental Literature (http://po-ex.net/) is to represent the intermedia and performative textuality of a large corpus of experimental works and practices in an electronic database, including some early instances of digital literature. This article describes the multimodal editing of experimental works in terms of a hypertext rationale, and then demonstrates the performative nature of the remediation, emulation, and recreation involved in digital transcoding and archiving. Preservation, classification, and networked distribution of artifacts are discussed as representational problems within the current algorithmic and database aesthetics in knowledge production."	aguiar1985 | arms2011 | bernstein1998 | bernstein2003 | bernstein2006 | bodin1997 | burnard2006 | deegan2009 | drew2002 | drucker2006a | drucker2006b | drucker2009 | eaves1996 | filreis2004 | goldsmithnd | kirschenbaum2009a | kirschenbaum2009b | liu2005 | mcgann2001 | mcgann1993 | montfort2004 | murray2012 | pitti2004 | portela2009 | renear2004 | schreibman2002 | schreibman2008 | schreibman2004 | shillingsburg1996 | shillingsburg2006 | siemens2005 | tabbi2007 | torres2008 | torres2010 | torres2012a | torres2012b | torres2013 | torresandportela2012 | torres2014 | vanhulle2011 | vanhoutte2004 | werner1999	1176	"Piersma, Hinke | Tames, Ismee | Buitinck, Lars | van Doornik, Johan | Marx, Maarten"	2014	War in Parliament: What a Digital Approach Can Add to the Study of Parliamentary History	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"With the digitization of the parliamentary proceedings (Handelingen der Staten Generaal), the structuring of this body of data, and the development of an advanced search engine, we can apply new methods of historical research. This contributes to a further promotion of the sophisticated use of quantitative data to enhance qualitative historical research. This article focuses on the Boerenpartij(Farmersâ€™ Party), the first political party from the far right that entered Dutch parliament after the Second World War (WWII). The Boerenpartij is remembered as being stigmatized by the traditional political parties as wrong ( fout ), as National Socialism and its supporters were dubbed in the Netherlands. However, no systematic research has been conducted on the questions: in what way, how frequently and for what purpose these connections with the wrong past were made. With the available digitized data and the retrieval techniques offered by computer scientists it is now possible to answer these questions."	bron2012 | handelingen1965 | nooij1969 | odijk2012 | svensson2012 | tames2013 | vandonselaar1991 | venderheiden2010 | vossen2005 | vossen2012	1177	"Shell, Erik"	2014	"A review of Brett D.

It proposes an alternative digital humanities approach to the study of world literature, advocating new methods of close comparative reading rather than the mode of distant reading endorsed by Franco Moretti and Alan Liu . Specifically, the research method proposed here is focused on a close reading of the novel The Secret Scripture (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with comparative reference to Pat Barkerâ€™s well-known war novel Regeneration (1997). Through the development and implementation of a digital humanities research method which facilitates new forms of digital literary analysis, we demonstrate that close reading and digital humanities can too be practicing partners in a way that serves to advance work in both the fields of world literature and digital literary studies."	barry2008 | cameron2009 | clement2008 | damrosch2003a | damrosch2003b | damrosch2003c | damrosch2009 | hemmings2005 | hanks2008 | heuser2011 | howell2010 | leach2008 | liu2012 | moretti2005 | moretti2000 | ramsay2008 | ramsay2003 | roberts2012 | robson2008 | shen2008 | wilkens2012 | winslow2012	1179	"Rockwell, Geoffrey | Day, Shawn | Yu, Joyce | Engel, Maureen"	2014	Burying Dead Projects: Depositing the Globalization Compendium	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"In the digital humanities we specialize in imagining and launching digital projects, but we rarely consider how to end them. In this paper we propose to discuss the ends of a particular digital project as a case study for the planning of ending. The project we focus on is the Globalization and Autonomy Online Compendium that was developed as a digital outcome of the Globalization and Autonomy project. Specifically, this paper will: Survey the general issues at stake when planning for the end of a digital project; Provide some background on the project and the Compendium; Discuss the underlying technologies that had to be dealt with; Address the specific problem of ending and how we prepared this project for archival deposit; And conclude by talking about some other ends that are really beginnings."	ukdataarchive2011 | alemneh2002 | beagrie2009 | brown2009 | coleman2008 | conway2010 | cooper2004 | diorio2010 | hedstrom1998 | kretzschmar2010 | nrdac2001 | kirschenbaum2009 | opendoar | rockwell2011 | sherpa2012 | vandeneyden2010	1180	"Dowling, David"	2014	Escaping the Shallows: Deep Readingâ€™s Revival in the Digital Age	Digital Humanities Quarterly	"Among the many reactions against the digital revolution is a humanitarian movement toward long form online reading in collective and social networks. This movement â€” visible in online book clubs such as Infinite Summer and 1book140, websites such as longreads.com, and the trend of blogs-to-books publication â€” is a reaction against superficial increasingly brief headline-driven Internet news. Called to action by the threat of what critic Jessica Helfand has diagnosed as digital cultureâ€™s narrative depravation, the deep reading revival has reclaimed narrative and returned it to the populace, transforming reading into an act of mass collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Despite studies corroborating Nicholas Carrâ€™s claim in The Shallows (2011) that the distractions of the digital environment are anathema to immersive linear deep reading, online culture has actually enhanced and accelerated the appreciation of longer richer works through its support of radial reading as described by Jerome McGann. This essay argues that while the intrinsically distracting virtual geography of the Internet has threatened to diminish the role of textured narrative in our intellectual and social lives, the Web has ironically provided the media for the most salient movements in support of the deep reading it threatens to obliterate."	bauerlein2008 | baron2013 | boynton2013 | briggs2011 | brown2012 | star | caneandalves2001 | carreiro2010 | carr2011 | chabrisandsimons2009 | chee2010 | collins2010 | collins2013 | coscarelli2009 | dediu2012 | destefanoandlefevre2007 | dowling2010 | dowling2011 | dretzin2010 | gillmor2006 | greenfield2009 | griswoldetal2005 | habermas1974 | harkaway2012 | helfand2001 | howe2012 | howe2009 | isidore2012 | infinitesummer2009 | jenkins2010 | jenkins2006 | jenkins2013 | jeongandfishbein2007 | johnson2006 | kohut2012 | konstantinou2012 | kovarik2011 | peters2012 | lanier2010 | lessig2008 | levy2007 | librarything2013 | liu2005 | longform2011 | malone2012 | many1996 | mcluhan1965 | mcgann1991 | mcgann2001 | miller2007 | moody2012 | nakamura2012 | facebook2012 | nielsen2006 | nielsen2008 | okker2003 | ophiretal2009 | papacharissi2009 | pedersen2009 | perlmutteranddowling2012 | phamandsarno2010 | redman1997 | shirky2009 | silver2012 | soffer2012 | sontag2007 | sonvilla-weiss2010 | staley2003 | striphas2009 | npr2012 | turkle2011 | turner2001 | walther2008 | harlequin2014 | outlander2014	1
