        <p>The source data for DHQ is encoded in XML following the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org">TEI Guidelines</a>. You can see the XML source for any article by clicking on the "XML" link at the top of the article. You can also download data derived from DHQ articles as follows: </p>
      	<ul>
      		<li>The entire corpus of DHQ articles in XML, as a <a href="../data/dhq-xml.zip">zip file</a>. </li>
      		<li>Metadata and abstracts for all DHQ articles as <a>XML</a>, <a href="">JSON</a>, or <a>TSV</a></li>
      	</ul>
      	<p>These files are updated on a quarterly basis, when a new issue is published. Articles from the public preview are included, but as those appear on a rolling basis, some preview articles may be omitted if they were not yet published at the time the archive was generated.</p></div>
<div>		<h2 id="usage">Usage of DHQ Data</h2>
        
        <p>By default, DHQ publishes all content under a CC-BY-ND license, but authors may also specify a more permissive license (either CC-BY or CC0). Although the default DHQ license precludes derivative works, we welcome proposals for derived works such as visualizations and are happy to give permission for these upon request. Please <a href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">contact the editors</a> with any questions or requests.</p>
