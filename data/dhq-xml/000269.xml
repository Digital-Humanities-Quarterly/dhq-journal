            <dhq:abstract>

                <p>Digital archives change more quickly than traditional ones: they are adaptable
                    and transient. This has advantages and disadvantages; digital archives can
                    disappear from sight almost instantly but they can also be easily safeguarded
                    and restored. Borrowing the critical vocabulary of performance studies, digital
                    archives could thus be understood as <q>repertoires</q> rather than traditional
                    archives. By treating digital archives as repertoires, this article explores
                    different threats and opportunities presented by their volatile nature and makes
                    policy and technical recommendations on how to ensure their relevance and
                    sustainability. </p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p><said>At the moment this archive is only a prototype, but we will soon have a
                        public version available online.</said> I have heard – and pronounced –
                    these words in several occasions in digital humanities conferences and
                    presentations. Everyone seems to be building an archive, but these projects are
                    often archives in progress. And the most established archives also change often:
                    new versions, features and editions are constantly added. When you visit the
                    website of many archives, it is common to find features that are <q>not yet</q>
                    working or to read in the history of the archives about aspects of the archive
                    that were present in previous iterations of the projects. </p>
                <p>It is easy to condemn this situation. Traditional archivists could assert that
                    digital archives are not really built to endure the passage of time and
                    constitute a repository for future historical research. Therefore, the argument
                    goes, digital archives are not really archives. However, comparing digital with
                    non-digital archives obviates many of the specific ways in which digital
                    archives can be relevant and sustainable, two important objectives of every
                    archiving project. There are two complicating factors to an easy comparison with
                    non-digital archives:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>The mutability of digital archives is complex. </item>
                    <item>The lifespan of a digital archive is indeterminate. Any iteration of the
                        archive can disappear quickly, but it can also be reconstructed in ways that
                        are difficult – if not impossible – with brick and mortar archives. </item>
                </list>
                <p>This article proposes to address these complications through the theoretical lens
                    of performance studies, a discipline that has long engaged in the theorization
                    of archives. In performance studies, the opposite of an archive is a repertoire.
                    And though there are fundamental differences between digital archives and
                    embodied performance repertoires, there are also striking similarities between
                    them. Looking at the way performance scholars conceptualize and study
                    repertoires, digital humanists can gain a strategic new vocabulary to describe
                    how digital archives work and, most importantly, think about ways to upkeep and
                    maintain the relevance of archives in the future. Before launching into a
                    performance studies approach, this article will briefly consider how the
                    differences between between digital and traditional archives have been
                    conceptualized earlier. This is a long and complex discussion, but several key
                    issues are constantly highlighted in the conceptualization of digital archives:
                    the possibility of new methodological approaches, the threat of the
                    disappearance of context, the new need for new technical models, the competing
                    claims of access and preservation, and the suitability of the word
                        <q>archive.</q>
                </p>
                <p>Much has been said about the capacity for search-and-retrieve and data mining
                    operations allowed by digital archives. One of the key areas where these
                    techniques are already making great an impact is newspaper archives and the
                    historical research they enable. Newspaper archives are unique because of the
                    periodicity, abundance, and uniformity of their records; thus, they provide us
                    with an excellent case study for the impact of new methodologies for archival
                    research. According to Bob Nicholson, who writes about the impact of digital
                    archives in the study of newspapers, everything has been changed by
                    search-and-retrieve as well as data-mining algorithms which could not have been
                    applied to physical newspaper collections. New technologies are affecting a
                    broad range of questions, whether it is to study the lives of individuals,
                    explore changes in the usage of language, track the development and circulation
                    of ideas, or write the history of a serialized publication: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#nicholson2013">Digital methodologies promise to
                            have a significant impact on multiple areas of historical research. We
                            are potentially on the cusp of a [...] revolution, a ‘digital turn’ in
                            humanities scholarship driven by the creative use of online archives and
                            a willingness to imagine new kinds of research.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#nicholson2013" loc="63"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>Archives dealing with literature, theatre and other arts are usually not as
                    uniform or as extensive as newspaper archives. Nevertheless, different ways of
                    interrogating archives are also changing the ways all kinds of digital archives
                    are conceptualized and used. Another concern often brought up in discussions
                    about digital archives is the disappearance of context. Discussing 19th century
                    newspaper and literature archives, Shafquat Towheed remarks that the context of
                    reading was different in the 19th century and the specificity of reading is
                    difficult to reconstruct from digital collections, since they generally lack
                    annotations and marginalia. Another problems is that items are not bundled
                    together, which makes the practice of browsing through the materials cumbersome: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#towheed2010">Paradoxically, while the
                            digitization of nineteenth-century newspapers means that they have never
                            been more widely available, the very experience of casually browsing
                            through the pages of an essentially disposable publication has become
                            increasingly remote and difficult to reconstruct.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#towheed2010" loc="142"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>Computer scientists are also trying to come to grips with the different
                    conceptual model required by digital archives, as opposed to that of digital
                    libraries or other kinds of collections. Following Stefano Vitali, Nicola Ferro
                    and Ginamaria Silvelo suggest that the most distinctive characteristic of
                    digital archives is that they are held together by an <term>archival
                    bond</term>: there is a specific, homogeneous and often serialized way in which
                    items in a collection are organized and related to one another. Ferro and
                    Silvelo propose a formal model to address these issues, NEsted SeTs for Object
                    hieRarchies (NESTOR) <ptr target="#ferro2013"/>. However, the development of
                    information organization models is still an open question and there are
                    currently no standards to be widely adopted. </p>
                <p>Another challenge of digital archives refers to the competing claims of access
                    and preservation. Should an archive emphasize the widest range of materials
                    possible? Or should it make sure that a smaller collection is properly
                    documented, annotated, and made accessible to non-specialists? Different
                    archives have different philosophies on this matter, but, as Michelle Warren
                    notes, every cultural record, including books, is shaped by this competing
                    claims: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#warren2014">The effort to preserve and the
                            desire for access have both changed the text now recorded. Together,
                            preservation and access make archives malleable and dynamic rather than
                            static.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#warren2014" loc="170"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>Another key concern is the suitability of the word <term>archive</term>. Kenneth
                    M. Price looks at different words that are used in digital humanities work:
                    edition, project, database, archive, and thematic research collection, before
                    suggesting a new potential term: arsenal. When discussing all of these terms, he
                    stresses the importance of the choice of words and also notes the advantages and
                    limitations of all the possible choices. His characterization of digital
                    archives is particularly insightful: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#price2009">In a digital environment, archive
                            has gradually come to mean a purposeful collection of surrogates. As we
                            know, meanings change over time, and archive in a digital context has
                            come to suggest something that blends features of editing and archiving.
                            To meld features of both — to have the care of treatment and annotation
                            of an edition and the inclusiveness of an archive — is one of the
                            tendencies of recent work in electronic editing.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#price2009"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>Whether or not another word becomes more common in the future, archive is the
                    currently the most common term to describe the digital artifacts I have in mind.
                    This is perhaps how most projects address the competing claims of access and
                    preservation. </p>
                <p>The previous overview has shown some of the main concerns and anxieties relating
                    to digital archiving: access and preservation, methodological implications for
                    research, formal computer-science models, the disappearance of context, and the
                    suitability of the word archive.</p>
                <p>In the rest of this article I will use terms prevalent in performance studies –
                    and suggest new concepts – that can help us understand the constraints and
                    possibilities of digital archiving. All of the issues mentioned above can be
                    traced to the dynamic, changing nature of archives. Although this dynamism is
                    often mentioned, I argue that the particular way in which digital archives are
                    dynamic demands further attention. Based on the terminology of theatre studies
                    and my own experiences working with digital archives, I propose two new terms:
                        <term>internal dynamism</term> and <term>external dynamism</term> in order
                    to qualify the ways that digital archives change.</p>
                <p>This article is organized as follows: the first section offers a definition of
                    archives and repertoires from performance studies and explains why digital
                    archives can be studied and managed as repertoires. The second and third part
                    look at the internal and external adaptability of archives. The last two
                    sections offer recommendations on how digital archives can be better managed to
                    ensure sustainability and relevance. For this, the article borrows tropes and
                    techniques from the open-source software development culture. </p>

                <head>The conceptual tools of performance studies</head>
                <p>Having described the complex nature of digital archives, I suggest that
                    performance studies can offer a new way of understanding the connection between
                    archives, memory and knowledge. Performance studies conceptualize archives in
                    two major ways: as a metaphor and as a problematic source of historical
                    knowledge about performance practices. Metaphorically, the archive represents
                    the way in which certain theater makers work. For example, Mike Frangos argues
                    that Samuel Beckett's plays are archival in the sense that they enact, in form
                    as well as in content, the main concerns of archiving: historicity, repetition,
                    memory, and erasure <ptr target="#frangos2012" loc="217"/>. This claim is
                    similar to that of Kenneth M. Price, who argues that the work of Walt Whitman
                    was developed, metaphorically, as a database. Whitman constantly republished
                    Leaves of Grass, rearranging verses drawn from a vast personal repository: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#price2009">his storehouse of poetic lines, in
                            both manuscript and print, was his working database for future
                            compositions</quote>
                        <ptr target="#price2009"/>
                    </cit>.</p>
                <p>The archive can also be a metaphor that stands in for <emph>any</emph> theatre
                    performance. In this sense, theatre is always a living, evolving archive where
                    things are changed as they are stored and retrieved. Marvin Carlson describes
                    theatre as a place where <term>ghosting</term> occurs. By this he means that
                    everything in the theatre has been <q>used before</q>. The same bodies of the
                    actors have interpreted other roles, the same words have been spoken and the
                    same objects have been used to convey other meanings <ptr target="#carlson2003"
                    />. Following the example of theatre studies, every aspect of cultural
                    production – anything and everything in a digital humanities archive – could be
                    understood in terms of archival metaphors and ghosting. As Jones et al. assert: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#jones2009">Arguably, all archiving is
                            performance: records are surrogates that provide a window onto past
                            moments that can never be recreated, and users interact with these
                            records in a performance to reinterpret this past.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#jones2009" loc="166"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>However, a more interesting avenue comes from the second conceptualization of
                    archiving in performance studies, where archives – in a more conventional sense
                    of the word – are seen as the problematic repositories of theatrical items:
                    photographs, booklets, recordings, technical scripts, and interviews. Whether
                    these items are ephemera or documentation records, they are problematic in the
                    sense that they are <emph>not</emph> performances. A film archive will contain
                    the films, and a literary archive will contain manuscripts. But a theatre
                    archive will never contain theatre performances. Theorists of theatrical
                    archiving have thus always dealt with a pressing concern of digital archives:
                    the fact that the items in a collection are not the <q>real</q> things but mere
                    surrogates, data, and traces. Peggy Phelan has famously argued that <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#phelan1993">performance becomes itself through
                        disappearance</quote> and that the records of a performance can never be
                    equivalent to the performance itself: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#phelan1993">Performance's only life is in the
                            present. Performance cannot be saved, recorded, documented, or otherwise
                            participate in the circulation of representations <emph>of</emph>
                            representations: once it does so, it becomes something other than
                            performance. To the degree that performance attempts to enter the
                            economy of reproduction it betrays and lessens the promise of its own
                            ontology.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#phelan1993" loc="146"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>This argument has been contested by Phillip Auslander, who argues that
                    performance and meditaized recordings cannot be distinguished on an ontological
                    basis: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#auslander1999">Mediatized forms like film and
                            video can be shown to have the same ontological characteristic as live
                            performance, and live performance can be used in ways indistinguishable
                            from the uses generally associated with mediatized forms. Therefore,
                            ontological analysis does not provide a basis for privileging live
                            performance as an oppositional discourse.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#auslander1999" loc="184"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>In her 2010 book on Cyborg Performance, Jennifer Parker-Starbuck historicizes
                    this controversy and labels it a <quote rend="inline" source="#parker-starbuck2011">dated</quote>
                    disagreement, suggesting that history has sided with Auslander and confessing to
                    a <quote rend="inline" source="#parker-starbuck2011">tacit acceptance of Auslander's
                        argument</quote> that the live is already mediatized <cit>

                            moment of globalized technology</quote>

                    </cit>. Nevertheless, the argument brought forth by Phelan still stands and
                    should still be relevant to digital archivists. Even if the <q>mediatized</q> is
                    now irremediably part of the <q>live</q>, there is still an ontological
                    difference between a live performance and a record of that performance. This
                    difference might not grant a political superiority to one of them (as Phelan
                    expected), but it should still inform the efforts of digital archivists. It is
                    important for us to recognize the differences between the digital surrogates in
                    an archive and the original sources. This necessarily calls for specific
                    practices of contextualization, such as explaining how the records were made and
                    what gaps are present in a documentation project. </p>

                <p>The theatrical archive is also problematic because it stands in opposition to
                    another mode of transmission through time and space, the repertoire. The
                    repertoire is an archive of the body and of oral knowledge. The differences
                    betweens both modes of transmission have been thoroughly explored by Diana
                    Taylor in the landmark <title rend="italic">The Archive and the
                        Repertoire</title>. Consider, for example, the way in which she describes
                    archival memory: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#taylor2003">Archival memory works across
                            distance, over time and space […] what changes over time is the value,
                            meaning or relevance of the archive. Insofar as it constitutes materials
                            that seem to endure, the archive exceeds the live.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#taylor2003" loc="19"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>This kind of memory is set in opposition to the one enabled by the repertoire: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#taylor2003">The repertoire, on the other hand,
                            enacts embodied memory: performances, gestures, orality, movement,
                            dance, singing - in short, all those acts often thought of as ephemeral,
                            non-reproducible knowledge. The repertoire requires presence; people
                            participate in the production and reproduction of knowledge by <q>being
                                there</q>, being a part of the transmission [...] The repertoire
                            both keeps and transforms choreographies of meaning.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#taylor2003" loc="20"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>In terms of what they hold – materials that are meant to endure distance in time
                    and space – digital archives are no different from conventional ones. However,
                    as Jones et al. notice, code-based archiving does require interaction and the
                    presence of the users: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#jones2009">Digital records are inherently
                            performative, only coming into existence when the correct code executes
                            the data to render a meaningful output.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#jones2009" loc="170"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>However, despite the performative aspect of the computer code they are built
                    upon, digital archives don't embody ephemeral knowledge that requires
                    co-presence. They require interaction but not the embodied co-presence of
                    producers and consumers of meaning. Digital archives do behave as repertoires in
                    that they are constantly evolving and they also keep and transform <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#taylor2003">choreographies of meaning</quote>, in Taylor's
                    evocative phrasing. This article suggests that there are two ways in which this
                    similarity with repertoires is manifested: constant change that is driven by
                    improvisation and the possibility of embedding the items of the repertoire in
                    entirely new settings. </p>
                <p>In what follows I suggest that the first of these characteristics is equivalent
                    to the <q>continuous beta</q> status of many digital archives; and the second,
                    to the potential to embed archival content in new settings through iframes and
                        APIs.<note>An iframe is an HTML element that allows a website to be embedded
                        in another one. An API is a an application program interface, a set of
                        protocols that allow a program or web service to communicate with other
                        programs or services.</note> These characteristics correspond to two kinds
                    of dynamism, which I propose to call <term>internal</term> and
                        <term>external</term>. Internal dynamism is the capacity of a repertoire or
                    digital archive to change constantly, as result of interactions, changes in the
                    people working on it, and the conditions affecting audiences and funding. The
                    external dynamism refers to the fact that the same material can be presented in
                    a variety of settings. For example, the same performance could be presented as a
                    ritual and as an international entertainment in different stages, as it happens
                    with some Balinese dance performances. In the case of a digital archive, the
                    same content could be presented on its website, or, if the encoded XML is
                    downloaded or served by an API, under a different interface. I use the term
                        <term>dynamism</term> in the following sections, but this term could also be
                    considered as <term>instability</term> or <term>adaptability</term>, depending
                    on whether we want to emphasize the positive or the negative aspects of this
                    constant change. Dynamism is not necessarily more neutral, but it is a common
                    term and I will use it to stress both the positive and negative aspects of this
                    propensity to change. </p>

                <p>Like performance repertoires, digital archives are constantly in flux. In the
                    case of performances, they often change because of generational relief, changes
                    in sociocultural conditions and in the economic forces behind sponsorship and
                    patronage <ptr target="#hughes-freeland2008"/>. For example, Balinese dances
                    used to be primarily ritual affairs, but the dance has been modified by the
                    influx of foreign artists and tourists. The <foreign xml:lang="in"
                        >kecak</foreign> dance, now undeniably part of the repertoire learned by
                    dancers and presented to local and foreign audiences, was partially developed by
                    German visual artist Walter Spies <ptr target="#seputtat2012"/>. In digital
                    archives, we can identify the following reasons for constant change:</p>

                        facilitate changing design decisions. Due to what Lev Manovich terms
                            <term>modularity</term>, making design decisions is sometimes relatively
                        straightforward <ptr target="#manovich2001"/>.<note>Modularity refers to the
                            capacity of independent elements (layers, programming objects, etc.) to
                            be combined into new media objects. Each elements can be independently
                            modified and reused.</note> The use of semantic styling techniques (such
                        as SASS) for web design allows simple changes to be instantly applied to the
                        entire website.<note> SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets.
                            This is a reusable, hierarchical and customizable way of defining CSS
                            (Cascading Style Sheets) that allow for design features to be easily
                            implemented across an entire website. See <ref

                        The look and feel can be constantly changed and updated and small
                        improvements can be constantly added, or bugs fixed. However, due to the
                        same modularity, sometimes details that would seem insignificant are indeed
                        very difficult to correct and this can send the archives crashing. For
                        example, changing the font and color and visual scheme of the entire website
                        is surprisingly easy. However, as we found out working on the Asian
                        Shakespeare Intercultural Archive (A|S|IA), ensuring a consistent
                        integration of buttons and labels across different language scripts, such as
                        Korean and Chinese, is a painstaking process.<note>The Asian Shakespeare

                        available. For example, a funding body might offer a grant to develop an
                        educational platform for an archive. Or, in order to justify a new round of
                        funding, teams also propose fundamental changes to the design, scope, or
                        conceptualization of an archive. Funding also means that archives are only
                        kept for a limited time. Few archives are funded for an indeterminate amount
                        of time, and often archival projects are dated, constrained to the duration
                        of a grant. </item>

                    <item><hi rend="bold">Practice-based approaches.</hi> People are constantly
                        experimenting, playing with and hacking archives. As Michelle Warren notes,
                        digital archives are often developed through hacking, or playful
                        experimentation <ptr target="#warren2014" loc="170"/>. This cannot be done
                        with conventional archives. </item>
                    <item><hi rend="bold">Changes in technical needs and platforms.</hi> This is
                        often referred to as <term>the treadmill effect</term>, where you need to
                        run just to stay in place. In a 2004 book chapter on design and usability,
                        Matthew Kirschenbaum predicted that Flash would take over many aspects of
                        web design, making websites more dynamic and interactive <ptr
                            target="#kirschenbaum2004" loc="533"/>. The irony is that he was right,
                        but his prediction is now obsolete, only a decade later. Flash dramatically
                        altered the content of the web but many projects are currently moving out of
                        Flash and into JavaScript since Flash is heavy, does not scale well, and is
                        difficult to adapt to responsive environments.<note><term>Responsive</term>
                            here refers to the practice of creating a single website that can be
                            adapted to different screen resolutions through a grid system, as
                            opposed to the previous practice of redirecting the user to different
                            websites based on their screen resolution.</note> This is just an
                        example of the rapid technological change that archival projects need to
                        cope with. </item>
                    <item><hi rend="bold">User feedback.</hi> It is easier to collect information on
                        how and why people are using the archive and do this in real time. Archival
                        teams can easily find out patterns of usage or collect information that can
                        inform design decisions. </item>
                </list>
                <p>Brick and mortar archives are also in flux, but in a different way and at a
                    slower pace. A radical change would override or erase previous iterations of a
                    traditional archive. There is also less experimentation and <q>hacking</q> in
                    the development of traditional archives and the disappearance of traditional
                    archives can be more definite than that of digital ones. A digital archive can
                    be reconstructed, if it is properly documented (more about this later, in the
                    recommendations). A brick and mortar archive, by contrast, often disappears in
                    dramatic ways. A tragic example of this was the destruction of the Cologne city
                    archives, the result of a structural collapse where two people lost their lives
                    in March 3, 2009 <ptr target="#curry2009"/>. It is estimated that 90% of the
                    municipal archives of the City of Cologne, which date back to the middle ages,
                    were destroyed by a collapse that was likely caused by the construction of a new
                    subway station in the neighborhood. And, as a counter example, we can find the
                    digital data stored in the hard drives destroyed by another tragic event, the
                    9/11 attacks. As Matthew Kirschenbaum notes, a German firm was able to restore
                    the data from the ruins of the collapsed buildings <ptr
                        target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="xii"/>. </p>
                <p>When traditional archives disappear, all is lost. This is also often the case for
                    digital archives. However, in some cases, the archives merely become
                    inaccessible or, in Tim Maly’s term, they become <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#maly2013">dark archives.</quote> A dark archive is a collection
                    of materials that exists but is unavailable for general access <ptr
                        target="#maly2013"/>. Crucially, though, digital archives can move in and
                    out of this darkness, they can be kept alive and represented. </p>

                <head>External dynamism</head>
                <p>The previous section detailed the internal dynamism of archives, but we can also
                    consider archives' potential for <q>external</q> change. Digital archives can be
                    embedded in a different environment. This is almost impossible to do with a
                    brick and mortar archive. But sections, or the entirety of an archive, can be
                    reconstructed in an entirely different situation. </p>
                <p>An item from a repertoire can easily be re-purposed for a different setting.
                    British director Peter Brook, for instance, recounts an instance where the same
                    performance of <foreign xml:lang="ar">ta'ziyah</foreign> in Iran took on
                    completely different meanings, depending on whether it was performed at a
                    village or at an international festival venue <ptr target="#brook1968"
                        loc="16–18"/>. In digital archives, this capacity for the same content to be
                    presented in different contexts is exacerbated by the quality of new media that
                    Lev Manovich identifies as transcoding. This means that media can be
                    transformed, converted, remixed, and inserted into other contexts <ptr
                        target="#manovich2001" loc="45–47"/>.</p>
                <p>Following the properties of new media, digital archives can be reinserted,
                    manipulated, and changed according to interactions with the users. There are two
                    ways in which this external dynamism is presented:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item><hi rend="bold">Interactivity.</hi> A digital archive can react to the
                        user in extremely dynamic ways. Depending on how the archive is created, a
                        user can effectively create her own sub-selection of archive materials. For
                        example, the A|S|I|A website allows users to bookmark portions of any video
                        and create their own annotated collection of video clips. </item>
                    <item><hi rend="bold">Extensibility.</hi> Many archives also allow users to
                        reuse the contents of the archive in another setting. The Perseus Digital
                        Library, for instance, allows users to download XML encoded version of all
                        its documents.<note>

                        archives, following YouTube, allow users to embed items from their
                        collections in other websites. In the Contemporary Wayang Archive (CWA), we
                        are developing a function to allow exactly this. Users will be able to
                        bookmark any section of any of the videos and then embed this (via an
                        iframe) into any other website.<note>A version of this is already available
                            on my online dissertation website, <ref
                                target="http://www.wayangkontemporer.com"
                                >http://www.wayangkontemporer.com</ref>. This website includes video
                            clips that are taken directly from the CWA archive.</note> Along the
                        same lines, APIs could easily be developed to allow users to transform and
                        re-purpose any aspect of the collection in ways not foreseen by the creators
                        of the archive. The Indonesian Cultural Archive Network (JABN – Jaringan
                        Arsip Budaya Nusantara) launches annual calls for institutions and archives
                        to re-utilize the materials of the five archives that constitute the
                        network. For example, people have used the digital texts as parts of live
                            performances.<note>An Indonesian language version of this is available

                <p>So far, this article has explored how the conceptualization of archives in
                    performance studies can help theorize issues that arise from digital archiving.
                    Two new concepts, internal and external dynamism, have also been proposed to
                    offer a more granular vocabulary to describe transience in digital archives. The
                    next two sections look at the ways that practices from open source communities
                    can help maintain the relevance and sustainability of digital archives. Based on
                    the characteristics of digital archives outlined here, I have two concrete
                    recommendations to make on how to ensure the continuity of archives, harnessing
                    and curving their extremely unstable nature: aiming for well documented open
                    source development, and implementing version control systems. </p>
                <div>
                    <head>Recommendation 1: Aim for (future) well documented, open source
                        development. </head>
                    <p>In the film <title rend="italic">Samsara</title> (2011, dir. Pan Nalin), a
                        character is puzzled by the question <q>how do you prevent a drop of water from drying
                            up?</q> The answer, learned after long travails, is easy, beautiful,
                        and difficultly counter-intuitive: <q>By throwing it into the sea.</q> Although
                        there are several problems to the applicability of this philosophy to
                        digital archiving, it does seem that opening up the source code and sharing
                        the collection is the best way to ensure two things: the archives'
                        continuity in many different platforms and the possibility of
                            <q>reconstructing</q> the archives later, in other platforms. The LOCKSS
                        acronym – Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe – is well known in the computer
                        world <ptr target="#diorio2011" loc="66"/>.<note>See <ref
                                target="http://www.lockss.org/">http://www.lockss.org/</ref>.</note>
                        Ensuring that many places can legally posses copies of the source code will
                        make the code survive. This might seem like a Faustian bargain to some, but
                        openly sharing is the best safeguard against the disappearance of digital
                        archives.</p>
                    <p>The reconstruction of the archive is another matter. As game studies
                        historians will know, poorly document code is one of the main problems of
                        trying to resurrect videogames written in languages no longer used or for
                        platforms and consoles now obsolete. If all the source code is stashed away,
                        there is no way of reconstructing it for later use; it is just trapped in a
                        black box, becoming one of the dark archives mentioned by Taly. In my
                        experience, and through conversations with colleagues, this is a difficult
                        goal to achieve. Several problems stand in the way of ensuring open-source
                        development. </p>

                        they have gone. Files are overwritten or named in abstruse ways so that it
                        is painstaking, if not impossible, to reconstruct a previous iteration of an
                        archive. Version Control Systems (VCS) allow for creating <q>releases</q>
                        where a particular version of the project can be fully reconstructed. This
                        can be done in any VCS, but an obvious choice is git, which is free and
                        often used by the open-source community.<note><ref

                    </p>
                    <p>The advantage of version control is that it is inexpensive to reconstruct any
                        previous iteration in the way that it was working earlier. This has the
                        advantage that other people can learn form it. But also it is a reaction
                        against the problem of constant change. It might be interesting for
                        academic, historical, or pedagogical reasons to look back at the previous
                        version of any given archive. Of course, both recommendations are related.
                        It is easy to use a version control system such as git, which can be used in
                        different platforms, to share open source projects. </p>

                <head>CONCLUSION</head>
                <p>Digital archives are subject to two kinds of adaptability: internal and external.
                    In this they are similar to repertoires, which also change constantly through
                    time and must be adapted to ever-changing circumstances. Performance studies can
                    provide digital humanists with additional vocabulary to explore these
                    characteristics. And the open source community can furnish us with tools and
                    techniques in order to make the most of the repertoire qualities of digital
                    archives. </p>
