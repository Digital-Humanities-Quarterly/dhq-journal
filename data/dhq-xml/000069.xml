            <p>Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual
               scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools
               of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of
               lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of
               a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus
               concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient
               parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical
               linguistics and evolutionary biology.</p>
            <p>The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports
               conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that
               now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. <q>Computation</q> is here
               broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which,
               in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than
               the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and
               other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to
               recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by
               signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on
               the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic
               expression.</p>
            <p>The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the
               digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the
               written word and the emerging field of biohumanities.</p>

               are increasingly pressed into service as instruments of reconstruction and
               forecasting; the contention of the article is that historically — and contrary to
               popular belief — prediction has been as much a part of the knowledge work of the

      <body>

         <p>In an essay published in the <title rend="italic">Blackwell Companion to Digital
               Literary Studies</title>, Stephen Ramsay argues that efforts to legitimate humanities
            computing within the larger discipline of literature have met with resistance because
            well-meaning advocates have tried too hard to brand their work as <q>scientific,</q> a
            word whose positivistic associations conflict with traditional humanistic values of
            ambiguity, open-endedness, and indeterminacy <ptr target="#ramsay2008"/>. If, as Ramsay
            notes, the computer is perceived primarily as an instrument for quantizing, verifying,
            counting, and measuring, then what purpose does it serve in those disciplines committed
            to a view of knowledge that admits of no incorrigible truth somehow insulated from
            subjective interpretation and imaginative intervention <ptr target="#ramsay2008"
               loc="479–482"/>?</p>
         <p>Ramsay's rich and nuanced answer to that question has been formulated across two
            publications, of which <title rend="quotes">Toward an Algorithmic Criticism</title> is
            the earliest.<note>
               <ptr target="#ramsay2008"/>, <ptr target="#ramsay2003"/>. Both essays are part of a
               larger book project that will be published by University of Illinois Press as part of
               its Topics in the Digital Humanities series.</note> Drawing on his experience as both
            a programmer and a scholar, he suggests that the pattern-seeking behavior of the
            literary critic is often amenable to computational modeling. But while Ramsay is
            interested in exposing the algorithmic aspects of literary methods, he concedes that in
            searching for historical antecedents, we may be more successful locating them in the
            cultural and creative practices of antiquity rather than in scholarly and critical
            practices <ptr target="#ramsay2003" loc="170"/>. His insight is born of the fact that a
            text is a dynamic system whose individual units are ripe for rule-governed alteration.
            While these alterations may be greatly facilitated by mechanical means, historically
            they have been performed manually, as in the case of the <q>stochastic</q> aesthetics of
            the <title rend="italic">I Ching</title> or the <q>generative aesthetics</q> of the
            Dadaists and Oulipo <ptr target="#ramsay2003" loc="170"/>. <quote rend="inline"
               source="#ramsay2003">Ironically,</quote> Ramsay writes, <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2003">it is not the methods of the scholar that
                  reveal themselves as <q>computational,</q> but the methods of the gematrist and
                  the soothsayer</quote>
               <ptr target="#ramsay2003" loc="170"/>
            </cit>. Ramsay's emphasis on prophecy is apt, for it allows us to link the divinatory
            offices of the poet and soothsayer with the predictive functions of the computer. It is
            interesting to note in this context that one of the earliest uses to which a commercial
            computer was put was as an engine of prediction: the UNIVersal Automatic Computer
            (UNIVAC), the first digital electronic computer to debut in the United States,
            successfully predicted the outcome of the 1952 Eisenhower-Stevenson presidential
               race.<note>See <ptr target="#ceruzzi2000"/>.</note> The computer’s pedigree in
            symbolic logic, model-based reasoning, and data processing make it a predictive machine
               <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>.</p>
         <p>With these observations in mind, the principal purpose of this essay is to establish an
            ancient lineage for what we might call <term>computational prediction in the
               humanities</term>, a lineage that runs counter to Ramsay's assertions insofar as it
            is distinctly critical or scholarly rather than aesthetic in character. Specifically, I
            argue that within the field of textual scholarship, conjectural criticism (the
            reconstruction of literary texts) can be profitably understood as a sub-domain of
            Ramsay's algorithmic criticism (rule-governed manipulation of literary texts). The essay
            seeks to do the following: <list type="unordered">
               <item>First, it challenges the assumption that <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#ramsay2003">computational processes within the rich tradition of
                     interpretive endeavors [are] usually aligned <emph>more with art than
                        criticism</emph>
                  </quote> (my emphasis) <ptr target="#ramsay2003" loc="167"/>. Although sometimes
                  erroneously considered <q>pre-interpretive,</q>
                  <note>As a response to the widely held belief that textual criticism and
                     bibliography are technical rather than hermeneutic disciplines, Jerome Mcgann
                     has forcefully argued that creating a critical edition is a fundamentally
                     interpretive endeavor. See <ptr target="#mcgann1991"/>.</note> textual
                  scholarship, one of our oldest branches of literary study, is a fundamentally
                  critical rather than artistic endeavor.</item>
               <item>Second, I provide preliminary evidence suggesting not only a formal, but also a
                  genealogical relationship between Mesopotamian prophecy and textual scholarship,
                  one that sanctions a prospective as well as retrospective view of the evolution of
                  a text. Such a proleptic viewpoint has, in fact, already been experimentally
                  adopted in evolutionary biology and historical linguistics, disciplines whose
                  conjectural methods parallel those of textual scholarship (about which see
                  below).</item>
               <item>Third, it offers an alternative theory for why the analogy between science and
                  the digital humanities apparently has so little traction among traditional
                  literary critics. Ramsay's contention is that the tasks at which a computer excels
                  are frequently judged, rightly or wrongly, to be more compatible with the
                  certitude of hard knowledge than the incertitude of soft knowledge. An equally
                  compelling (and complementary) reason is that the computer is too often seen
                  exclusively as a device for processing numbers rather than manipulating text. But
                  if the computer can count numbers like a mathematician, it can also play with
                  letters in ways, as we shall see, that poets and textual scholars alike would
                  recognize.</item>
               <item>Fourth, the essay reconfigures the relationship between humanities computing
                  and science by exploring the common denominator of literacy rather than numeracy.
                  In other words, the essay brings into focus those scientific disciplines that
                  manipulate a symbol system that semiotically — <emph>operationally</emph>, we
                  might say — more closely resembles letters than numbers, namely linguistics and
                  bioinformatics. The essay further posits that when viewed historically, the
                  relationship among the three disciplines isn't unidirectional, but rather deeply
                  reciprocal. There is compelling circumstantial evidence that the conjectural
                  methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology were largely derived
                  from those of textual criticism in the nineteenth century. Subsequently, however,
                  linguistics and biology were (and to some extent remain) more active in exploiting
                  the computer's ability to execute algorithms on strings as a way to predict,
                  model, and analyze evolutionary change — or in other words to automate the methods
                  first expounded by textual critics more than a century earlier.</item>
            </list>
         </p>
         <p>Broadly conceived, then, this essay re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual
            scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools of
            reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost
            readings in classical texts and the computational modeling of the evolution of a
            literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus
            concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction (as well as
            retrodiction).</p>
         <p>In the first section of the essay I attempt to define conjecture, often viewed in the
            humanities as a misguided and anti-methodical pursuit, and rationalize it as a form of
            subjunctive knowledge, knowledge about what might have been or could be or almost was.
            The object of conjecture is notional rather than empirical; possible rather than
            demonstrable; counterfactual rather than real. This subjunctive mode, I contend, is not
            antithetical to the humanities, but central to it. Whether it is a student of the
            ancient Near East deciphering a fragmented cuneiform tablet or a musician speculatively
            completing Bach's unfinished final fugue or a literary scholar using advanced 3D
            computer modeling to virtually restore a badly damaged manuscript, the impulse in each
            instance — vital and paradoxical — is to go beyond purely documentary states of
            objects.</p>
         <p>The essay develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports
            conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the material model of textuality that now
            predominates. <term>Computation</term> is here broadly understood to mean the systematic
            manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the case of language, entails
            the grammatical processing of strings<note>By <q>string,</q> I mean a sequence of
               non-numeric symbols, such as letters. The term, which derives from computer science,
               is explained below.</note> rather than the mathematical calculation of numbers to
            create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and other word games. The essay thus proposes that
            a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting
            to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language
            collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to
            algorithmic expression and simulation.</p>
         <p>In an effort to overcome common objections to analogies between the humanities and
               sciences,<note>As discussed earlier, Ramsay identifies and analyzes these objections
               in <ptr target="#ramsay2003"/> and <ptr target="#ramsay2008"/>, <emph>passim</emph>.
            </note> I offer a reflection — part historical, part formal or theoretical — on the
            parallel importance of the tree paradigm in evolutionary biology, textual criticism, and
            historical linguistics. By <term>tree paradigm</term>, I mean the grouping of
            manuscripts, languages, or genomes into families and showing how they relate to one
            another in genealogical terms, and using these relationships to conjecture about lost
            ancestors or archetypes. My themes are the interdependence and correspondence of tree
            methods (and their associated algorithms) in three diverse knowledge domains. From tree
            structures, I turn to a form of causal transmission known as a transformation series, a
            recognized phenomenon in the three disciplines surveyed. Because of their similarity to
            a genre of word puzzle known as doublets, transformation series allow us to revisit the
            connection between wordplay and divination established earlier in the argument.</p>

         <div>
            <head>A Rationale for Conjecture</head>
            <p>In textual scholarship, conjecture is the proposal of a reading not found in any
               extant witness to the text. It is predicated on the idea that words are always signs
               of other words; the received text also harbors the once and future text. When A. E.
               Housman alters a line from Catullus's <title rend="italic">Marriage of Peleus and
                  Thetis</title> (c. 62-54 BCE) so that it reads "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Emathiae
                  tutamen, Opis carissime nato</foreign>," instead of "<foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >Emathiae tutamen opis, carissime nato</foreign>," he is practicing the art of
                  conjecture.<note>While this is apparently a genuine conjecture of Housman's, I am
                  relying on the dramatic exposition of it in <ptr target="#stoppard1997" loc="37–8"
                  />.</note> Housman's small orthographic tweaks produce sizable semantic shifts: by
               relocating a comma and capitalizing <q>Opis</q> so that it is
               understood not as the Latin term for <q>power,</q> but as the
               genitive of <q>Ops,</q> the mother of Jupiter in Roman mythology, he
               substantially alters the meaning of the line: <q>Peleus, most dear to his son, is the protector of the power of Emathia,</q>
               becomes <quote rend="inline" source="#housman1921">Peleus, protector of Emathia, most dear to
                  the son of Ops [Jupiter].</quote> The emendation, as the fictional Housman
               explains in Tom Stoppard's <title rend="italic">The Invention of Love</title>,
               restores sense to nonsense by ridding the language of anachronism: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#stoppard1997">How can Peleus be <foreign
                        xml:lang="grc">carrisme nato</foreign>, most dear to his son, when his son
                     has not yet been born?</quote>
                  <ptr target="#stoppard1997" loc="37"/>
               </cit>.</p>
            <p>Expressed in grammatical terms, conjecture operates in the subjunctive and
               conditional moods.<note>Pages 4-5 intermittently incorporate prose I originally
                  drafted for an essay co-authored with Matthew Kirschenbaum in 2000 entitled <title
                     rend="quotes">Outside the Archive,</title> portions of which were delivered at
                  the Bibliography and the Internet panel, MLA Convention, Marriott Hotel,
                  Washington D. C., 29 Dec. 2000. Several of the themes of this essay intersect with
                  those explored in the earlier paper, which I have cited where appropriate. For a
                  published version of these remarks, see <ptr target="#kraus2002"/>.</note> Because
               its range of motion extends beyond the pale of the empirical, its vocabulary is
               replete with <emph>could</emph>s, <emph>might</emph>s, <emph>may</emph>s, and
                  <emph>if</emph>s. Such a vocabulary reflects not caution — on the contrary,
               conjecture is a radical, audacious editorial style — but rather a refusal to settle
               for attested states of texts. In this it is opposed to the current wave of archival
               models of editing, which, in their rejection of speculative and inferential readings,
               opt for representation in the indicative mood.</p>
            <p>Conjecture has at various moments in history held a place of honor in our repertory
               of editorial paradigms. Taken collectively, for example, Housman’s critical writings
               offer a magnificent apologia of <term>divinatio</term>, as conjecture is still
               sometimes called. The strength of conviction, the peremptory eloquence, the sheer
               depth and breadth of knowledge contained in those pages brook no protests about the
               bugbear of intentionalist editing or the death of the author. But at the same time,
               conjecture is a foundling, strangely lacking a well-defined history, theory,
               methodology. Discussion of it, which more often than not occurs incidentally, tends
               to take place not on an expository or historical plane, but on a homiletic or poetic
               one. Thus, for example, amid all his scientific discourse on compounded variational
               formulas, ancestral groups, successive derivation, and other arcane topics pertaining
               to recension, W. W. Greg falls almost quiet when he turns to the subject of
               conjecture: <q>the fine flower</q> of textual criticism he calls it, choosing
               metaphor over definition <ptr target="#greg1924" loc="217"/>. Treatments of
               conjecture characterized more by brevity than rigor are the norm: the process is
               hazily glossed metaphorically or else grounded in the successful critic’s abstract
               qualities of mind, which do not always lend themselves to analysis (e.g., intuition,
               judgment, confidence, insight, authority, charisma). For these reasons, conjecture
               has customarily been seen as either a practitioner’s art, the conspicuous absence of
               a meta-literature a symptom of the bottom-up approach it tends to favor, or a
               prophet’s.</p>
            <p>The scholarly language can at times suggest the intervention of a supernatural agent.
               The classicist Robin Nisbet speaks of a <q>Muse of Textual Conjecture,</q> whom he
               playfully christens, appropriately enough, <name>Eustochia</name>.<note>Eustochia:
                     <q>a happy conjecture</q>; <ptr target="#nisbet1991"/>
               </note> As one response to the exquisitely difficult recovery mission that conjecture
               sets for its critics, Eustochia might be perceived as a sad contrivance to a
               misguided endeavor; a <emph>deus ex machina</emph> called in to artificially resolve
               all textual difficulties. But consider, for a moment, the bleak alternative: a world
               in which conjectural knowledge never was or could be an article of faith. Samuel
               Johnson’s plaintive verdict that conjecture <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#johnson1765">demands more than humanity
                     possesses</quote>
                  <ptr target="#johnson1765" loc="para. 105"/>
               </cit> gives our imaginations something to work with; now envision that same
               despondency on a collective rather than individual scale. Instead of Erasmus proudly
               proclaiming the reconstruction of ancient texts the noblest task of all, we’d have
               only Stoppard’s Housman making a Faustian pact, born of despair, to suffer the fate
               of Sisyphus if only each time the stone rolled back he were given another fragment of
               Aeschylus <ptr target="#stoppard1997"/>.</p>
            <p>What does this general silence indicate about conjecture, its status in textual
               criticism, and its practice? E. J. Kenney’s position (which he officially co-opts
               from the nineteenth-century critic Boeckh, but which nevertheless seems to be
               prevalent among Classical editors) that the solution to the more <q>difficult
                  cases</q> of conjecture <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#kenney1974">comes in a flash or not at all</quote>
                  <ptr target="#kenney1974" loc="147"/>
               </cit> is tantalizing, but the idea of a lucid eureka moment — eerily similar to the
               romantic notion of inspired creativity (<cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#abrams1953">At its inception, a [romantic] poem is
                     an involuntary and unanticipated donnée</quote>
                  <ptr target="#abrams1953" loc="24"/>
               </cit>) — shouldn’t curtail discussion; it should open the floodgates. And because
               the archival model holds conjecture in abeyance, an entire new generation of young
               textual critics who have cut their critical teeth on documentary precepts are all but
               forbidden at the outset to engage in it. For this reason alone conjectural criticism
               should inspire inquiry, but also precisely because it pretends to elude historical,
               cognitive, or technical understanding.</p>
            <p>Would it be possible for conjecture to assume again a position of prominence in
               editorial theory? It would take a concerted inquiry into history, method, and theory.
               We would need to seriously engage the psychology of intuition, the AI and cognitive
               literature of inference, and the history of conjecture as divinatory art and
               scientific inquiry. We would need to keep apace with advancements in historical
               linguistics and evolutionary biology (two fields whose relevance to textual criticism
               is vastly under-appreciated) and the burgeoning psycholinguistic literature of
               reading. Indeed, we would reap many rewards from outreach to the linguistic
               community. We would need to dispel the myth that conjecture is a riddle wrapped in a
               mystery inside an enigma. A curriculum for conjecture would give us better insight
               into the method underlying the prediction — or retrodiction — of ancient readings of
               texts. Not least, we would need to work decisively to bring conjectural criticism
               into the 21st century. Because it has traditionally been described as a balm to help
               heal a maimed or corrupted text, conjecture is in desperate need of a facelift; the
               washed-up pathological metaphors long ago ceased to strike a chord in editorial
               theory.</p>
            <p>So what would an alternate language of conjecture sound like?</p>
            <p>We might, for starters, imagine conjecture as a knowledge toolkit designed to perform
                  <q>what if</q> analyses across a range of texts. In this view, the text is a
               semiotic system whose discrete units of information can be artfully manipulated into
               alternate configurations that may represent past or future states. Of course the
               computing metaphors alone are not enough; they must be balanced by, among other
               things, an appreciation of the imponderable and distinctly human qualities that
               contribute to conjectural knowledge. But formalized and integrated into a curriculum,
               the various suggestions outlined here have the potential to give conjecture a new
               lease on life and incumbent editorial practices — much too conservative for a new
               generation of textual critics — a run for their money.</p>

            <head>A Formal Definition and Methodological Overview</head>
            <p>What do I mean by conjecture, then? Giovanni Manetti's pithy definition — <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#manetti1993">inference to the imperceptible</quote> — is good insofar
               as it captures the cognitive leap (<q>inference</q>) from the known to the unknown.<note>
                  <ptr target="#manetti1993" loc="117"/> To the extent that it implies specifically
                  human inference, <q>cognitive</q> is a misleading word choice. The inferential
                  leap may be either biological or artificial (with <q>artificial</q> understood as
                     <q>computational,</q>
                  <q>mechanical</q> or <q>automated</q>).</note> But it fails to denote the temporal
               dimension of conjecture so essential to a field like textual criticism, which deals
               with copies of texts that are produced in succession and ordered in time. Moreover,
                  <term>inference</term> is not a monolithic category but can be further subdivided
               into inductive inference, deductive inference, abductive, intuitive, probabilistic,
               logical, etc. Manetti's definition thus needs to be massaged into something more
               apropos to textual scholarship. For the purposes of this essay, I'll define it as
               follows: conjecture is <emph>allographic inference to past or future values of the
                  sign</emph>. <term>Allographic</term> is a semiotic term given currency by the
               analytic philosopher Nelson Goodman in his seminal <title rend="italic">Languages of
                  Art</title> and refers to those media that resolve into discrete, abstract units
               of information — into what might be more loosely called <term>digital units</term> —
               that can be systematically copied, transmitted, added to, subtracted from,
               transposed, substituted, and otherwise manipulated. Conjecture as it is understood in
               this work is indifferent as to whether the mode of allographic manipulation is
               manual, cognitive, or mechanical. Allographic contrasts with autographic, or
               continuous, media. Examples of the former include musical scores, alphabetic script,
               pixels, and numerical notation; examples of the latter, paintings, drawings, and
               engravings. Painter and theorist Julian Bell summarizes Goodman like this: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#bell1999">Pictures differ from other sign systems,
                     such as writing, by being continuities in which every mark is interdependent,
                     rather than operating through a combination of independent markers like the
                     alphabet. (In computational terminology, they are <q>analog</q> rather than
                        <q>digital</q> representations.)</quote>
                  <ptr target="#bell1999" loc="228"/>
               </cit>. Words are conventionally allographic, images autographic, though much
               important work in recent years has contested the validity of these distinctions and
               examined borderline cases, such as pattern poetry. Indeed, the last two decades of
               textual criticism have witnessed a wealth of scholarship promoting the text's
               bibliographic or iconic codes. Despite the virtues of such visual approaches to
               textuality (and there are many), conjectural criticism has been hamstrung by their
               success. The general argument in this essay is that conjecture flourishes in an
               allographic environment, not an autographic one. By <q>allographic inference,</q>
               then, I mean <emph>the considered manipulation or processing of digital signs with
                  the goal of either recovering a prior configuration or predicting a future or
                  potential one</emph>.</p>
            <p>If we set aside for a moment the original terms of my definition (<term>allographic
                  inference</term>) and focus instead on the terms used to gloss them (<term>digital
                  processing</term>), then one of the salient points to emerge is that conjecture as
               formalized in these pages is semiotic in the first instance and computational in the
               second. Conjecture, that is to say, involves digital signal processing or, to use the
               more general-purpose term, <term>computation</term>.<note>Not all computers, however,
                  are digital. The slide rule, for example, is a manually operated analog computer,
                  whereas the abacus is digital. The electronic analog computer, originally
                  developed for military, meteorological, and industrial applications, represents
                  information in voltages that vary continuously rather than discretely. Mechanical
                  analog machines known as differential analyzers were used to solve equations well
                  into the 1960s before being superceded by the von Neumann stored program model. It
                  was the speed, versatility, and (especially) accuracy of digital computers that
                  enabled them to eventually overtake their analog predecessors. </note> Moreover,
               just as digitality, as a concept, extends beyond the boxy electronic machines that
               sit on our desktops, so too does computation. As David Alan Grier reminds us in
                  <title rend="italic">When Computers Were Human</title>, homo sapiens has been
               computing on clay tablets, papyrus, parchment, and paper for millennia <ptr
                  target="#grier2005"/>. A <term>computer</term> is simply someone or something that
               systematically manipulates discrete, abstract symbols. As conventionally understood,
               those symbols are numbers, and the manipulations performed on them are addition,
               subtraction, multiplication, and division. But computers are text manipulators as
               much as number crunchers. The subfield of computer science that operates on textual
               rather than numeric data is known as <term>stringology</term>. Reflecting this
               broader emphasis, the symbols that are the focus of this essay are primarily
               alphabetic, but also phonemic and molecular. The only criterion for the symbols to
               function conjecturally, as already stated in our definition, is that they be digital,
               or allographic. The processes discussed here and throughout likewise depart from
               computational norms. They are not always or only mathematical operations, but also
               semiotic or grammar-like operations: transposition, deletion, insertion,
               substitution, repetition, and relocation. I will have more to say about them later,
               but for now let me summarize the four poles around which string computation has been
               organized in this project: <list type="ordered">
                  <item>Input: allographic/digital (texts, words, letters, phonemes, molecular
                     sequences)</item>
                  <item>Processor: human or machine</item>
                  <item>Processes or Operations: semiotic or grammar-like (transposition, insertion,
                     deletion, relocation, substitution)</item>
                  <item> Output: textual errors (scribal copying); conjectural reconstructions or
                     projections (textual criticism, historical linguistics, evolutionary biology);
                     wordplay (poetry); auguries (divination); plain text or cipher text
                     (cryptography)</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This framework allows us to associate activities, behaviors, and practices that
               wouldn't otherwise be grouped together: wordplay, divination, textual transmission,
               and conjectural reconstruction, for example. It also allows us, as we shall see, to
               perceive a number of underlying similarities among a set of disciplines that for most
               of the twentieth century didn't take much interest in one another, namely textual
               criticism, historical linguistics, and evolutionary biology.</p>
            <p>Historically, we have referred to the source of a message about the future as an
                  <q>oracle</q> or <q>sibyl</q> or <q>seer</q>; within the contexts specified in
               this essay, we can alternately refer to that agent, whether human or mechanical, as a
                  <q>computer.</q> From this standpoint, divination is not <q>knowledge in advance
                  of fact</q> so much as knowledge that is a (computational) permutation of fact
                  <ptr target="#jones1948" loc="27"/>. Justin Rye, for example, author of the
               imaginary language <q>Futurese,</q> a projection of American English in the year 3000
               AD, proposes that the word <q>build</q> will be pronounced /bIl/ in some American
               dialects within a century or more as a consequence of consonant cluster
               simplification <ptr target="#rye2003"/>. Underlying this speculation is a simple
               deletion operation that has been applied to a factual state of a word to compute a
               plausible future state. Transition rules of this kind are key ingredients in all of
               the examples of conjecture discussed in this project: the wordplay of Shakespeare's
               fools, soothsayers, and madmen; the puns of the Mesopotamian or Mayan priest; the
                  <q>emendations</q> of textual scholars; the doublets of Lewis Carroll; the
               molecular reconstructions of geneticists; the projections of conlangers (creators of
               imaginary languages); the transformation series of historical linguists, textual
               scholars, and evolutionary biologists.</p>
            <p>These devices and systems are unified by their semiotic and, in some cases, cognitive
               properties and behaviors: a pun resembles an editorial reconstruction resembles a
               speech error resembles a genetic mutation, and so forth. Each of these transitive
               relations is explored in the course of this essay. Consider, as a preliminary
               example, the analogy between textual and genetic variation. It is the allographic
               equivalence between the two — the fact that both are digitally encoded — that makes
               possible a strong theory of translation, allowing one system to be encoded into the
               other and, once encoded, to continue to change and evolve in its new state.
               Brazilian-born artist Eduardo Kac, who coined the term <term>transgenic art</term> to
               describe his experiments with genetic engineering, exploits this allographic
               equivalence in <title rend="italic">Genesis</title> (1999), a commissioned work for
               the Ars Electronica exhibition. Kac's artist statement reads in part as follows: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#kac1999">The key element of the work is an
                        <q>artist's gene,</q> a synthetic gene that was created by Kac by
                     translating a sentence from the biblical book of Genesis into Morse Code, and
                     converting the Morse Code into DNA base pairs according to a conversion
                     principle specially developed by the artist for this work. The sentence reads:
                        <q>Let man have dominion over the fish of the
                        sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves
                        upon the earth.</q> It was chosen for what it implies about the dubious
                     notion of divinely sanctioned humanity's supremacy over nature. The Genesis
                     gene was incorporated into bacteria, which were shown in the gallery.
                     Participants on the Web could turn on an ultraviolet light in the gallery,
                     causing real, biological mutations in the bacteria. This changed the biblical
                     sentence in the bacteria. The ability to change the sentence is a symbolic
                     gesture: it means that we do not accept its meaning in the form we inherited
                     it, and that new meanings emerge as we seek to change it.</quote>

            <p>Kac’s elaborate game of code-switching is enabled by what Matthew Kirschenbaum calls

            <p>I first became sensitive to the convergence of conjecture and wordplay while studying
               Shakespeare as a graduate student. The ludic language of Shakespeare's fools,
               soothsayers, and madmen seemed to me to uncannily resemble the language of
               Shakespeare's editors as they juggled and transposed letters in the margins of the
               page, trying to discover proximate words that shadow those that have actually
               descended to us in the hopes of recovering an authorial text. The pleasure George Ian
               Duthie, a postwar editor of Shakespeare, shows in permutating variants — juxtaposing
               and repeating them, taking a punster's delight in the homophony of stockt, struckt,
               and struck; hare and hart; nough and nought<note>Duthie is quoted at length in <ptr
                     target="#mcleod1983" loc="192–93n22"/>.</note> — finds its poetic complement in
               the metaplasmic imagination of Tom O'Bedlam in <title rend="italic">King Lear</title>
               or the soothsayer Philarmonus in <title rend="italic">Cymbeline</title>. Kenneth
               Gross points to what he calls Tom's <quote rend="inline" source="#gross2001">near
                  echolalia</quote> on the heath in the storm scene, the <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#gross2001">strange, homeless babble</quote> that <cit>

                  <ptr target="#gross2001" loc="184"/>
               </cit>. There is something scribal and exegetical in Tom's babble, just as there is
               something poetic and ludic in Duthie's editing. And in the way both manipulate signs,
               there is also something fundamentally conjectural.<note>Not to mention fundamentally
                  postmodern. With their profusion of puns, ambiguity, and double-coded meanings,
                  Duthie's conjectures exhibit some of the defining traits of literary postmodernism
                  (if we were to transplant them onto the pages of Joyce's <title rend="italic"
                     >Finnegan's Wake</title> or Pynchon's <title rend="italic">Gravity's
                     Rainbow</title>, would the results be so very discordant?). There is, more
                  generally, something in the play of conjectural signification that resembles
                  poststructuralist theories of language: each word reverberates with the traces of
                  other words, and it is the promise of these other words that drives the
                  conjectural project.</note> Conjecture, then, can be profitably understood by
               adopting a semiotic framework — expressed here in computational terms — within which
               we can legitimately or persuasively correlate the rules and patterns of conjectural
               transformation with those of mantic codes and wordplay.</p>
            <p>Consider, too, the soothsayer Philarmonus, solicited by Posthumus near the close of

               editors <ptr target="#gross2001" loc="13"/>. It is significant, for example, that
               Posthumus should initially mistake Jupiter’s oracle for the ravings of a madman, for
               the madman and the prophet hear and speak in a common register. The fool, too,
               engages in the same digital remixing of sound and sense, and it is worth recalling in
               this context that Enid Welsford’s classic study of the fool’s social and literary
               history devotes an entire chapter to his dual role as poet and clairvoyant <ptr

               in the dialect of riddles and puns that constitutes the shared vernacular of
               Shakespeare’s fools. He subscribes to a philosophy of language that views the
               manipulation of sounds as a form of sympathetic magic — a process of
                  <emph>world</emph>-making through <emph>word</emph>-making (and un-making). In the

               this philosophy should not distract us from the radical theory of the sign that
               underpins it: that there exists an instrumental link between signifier and signified,
               such that reconfiguring the one provides a means for fashioning, shaping, or
               foreshadowing the destiny of the other: <cit>

               has the power to pervert the world by deforming (<q>dallying with</q>) the language used to signify it. But Shakespeare mobilizes
               other meanings as well. In the domain of textual scholarship, the term
                  <term>corrupt</term> has historically been used to describe a text riddled with
               copy errors. Because Feste’s cunning mispronunciations and nonsense words hover
               between intelligibility and unintelligibility, they closely parallel scribal error: <cit>

            </p>
            <p>Let me pause here to gather together a number of threads: my central tenet is that
               the linguistic procedures of Shakespeare's editors often seem to mimic those of
               Shakespeare's most inveterate <q>computers</q> of language. To emend a text — to
               insert, delete, and rearrange letters, phonemes, or sequences of words — is to
               ritualistically invoke a divinatory tradition of wordplay that dates back to at least
               the third millennium BC. For a benign alien power observing human textual rites from
               afar, the linguistic manipulations of a Duthie or a Housman would, I imagine, be for
               all intents and purposes indistinguishable from those of a Philarmonus or Feste or
               Tom O’Bedlam or Chaldean or, for that matter, a computer programmer using
               string-rewriting rules to transform one word into another. What all these examples
               have in common are digital units manipulated by computers (programmers, soothsayers,
               madmen, fools, punsters, poets, scribes, editors) using a small set of combinatorial
               procedures (insertion, deletion, transposition, substitution, relocation) for
               conjectural, predictive, or divinatory ends. Duthie and Tom O'Bedlam, computer
               programmers and Kabbalists, Philarmonus and historical linguists: they all compute
               bits of language.</p>
            <p>As an editorial method, such alphabetic computation is dismissed by Housman as a
               wanton orthographic game. Finding a kindred spirit in a nineteenth-century German
               predecessor, he approvingly quotes the following: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#housman1921">Some people, if they see that anything
                     in an ancient text wants correcting, immediately betake themselves to the art
                     of palaeography . . . and try one dodge after another, as if it were a game,
                     until they hit upon something which they think they can substitute for the
                     corruption; as if forsooth truth were generally discovered by shots of that
                     sort, or as if emendation could take its rise from anything but a careful
                     consideration of the thought.</quote>
                  <ref target="#housman1921">Qtd. in Housman 1921.</ref>
               </cit> And yet the conjectures of, for example, Richard Bentley (1662-1742), one of
               the few textual critics for whom Housman professes admiration, are as much the
               product of letter play and combinatorial art as they are of careful deliberation and
               thought. (Given the structure and workings of the mental lexicon, discussed below, we
               might reasonably assert that letter play is the <foreign xml:lang="la">sine qua
                  non</foreign> of conjectural thought.) Lamenting the corrupt state of the blind
               Milton's <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, which, according to Bentley, was
               not only dictated to a tone-deaf amanuensis, but also, adding insult to injury, later
               copy-edited by a derelict acquaintance, Bentley attaches a preface to his edition of
               the poem that includes a table of the <q>monstrous Faults</q> disfiguring the
               masterpiece, alongside Bentley's proposed emendations <ptr target="#bentley1732"/>.
               Reflecting the editor's conviction that <quote rend="inline" source="#bentley1732"
                  >Words of a like or near Sound in Pronunciation</quote> were substituted
               throughout for what Milton intended <ptr target="#bentley1732"/>, the table reads
               like a dictionary of wordplay: <q>is Judicious</q> is emended to <q>Unlibidinous</q>;
                  <q>Nectarous</q> to <q>Icarus</q>; <q>Subtle Art</q> to <q>Sooty Chark</q>;
                  <q>Wound</q> to <q>Stound</q>; <q>Angelic</q> to <q>Adamic.</q>
               <note>Bentley n.pag.</note> The same <q>near echolalia</q> that characterizes Tom
               O'Bedlam's speech in the storm scene also characterizes Bentley's editorial
               method.</p>
            <p>To adjudicate among variants, Bentley finds evidence and inspiration in diverse
               knowledge domains. Milton's <quote rend="inline" source="#bentley1732">
                  <emph>secret</emph> top of Horeb</quote> in the opening lines of <title
                  rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> is conjecturally restored to <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#bentley1732">sacred top</quote> through an appeal to
               literary tradition, geology, meteorology, and logic. According to Bentley, <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#bentley1732">secret top</quote> finds little precedent in
               the works of antiquity, while <quote rend="inline" source="#bentley1732">sacred
                  top</quote> has parallels in the Bible, Spenser, and various classical authors
                  <ptr target="#bentley1732" loc="1n6"/>. Emending a text by bringing it into
               alignment with literary antecedents is a technique in which Bentley takes recourse
               again and again, as though a poem were best thought of as a commonplace book filled
               with its author's favorite quotations. The model of authorship that underwrites this
               approach is one that stresses sampling and collage over originality and solitary
               genius. The more allusive and intertextual the work, the more susceptible it will be
               to conjectural reconstruction.</p>
            <p>Whatever the shortcomings of Bentley's appeal to precedent, it has the effect of
               helping systemize and guide his wordplay. His paronomastic methods are constrained by
               other factors as well: the double articulation of natural language, comprised of a
               first level of meaningful units (called morphemes) and a second level of meaningless
               units (called phonemes), imposes order and rules on the process. There are in English
               a total of twenty-six letters of the alphabet capable of representing some 40-45
               separate phonemes, and phonotactic and semantic constraints on how those letters and
               sounds may be combined. The sequence <q>ptk</q> in English, for example, is
               unpronounceable, and the sequence <q>paf,</q> while pronounceable, is at the time of
               this writing meaningless, except perhaps as an acronym. Bentley's wordplay is thus
               bounded by the formal and historically contingent properties of the natural language
               with which he works, properties that theoretically prevent his substitutions and
               transpositions from degenerating into mere gibberish.</p>
            <p>The importance of digital or allographic units to computation, as I have defined it
               here, is underscored by Gross's observation that what Tom O'Bedlam manipulates are

            <head>Textual Transmission as Wordplay</head>
            <p>The similarities between scribal and poetic computation (understood in the sense in
               which I have defined it) are brought home by even a casual look at the editorial
               apparatus of any critical edition of Shakespeare, where editors have traditionally
               attempted to ascertain whether a particular verbal crux is a poetic device in need of
               explication or a misprint in need of emendation. The Shakespearean text is one in
               which an error can have all the color and comedic effect of an intentional
               malapropism, and an intentional malapropism all the ambiguity and perplexity of an
               inadvertent error. Is Cleopatra's <q>knot
                  intrinsicate</q> a deliberate amalgam of <q>intricate</q> and
                  <q>intrinsic,</q> one that deploys <q>half a dozen meanings,</q> or, by contrast, an accidental blend introduced
               into the text by a distracted compositor? Is Hamlet's <q>sallied flesh</q> an alternative spelling of
                  <q>solid,</q> one that also plays on <q>sullied,</q> or, more mundanely, a
               typesetting mistake? Does the Duke's <q>headstrong weedes</q> in <title rend="italic">Measure for Measure</title>
               encapsulate some of the play's core themes, or is it an inadvertent and nonsensical
               deformation of <q>headstrong <emph>steeds</emph>
               </q>?<note>See <ptr target="#mahood1957" loc="15–8"/>.</note> We are in general too
               hasty, insists M. M. Mahood in <title rend="italic">Shakespeare's Wordplay</title>,
               in dismissing these and other odd readings as erroneous variants rather than
               appreciating them for what they in many instances are: the artful <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#mahood1957">twists and turns</quote> of a great poet's
               mind <ptr target="#mahood1957" loc="17"/>.</p>
            <p>That Mahood feels compelled to devote several pages to the problem of distinguishing
               between errors and wordplay in Shakespeare's text is worth lingering over. It
               suggests that there is something fundamentally poetic about the changes — or
                  <term>computations</term> — a text undergoes as it is transmitted through time and
               space. This holds true regardless of how we classify those computations, whether as
               errors, creative interpolations, or conjectural emendations. It is as if a poem, at
               its most self-referential and rhetorical, were recapitulating its own evolution, or
               the evolution recapitulating the poem.</p>
            <p>To clarify the point, consider the phenomenon of metathesis, the simple transposition
               of elements. Metathesis is a law of sound change (historical linguistics), a cipher
               device (cryptography), a poetic trope (classical rhetoric), a scribal error (textual
               criticism), and a speech error (psycholinguistics). There are entries for metathesis
               in both <title rend="italic">A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms</title> (a guide to
               formal rhetoric) and <title rend="italic">A Companion to Classical Texts</title> (a
               primer on textual criticism, which includes a typology of scribal error).<note>
                  <ptr target="#lanham1991"/>; <ptr target="#hall1913"/>.</note> The overlaps
               between the two reference works are, in fact, considerable, with entries for
               epenthesis (the insertion of an element), homeoteleuton (repetition of words with
               similar endings) and other basic manipulations common to both. While it would be a
               stretch to claim that the lists contained in them are interchangeable, it wouldn't be
               much of one. Wordplay, one might conclude, is a poetics of error.</p>
            <p>Cognitive evidence supports this view. Clinical experiments, slips of the tongue,
               slips of the pen, and the speech and writing disorders of aphasics (those whose
               ability to produce and process language has been severely impaired by a brain injury)
               all provide insight into the structure and organization of the mental lexicon.
               Current research models that lexicon as a web whose connections are both acoustic and
               semantic: like-sounding and like-meaning words are either stored or linked together
               in the brain <ptr target="#aitchison2003"/>. These networks of relation make certain
               kinds of slips or errors more probable than others. As natural language users, for
               example, we sometimes miss a target word when speaking or writing and instead replace
               it with one that occupies a nearby node, making substitutions like
                  <emph>profession</emph> for <emph>procession</emph> or <emph>medication</emph> for
                  <emph>meditation</emph> relatively common <ptr target="#aitchison2003" loc="145"
               />. Transpositions like <emph>pasghetti</emph> for <emph>spaghetti</emph> or blends
               like <emph>frowl</emph> (<emph>frown</emph> plus <emph>scowl</emph>) are also legion
               and suggest that the unit of production and manipulation is the individual phoneme or
               grapheme: discrete, digital, and mobile <ptr target="#aitchison2003" loc="216"/>. For
               many aphasics, these errors completely overtake normal speech: clip might become
               plick; butter, tubber; or leasing, ceiling <ptr target="#aitchison2003" loc="22"/>.
               As Jean Aitchison observes, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#aitchison2003">the problems of aphasic patients are
                     simply an exaggeration of the difficulties which normal speakers may

                  <ptr target="#aitchison2003" loc="22"/>
               </cit>. But what is uncontrollable in the aphasic is deliberate in the poet. <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#steiner1998">There is a sense in which a great poet or
                  punster is a human being able to induce and select from a Wernicke
                  aphasia,</quote> writes George Steiner in <title rend="italic">After Babel</title>
               <ptr target="#steiner1998" loc="297"/>. To which I would add: or from everyday speech
               and writing errors.</p>
            <p>Steiner’s insight repays further attention. Poets, like artists in general, often
               creatively stress-test the system or medium with which they work, probing its edges,
               overloading it, and pushing it beyond normal operational capacity. Discovering where
               language breaks down or deviates from regular use is the business of both poet and
               neuroscientist, providing a means of gaining insight into the mechanisms of language
               perception, processing, and production. But whereas the neuroscientist gathers data
               from aphasic patients in a clinical setting, the poet becomes, as it were, his own
               research subject, artificially manipulating the cognitive networks of meaning and
               sound that form his dataset. As Steiner notes, when intentionally created, ordered,
               and embedded in larger textual or linguistic structures, such distortions become
               poetry.</p>

            <head>Divination as Wordplay</head>
            <p>The mantic wordplay in Shakespeare's <title rend="italic">Cymbeline</title> has
               forerunners in divination methods indigenous to cultures as diverse as those of the
               Quiché Maya of South America and the Sumerians of the ancient Near East. Mayan
               priests still practice a type of calendrical prophecy that involves uttering the
               words of a specific date and interpreting their oracle by punning on them <ptr
                  target="#tedlock2000" loc="263"/>. Notably, the Quiché term for punning is
                  <foreign xml:lang="myn">sakb'al tzij</foreign>, <q>word dice,</q> which in the
               context of Mayan daykeeping makes links among wordplay, divination, and games
               explicit <ptr target="#tedlock2000" loc="263"/>. Later, we shall examine the kinds of
               string metrics that one can apply to puns and textual variants to compute optimal
               alignment, edit distance, and edit operations. What these are and why one might want
               to compute them are the subjects of another section; for now, it is enough to note
               that these algorithms rest on the premise that words and texts change procedurally —
               by adhering to the same finite set of legal operations we've previously
               discussed.</p>
            <p>We can also demonstrate the formalism of divinatory practice by looking at some of
               the earliest inscribed prophecies of the ancient Near East, which make extensive use
               of the same conditional blocks found in modern computer programs to control the flow
               and <q>output</q> of the mantic code: <cit>

               </note> Understood algorithmically, the Mesopotamian divinatory code is a
               proto-machine language, one that precedes by several millennia Pascal or Java or
                  C++.<note>There is a question of nomenclature here. I am aware that within tech
                  circles, Java, Pascal, and C++ would be denoted high-level programming languages
                  rather than machine languages. The latter term is reserved for low-level code
                  legible only to the computer. By contrast, a high-level programming language is
                  legible to humans and must be compiled into machine language before the computer
                  can process it. Nonetheless, this narrow definition exists alongside a broader
                  one, which copposes <q>machine</q> or <q>artificial</q> language to <q>natural</q>
                  or <q>human</q> language, in this way distinguishing Pascal or C++ or Java from
                  Italian or English or Chinese. It is this more generic sense of the term that I'm
                  drawing on here. The fact that so-called machine or artificial languages in the
                  broader sense are almost always written in English adds a further layer of
                  cultural, technological, and linguistic complexity to these various

            <head>Textual Criticism as Divination</head>
            <p>The allographic operations used to generate a future text in Mesopotamian divination
               are formally consonant with those that produce variant readings in an open print or
               manuscript tradition. Mesopotamian divination <emph>simulates</emph> textual
               transmission, by which I mean that it seems to accelerate or exaggerate, as well as
               radically compress, a process that would normally occur over centuries or millennia —
               and one, moreover, that would in a great many of its particulars occur inadvertently
               rather than (as in Mesopotamian divination) deliberately. It is as if we were
               watching a text descend to posterity through time-lapse photography. These conceptual
               and behavioral associations are visually reinforced by the traditional emblems of the

               affinity between Sumerian divination and early textual scholarship of the Hebrew
               Bible is expertly established by Michael Fishbane in <title rend="italic">Biblical
                  Interpretation in Ancient Israel</title>, an extraordinary study of the scribal
               phenomenon of inner-biblical exegesis. Fishbane writes as follows: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#fishbane1989">Sometimes these [Mesopotamian
                     prophecies] are merely playful <foreign xml:lang="fr">jeux de mot</foreign>s;
                     but, just as commonly, there is a concern to guard esoteric knowledge. Among
                     the techniques used are permutations of syllabic arrangements with obscure and
                     symbolic puns, secret and obscure readings of signs, and numerological ciphers.
                     The continuity and similarity of these cuneiform cryptographic techniques with
                     similar procedures in biblical sources once again emphasizes the variegated and
                     well-established tradition of mantological exegesis in the ancient Near East —
                     a tradition which found ancient Israel a productive and innovative tradent
                     [i.e., transmitter of the received tradition].</quote>
                  <ptr target="#fishbane1989"/>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p>Fishbane’s work demonstrates through exhaustive research that mantic practice of the
               ancient Near East is a crucially important locus for understanding early textual
               analysis and emendation of the Hebrew Bible. Our working hypothesis must therefore be
               that the connections between these hermeneutic traditions are causal as well as
               formal. Historically, then, and contrary to popular belief, prediction has been as
               much a part of the knowledge work of the humanities as of the sciences — as much our
               disciplinary inheritance as theirs. It is time that we own that legacy rather than
               disavow it. We have for some time now outsourced conjecture to the Natural, Physical,
               and Computational Sciences. Paradoxically, then, it is only through
               interdisciplinarity that we can possibly hope to reclaim disciplinarity.</p>

            <p>This section looks at the shared <q>arboreal habits,</q> to use Darwin's term <ptr
                  target="#darwin1871" loc="811"/>, of conjectural critics in three historical
               disciplines: textual criticism, evolutionary biology, and historical linguistics.
               More than a century after the publication of Darwin's <title rend="italic">On the
                  Origin of Species</title>, which helped popularize the Tree of Life, tree
               methodology remains at the center of some of the most ambitious and controversial
               conjectural programs of our time, including efforts to reconstruct macrofamilies of
               languages, such as Proto-Indo-European, and the Last Universal Common Ancestor
               (LUCA), a single-celled organism from which all life putatively sprang.<note>On LUCA,
                  see <ptr target="#poole2002"/>.</note> At the outposts of the biological and
               linguistic sciences, conjecture is prospective as well as retrospective: synthetic
               biologists and language inventors are known to experiment with modeling future states
               of genomes and languages, respectively.<note>While my goal in this section to draw
                  parallels among biogenetics, textual criticism, and historical linguistics, I am
                  also sensitive to potential conflicts in their aims or intentions that deserve
                  more attention than I can afford to give them here. One of my aspirations in
                  publishing this article is to raise awareness of and interest in conjecture in the
                  digital humanities. But I am less sanguine about the role it might play in
                  biogenetics, where the potential for abuse of the conjectural ethos is so great.
                  Take, for example, the sub-discipline of synthetic biology, or <quote
                     rend="inline" source="#woolfson2005">making creatures from scratch,</quote>
                  which is discussed in <ptr target="#woolfson2005"/>. On the reconstructive
                  possibilities of this emerging discipline, Woolfson muses that <quote

                     elusive ancestor of all human life on Earth, a hypothetical organism known as

                  </quote> since <quote rend="inline" source="#woolfson2005">the remnants of LUCA
                     should be scattered across the genomes of all living things.</quote> He goes so

                     source="#woolfson2005">back to life.</quote> It is for this reason that the
                  material difference between texts and bodies needs to be continually acknowledged.
                  Otherwise we risk glib pronouncements that fail to take into account what is at
                  stake in asserting only their likeness. For discussion of the origins and limits

               the technical term — O’Hara’s interest in <q>trees of history</q> stems from his work
               in cladistics, a system of classification based on phylogenetic relationships in
               evolutionary groups of organisms. Over the last several decades, cladistics has
               become a highly sophisticated computer-assisted methodology, one that has outpaced
               stemmatics and its linguistic counterpart technically if not conceptually. It is
               unsurprising, then, that in addition to satisfying a general theoretical curiosity
               about the coincidence of trees of history in three seemingly disparate fields,
               O’Hara’s research is also an outreach project. He has, for example, collaborated with
               Peter Robinson to produce cladistic analyses of Chaucerian manuscripts <ptr
                  target="#ohara1993" loc="53–74"/>. Such outreach has awakened both textual critics
               and linguists to the application of bioinformatics to their respective fields. But
               while O'Hara triangulates all three historical sciences, the link between textual
               scholarship and linguistics receives comparatively less attention than the links each
               of them shares with evolutionary biology. It is this third leg of the triangle that I
               want first to consider.</p>
            <p>The evidence suggesting a direct historical relationship between stemmatics in
               textual criticism and the comparative method in linguistics is relatively hard to
               come by in the secondary literature, and what little of it there is, is
               circumstantial. The English-language textual scholarship has almost nothing to say on
               the subject,<note>Since first drafting this essay, I have been made aware that
                  Sebastiano Timpanaro's seminal monograph on the German classicist Karl Lachmann
                  has been translated from its original Italian into English by Glenn W. Most under
                  the title <title rend="italic">The Genesis of Lachmann's Method</title>. The book
                  includes an informative chapter on the crosscurrents between textual criticism and
                  linguistics in the nineteenth century, which builds on the earlier work of Henry
                  Hoenigswald, discussed below.</note> although I suspect the situation with respect
               to German-language scholarship may be different, and the linguistic and biological
               literature for the most part falls in step. Standard accounts of the comparative
               method, as the genealogical approach is known in historical linguistics, are more apt
               to note the influence of Darwinian principles than textual ones. But a small cadre of
               linguists and biologists, following the lead of the late Henry Hoenigswald, have set
               about revising what we think we know about tree visualizations in the nineteenth
                  century.<note>See the landmark volume of essays co-edited by Hoenigswald and Linda
                  F. Wiener, <ptr target="#hoenigswald1987"/>.</note> Hoenigswald, a historical
               linguist as well as a historian <emph>of</emph> linguistics, has managed to unearth
               interesting connections by operating at a granular level of analysis.<note>See in
                  particular <ptr target="#hoenigswald1963" loc="1–11"/>.</note> He succeeds where
               others fail because he has something of a detective mentality about him: his work
               demonstrates that to successfully trace the itinerary of ideas, one sometimes has to
               be willing to track the movements of the individuals who propagated them. Who knew
               who when, where, and under what circumstances? His lesson is that it is useful to
               think in terms of coteries and their membership if the objective is to map the spread
               of ideas. While other scholars write very generally about the diffusion of the
               arboreal trope in the nineteenth century, Hoenigswald — and perhaps we see the
               imprint of the genealogical method here — attempts to discover direct lines of
               influence.</p>
            <p>Any account of the origins of the comparative method in historical linguistics must
               take into account the achievements of A. Schleicher (1821-1868), the founding father
               of the <title rend="italic">Stambaumtheorie</title>, or genealogical tree model, by
               which the relations of the variously known IndoEuropean languages were set forth in a
               pedigree, and an asterisked hypothetical ancestral form postulated. <term>Comparative
                  method</term> is a misnomer to the extent that it suggests comparison is the focal
               activity of the method, when in fact it is more like a means to an end. Comparisons
               of variants between two or more related languages are undertaken with the purpose of
                  <emph>reconstructing</emph> their genealogy and proto-language. While the method
               is partially indebted to the Linnean taxonomic classification system, Hoenigswald is
               quick to point out a second, perhaps more significant influence: as a student,
               Schleicher studied classics under Friedrich Ritschl (1806-1876), who, along with
               other nineteenth-century figures such as Karl Lachmann and J. N. Madvig, helped
               formalize the science of stemmatology <ptr target="#hoenigswald1963" loc="5"/>. The
               affinities between textual criticism and historical linguistics are such that very
               minor adjustments to the definition of comparative method would produce a textbook
               definition of stemmatics: <quote rend="block" source="#cameron">

                        recently, however, many scholars would have inserted a full stop after

                        </cit>. On the contrary, reconstruction has been a desideratum of
                        evolutionary biology from the start: one encounters a conjectural ethos in
                        Darwin's Descent of Man and in the writings of, for example, Thomas Huxley,
                        the eminent Victorian biologist and staunch defender of Darwin's model of
                        evolution. The ethos has always been there, the methodology has not; or
                        rather, the methodology has been hobbled by the lack of a clear unit of
                        comparison and conjecture. But whereas conjectural criticism in recent
                        decades has experienced a downtick in popularity in textual studies, the
                        reverse is true in evolutionary and synthetic biology, where allographic
                        methods have taken hold. With DNA and protein sequences — digital, discrete,
                        and abstract — now firmly established as the clear units of conjectural
                        analysis in evolutionary biology, the reconstructive paradigm has begun to
                        flourish.</note>

            <p>In order to better understand how an unattested text, language, or genome is inferred
               from attested forms, I want to briefly look at two competing classes of stemmatic
               algorithms: maximum parsimony and clustering. Broadly speaking, clustering or
               distance methods compute the overall similarities between manuscript readings,
               without regard to whether the similarities are coincidental or inherited,<note>In
                  phylogenetics, this difference is expressed as that between so-called homoplastic
                  characters and homologous characters.</note> while maximum parsimony computes the
                  <q>shortest</q> tree containing the least number of change events still capable of
               accommodating all the variants. The difference is often expressed in evolutionary
               biology as that between a phenetic (clustering) versus a cladistic (parsimonious)
               approach. Here is how Arthur Lee distinguishes the two: <quote rend="block"
                  source="#salemans1996">Cladistic analysis is sharply differentiated from cluster
                  analysis by that which it measures. Cluster analysis groups the objects being
                  analysed or classified by how closely they resemble each other in the sum of their
                  variations, using statistical <q>distance measures.</q> Cladistic analysis, on the
                  other hand, analyses the objects in terms of the evolutionary descent of their
                  individual variants, choosing the evolutionary tree which requires the smallest
                  number of changes in the states of all the variants.<note>Qtd. in <ptr
                        target="#salemans1996" loc="44"/>. This volume testifies to the distinctly
                     Scandinavian flavor of much new work in stemmatology.</note>
               </quote> In cladistic analyses, the evidentiary gold standard excludes most of the
               textual data from consideration: only shared derived readings as opposed to shared
               ancestral readings are believed to have probative value. An ancestral reading, or
               retention, is any character string inherited without change from an ancestor. A
               derived reading, by contrast, is a modification of a reading inherited from the
               ancestor, often motivated rather than arbitrary from a paleographic, metrical,
               phonological, manual, technological, aesthetic, grammatical, cognitive, or some other
               perspective (for example, the <title rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</title> scribe
               who, when confronted with the metrically deficient line <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#canonical">But tel me, why hidstow with sorwe</quote> in the Wife of Bath's
               Prologue, alters <q>why</q> to <q>wherfor</q> to fill out the meter). When such
               readings are contained in two or more manuscripts, they are regarded as potentially
               diagnostic. Having made it through this initial round of scrutiny, they are then
               subject to a second round of inspections, which will result in exclusions of variants
               that have crept into the text via routes not deemed genealogically informative. The
               transposition of the <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of <hi
                  rend="italic">the</hi> when keyed into a computer is a mundane example. So
               pedestrian is this error that your word-processing program most likely automatically
               corrects it for you when you make it. In the terminology of Don Cameron, it is an
                  <term>adventitous</term> rather than <term>indicative</term> error.<note>Cameron,
                  in <ptr target="#hoenigswald1987" loc="229"/>.</note> The stemmatic challenge is
               to screen out the adventitious variants, and successfully identify and use the
               indicative variants.</p>
            <p>Phenetic or clustering analyses involve the use of a distance metric to determine
               degrees of similarity among manuscripts. The Levenshtein Distance algorithm, for
               example, named after the Russian scientist who created it, tabulates the number of
               primitive operations required to transform one variant into another. We can
               illustrate its application with one of the most notorious variants in the
               Shakespearean canon. In Hamlet's first soliloquy, we encounter the following lines: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#canonical">
                     <lg>
                        <l>O that this too too sullied flesh would melt,</l>
                        <l>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew . . .</l>
                     </lg>
                  </quote>
                  <ref type="offline">1.2.129-30</ref>
               </cit> The first folio reads <quote rend="inline" source="#canonical">solid flesh,</quote>
               while the second quarto has <quote rend="inline" source="#canonical">sallied flesh.</quote>
               The Levenshtein or edit distance between them is determined as follows: let
                  <q>solid</q> equal the source reading and <q>sallied</q> the target reading. The
               first task is to align the words so as to maximize the number of matches between
                  letters:<note>As Julia Flanders has pointed out to me, one could also compute the
                  edit distance between phonological (rather than orthographical) representations of
                  the words.</note>
               <eg>s o - l i - d | | | | s a l l i e d</eg>
            </p>
            <p> Sequence alignment, as the method is called, is a form of collation. Identifying all
               the pairings helps us compute the minimum number of procedures needed to change one
               string into another. A mismatch between letters indicates that a substitution
               operation is called for, while a dash signals that a deletion or insertion is
               necessary. Three steps get us from source to target: a substitution operation
               transforms the <q>o</q> of <q>solid</q> into the <q>a</q> of <q>sallied</q>; an
               insertion operation supplies the <q>l</q> of <q>sallied</q>; and another insertion
               operation gives us the penultimate <q>e</q> in our target variant: <eg>solid — &gt;
                  salid salid — &gt; sallid sallid — &gt; sallied</eg> A distance of three edit
               operations (one substitution and two insertions) thus separates the two character
               strings. In clustering, the greater the edit distance between different readings, the
               more dissimilar they are assumed to be.</p>
            <p>Although heterogeneous in their approach, both clustering and maximum parsimony are
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">ars combinatoria</foreign>. That is, both involve making
               assumptions about and/or modelling various orders, numbers, combinations, and kinds
               of — as well as distances between — primitive operations that collectively account
               for all the known variants in a text's transmission history. Both also take entropy
               for granted: they assume the depredations of time on texts to be relentless and
               non-reversible, with the result that the more temporally remote a descendant is from
               an ancestor, the more dissimilar to the ancestor it will be. In terms of our tree
               graph, this means that a copy placed proximally to the root is judged more similar to
               the archetype than a copy placed distally to the root.<note>Although I do not take up
                  the question of the distinction between networks and trees in this article, a
                  fuller exposition of the stemmatic method would need to discuss the issue of
                  conflated texts, which incorporate readings from two or more manuscripts. While
                  tree models cannot accommodate such texts, networks can. </note>

            <head>Conjecture as Wordplay (Redux)</head>
            <p>In biology, textual criticism, and historical linguistics, a transformation series
               (TS) is an unbroken evolutionary sequence of character states. The changes that a
               word or molecular sequence undergoes are cumulative: state A gives rise to state B,
               which in turn generates C, and so on. The assumption is that each intermediary node
               serves as a bridge between predecessor and successor nodes; state C is a modified
               version of B, while D is a derivation of C. The changes build logically on one
               another and follow in orderly succession. Consider, for example, a hypothetical (and
               admittedly idealized) textual series: head/heal/teal/tell/tall/tail.<note>For an
                  example of a genuine rather than hypothetical transformation series, see Cameron,
                  in <ptr target="#hoenigswald1987" loc="234"/>.</note> Each word differs from the
               next by exactly one letter. The transitions are gradual rather than abrupt, striking
               a balance between continuity and change. <q>If we can
                  discover such a transformation series,</q> writes H. Don Cameron, <q>we have strong evidence for the relationship of the
                  manuscripts</q> in which the readings occur.<note>Cameron, in <ptr
                     target="#hoenigswald1987" loc="234"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Those readings might relate to one another in the vertical direction, in which case
               the task of the textual critic is to determine their order and polarity: <figure
                  xml:id="figure04">
                  <head>Transformation Series (Version 1)</head>

                  <figDesc/>
               </figure> Conversely, they might relate to one another as leaf nodes in the
               horizontal direction,<note>Unlike interior nodes in a tree, which have both ancestors
                  and descendants, leaf nodes have only ancestors.</note> under which circumstances
               the editorial challenge is to infer vertical relationships: <figure xml:id="figure05">
                  <head>Transformation Series (Version 2)</head>
                  <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.jpg"/>
                  <figDesc/>
               </figure> From this diagram, one can reconstruct plausible vertical variants, which
               recapitulate the horizontal: <figure xml:id="figure06">
                  <head>Transformation Series (Version 3)</head>
                  <graphic url="resources/images/figure06.jpg"/>
                  <figDesc/>
               </figure> In this graph, each internal node generates two children, one of which
               preserves the reading of the parent, the other of which innovates on it. The
               innovations, or mutations, collectively constitute the TS and form a single
               evolutionary path through the tree.</p>
            <p>Both distance and parsimony methods shed light on transformation series. The degree
               of difference between two leaf nodes, for example, reflects their degree of
               relationship: in our reconstruction, <emph>tail</emph> and <emph>tall</emph>, which
               differ by only one character, share a more recent common ancestor than
                  <emph>tail</emph> and <emph>head</emph>, which differ by four.<note>Although both
                  head and tail have the letter "a" in common, it occupies a different position in
                  each word and thus doesn't count as a <q>match.</q>
               </note> The variants are also ordered so as to minimize the total number of mutations
               along the vertical axis, consistent with the principle of parsimony.</p>
            <p>Now an admission: the source of the head/heal/teal/tell/tall/tail series is the
               nineteenth-century British author and mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better
               known by the pseudonym Lewis Carroll, who uses it to illustrate not textual
               transmission or biological evolution, but rather a word game of his own invention,
               which he called <q>doublets</q>
               <ptr target="#carroll1992" loc="39"/>. Alternately known as <q>word ladders,</q>
               doublets is played by first designating a start word and end word. The objective is
               to progressively transform one into the other, creating legitimate intermediary words
               along the way. The player who can accomplish this in the fewest number of steps
               wins.</p>
            <p>The congruity between doublets and biological evolution is the subject of an
               ingenious essay by scientist David Searls, entitled <title rend="quotes">From <title

               doublets by quoting the opening lines of Carroll's nonsense poem <title rend="quotes"
                  >Jabberwocky,</title> famous for its portmanteaux, neologisms, and word puzzles:

                  >Jabberwocky,</title> manifests the same metamorphic impulse that would later
               guide Carroll's invention of other word games. Of the gradated form of doublets in
               particular, Searls remarks that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#searls2001">the notion of the most parsimonious
                     interconversions among strings of letters is . . . at the basis of many

                  <ptr target="#searls2001" loc="341"/>
               </cit> — and, of course, in textual criticism and historical linguistics.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, Carroll himself alludes to the resemblance between doublets and
               Darwinian evolution in an example that anticipates by more than half a century the
               linguistic and scriptural foundations of modern molecular genetics. He satirically
               bridges the evolutionary gap between apes and humans with a six-step transformation
               series: <eg>APE — &gt; ARE — &gt; ERE — &gt; ERR — &gt; EAR — &gt; MAR — &gt;
                  MAN</eg>
            </p>
            <p>Extending Carroll's experiment to sets of words, Searls reconstructs hypothetical
               ancestors for eight leaf nodes:</p>
            <figure xml:id="figure07">
               <head>Doublet Tree. Searls annotates his diagram as follows: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#searls2001">Given the set of words in the bottom
                     row, the object would be to find the minimal tree with valid English words
                     at each interior node, with one <q>mutation</q> per connection, as shown
                     here</quote>

               <figDesc/>
            </figure>
            <p>Here the words at the bottom level are used to infer ancestors, but they might also
               be used to project descendants. They support conjectures that <emph>converge</emph>
               backward in time or <emph>diverge</emph> forward in time.</p>
            <p>While Carroll initially conceived of doublets as a game of substitutions, involving
               the exchange of one letter for another, he later also admitted transpositions, as in
               the third step of the following series: <eg>IRON — &gt; ICON — &gt; COIN — &gt; CORN
                  — &gt; CORD — &gt; LORD — &gt; LOAD — &gt; LEAD</eg> And although deletions and
               insertions were never formally a part of doublet puzzles, they were central to
               another game exploring word generation, which Carroll dubbed <title rend="quotes"
                  >Mischmasch.</title>
               <note>
                  <ptr target="#searls2001" loc="341–2"/>
               </note> Indeed, taken collectively, Carroll's games incorporate the full spectrum of
               grammatical operations on strings, almost as if they were intentionally designed to
               model patterns of descent with variation in cultural and organic systems.</p>
            <p>What should we make of the fact that scientific theories of transmission and
               reconstruction can be so effectively illustrated with a parlor game? Recall that a
               correspondence between conjecture and wordplay was established earlier in this essay.
               There we discovered that a textual critic endeavoring to recover a prior text and a
               diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs were often united in their reliance
               on letter substitutions, puns, anagrams, and other permutational devices. Noting that
               the procedures underlying such word games were amenable to algorithmic expression, we
               labeled both the textual critic and the prophet who perform them <q>computers.</q> At
               the same time, we maintained that they were computers of a special sort, proficient
               in the semiotic processing of strings rather than the mathematical reckoning of
               numbers. Into their ranks we can also admit evolutionary biologists and historical
               linguists, for whom the grammatical operability of signs is no less germane.</p>
            <p>In a post-industrial, Westernized society, an individual with the proper education
               who displays an aptitude for string manipulation might find gainful employment as an
               evolutionary biologist or historical linguist or cryptographer. In another milieu,
               that same individual might instead be inducted into the ways of the poet or prophet.
               The Mayan priest who practices calendrical divination through puns, the Mesopotamian
               baru who deciphers oracles through wordplay, and the Shakespearean soothsayer who
               interprets auguries by means of substitutive sounds and false etymologies find their
               21st-century scientific complement in the figure of the computational biologist.
               Searls remarks that Carroll's doublet puzzles reveal <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#searls2001">a turn of mind well suited to
                     methodologies used in modern computational biology.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#searls2001" loc="339"/>
               </cit> This statement has the effect of endowing what might otherwise be seen as an
               idle pastime with scientific rigor and purpose. But we could also flip the words
               around to observe that the computational methods of the biologist reveal a turn of
               mind well suited to wordplay. By thus inverting the language, we begin to see the
               poet in the scientist as well as the scientist in the poet. The contention of this
               poet-scientist is that all living things evolve through combinatorial play. The Book
               of Life, it would seem, is a volume of poetry, a dictionary of wordplay, and a
               compendium of oracles all bound together.</p>

            <p>In this essay I have tried to advance the proposition that conjectural knowledge in
               the humanities is a manifestation of the inalienable human need to imagine what might
               have been or could be or almost was. This mandate of the subjunctive is beautifully
               conveyed by George Steiner in <title rend="italic">After Babel</title>: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#steiner1998">It is the constructive powers of
                     language to conceptualize the world which have been crucial to man's survival

                     of death. It is the miraculous — I do not retract the term — capacity of
                     grammars to generate counter-factuals, <q>if</q>-propositions and, above all,
                     future tenses, which have empowered our species to hope, to reach far beyond
                     the extinction of the individual. We endure, we endure creatively due to our
                     imperative ability to say <q>No</q> to reality, to build fictions of alterity,

               </cit> For Steiner, that <quote rend="inline" source="#steiner1998">imperative ability</quote>
               is more than a psychological or linguistic impulse; more, even, than a creative or
               ethical force; it is also a life instinct.</p>
            <p>In the course of this work I have also tried to show that algorithms on strings —
               vital to conjecture — are as computationally sound as algorithms on numbers. We are
               so accustomed to thinking that punsters and textual critics somewhat imprecisely
               reshuffle symbols, whereas mathematicians and engineers methodically calculate them
               that it will perhaps take a class of scientists who process strings rather than
               numbers to convince us otherwise. We have looked at just such a group of
               professionals, computational biologists, whose work on the chemical <q>letters</q> of
               DNA resembles nothing so much as the parlor game of doublets or word ladders. And yet
               this form of wordplay is couched in the language of computation rather than poetry,
               vetted by biologists rather than poets or literary scholars, and published in
               scientific journals rather than poetry rags or literary monographs. Perhaps most
               significantly, the similarities between the methods of the computational biologist
               and the textual scholar — like those between the soothsayer and textual scholar — are
               not coincidental, but causal and historical.</p>
            <p>One of my primary objectives has been to dispute the commonplace assumption that the
               inner workings of conjecture are ineffable and opaque. R. J. Tarrant, for example,
               writes that <quote rend="inline" source="#tarrant">conjectural criticism advances slowly
                  and unsteadily,</quote> proceeding at a <quote rend="inline" source="#tarrant">glacial
                  pace</quote> and is not amenable to <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#tarrant">discussion of methods and trends</quote>
                  <ptr target="#tarrant" loc="121"/>
               </cit>. Remarks of this sort are scattered throughout the literature of textual
               scholarship: E. J. Kenney and Martin West profess similar sentiments, as does F. W.
               Hall, who remarks that, traditionally, conjecture <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hall1913">proceeds from no method and conveys no
                     certainty</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hall1913" loc="151"/>
               </cit>. My position, by contrast, has been that conjectural knowledge is produced in
               more determinate ways than is customarily acknowledged, which is to say through not
               only (or necessarily) the statistical processing of discrete symbols, but also their
               grammatical or semiotic processing. Stated more generally, there are reciprocal
               relations among conjecture, computation, and semiotics. This essay, then, has been
               written with the conviction that a cogent theory of conjecture is a desideratum of
               textual studies.</p>
            <p>But what about conjectural methods in humanistic fields other than textual studies
               and linguistics that don't rely on systems of inheritance and variation? Take
               history, for instance, where the historical imaginary is our predominant tool for
               filling in the missing details of the past; or digital preservation, where the
               archivist must designate a primary user community for the cultural objects she
               preserves. By projecting the knowledge base of this user group into the future, the
               archivist makes decisions about what kind of descriptive metadata and contextual
               information to include in order to <quote rend="inline" source="#thomas2007">render the object
                  intelligible</quote> to posterity.<note>
                  <ptr target="#thomas2007" loc="5"/> The workbook was published online on 19 May

               If she misjudges the needs and attributes of this community — if her conjectural
               faculties falter — then the archive may be less meaningful, accessible, or useful
               than it would otherwise be. Are these two forms of conjecture so very different,
               either from each other or from those already described, as to generally make
               comparisons between them baseless? Or is it possible to create an integrated research
               narrative capable of accommodating a variety of conjectural projects, perhaps through
               recourse to a sophisticated typology of conjecture?</p>
            <p>My own hunch is that there are deep structures common to many types of conjecture and
               new methods available to others that await discovery and experimentation. Our success
               in identifying and exploiting them, however, will depend in no small measure on how
               committed the digital humanities community is in coming years to building an
               information infrastructure that supports new models of scholarly communication and
               research. Patrick Juola, a computational linguist at Duquesne University, for
               example, is currently developing a prototype system for exploring corpus-based
               approaches to conjecture in the humanities. As Juola explains, his idea is to program
               the computer <quote rend="inline" source="#private">to make essentially random emendations
                  to texts and then rank them for plausibility using a set of agreed-upon
                  criteria,</quote> the underlying assumption being that the machine <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#private">is capable of devising and examining many more
                     possible readings than even the most prolific human author, and even if 99.9%
                     of the possible readings are flat gibberish, the one in a thousand may include
                     interesting and provocative readings that human authors have missed</quote>
                  <ref type="offline">Patrick Juola, email to the author, 3 Oct. 2008.</ref>
               </cit> Noting that this data-driven approach can be extended in a variety of ways,
               Juola emphasizes the versatility of the comparative framework he is proposing: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#private">I could equally compare American and British
                     literature, or 19th and 20th century literature, or first-person and
                     third-person novels, or any other interesting category. Essentially, what the
                     prototype I envision will do is generate (and test superficially) random
                     conjectures like <hi rend="quotes">[Works in Category 1] use [Semantic category
                        B] more than [Works in Category 2].</hi>
                  </quote>
                  <ref type="offline">Juola, email to the author, 3 Oct. 2008.</ref>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p>The promise of Juola's corpus-based conjectural criticism, however, is predicated on
               the kind of mass digitization from which humanities researchers, as Christine Borgman
               emphasizes in <title rend="italic">Scholarship in the Digital Age</title>, have thus
               far benefited very little, at least as compared to their scientific colleagues.<note>
                  <ptr target="#borgman2007" loc="214–5"/>. Borgman also notes that <quote
                     rend="inline" source="#borgman2007">generally speaking, the humanities are
                     more interpretive than data-driven,</quote> with digital humanists being one
                  obvious exception <ptr target="#borgman2007" loc="213"/>.</note> The
                  <emph>data</emph> content layer, moreover, lacks the infrastructural support that
               libraries, institutions, and publishers have traditionally provided for the
                  <emph>document</emph> content layer.<note>Borgman 225.</note> The problem is
               exacerbated in the humanities by the fact that the distinction between data and
               publications (or data and documents) is fuzzy to begin with <ptr
                  target="#borgman2007" loc="219"/>. If we can create the kind of institutional
               incentives recommended by Borgman to develop, manage, and curate the data content
               layer, then perhaps a new practice of conjecture will follow.</p>
