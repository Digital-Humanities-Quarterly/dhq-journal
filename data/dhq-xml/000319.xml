                <p> This paper offers a case study of two contrasting digital scholarship
                    internships at The Pennsylvania State University. We explore the benefits and
                    drawbacks of the internship model as an approach to developing digital
                    scholarship among undergraduates through detailing the challenges and
                    particularities of these experiences and analyzing mentor reflection and student
                    feedback. We conclude with a number of recommendations on best practices for
                    teaching digital scholarship through an internship model and aim to provide a
                    useful roadmap for institutions looking to follow a similar model for
                    undergraduate education in this field.</p>

                <head>​Introduction</head>
                <p>Digital scholarship has never been more important than for the current generation
                    of undergraduate students. The need to develop one’s technical expertise is not
                    just a concern for those few students aspiring to a career in academia;
                    competency in the use of computer-assisted methods has relevance for the entire
                    student population. Data analytics, knowledge representation, and dissemination
                    techniques are just a few of the many areas with broad professional application
                    to have undergone technology-driven transformation in recent decades. Society’s
                    reliance on technology is such that the digital has permeated our professional
                    lives, transforming the skillsets expected of students upon graduation.</p>
                <p>The integration of digital scholarship in the undergraduate curriculum can
                    further the students’ learning experiences and engagement with their core
                    subject matter, but there are numerous obstacles to embedding the skills
                    required into course learning objectives and outcomes. Increasing digital
                    fluencies among undergraduate students in the Arts and Humanities, in
                    particular, presents a number of key challenges: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#bjork2012">the technical proficiency of undergraduates and
                            instructors, the timeframe of a single semester or quarter, and the
                            availability of hardware and software</quote>
                        <ptr target="#bjork2012" loc="101"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p> As a consequence, institutions of higher education are responsible for exploring
                    a variety of pedagogical approaches to digital scholarship, both within and
                    beyond the confines of the classroom. By <soCalled>digital
                        scholarship,</soCalled> we refer to the practice of leveraging digital
                    methods and computer-assisted approaches to research in the broader Arts and
                    Humanities, and indeed, in related disciplines across the Social Sciences, for
                    the purposes of producing new meaning across a multitude of forms.<note> We use
                        the term <soCalled>digital scholarship</soCalled> as opposed to
                            <soCalled>Digital Humanities,</soCalled> as, while we recognize that the
                        latter term is useful in identifying the specific field or community,
                        digital scholarship at Penn State, as at many other institutions, involves
                        collaborators who identify as being from beyond the Humanities, with many
                        hailing from the Social Sciences. But for the purposes of this paper, this
                        is a minute detail, and, functionally, the terms could just as easily be
                        used interchangeably.</note> In turn, there is a need to ensure that
                    students are not simply being trained in the use of intuitive tools to produce
                    artifacts of tactical convenience, but rather, that they are developing a deep
                    understanding of the potential for new and supplementary meaning offered by
                    computational methods, as well as an awareness of the digital’s many constraints
                    and the profound repercussions that interdisciplinarity can have for established
                    practices. As Tanya Clement argues: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#clement2012">Until we consider digital humanities undergraduate
                            pedagogy in terms other than training, and rather as a pursuit that

                    </cit> In this paper, we present a case study of an engaged scholarship
                    model–which seeks to complement classroom-based learning with out-of-classroom
                    experiences–as a means to explore an alternative pedagogical approach to digital
                    scholarship. Specifically, we consider two evaluative questions: how effective
                    are internships at developing knowledge and skills in digital methods? What are
                    the optimal student learning conditions with respect to structure, guidance, and
                    supervision to nurture the development of such knowledge and skills? To address
                    these questions, we compare two undergraduate internships which proceeded as
                    part of a collaboration in 2015 between the The Pennsylvania State University
                    Libraries and the College of the Liberal Arts, which saw two independent groups
                    working with undergraduate students on research projects with a significant
                    digital component. At Penn State, there has been little distinction between the
                    Digital Humanities work that is housed within the University Libraries, and that
                    which is primarily led at the academic College-level. The structure of the
                    institution’s Digital Humanities effort, and indeed the interdisciplinary nature
                    of the field, is such that it has a range of interdepartmental
                        stakeholders.<note> For example, many of Penn State’s DH initiatives, and in
                        some cases, faculty appointments, are jointly funded by the University
                        Libraries and the College of the Liberal Arts.</note> Both projects hired
                    two paid interns, who were employed in a full-time capacity for a duration of 13
                        weeks.<note> The Pennsylvania State University Libraries has for the last 15
                        years administered a paid undergraduate internship program that is supported
                        by the generous endowment of donor, Donald W. Hamer, and former employee,
                        Marie Bednar. The endowment is to support and enhance the University
                        Libraries by providing monies for an internship program to enable
                        undergraduates to participate in an active and collaborative learning
                        experience and to gain career experiences in the student’s field of study.
                        Both of the projects outlined in this paper were supported by Bednar
                        funding.</note></p>
                <p> One pair of interns worked on a project which availed of computational
                    approaches to text analysis for the purposes of exploring the language utilized
                    by online roleplayers. These students worked primarily under the guidance of the
                    Digital Humanities Research Designer, with support from the University
                    Libraries’ Publishing and Curation Services, as well as the Office of Digital
                    Pedagogy and Scholarship in the College of the Liberal Arts. In this instance,
                    the students worked collaboratively under minimal supervision on the same
                    project, on a research question of their own choosing. Effectively, this
                    internship was an experiment to see the possibility of undergraduate digital
                    scholarly research supported by resources – time, money, and faculty/staff
                    expertise. For the purposes of clarity, these students will be referred to as
                    the <soCalled>text analysis interns.</soCalled> The other pairing, which will be
                    addressed as the <soCalled>geospatial interns,</soCalled> worked with faculty
                    and staff of the Donald W. Hamer Maps Library, and were tasked with helping the
                    library accomplish the goal of increasing digital access to the Sanborn Fire
                    Insurance map collection. This internship was comparable to a traditional
                    professional internship structurally, but with the goal of developing digital
                    skills (digitization, mapping) that transfer to academic research, along with
                    the freedom within the scope of the internship to pursue independent projects as
                    interns developed skills. While the implementation and scope of the projects
                    varied, both sought to adopt a digital-project-as-pedagogy approach, so that
                    interns developed advanced expertise through direct engagement with applied
                    research. In doing so, the intention was that interns would gain a sense of how
                    to conduct research that is of publishable quality, while seeing what is
                    required in bringing a digital project from conception to fruition. By design,
                    the experience allowed students to develop a number of their broader
                    professional skills, such as time and project management, as well as practice
                    habits of collaboration, all of which would occur in professional
                    environments.</p>

                <p>As we begin to evaluate the internship model as a way to develop digital
                    scholarship skills in students, it is helpful to situate the approach within a
                    pedagogical framework. In this case, both internships were envisioned as
                    project-based learning opportunities to enhance the digital skills and
                    professionalization of undergraduate students. This <soCalled>learn by
                        doing</soCalled> approach is common in the classroom, and can be equally
                    effective in the field, given the right conditions. In <title rend="quotes">Perspectives on Learning in Internships,</title> David Thornton Moore
                    challenges the notion that academic learning happens exclusively in the
                    classroom, and that only testing or application of that knowledge happens in the
                    field <ptr target="#moore1983" loc="40"/>. He argues: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#moore1983">Thinking in the real world may indeed supplement and
                            reinforce school-based learning; but it can also do far more to develop
                            valid and important learning in its own right</quote>
                        <ptr target="#moore1983" loc="42"/>
                    </cit>. Moore puts forth a matrix to evaluate internship experiences through
                    focusing on two dimensions: the ways one uses knowledge, and the ways one
                    relates to others in a particular learning environment. With respect to the
                    mental work of internships, he suggests that we consider how interns are
                    expected to use knowledge: is it fixed and immutable, or are students able to
                    reorganize and transform knowledge? <ptr target="#moore1983" loc="41"/>.
                    Similarly, we can evaluate the social relationships in particular contexts to
                    see the degree to which interns are relied on and able to participate in the
                    definition and creation of knowledge. This framework provides two spectrums
                    useful for evaluation: is the mental work of the internship more rote and
                    algorithmic, or creative and transformative? And are the social relationships in
                    the environment hierarchical and controlled, or collegial and participatory?
                        <ptr target="#moore1983" loc="44"/>. What follows is a comparison of the two
                    internship experiences, using Moore’s matrix where appropriate. </p>

                    <head>​Selection, Planning, and Orientation </head>
                    <p>In choosing the final candidates, each of the mentors made selections from
                        the pool of applicants based in part on students possessing complementary
                        skillsets, the ability to work collaboratively with others, and a natural
                        curiosity and willingness to learn. However, as noted, there were a number
                        of differences in the implementation of the two internships.</p>
                    <p>The geospatial interns were supervised by a project team of four–Penn State’s
                        Geospatial Services Librarian, GIS Specialist, Maps Library Manager, and
                        Research Data Management Specialist–that worked for three months prior to
                        their start to plan and scope the project. Preparations for the arrival of
                        the geospatial interns included producing a document outlining general
                        professional expectations, organizing introductory reading material on the
                        history of fire insurance mapping–of which the Sanborn collection is a
                        part–producing a step-by-step technical protocol, and developing and writing
                        about goals for project and intern learning outcomes. Interns were oriented
                        to the project by the team at the beginning of the summer and integrated
                        into all project activities from that point forward. </p>
                    <p>The text analysis interns were supervised by the Digital Humanities Research
                        Designer, though they were largely under the tutelage of the Social Sciences
                        Data Curation Fellow throughout the initial phase of their project during
                        which data management was one of the primary concerns. In preparation for
                        their start, a general scope of work, with learning goals identified and a
                        rough project timeline outlined, was developed. The project timeline
                        included general phases of research project development, with a lot of
                        flexibility built in to accommodate the students’ project. Upon their start,
                        the students were introduced to the goals and expectations of the
                        internship, but then given latitude to define the nature of their research
                        project. </p>

                <div>
                    <head>Roles and Responsibilities </head>
                    <p>The geospatial interns occupied much of their time georeferencing and
                        extracting data from the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, and then creating
                        ArcGIS web-based applications to view and search the data. After the initial
                        orientation, interns took over updating the step-by-step protocol as issues
                        arose. Interns also took the lead on researching and developing land-use
                        codes for buildings. Significant guidance was given to the interns on how to
                        create good quality metadata. The varied experiences and skills of the
                        geospatial interns were key to the project. The geospatial intern with a
                        landscape architecture background applied the use of graphics software from
                        architectural coursework. The geospatial intern with a geography background
                        made connections across geographic elements from geography coursework.
                        Interns kept a log of their daily activities and questions on a network
                        drive that was monitored by all team members and served as a diary of sorts
                        at summer’s end. Intern updates on activities, difficulties, and progress
                        were also delivered to the rest of the project team during weekly project
                        meetings.</p>
                    <p> The text analysis interns day-to-day tasks were self-directed and aligned to
                        their research goals and project design. The text analysis interns conducted
                        a significant literature review, acquired chat logs to to serve as their
                        source data, and worked with mentors to store, clean, and analyze the data.
                        Their study seeks to determine the extent to which online roleplayers make
                        use of lanauge in the construction of narrative, using computer-assisted
                        methods to idenitiy the particularities of the language of online rolepay
                            <ptr target="#osullivan2016"/>. The text analysis interns had regular
                        contact with project mentors, but the dynamic was more similar to an
                        apprentice working with a mentor than an employee working with a supervisor. </p>
                    <p>The level of direction and scaffolding provided to the interns was the most
                        significant difference in the two internship experiences. As outlined above,
                        the geospatial interns received considerable direction at the outset, and
                        regular ongoing feedback throughout the duration. With respect to the mental
                        work based on Moore’s framework, though, both sets of interns performed
                        complex tasks and advanced ways of thinking. The digital humanities interns
                        did have more autonomy over their day-to-day tasks, but they still relied on
                        significant guidance from the mentors to develop the digital research skills
                        to complete their research project. Because the geospatial interns were not
                        assigned mundane and routine tasks, but rather, charged with
                        responsibilities that demanded they apply the methods of digital scholarship
                        correctly and adapt to changes in project needs or tasks, both internships
                        provided meaningful opportunities for students to acquire and use
                            <soCalled>scholarly</soCalled> knowledge <ptr target="#moore1983" loc="42"/>. Also, the social relationships in both internships were
                        collegial and participatory. That is, while the geospatial interns worked
                        within a more traditional supervisory structure, they were also included on
                        the research team as active participants, with a shared responsibility as a
                        vital part of a major project’s progression. </p>
                    <p>The text analysis interns developed their sense of responsibility through
                        ownership, in that they were made aware from the outset that the success or
                        failure of the project would be a direct consequence of their own
                        efforts–saying this, students were made aware that
                            <soCalled>failure</soCalled> did not mean incompletion, and that
                        exploration, discovery, and learning were to be privileged over the delivery
                        of expected outcomes. Moore says, <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#moore1983">In classrooms, students rarely have the opportunity
                                to be truly responsible - not just punctual or obedient, but to have
                                others actually count on them for something meaningful</quote>
                            <ptr target="#moore1983" loc="43"/>
                        </cit>. The digital-project-as-pedagogy approach in both internships gave
                        students the chance to engage in meaningful projects that required them to
                        think critically, adapt to changing demands, collaborate with colleagues,
                        and identify when they needed guidance and feedback. </p>

                <p>In this section, mentor and student intern perspectives give some insight on the
                    approaches and outcomes of the internship experiences. The mentors provide a
                    self-reflective account of the internships, while the student perspectives are
                    based on a thematic analysis of a qualitative survey which was conducted upon
                    completion of their employment. </p>

                            Perspectives section, we give the students an opportunity to reflect on
                            their experience. However, it would have been ideal if, given a broader
                            scope, they had been given the opportunity to survey their mentors more
                            comprehensively.</note></head>
                    <p>A number of common challenges emerged across both internships, along with a
                        variety of project-specific issues that arose. The first challenge was the
                        selection of the candidates since mentors not only had to choose the
                        students with the most direct experience, but rather, to pair individuals
                        with complementary skillsets who we felt would function well within a
                        collaborative setting. The text analysis project also required students who
                        could work independently, conducting the unsupervised research necessary to
                        further both the theoretical and technical aspects of their project. In this
                        instance, particularly in relation to the text analysis project, there was
                        also a need to judge the motivations of applicants–while curiosity among
                        undergraduates is to be encouraged, there was a sense that many of the
                        students were more interested in securing an internship–<emph>any</emph>
                        internship–than they were in the Digital Humanities as a subject matter. In
                        essence, we found the selection of the candidates was not just about
                        experience, but a balance between aptitude, attitude, and interpersonal
                        skills. In both instances, the aim was to select interns who would be able
                        to leverage their skillsets in different and mutually beneficial ways. There
                        is some tension in this approach, as it opposes most other pedagogical
                        contexts: where the process of choosing candidates for an internship is
                        highly selective, in the classroom you are typically not in a position to
                        engineer your learner-dynamic. The aforementioned tension emerges from the
                        realisation that the impact of such initiatives, which are not necessarily
                        replicable in a broader range of contexts, is limited. </p>
                    <p> As outlined, one of the key differences was that the geospatial interns were
                        assigned to an existing project, whereas the text analysis students worked
                        on a research topic of their own choosing. When creating internships
                        involved with a pre-existing project, it is important to consider the level
                        of interest and student engagement. In the case of the geospatial interns,
                        student engagement was fostered by continual positive social interaction and
                        role-modeling professionalism and engagement of all team members throughout
                        the project. This generated the essential sense of ownership inherent in the
                        alternative student-driven project, while also giving students a sense of
                        collaborative responsibility. With the text analysis interns, the mentors
                        felt it was vital that the project’s focus was student-driven, as this would
                        ensure their commitment to the undertaking when faced with the inevitable
                        technical barriers throughout the processes of gathering and analysing the
                        data. In the text analysis project, any potential failure would be the
                        students’ own, whereas in the geospatial internship, students were aware
                        that their component was an essential part of a larger whole, and thus,
                        benefited from the experience that comes from working within a broader team.
                        The geospatial interns benefited from having clearer milestones and
                        indicators of success given the larger project context they were working
                        within. The text analysis interns had to navigate through the uncertainty of
                        conducting research employing digital humanities methods, absent the
                        structure of a more typical professional internship. There are tradeoffs to
                        consider in both internship models, with one privileging technical and skill
                        development, and the other prioritizing more holistic research skill
                        development. </p>
                    <p> As noted, the two projects adopted different approaches to supervision. The
                        model used to supervise the geospatial interns was one of co-supervision
                        shared by three individuals, with the supervisor in closest proximity to the
                        workstations of the interns serving as a daily point of contact. The mentors
                        felt that it was important to have daily contact with the interns in order
                        to foster collaboration, integrate them into the project, and give them
                        real-world experience working in a professional environment. The entire team
                        also met on a weekly basis to discuss aspects of the project, alternatives
                        to adopted approaches, and assess progress towards the end goals. This
                        process enabled the students to build communication and negotiation skills,
                        as well as learn to compromise on those elements of the project where a
                        unified vision was needed. In contrast, the text analysis interns worked
                        very much in isolation, liaising with their mentors as their research
                        requirements dictated. Over the course of the project, direct meetings were
                        predominantly reserved for those instances where the students required
                        instruction in a specific methodology. There were some clear benefits to
                        this approach, in that the students seemed to cope well with the demands of
                        a project’s initial research requirements: they produced a very thorough
                        literature review, and were proactive in the gathering of a suitable
                        dataset. However, the chief supervisor also noticed considerable scope creep
                        at various junctures, and that between meetings, students had wandered from
                        the guidelines offered during previous interactions. On multiple occasions,
                        the mentor found it necessary to remind students of their central research
                        question, and how best to re-focus their efforts on answering that question.
                        Upon reflection, this approach gave the students a real sense of the demands
                        of independent or small-scale collaborative research - which is still the
                        major component of research-based positions, even in the Digital Humanities
                        - but that some further direction would have certainly helped the students
                        achieve their intended deliverables. </p>
                    <p>The geospatial interns were exposed to other units and departments within the
                        library so that they could situate their projects within a wider
                        professional context. It was important for them to learn how the project
                        related to other units in terms of deadlines, roles, contributions, and
                        limitations. As noted, the text analysis interns worked independently, and
                        so they did not further their understanding of how various departments
                        contribute to the institution’s overarching strategies. It was hoped that
                        they would spend some time working with the Digitization and Preservation
                        department, but the dataset that their research necessitated did not require
                        digitization, and so this element was removed. The relative autonomy allowed
                        the students to see how scholarly research, and particularly digital
                        scholarly research, is conducted – a significant amount of independent work
                        with points of collaboration with specialists when the project dictates that
                        level of support. Mentors observed that the students’ enthusiasm waned in
                        the final weeks of the project. This may have been due to the length of the
                        undertaking, as most undergraduates are not used to projects of this scope,
                        but it may also have been due to a lack of stimulation in what was an
                        isolated setting. We hoped that their interest in the research project would
                        be sufficient to overcome this issue, but there is certainly some merit to
                        suggesting that students should engage with a variety of units and
                        departments if only as an exercise in breaking the monotony of independent
                        research and providing them with some additional context and routine, as
                        well as introducing and fostering a sense of community. </p>
                    <p>Professionalization was an important part of both internships, the intention
                        being that students would emerge from the experience having developed more
                        confidence in their ability to negotiate workplace dynamics. This was
                        accomplished, in that interns appeared to increase their involvement as the
                        projects progressed, making vital contributions towards the future
                        directions of the projects. Our implementations suggest that a major risk of
                        the internship model is that, in the event that students do not engage, the
                        investment of mentors’ time is a risk without guarantee of concrete rewards,
                        both in terms of project output and student learning. One of the failings in
                        the text analysis internship was the student engagement with the more
                        technical aspects of the project. The nature of the dataset was such that
                        students spent a considerable time gathering and cleaning chatlogs from
                        online games, leaving little time for the analysis phase. While working
                        through a series of computer-assisted methodologies with the interns, their
                        supervisor felt that the students struggled with the volume of information,
                        and had at that point suffered from a loss of motivation. To that end, while
                        they drove the research objective, and gained a holistic understanding of a
                        digital project’s lifecycle, the extent to which they expanded upon their
                        technical expertise is less certain. From the perspective of its product,
                        the project was a success, in that the student produced a research report of
                        some significance. From a pedagogical perspective, the students now
                        understand what constitutes rigorous digital scholarship, and the steps
                        required to accomplish such. However, it would have been better if more
                        structure had been provided so as to ensure that they also emerged with more
                        methodological expertise, as this was one of the expected learning outcomes.
                        Supervisors of the geospatial interns reviewed their ouputs during multiple
                        stages of development, including the overall aesthetics of the output,
                        accuracy, consistency, and thoroughness, an approach which the text analysis
                        project could also have been adopted.</p>
                    <p>In terms of determining the interns’ transformation of information, based on
                        observations of their knowledge and experiences at the beginning of the
                        internship compared to their experiences at the end of the internship, it is
                        evident that the work conducted led to a transformative experience. This
                        transformation can be characterized as the development of knowledge about
                        processes and topics that enable the learners to take their skills and
                        experiences from the internships and transfer them to new situations and
                        activities. Furthermore, these experiences informed the mentors on the
                        importance of focusing on the specific needs of the intern, and how such is
                        often challenged by the surrounding organizational, administrative, and
                        project needs. Internships in this field should privilege the development of
                        a student’s digital skills, rather than seek to accomplish any specific
                        research output, though accomplishing such should be encouraged, and indeed
                        act as part of the means by which success is measured. Thus, an
                        intern-centric undergraduate learning experience should be adopted, wherein
                        topics on the periphery of core curricula can be integrated into the
                        project. </p>

                    <p>As this study is focused on the experiential aspects of the internships as
                        pedagogical models, a qualitative approach was adopted for the analysis of
                        the student perspectives. A common survey was issued to the interns, in
                        which they were asked to respond to three questions:<note> Students were
                            aware of the purposes of the survey, and gave permission for their
                            responses to be directly quoted in this paper.</note>

                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item>What skills did you develop during this internship, and which do you
                            feel you will use again? </item>

                        <item>Were there aspects of this internship that you found disappointing or

                    </list>
                    <p>The questions were deliberately open, so as to not lead student responses.
                        Using thematic analysis, we approached the data with two concerns: what
                        insights could be gained in the development of the students’ research,
                        technical, and professional skills, and what other, unanticipated themes,
                        emerged across each of the groups? It is worth noting that students were
                        seen as collaborators throughout this process, their contributions to this
                        study a key part of its scholarly value. Furthermore, their participation
                        was very much a success in the sense that they produced outstanding work of
                        considerable substance.</p>

                        <p>A number of themes emerged from the respondents, the most prominent of
                            which was <soCalled>problem solving.</soCalled> The interns agreed that
                            this was both the primary skill they developed, as well as the most
                            beneficial aspect of their internship. This is a positive finding, in
                            that it reflects the pedagogical ethos of the Humanities and Social
                            Sciences, seeking to foster critical thinking among undergraduates. It
                            also shows how students, with appropriate training, can learn how
                            unfamiliar technologies and techniques can be applied to the creation of
                            new knowledge and meaning. Interns also drew much attention to the value
                            of those transferable generic skills which they felt would be of use in
                            their future careers. Several of the interns also referenced specific
                            technical skills - it was particularly encouraging to see that the text
                            analysis interns recognized both the technical expertise and broader
                            professional competencies which they developed, as their chief
                            supervisor placed little emphasis on the latter. They clearly realized
                            the broader professional value of the internship, as well as the
                            potential for applying digital methods to a broad range of activities
                            beyond academia: <q>I developed skills in technical writing and reading,
                                experimental design, data analysis, data management, and team-based
                                research. I feel that [these] skills will be very useful in my

                        <p>The experiences of the interns were clearly impacted by the interpersonal
                            dynamics of their projects:<q>Working with another intern to help solve
                                problems and make compromises and decisions was one of the most
                                important aspects...</q>; <q>I feel like our project really
                                benefited from two of us working together … bouncing ideas off of
                                one another, dividing up the tasks either of us were best suited to,
                                but each contributing even when the other took the lead on one
                                step.</q> The geospatial interns also benefited from working with
                            professionals across different departments and units, while the text
                            analysis students articulated that they achieved the initiative’s
                            primary objective of giving them an understanding of how to bring a
                            digital project through its complete lifecycle, from concept to
                            fruition. A related theme–engaged scholarship as having the potential to
                            offer more than what is permitted in a classroom setting–also emerged:
                                <q>In school, all of our work is done in a single semester and often
                                alone, so working on a project that required we not only think about
                                immediate outcomes, but also future uses and applications and
                                collaborating with others was very helpful.</q></p>
                        <p> The majority of students cited a lack of structure as being one of the
                            drawbacks. This criticism was far more evident among the text analysis
                            students, where they were largely left to work independently. Extensive
                            planning was conducted for the geospatial internship, so a reference to
                            a lack of structure in this instance is possibly due to adjustments
                            being required as the project progressed. This is a natural consequence
                            of any large-scale collaborative project, and so ideally, the need for
                            some level of uncertainty would have been appreciated by the students. A
                            related frustration–the pursuit of blind alleys–was cited by the text
                            analysis interns, which again, is inherent in any such undertaking, and
                            something which we hope they now realize. The extent to which the text
                            analysis interns were allowed to work independently could perhaps be
                            revised in any future iterations of this initiative, in that the
                            students clearly wanted more supervision. The post was advertized and
                            described during the interview process as being an independent study,
                            wherein the internship would largely be driven by the students’ own
                            interests and ability to develop new expertise under limited
                            supervision. The extent to which undergraduates can comprehend the
                            significance of such an absence of structure was arguably
                            underestimated. A better approach might have been to facilitate some
                            preliminary, even extensive discussion at the start of the internship
                            about what <soCalled>independent study</soCalled> means, especially if
                            this type of academic experience is new to the students. This could be
                            followed by periodical reviews of the <emph>format</emph> of the
                            undertaking and its ramifications for the work. It is also worth noting
                            that the students made no references to any difficulties in mastering
                            particular materials or tasks, which would suggest that this model could
                            benefit from students receiving feedback on where they excelled, and
                            where further improvements could be sought, so as to increase their own
                            awareness of their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

                <p>A similar approach to that utilized in the geospatial internship was pioneered at
                    Bucknell University, where undergraduates worked as research assistants on the

                            temporally) allows for the development of rich, deep knowledge in both
                            digital tools and research subject matter. Indeed, extending the
                            faculty-student collaboration to include students from outside
                            traditional humanities departments also reifies the value of
                            interdisciplinary research at an early level and reflects the
                            professional DH research model employed by larger-scale
                            projects.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#faull2015"/>
                    </cit> The experience at Penn State, both in the geospatial and text analysis
                    internships, support these claims. Restating Moore’s spectrums of mental work,
                    knowledge engagement and social relations, undergraduate student internships can
                    be interpreted as serving two distinct but overlapping roles in student
                    preparation. First, they can be seen as a direct extension of classroom work
                    where information literacy and critical thinking–or research–are the focus;
                    application outside of the classroom is the learning environment, and learning
                    outcomes are evaluated in relation to student preparation for further engagement
                    with academics. Alternatively, internships also acknowledge the gaps left by
                    classroom preparation and a response to the reality that most students will not
                    become professional academics, but rather will work in a variety of professional
                    settings. In a student-centric internship model, we encourage advisors and
                    supervisors to be somewhat flexible in adjusting the structure and expectations
                    of their interns according to their stated professional goals rather than
                    preconceived learning objectives or project goals. Although not by design, both
                    internship case studies were successful in this regard, perhaps as a result of
                    careful review and selection of intern candidates. As has already been
                    emphasized, the selection step of an internship plays an important role in
                    setting the stage for internship success and failure from both the perspective
                    of the students and advisors. Any similar undertakings would be best advised to
                    engineer a dynamic which represents the best possible opportunity for success,
                    pairing complementary skillsets and personalities, though these can be difficult
                    to assess, particularly the latter, through a limited application process.</p>
                <p> Other institutions looking to implement similar models need to be very clear on
                    their purpose: is the aim to have students develop their ability to negotiate
                    the workplace, or learn how to do advanced research? It is possible to
                    accomplish both, but depending on restrictions on time and resources, it may not
                    be possible to achieve an equilibrium. Nor is it desirable to give students a
                    false sense of a particular dynamic: the reality is that, major
                    interdisciplinary projects excluded, most scholarship is still conducted in a
                    largely isolated manner. This is not to say that we support the status quo, but
                    merely acknowledge that it would be irresponsible to have students believe that
                    a career in scholarship, particularly in the Humanities, will be predominantly
                    occupied by collaborative endeavours–this might change, but most hiring and
                    promotion committees still privilege <soCalled>traditional</soCalled> forms of
                    scholarship. Regardless of an internship’s stated purpose, students should
                    develop competencies beyond those cultivated in the classroom, and the
                    supervisory team should stress the importance of transferable skills, so that
                    students can see the utility of any newfound expertise. Internships provide an
                    opportunity to liberate students of the constraints of the classroom, affording
                    them the chance to make and learn from mistakes, to explore potentially
                    fruitless strands of inquiry, and delve deeper into topics of personal interest.
                    When developing a program model in such a context, Moore’s framework is helpful
                    to review, considering the extent to which the work will be rote rather than
                    creative or transformative: will there be enough of an intellectual engagement
                    for the internship to be worth it for the student? How controlled is the
                    situation? Will interns have the ability to make a real difference in the
                    project as equals or is the information very controlled and top-down? </p>
                <p> Defining suitable barometers for the measurement of success also presents a
                    challenge. The primary purpose of the text analysis internship was to give
                    students a sense of what is required in the completion of a digital project, a
                    condition which, from assessment of their final research outputs, was a success.
                    However, it cannot be said with confidence that they could replicate some of the
                    methodologies that were utilized without assistance, and a future iteration of
                    the initiative would do well to ensure that the project’s dataset can be
                    gathered quickly, allowing more time for students to gain familiarity with some
                    of the more technical aspects. This experience was shared by the geospatial
                    interns, who spent a considerable amount of time having to digitize physical
                    materials. When defining those objectives which will determine the success of a
                    project, it is essential to allow for the time necessary to investigate
                    challenges and problems, both technical and intellectual, that arise throughout
                    the research process. Supervisors must also account for seemingly obvious yet
                    often overlooked social realities, like students wanting to take holidays during
                    the summer semester, which was when these internships took place. </p>
                <p>The danger in such programs is that mentors will impose their own value systems
                    on their participants, expecting them to adhere to scholarly principles and
                    standards that undergraduates cannot reasonably be expected to have attained.
                    Even faculty with extensive teaching experience might find that they are
                    demanding too much of participants who are embarking on what is likely their
                    first major research undertaking, and expectations must be continuously
                    revisited <emph>before</emph> the project begins so as to ensure intended
                    outcomes are realistic. While it is important to have a clear set of
                    expectations before the project begins, flexibility is crucial, as it affords
                    interns the scope necessary to pursue unforeseen developments, thus emphasizing
                    learning outcomes over tangible deliverables. Students must not be afraid to
                        <soCalled>fail,</soCalled> for any such fear will restrict critical and
                    creative exploration. Equally, considering the value of the opportunity, the
                    demands placed on interns should be as challenging as they are reasonable, and
                    mentors need to be comfortable reprimanding any participant whose performance
                    might not be meeting expectations–this is difficult, in that you may well be
                    dealing with inexperienced individuals with whom you have started to build a
                    rapport atypical of what is usually established between faculty and
                    undergraduates. Striking a balance between authority and understanding is a
                    leadership quality that is not easily attained.</p>
                <p> Institutional limitations must also be considered–the reality of engaged
                    scholarship is such that it is not always feasible. Penn State, and other
                    institutions like Bucknell, where similar programs are already in place, has a
                    network of faculty and staff whose remit is to support digital scholarship and
                    undertakings of this nature. At other institutions, where faculty may be working
                    without appropriate support from suitably-qualified peers, implementing such an
                    approach might prove to be far more challenging. Having undergone significant
                    investment in personnel whose mandate was to develop the institution’s capacity
                    for digital scholarship, Penn State is in a position to pursue such initiatives.
                    The culture of the departments involved is such that the inherent power
                    differentials in staff and faculty-like employee classifications did not
                    influence the internships–the projects operated as a nearly flat hierarchy, with
                    all faculty, staff, and students contributing as important stakeholders. In a
                    different context, wherein such an initiative might be contained within the
                    hierarchical structures embedded within an institution, one could envision
                    problematic scenarios where student time is prioritised in terms of labour, and
                    dichotomies within employee classifications are reinforced in the minds of
                    emerging scholars. The danger in these models, which involve both intellectual
                    and practical components, is that interns might develop false scholar versus
                    technician personas, based on the perceived roles of contributors. It is
                    imperative to the future of digital scholarship, which has considerable issues
                    around the division and acknowledgement of labour, that artificial
                    power-structures are not reinforced in the minds of the next generation. This
                    extends to both the students <ptr target="#dipressietal"/> and their perceptions
                    of the roles played by all those staff enabling and contributing to the
                    internship. At institutions where faculty-staff classifications exist, measures
                    must be taken to ensure that each partner is encouraged to make a direct
                    contribution to the scholarship’s intellectual vision, and that any technical
                    effort is recognized for its inherent value. </p>
                <p>Administrative support must also be in place, particularly if course credit is
                    going to be one of the motivating factors for students. The geospatial interns
                    had the option of obtaining credit through their respective departments, an
                    option which one of them pursued. While a commitment to alternative modes of
                    learning is present in particular schools and departments at Penn State, one
                    cannot assume that cultural differences do not exist across disciplines, and
                    that similar administrative support for engaged scholarship would be present
                    across the entire institution. Cost is also a major consideration, particularly
                    here, where the Bednar program allowed us to pay students for their
                    participation in the internships.<note> Cost also relates to scale and
                        departmental or school commitment. Success for a digital scholarship
                        internship program might be defined by increased scale, which itself is
                        dependent on the growth in the number of faculty engaged in these approaches
                        and on commitment by college/departmental administrations.</note> The
                    likelihood is that most institutions would not be in a position to pay interns,
                    nor would they have the capacity to provide the technology necessary for
                    students to pursue digital modes of scholarship. Unpaid internships might only
                    serve to further the field’s current issues with diversity, in that they would
                    be exclusive to those students in the privileged position of not having to
                    consider remuneration when pursuing extracurricular placements. </p>
                <p>Engaged approaches to teaching digital scholarship provide a mechanism to explore
                    areas of interest in a collaborative and multidisciplinary manner. A digital
                    project requires contact with primary and secondary sources through the lens of
                    digital technologies. By creating opportunities to take an inquiry and explore
                    it in a project environment, interns are learning the importance of
                    understanding how these sources can be negotiated and manipulated through the
                    digital, and what the deep and significant repercussions of this act might be.
                    Given the resources, appropriate planning, and clear objectives and success
                    metrics, we conclude that the internship model can be a highly effective
                    learning experience for students, both to develop their digital literacies and
                    professional skills. With the right guidance and meaningful work, the
                    digital-project-as-pedagogy can be a powerful teaching approach in the digital
                    humanities. </p>
