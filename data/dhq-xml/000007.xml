                  <p>Melissa Terras hails from Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, and ignored
				computers until her final year of her undergraduate MA, in History of Art and English
				Literature at the University of Glasgow (1998). Discovering the Internet (and something
				that she was good at) led to an MSc in IT (Software and Systems), also at Glasgow in
				1999. In 2002 she completed her doctorate at the University of Oxford, which was a joint
				project between the Department of Engineering Science and the Centre for the Study of
				Ancient Documents, on using image processing and artificial intelligence to try and
				<q>read</q> the Roman documents from Vindolanda.</p>
                  <p>Melissa then spent a year at the Royal Academy of Engineering, as assistant manager of
					the Policy unit, providing impartial advice to the UK government on matters scientific.
					Now at University College London, she is a lecturer in the School of Library, Archive,
					and Information Studies on Internet Technologies, Web Publishing, and Digital Resources
					in the Humanities. She is acting Secretary of ALLC (2005/6) and an Officer of the
					Association for Computers and the Humanities (2005-8), as well as being involved in
					other consultancy activities within the Digital Humanities field. She is interested in
					computational techniques which would allow research in the Humanities that would

      <body>
         
            <p>Welcome to the first issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly: a new, online,
				open-access journal published by the <ref target="http://www.digitalhumanities.org">Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations</ref>. This issue has been a long
				time in the making. The first organizational efforts began in June 2005, and the
				journal’s technical development started soon after. Developing a new journal — on a
				new publication model, with an innovative technical architecture — is not an
				undertaking for the faint-hearted. That level of challenge, however, was central to
				the venture from the start: the world may not need yet another academic journal, but
				it does need experiments in how academic journals are published. DHQ is conceived as
				just such an experiment, conducted by the community best suited to make it a success
				and learn from the results.</p>
            <p>What is experimental about DHQ? First, it is an open-access journal, freely
				available to the public, and published under a <ref target="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons
					license</ref> that permits copying, distribution, and transmission of the work
				for non-commercial purposes, as long as attribution is made. Copyright remains with
				the author, so that DHQ serves as a gathering point for the best digital humanities
				research, without becoming a barrier to further publication or reuse. Second, DHQ
				treats its articles as contributions to a growing research archive that will itself
				become an object of study. All articles are given a detailed XML encoding to mark
				genres, names, citations, and other features that may serve the future scholar
				interested in the emergence of the digital humanities as a research field. As
				articles accumulate, the journal’s interface will develop to exploit this markup
				through nuanced searching, visualization tools, and other modes of exploration.
				Finally, DHQ seeks to encourage experimentation with the forms of scholarly
				publication. The journal itself is multimodal and evolving: we accept multimedia and
				interactive submissions, and very shortly will be adding a blog and the ability to
				comment on DHQ articles. We also look forward to opportunities for collaboration
				with <ref target="http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/"><title rend="italic">LLC</title></ref>, perhaps involving co-publication of articles with complex multimedia
				components. To the extent that our rhetorical habits are partly the product of the
				print medium, with its familiar reference structures, ordering conventions, and
				practical limitations, we would like to see whether those habits can adapt and
				mutate — or, at the very least, become more self-conscious — when given the opportunity.
				The opportunity to include interactive media, links to data sets, diagrams and
				audiovisual materials may in itself shift the way arguments are made. We expect
				these changes to happen slowly, if at all: we will be publishing plenty of articles
				in familiar genres and formats for some time to come. But we welcome thoughtful
				experiments, even risky ones, and we hope our readers will read them in the same
				spirit.</p>
            <p>In all of these ways, DHQ is guided by the desire to reach outwards beyond the
				immediate community of ADHO, <ref target="http://www.ach.org">ACH</ref>, and <ref target="http://www.allc.org">ALLC</ref>, and to complement rather than duplicate
				the function of LLC, the journal of record for these organizations. Digital
				humanities is by its nature a hybrid domain, crossing disciplinary boundaries and
				also traditional barriers between theory and practice, technological implementation
				and scholarly reflection. But over time this field has developed its own
				orthodoxies, its internal lines of affiliation and collaboration that have become
				intellectual paths of least resistance. In a world — perhaps scarcely imagined two
				decades ago — where digital issues and questions are connected with nearly every area
				of endeavor, we cannot take for granted a position of centrality. On the contrary,
				we have to work hard even to remain aware of, let alone to master, the numerous
				relevant domains that might affect our work and ideas. And at the same time, we need
				to work hard to explain our work and ideas and to make them visible to those outside
				our community who may find them useful.</p>
            <p>DHQ thus seeks to serve as a bridge between the historic constituencies of the
				digital humanities — the members of ADHO and its affiliate organizations — and the many
				closely related domains that have emerged. Being open-access, it can offer a freely
				accessible view of the field to those who are curious about it, and can also provide
				a publication venue that is visible to readers (and potential authors) from these
				other domains. Our hope is that DHQ can function as a meeting ground, a space of
				mutual encounter where we ask and explain, rather than assuming, why our work is
				interesting and how it is relevant. This approach places a heavy burden on the peer
				review and editorial process, since it must play a dual role: not only to ensure
				that we identify and accept what is of the highest quality, but also to help authors
				address the entire DHQ audience and make the full value of their work as clear as
				possible. The revision process should never reduce the complexity of an argument,
				but it should make the argument — and its significance — clear to an intelligent reader
				from any field.</p>
            <p> It is tempting, in the first issue of a journal by this name, to pose the question,
				<q>What is digital humanities?</q> and perhaps to attempt
				an answer. Instead, we defer this question to the future, with the expectation that
				it will be answered, or at least addressed, in the annals that are to be written and
				published here. Not the first issue, nor even the tenth, will give a sense of the
				emerging shape: it will take time for the range of submissions to represent the real
				contours of the field. And there will be a further dialectical process of reading
				and authorship, provocation and response, through which we can expect the field to
				evolve. The question for this journal is thus not <q>What is
					digital humanities?</q> but <q>How can we shape the
						digital humanities?</q> and we hope the process will reward your attention.
				Join the experiment — <ref target="dhq/submissions/">submit</ref>, <ref target="dhq/submissions/peerreviewing.html">review</ref>, read, comment, and
				enjoy! </p>
