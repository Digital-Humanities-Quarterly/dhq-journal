                <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration brings the benefit of multiple perspectives to a
                    research project, yet it also provides opportunities for reflection on each
                    discipline’s knowledge base. This article presents a case study in
                    interdisciplinary collaboration between two disparate fields, web development
                    and anthropology. We explore the challenges of translating between domains with
                    differing values, aims and methodologies, as well as issues that arose for us
                    during the development of a web application designed to provide a digital output
                    of an ethnographic project. We consider our experience using the Agile style of
                    software development, which emphasises rapid prototyping, iteration and even
                    failure. In the long run, we find negative experiences in web development can be
                    more valuable than the positive ones. The concept of ‘knowledge brokerage’ is a
                    useful term to describe the collaboration between the academics – who were
                    forced to conceptualise their data in new ways – and the developer – who
                    negotiated these transitions between abstract information and binary data, and
                    between academia and a public-facing web application.</p>

                <p>Interdisciplinarity is a key concept driving many calls for collaborative
                    research and innovative teaching in the humanities. The benefits of
                    interdisciplinarity in education (and research) include <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#mansilla2007">an integration of knowledge, freedom of inquiry, and
                            innovation</quote>
                        <ptr target="#mansilla2007" loc="217"/>
                    </cit> which is considered crucial to solving contemporary social problems and
                    enhancing understanding of the arts and literature. That said, it is often
                    difficult to embark on given that <q>disciplinary silos and discourse
                        communities… stand as barriers to interdisciplinary research and
                        education</q> which in turn keep researchers from benefitting from each
                    other's knowledge <ptr target="#borrego2010" loc="62"/>. This article recounts
                    the story of an interdisciplinary research project (which united the fields of
                    web development and cultural anthropology) that highlights failure as an
                    important part of the research process. As an example, we reflected on the
                    frequent crashing of the website by the anthropologists as they tried to input
                    new material in a custom content management system. The anthropologists often
                    entered data in ways that yielded the message <q>502 Bad
                        Gateway</q>, an error which appears whenever two servers running
                    simultaneously aren’t communicating. In the early days of the project, we came
                    to see this phrase as a metaphor for the process of working collaboratively,
                    with our web project traversing many gateways, between multiple viewpoints,
                    priorities and interests, holding fast in some instances, and breaking down in
                        others.<note> Note that the pronoun <soCalled>we</soCalled> is used throughout
                        the paper when referring to actions and ideas shared by the
                        interdisciplinary team. When designers and anthropologists are isolated in
                        their experience, this will be indicated appropriately.</note> Despite its
                    negative connotations, we employ this phrase constructively to explain the
                    negotiated, stop and start process that characterised the working relationship
                    between stakeholders. Forte, who has examined the social and cultural
                        <soCalled>constructedness</soCalled> of websites, has written about the
                    process of organising ethnographic data and recorded sounds as the: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#forte2005">product of intense social organization, brokerage and
                            exchange, revealing quite a different story from that may appear on the
                            seemingly placid surface of a site. Websites do not just tell stories;
                            they contain stories within them about themselves.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#forte2005" loc="94"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>This idea that a <soCalled>seemingly placid</soCalled> website conceals a dynamic
                    and complex creative process that lies beneath also speaks to a more specific
                    definition of what a digital repository is; it is not just a storage site, it is
                    also a place to think through, to imagine what is not present and to interpret
                    what is. <title rend="italic"><ref target="http://sonicjapan.clab.org.au">Sonic
                            Japan</ref></title> aims to be such a website, communicating these
                    meanings by sharing sounds field-recorded in the sonically intense environments
                    of Japan through a browser-based web application.<note> The sound data was
                        collected as part of the Australian Research Council project <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> DP130102035 and involved the
                        researchers travelling to Japan to conduct ethnographic fieldwork in
                        different locations, collecting sound recordings of different events and
                        activities accompanied by interpretative text.</note> The site was created
                    by an interdisciplinary team comprised of researchers in anthropology working
                    with a graduate student intern (in the University of Melbourne’s Masters of
                    Information Technology program<note> This internship was initially for 12 weeks
                        and was then extended into a research assistant position attached to the
                        research project.</note>) who served multiple roles of product manager,
                    designer and web developer (and is hereafter referred to as <soCalled>the web
                        developer</soCalled>, even when discussing product and design concerns).</p>
                <p>From an academic perspective, this project required a web presence because the
                    researchers wanted a digital format for a broader audience and to provide a more
                    immersive and holistic view of sonic practice through multimedia, including
                    audio, text, and images. This requirement echoes a call from researchers in the
                    digital humanities who wish to challenge <soCalled>the primacy of
                        text</soCalled> to produce <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">an expanded concept of the sensorium of humanistic
                            knowledge</quote>
                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="121"/>
                    </cit>. Scholars such as Bellamy <ptr target="#bellamy2012"/> and Murray and
                    Wiercinski <ptr target="#murray2014"/>have described digital humanities projects
                    in terms of the ways in which software practitioners build tools for humanities
                    scholars in the earlier <soCalled>input</soCalled> phases of the research cycle.
                    Yet, <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> can be understood as a digital
                    research <emph>output</emph> which demonstrates the intersection of utility (in
                    terms of its educative dissemination of research findings) and art (as a
                    creative and expressive product). </p>
                <p>This article explores what was learned about web development, anthropology and
                    interdisciplinary collaboration as the web developer and anthropologists came to
                    work together. Web developers and academics both work within standard
                    constraints such as time, budget and role management. The anthropologists,
                    however, had to reconceptualise the way they viewed their data to produce <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title>. For instance, rather than merely writing
                    up their impressions of the field and adding analytic comments, they had to ask
                    themselves new questions regarding information and ethical considerations, such
                    as: What metadata needs to be attached to the sound files to be meaningfully
                    understood in a digital domain? How do ethical requirements regarding privacy
                    and anonymity in human research interface with the precision of digital
                    representation in terms of mapping and description?</p>
                <p>For the developer, on the other hand, the challenges around the translation and
                    interpretation of data in the digital realm were not unique, because software
                    engineers routinely work with non-specialists. Rather, her challenge was to
                    effectively act as a <soCalled>knowledge broker</soCalled> between the
                    academics, their data, the software, and a public audience. Meyer defines
                    knowledge brokers as those who <quote rend="inline" source="#meyer2010">facilitate the creation,
                        sharing, and use of knowledge</quote>; they also <q>establish and maintain
                        links between researchers and their audience</q> and <q>link know-how,
                        know-why, and know-who [...] in the public domain as much as in the private
                        domain</q>
                    <ptr target="#meyer2010" loc="119"/>. This definition was an apt one for the web
                    developer, who was focussed on taking the anthropologists’ data to a lay
                    audience via the website, a distinct task outside the anthropologists’ comfort
                    zone of writing for academic audiences.</p>
                <p>As in often the case in independent study projects, the web developer took on the
                    project with vague goals, no clear workflow and no budget to be completed within
                    the 12-week internship period. Despite this, she used an iterative development
                    style called Agile to overcome some of these obstacles and was able to launch a
                    prototype site within the timeframe. Presenting initial user interface
                    prototypes to the anthropologists helped expose further goals and design
                    questions. Bugs emerging during the implementation of a content management
                    system for <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan’s</title> sounds also invited a
                    re-examination of code and engineering methodology. Later on, deployment on the
                    web led the developer to re-evaluate product development methodology, design
                    decisions and project priorities. While the anthropologists had no experience
                    with the startup mantra of <soCalled>fail fast, fail often</soCalled> (and were
                    generally frightened at the thought of visible failure!), they soon found that
                    the refrain certainly applied in the anthropology domain, and had undeniable
                    benefits.</p>
                <p> In the first part of this article we outline the gaps emerging when the two
                    fields of web development and anthropology collaborated on this project. Then,
                    we discuss the application of web development methodologies for <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title>, focusing on design questions and the
                    critical intersection between the interdisciplinary teams’ various definitions
                    of <soCalled>success</soCalled> through prototyping and iteration. Lastly, we
                    reflect on the hindrances and opportunities that emerged from our
                    interdisciplinary partnership, using the metaphor of a <soCalled>bad
                        gateway</soCalled> for the learning experience. </p>

                <head>Anthropology versus Web Development</head>
                <p>Anthropology sits somewhere between the social sciences and the humanities, and
                    since the 1980s has been known for its reflexive and critical gaze. Ingold notes
                    that <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#ingold1994">[p]erhaps uniquely among academic disciplines,
                            anthropology thrives on the art of its own perpetual deconstruction.
                            Caught at the intersection of two cross-cutting tensions, between the
                            humanities and the natural sciences on the one hand, and between
                            theoretical speculation and lived experience on the other, it leaves
                            little room for intellectual complacency.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#ingold1994" loc="xii"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>On the other hand, web development is more concerned with synthesis than
                    analysis, particularly the synthesis of tools and systems to solve problems.
                    Developing <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> prompted both anthropologist
                    and developer team members to rethink their definition of
                        <soCalled>data</soCalled>. In object-oriented programming, data is typically
                    a series of <emph>fields</emph> or <emph>attributes</emph> which together form
                    an <emph>object</emph> analogous to a real-world concept. For example, an
                    employee in X Department with salary Y, position Z and employee number 12345;
                    this collection of attributes creates an instance of an Employee. Of course, the
                    employee’s humanity is more complex than that, but a computer
                        <soCalled>thinks</soCalled> only in ones and zeroes, and data must be
                    parceled into discrete units for the machine to process. Thus, in computer
                    science, data is a specific type of approximation of empirical reality. An
                    object is an abstraction to the developer. Software engineering feeds on
                    discovering abstractions, which form the basis of flexible, maintainable
                    systems.</p>
                <p>In winnowing down a complex world to one of binaries, or of fields and objects,
                    the representation of nuanced ideas can be limited. Compared to software
                    engineers, anthropologists see their data as constantly constructed,
                    contextualised and contested in time, in space, and by the individuals involved
                    as demonstrated through differences in language, sociocultural position and
                    value. Categories are not so objectively defined, and often have blurred
                    boundaries. Schreibman, Sievers and Unsworth note that collaboration in the
                    digital humanities brings to light these differences, especially in the case of
                    what they call <quote rend="inline" source="#schreibman2004">knowledge-bearing artifacts</quote>: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#schreibman2004">The process of such representation – especially so when
                            done with the attention to detail and the consistency demanded by the
                            computing environment – requires humanists to make explicit what they
                            know about their material and to understand the ways in which that
                            material exceeds or escapes representation.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#schreibman2004"/>
                    </cit>
                </p>
                <p>In this case, the web design and development process pushed the anthropologists
                    to re-evaluate their data not only in terms of its content and communicative
                    impact, but also what they themselves understood about their relationship to the
                    data and how that relationship shaped its presentation and meaning. For example,
                    one of the initial design proposals was to situate each sound as a marker on an
                    interactive map, using the Google Maps API. Some sounds recorded in-place could
                    be attributed to a single latitude and longitude point, but what of a sound
                    recorded in motion? What of sounds recorded at the same site, but at different
                    times? The anthropologists, as experts in ethnographic writing, had less
                    experience in thinking about how best to organise and present the complexity of
                    their material in ways other than text. However, the web developer faced the
                    challenge of translating and ordering anthropological data into a version
                    appropriate for a computer to manipulate, without sacrificing too much of the
                    data’s cultural significance and analytic potential. Specifically, the
                    anthropological data had to be modeled into objects with fields and data types
                    to introduce enough abstraction to create a flexible system. Because the
                    researchers had <soCalled>been there</soCalled> when the data was recorded, they
                    often had very specific ideas about how it should be presented, and these
                    requirements were not always logical to a developer aiming to design a web
                    system based on repeat functionality through abstraction.</p>

                <div>
                    <head>Differing Aims and Methodologies</head>
                    <p>Software engineering aims to solve problems with software systems. All
                        methodologies that follow primarily stem from The User. Though business
                        models and technical constraints are also considered during development,
                        software that purely emphasizes the software engineer – instead of the user
                        – would result in a product with limited potential. Thus, the software
                        development life-cycle aims to satisfy users within constraints. This
                        life-cycle typically includes phases of requirements engineering, design,
                        implementation, testing and maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, humanities research generally aims to observe, transcribe and seek
                        to understand human experience. While engineering and humanities projects
                        both consider audiences, in engineering the audience is the consumer of a
                        product who generates the goal through some need or desire. In the
                        humanities, however, the author draws material from the empirical world to
                        articulate questions that address problems. Humanities research can be seen
                        as a form of both translation and authorial self-expression; the audience
                        that consumes the research output is considered but likely not the primary
                            <emph>driver</emph> of the output. A humanities research life-cycle
                        would occur in roughly this order: project formulation, data gathering,
                        writing, editing, submission for peer review, revision and publication. The
                        design of output takes place after data collection, and before and during
                        writing, and the text becomes the final product that appears to require no
                        maintenance after publication (even if it may attract external critique and
                        response). Humanities research has an interest in process and change, yet
                        its outcomes – as in published findings as text – are in general static and
                        unchanging. </p>
                    <p>If these textual products are mostly unchanging compared to software
                        products, these methodology differences become even starker when considering
                        Agile software development. Agile software development is
                            <emph>iterative</emph>; rather than move from extensive requirements
                        analysis to a <soCalled>final product</soCalled> over months or years, the
                        developer rapidly cycles through requirements, design, implementation and
                        test, often in cycles of two weeks or less. Its overall
                            <soCalled>philosophy</soCalled> emphasises working software, customer
                        focus, collaboration and flexibility, thus welcoming change <ptr target="#cohen2003"/>. To align with these Agile values, the developer
                        usually breaks up product ideas into small pieces of functionality to build
                        a <soCalled>minimum viable product</soCalled> for immediate feedback. This
                        feedback may take the form of user testing, A/B testing (a kind of
                        semi-controlled experiment) or clickstream data – the goal is to discover
                        whether or not the software is solving problems. Based on this feedback, the
                        team can move on to the next iteration and improve the product more quickly,
                        at lower cost and with fewer risks. Hence, the project is never finished but
                        is continuously evolving.</p>
                    <p>Agile project management has become widespread among software developers. A
                        recent Hewlett Packard survey noted that the majority of their respondents
                        used at least some Agile styles in their project management, for reasons
                        including enhanced collaboration, better quality software, increased
                        customer satisfaction, decreased time to market and lower costs <ptr target="#hewlettpackard2015"/>. Moreover, this style of development
                        aligns with such Tech mantras as <soCalled>fail fast, fail often</soCalled>
                        and <soCalled>move fast and break things</soCalled>, which emphasise rapid
                        learning, and especially learning through mistakes. This emphasis on failure
                        and breakage is part of a self-critique process, a constant search for
                        refinement. This differs from anthropology, where critiques of a textual
                        product mostly occur after submission or publication, and arise from
                        differences in opinion and interpretation more than from outright personal
                            <soCalled>failure</soCalled>. </p>

                    <head>What's the Problem? Requirements Analysis</head>
                    <p>Software development, cyclical or otherwise, typically kicks off with a phase
                        of <soCalled>requirements engineering</soCalled>. Here, technical team
                        members engage with stakeholders and potential users to determine software
                        needs. At the core of requirements engineering is the question,
                                <q><emph>What is the problem we are trying to solve?</emph></q> When
                        problems are clearly defined and analysed, the engineer can design an
                        appropriate solution. For the anthropologist, the creation of a research
                        question begins with the individual scholar, and is usually generated from
                        previous research, encounters with the people whose ideas and activities
                        become the center of study, or other serendipitous interactions.</p>
                    <p>Web development is concerned with problem-solving, but the digital humanities
                        brings challenges because the question, <q><emph>What is the problem we are
                                trying to solve?</emph></q> is not always immediately answerable;
                        sometimes the research questions change as the research is gathered, sorted
                        and contemplated. To illustrate this challenge: in contemporary software
                        development, the design, product and engineering teams often write
                            <soCalled>user stories</soCalled>. These user stories take the format:
                            <quote rend="block" source="#undocumented"><emph>As a X [type of user], I want to Y [do
                                something] so that I can Z [accomplish some goal].</emph></quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>The user story format above somewhat mirrors Booth, Colomb and Williams’
                        description of the research process in the humanities, which involves a
                        topic, a research question and a research motivator, or a meta-level
                        statement about the world around us that advances knowledge:<cit>
                            <quote rend="block" source="#booth2003"><emph>I am studying X [topic] because I want to know
                                    more about Y [research question] to help my reader understand Z
                                    [research motivator]. </emph></quote>
                            <ptr target="#booth2003" loc="52"/>
                        </cit></p>
                    <p>These stories are meant to drive feature design and development in software
                        engineering, and to justify academic interest and investment in humanities
                        research; combined, they represent the first step in the digital humanities
                        creative process. It is important to stress that the <soCalled>user
                            story</soCalled> seeks to satisfy an audience, and to encourage empathetic
                        thinking to tailor a solution to the audience’s needs, while the Booth,
                        Colomb and Williams framework seeks self-expression with a transformative
                        effect on the reader (which is generally one-way). </p>
                    <p>In the digital humanities, the user story variables are not so easily filled,
                        particularly when considering the goal of the user. One user story for
                            <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> might be <quote rend="inline" source="#private"><emph>As a student of Japanese, I want to hear / see / feel the
                                culture of Japan so that I can better enhance my learning of the
                                language, history and culture through deeper engagement with the
                                ethnographic field.</emph></quote> Another could be <quote rend="inline" source="#private"><emph>As a person interested in Japan and things Japanese,
                                I want to  hear / see unusual sounds / images of Japan that go
                                beyond the typical travel book / textbook / promotional website to

                        Thus, project goals were relatively abstract; rather, the anthropologists
                        began with their desire to trigger ideas, feelings and associations in
                        users, and to transmit cross cultural understanding through the digital
                        expression of sensory and affective experience. The web developer had to
                            <q>link knowhow (&amp;) know-why</q> from the anthropologists to the
                        public via the eventual website <ptr target="#meyer2010" loc="119"/>. As
                        such, the user stories for a site like <title rend="italic">Sonic
                            Japan</title> demonstrate evolving relationships between knowledge,
                        audiences and technology. The Internet facilitates circulation of knowledge,
                        and the web developer plays a critical role as knowledge broker between
                        users and scholars. </p>

                <head> Developing <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title>
                </head>
                <p>The idea of a sonic-focused website was inspired by a rich body of research in
                    anthropology. In the past few decades, a <soCalled>somatic turn</soCalled> in
                    the humanities and social sciences has inspired an internationally recognised
                    field of sensory anthropology, which rightly points out an over-reliance on the
                    visual and the auditory in anthropology <ptr target="#classen1994"/>
                    <ptr target="#howes2003"/>. Erlmann noted that even for those writing about
                    sound, instead of examining <quote rend="inline" source="#erlmann2004">scores or meanings that are the
                        result of acts of inscription</quote>, we should <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#erlmann2004">instead focus...on the materiality of...communication
                            [and] issues of sensuality.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#erlmann2004" loc="2"/>
                    </cit>. How to best achieve this, however, has puzzled social scientists for
                    generations. Charles Seeger, the forefather of American ethnomusicology,
                    addressed these limitations of text and declared that speech and music are
                    incompatible as modes of communication and indeed that we should be musicking
                    about music <ptr target="#seeger1977" loc="179"/>. It follows that we should be
                        <soCalled>sounding</soCalled> about sound more generally.</p>
                <p>Thus, by emphasising sound, the anthropologists in this project hoped to
                    encourage the user to focus on and think critically about auditory details and
                    how sound is produced, linking the sound to action and in some cases intent.
                    They thought a focus on sound might also help to take the user out of his or her
                    visual and intellectual <soCalled>comfort zone</soCalled> by destabilising the
                    sensory focus of the experience, opening up new channels for interpreting
                    cultural information. We can never fully share a sensory moment, but can help
                    our audiences imagine that moment with the aid of a number of sensory and other
                    cues <ptr target="#kohn1994" loc="25"/>.</p>
                <p>To support the reception of aural data, we considered a variety of visualisation
                    methods to portray sound through a browser-based user interface. In fact, <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> joins a tradition of digital projects –
                    arising from sensory anthropology, urban studies, ecoacoustics, sound art and
                    even technology startups – that present sound recordings through the web and
                    mobile apps. For example, repositories of user-uploaded sound recordings like
                        <ref target="https://soundcloud.com/stream">Soundcloud</ref> or <ref target="https://foundbite.co">Foundbite</ref> make sounds – including field
                    recordings – accessible with search and social features. Archivists like those
                    at the <ref target="http://www.bl.uk/subjects/sound">British Library</ref> have
                    also undertaken this endeavour. On the browser, geographic sound maps (like the
                        <ref target="https://www.moma.org/moma_studio/soundmap">MoMA Sound Map</ref>
                    or the University of Turin/Bell Labs’s <ref target="http://goodcitylife.org/chattymaps/index.html">Chatty Maps</ref>),
                    interactive graphs<note> See for example an audiophile’s interactive project:
                            <ref target="http://daftpunk.themaninblue.com/">http://daftpunk.themaninblue.com/</ref>
                    </note> or video game-like experiences (like <ref target="http://www.amplifon.ie/sounds-of-street-view/gallery/index.html">Sounds of Street View</ref>) create highly interactive, multi-sensory
                    experiences of sound that depart from the ‘primacy of text’, capitalise on
                    browser technology and invite engagement from broader audiences. However, the
                    researchers noted that these technologies often fail to provide anthropological
                    context, and were impressed with sound blogs like the <ref target="http://www.sensorystudies.org/sound-gallery/">Sensory Studies Sound
                        Gallery</ref> which pair sound recordings with ethnographic
                        description.<note> See also: <ref target="https://soundstudiesblog.com/">https://soundstudiesblog.com/</ref>
                    </note> Ultimately, the <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan </title>team decided
                    that it wanted a product with the voice and context of a blog, the spatiality of
                    a soundmap, the searchability of a Soundcloud and the interactivity of a graph
                    or immersive experience, aiming for a holistic representation reinforcing our
                    view that sound is a complex whole.</p>
                <p>The <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> project could be seen as a
                        <soCalled>gateway</soCalled> which sought to combine both the goals and
                    processes of the two disciplines involved. Our process was as following: After
                    initial discussion of the anthropologists’ requirements — which at times
                    appeared nebulous and difficult-to-measure to the web developer — she started
                    designing with pen-and-paper drawings, later expanding to build mock-ups and
                    dummy prototypes. She then developed working prototypes, concentrating on small
                    segments of functionality, which were critically reviewed by the anthropologists
                    as well as university IT advisors. By participating in design and examination of
                    prototypes, all the team members were encouraged to think with empathy about the
                    user, refine the story they wanted to tell, and consider the implications of
                    varying visual communication choices. </p>
                <p>The anthropologists often found the Agile style confusing because of the wealth
                    of possibilities and multiple and frequent decisions about which direction to
                    take. This recalls Schreibman, Sievers and Unsworth’s comment on how
                    collaboration with computer scientists pushes humanities scholars out of their
                    comfort zone <ptr target="#schreibman2004"/>. Moreover, prototyping revealed
                    design questions that provoked the anthropologists to defend their choices of
                    subject matter, and claims of relevance to a wider audience. In many ways, this
                    validated the Agile style as we felt we were moving quickly toward a stronger
                    product by examining its actual sensory effect, though we lacked the financial
                    resources to conduct real user testing. Overall, we sought to strike a balance
                    between user-focused design and the presentation of academic ideas, with a
                    revealing dialogue emerging as a result.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>Design Issues Discovered</head>
                    <p>To illustrate the collaboration’s effect on anthropological research, the
                        following section describes various presentation issues discovered during
                        the prototyping process. In each case, discussions during the collaborative
                        design process led the anthropologists to better define their desires for
                            <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> as research output and to
                        rethink how their data would fit into the web medium. </p>
                    <p>For example, <term>representation </term>– how to locate the sounds in space
                        – meant that the basic sound files needed to be associated with a series of
                        metadata. For the anthropologists, this raised a number of issues. What
                        photos should be associated with a sound? The photo of the object, person or
                        machine that made the sound, the landscape in which the sound was produced?
                        Another design issue was that of <term>curation</term> of material. <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan </title>did not <emph>need</emph> to be
                        curated – sound data could be presented without significant editorial
                        commentary but rather a small amount of metadata, focusing instead on the
                        less personal properties of the sounds (such as audio, categorical or
                        geographical) to encourage a user to explore on her own – for example,
                        through an interactive graph. But after initial design discussion, the
                        anthropologists felt their main contribution to the project was not only the
                        recording of sounds but also the <soCalled>value added</soCalled> commentary
                        that would augment the user’s experience by relating the sensory experiences
                        of the anthropologist at the time of recording. This is consistent with
                        Burdick and colleagues, who characterise the digital humanities partly <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">by an emphasis upon curation as a defining feature
                                of scholarly practice.</quote>
                            <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="121"/>
                        </cit>. Hence <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> organises its sounds
                        around the notions of Places and Themes, partially to introduce geographical
                        and cultural concepts to those without background knowledge of Japan.
                        Further, rather than publishing sounds without comment, we added titles,
                        textual descriptions, and blog posts to enhance accessibility, interest and
                        understanding through academic curation.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p> The anthropologists also debated the use of <term>crowdsourcing</term>. Many
                        sound maps and other websites utilise crowdsourcing through user
                        contribution. This heightens the potential for gathering large amounts of
                        data, introduces a multiplicity of perspective and invites a continuous
                        stream of fresh content. However, after reviewing prototypes, the team
                        decided against extensive use of crowdsourcing because they questioned
                        whether these additional voices and perspectives might push aside the
                        researchers’ unique contributions to the project (as in the curation and
                        contextualisation issues described above). For example, for Place and Theme
                        page visuals, the team considered supplementing the researchers’ images with
                        user-generated photos from Flickr, which provides user-uploaded photos
                        through its API. Yet, the anthropologists raised concerns over the
                        appropriateness of <soCalled>random</soCalled> draws of images from Flickr,
                        as prototypes revealed that user-generated photos sometimes created
                        inappropriate or misleading associations with our data, for instance with
                        the API sometimes presenting tourist photos with a potentially Orientalist
                        framing. In general, non-contextualised data could be misleading, such as
                        offering up sounds of traffic in Tokyo (potentially creating an image of a
                        congested polluted city, devoid of the quiet green spaces which exist there
                        too) or only presenting the sounds of traditional music <soCalled>frozen in
                            time</soCalled>, without explaining its role in contemporary
                        society.</p>
                    <p>The final design issue considered during prototyping was the
                            <term>privacy</term> of human subjects captured in the recordings.
                        Geolocation technology creates the potential for individuals to be
                        unknowingly and perhaps unwillingly tracked as well as personally
                        identified. Deciding which recordings should be disassociated with geo-data
                        to protect subject anonymity was difficult. Though we did not identify the
                        subjects’ names, some of our recordings contain fully audible conversations.
                        These were recorded in places that could be construed as public, but given
                        that people’s movements often align with spatial and temporal habits, we
                        envisioned potential privacy infringement. Further, many people conduct
                        private conversations in public spaces believing that no one is listening,
                        and some conversations may have been recorded without all of the speakers’
                        knowledge or consent. Yet, we also considered that sound is spontaneous and
                        moves in and through private and public spaces, which naturally brings
                        potential for privacy infringement. Upon examination of <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title>’s automatically generated sound maps, the
                        anthropologists decided to protect only the spatial anonymity of vulnerable
                        subjects such as children and patients at an alcohol treatment centre by
                        masking the exact locations of these recordings; other sounds were presented
                        without anonymity.</p>
                    <p>All of the above issues exemplify the effect of Agile web development on the
                        creation of an anthropology-focused web application. In the <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> case, the prototypes presented at
                        weekly meetings helped the anthropologists clarify their desires for a sound
                        website as curated research output that would highlight their unique
                        perspectives and emphasise contextualisation of the sounds, while still
                        providing value to a variety of users. In other words, the web developer
                            <soCalled>brokered</soCalled> sessions where her knowledge was harnessed
                        to explain possibilities of her design as well as to forecast the format’s
                        limitations. Not all of the anthropologists’ wishes could be answered, but
                        in these failed attempts, the researchers gained new perspectives on their
                        data. These discussions added new layers to a research project previously
                        focused mainly on recording sounds and producing written commentary – a
                        positive effect through occasional bad gateways.</p>

                    <p>Rapid prototyping brought Sonic Japan’s design questions over visualisation,
                        curation and privacy to light, which lent support for the Agile style. Yet
                        for the web developer, this project eventually lent support for multiple
                        product development and engineering methodologies, creating new learning on
                        the digital side of this digital humanities collaboration. </p>
                    <p>For example, one criticism of Agile is that while it avoids over-engineering
                        in favor of flexibility and working code, it can lead to under-engineering,
                        especially by novices who are overly concerned with shipping features
                        instead of sound technical design (see <ptr target="#cohen2003"/>). Rakitin

                        eventually had to refactor application code to introduce appropriate

                        need to strike a balance between rapid prototyping and a more planned style
                        of engineering. In another example, when developing a content management
                        system for uploading sounds and entering sound metadata, frequent emergent
                        bugs both invited code repair and lent credence to methodologies like Test
                        Driven Development (TDD), in which tests are written <emph>before</emph>
                        implementation (different from the previously described software development
                        lifecycle). As per Janzen and Saiedian, TDD’s test writing is <q>essentially
                            an analysis step</q> that should clarify code requirements and improve
                        code quality by encouraging early refactoring <ptr target="#janzen2005"/>. For
                            <hi rend="italic">Sonic Japan</hi>, the developer learned the value of
                        TDD through literal breakages during development.</p>
                    <p>Further, once the web application was deployed, the
                        developer-as-product-manager quickly perceived a lack of data support in
                        favour of the initially chosen designs. Though the team had iterated to
                        ensure alignment with research needs, the product manager did not have any
                        hard numbers nor even anecdotal feedback proving that <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan was</title> achieving goals of reaching users, of
                        introducing users to Japan and sensory anthropology, and of <q>triggering feelings and associations</q>. Thus, we
                        needed to track user actions through web analytics. Data from web analytics
                        caused the developer to question design decisions. For example, initial data
                        revealed low user engagement with the website’s sound maps, with many users
                        leaving the map page without interacting with the sounds. Highlighting the
                        anthropology commentary in the form of blog posts instead of maps, however,
                        gave different results, and this data provided concrete evidence in support
                        of curation. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, with analytics data, the developer refined project priorities on
                        the whole toward a system of formalised project goals and metrics. For
                        example, the analytics data revealed that few people were actually visiting
                        the site since the team had not initially focused on marketing or
                        distribution. After all, one of our goals was to break out of what Parker
                        has called the <soCalled>ivory tower</soCalled> model of research
                        communication <ptr target="#parker2013" loc="50"/> to make publications and
                        recent knowledge accessible to a wide variety of readers. Did our data
                        indicate that the digital format was not helping this project to reach a
                        wide variety of readers? The developer-as-product-manager decided the
                        project needed to focus more on distribution, and progress toward this goal
                        would be measured by unique visits, search engine rankings, social media
                        followers and/or subscribers. Hence, the developer-product manager began to
                        work within a new framework of goals, measurement and specific tactics to
                        align with both goals and data.</p>
                    <p>The project proved to be a continuous evolution not only in terms of design
                        and implementation but also in terms of methodology, process and management
                        style. Thus, the developer, besides negotiating between the researchers and
                        software, also began to negotiate between the project on the whole and the
                        outside world. Through failures, bad gateway errors and dismal analytics
                        data, the developer learned the importance of different methodologies, even
                        for a project that initially seemed to lack of concrete problem definition.

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>How scholars study the social world — how they see the world, how they record it,
                    how they relate their version of the world to others, and how readers react to
                    the stories presented by others — is increasingly mediated through communication
                    technologies. These technologies afford new ways of capturing and sharing ideas,
                    creating a new record of social life that that can be conceived as truly
                        <soCalled>beyond the text</soCalled>. Technologies do not just mediate the
                    outcomes, however; they have the potential to frame inquiry from the start into
                    new and exciting territory, encompassing the sensorial experience (albeit a
                    mediated one) that the text cannot always deliver.</p>
                <p>This article has charted the ups and downs of an ongoing collaboration between
                    anthropologists and web developers and how brokerage led to problem solving; it
                    also demonstrates that provides an opportunity for us to think about the ways in
                    interdisciplinary research advances in stops and starts rather than in smooth
                    progression which we move forward in this relationship. As a case study in
                    interdisciplinary collaboration in the digital humanities, <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan</title> provided an opportunity for web developers and
                    anthropologists — despite their differences in their definition of data, goals,
                    disciplinary values and methodology — to create new knowledge. While these
                    differences may lead to friction, confusion and errors when developing a web
                    application, they can also lead to positive outcomes. The interdisciplinary
                    nature of the <title rend="italic">Sonic Japan </title>project prompted new ways
                    of thinking for team members in both web development and anthropology research,
                    as the design and development process brought a host of challenges to light.
                    These challenges spanned design issues as well as methodology. The
                    anthropologists grappled with the best way to represent their data in the web
                    medium, struggling with the need to monitor their level of curation and maintain
                    location privacy in an ethical way. Meanwhile, the web developer sought to bring
                    the anthropologists’ research practices within methodological frameworks of
                    product management and software engineering, despite their preference for
                    flexibility. Rapid prototyping and testing revealed issues anthropological,
                    technical and even managerial, demonstrating the value in continuous iteration
                    for this interdisciplinary exercise. Thus, our experience creating Sonic Japan
                    can serve as an illustrative example of an interdisciplinary developmental
                    process. We speak to our case study as a transformative journey rather than a
                    destination, a journey that traversed various disciplinary
                        <soCalled>gateways</soCalled>.</p>
