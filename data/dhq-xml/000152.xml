                <p>Digital humanities discussions of distant reading, machine reading or not-reading
                    have often turned on a depiction of the field of literary production in which
                    individual texts and authors recede in importance as units of analysis. At the
                    same time, the question of what is specific to the literary in discussions of
                    electronic textuality, or the digital literary, has been under-analyzed. This
                    article contributes to theorizing the digital literary by way of an analysis (or
                    close reading) of the role of machine reading in a postcolonial science fiction
                    novel by Amitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome. This novel participates in the
                    imagination of electronic textuality and digital forensics at a moment when the
                    imagined possibilities of the digital archive were of intense interest to both
                    cultural critics and literary writers. The figure of the writer of vernacular
                    literature in the novel, I argue, brings together the text's interest in both
                    electronic textuality and the subaltern archive, thus establishing the stakes of
                    the digital precisely on a revamped role for the literary in the context of
                    globalization. As such, Ghosh's novel provides a useful opportunity for
                    re-considering proposals for distant reading in relation to world literary
                    studies and postcolonial criticism.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Published in 1996, Amitav Ghosh’s <title rend="italic">The Calcutta
                        Chromosome</title> figures machine reading as an imaginative device enabling
                    the recovery of subaltern histories and the construction of a posthuman future.
                    The novel dramatizes a series of information recovery operations in which
                    digital traces are retrieved from a seemingly all-encompassing electronic ether.
                    The novel is thus centered around questions of digital archiving and digital
                    forensics — central themes of the digital humanities. Indeed, Ghosh’s
                    exploration of topics of machine reading and digital forensics well exemplifies
                    what Matthew Kirschenbaum has referred to as the <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#kirschenbaum2008">forensic imagination</quote> in his study of
                    electronic literature between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s <ptr
                        target="#kirschenbaum2008"/>, precisely the context for Ghosh’s novel.
                    Ostensibly a medical mystery, <title rend="italic">The Calcutta
                        Chromosome</title>’s central question — how a mediocre scientist in the
                    British imperial service in India was able to discover the mechanism of
                    malaria’s transmission through mosquitoes — is only solved when the work of a
                    writer of Bengali vernacular literature is recovered alongside deleted emails
                    and other documents retrieved through digital forensics. Acts of information
                    retrieval pervade the novel as the narrative is assembled through the recovery
                    of textual artifacts with the aid of a comprehensive digital archive named Ava.
                    The narrative of the novel is pieced together through a series of increasingly
                    dramatic recovery operations that extract digital textuality out of the
                    electronic ether. The digital archive itself is figured in the novel by the
                    character Ava, both an archive and an artificial intelligence who functions as a
                    Spiritualist medium in order not only to solve the text’s medical mystery but
                    also to enable the posthuman future to which the text gestures in its
                    conclusion. </p>
                <p>In this article, I use the depiction of machine reading in <title rend="italic"
                        >The Calcutta Chromosome </title>to interrogate the status of the <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">digital literary,</quote> a
                    volatile concept that has emerged in the context of readings of electronic
                        literature.<note> Kirschenbaum frames his work as a study of <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">electronic textuality

                        </cit>, but what the literary itself has to contribute to discussions of
                        digital forensics is unstated in his text. See also <title rend="italic"
                            >Electronic Literature: New Horizon of the Literary </title>
                        <ptr target="#hayles2008"/>. </note> The enigma of the writer of vernacular
                    literature in a novel built around the trope of machine reading suggests that
                    the status of the literary is by no means clear-cut in the context of electronic
                    textuality. Recent work in the digital humanities has called for
                        <soCalled>not-reading</soCalled> as a means of tackling the surfeit of
                    electronic textuality made accessible through contemporary digital archives. As
                    Franco Moretti has provocatively asserted, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2000">we know how to read texts; now
                            let’s learn how <emph>not</emph> to read them</quote>
                        <ptr target="#moretti2000" loc="57"/>
                    </cit>. Moretti’s proposals have focused on what he has called <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">distant reading</quote> in his
                    influential <title rend="italic">Graphs, Maps, Trees</title> where he advocates
                    primarily quantitative methods for visualizing the data of literary production
                        <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>. Matthew Kirschenbaum has expanded on the trend
                    towards distant reading by suggesting that <cit>

                    mastering large bodies of text through <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#moretti2007">not-reading,</quote> a kind of extreme abstraction in
                    which individual works of literature disappear in favor of electronic textuality
                    in general. This abstraction depends on discarding precisely the distinctions
                    that made the literary as a category possible to begin with, what Moretti calls
                    in <title rend="italic">Graphs, Maps, Trees</title>, <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#moretti2007">the old, useless distinctions</quote> such as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">high and low; canon and archive;

                    </cit>.</p>
                <p>But what can we make of the literary itself in light of this development of
                    not-reading? As Nicholas Brown makes clear in his essay on the <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#brown2009">end of literature,</quote> the postmodern
                    desire to dissolve the distinctions underlying the category of the literary
                    raises a tension that is inherent to literature itself as it was theorized at
                    the end of the 18th century <ptr target="#brown2009"/>.<note> Brown has a larger
                        discussion of the itinerary of the concept of <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#brown2005">literature</quote> in <title rend="italic">Utopian
                            Generations</title>
                        <ptr target="#brown2005"/>. For another historical account of the rise of
                        literature at the beginning of modernity, see Eagleton, <title rend="italic"
                            >Literary Theory</title>
                        <ptr target="#eagleton2008"/>.</note> The separation between the literary
                    and textuality in general is a necessarily unstable one produced by the attempt
                    to elevate the aesthetic to a mode of experience in its own right. Jacques
                    Rancière has used the term <quote rend="inline" source="#ranciere2009"
                        >literariness</quote> to describe the function of literature as a way of
                    perceiving and interacting with the world autonomous from any particular subject
                    matter or genre, an innovation of the aesthetic theories of the late-18th
                    century culminating in the work of Balzac and Flaubert. Here, the literary
                    stands abstracted from individual works of literature as part of a broader
                    aesthetic regime that can be seen as, according to Rancière in <title
                        rend="italic">The Aesthetic Unconscious</title>, <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#ranciere2009">legitimizing an unconscious truth not to be found in
                        an individual history but rather in the opposition between two
                        orders,</quote> orders such as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ranciere2009">the <emph>figural</emph> beneath

                        <ptr target="#ranciere2009" loc="64"/>
                    </cit>. In light of this itinerary of the concept of the literary in the period
                    of modernity and its aftermath, we can see how techniques of not-reading do not
                    eschew the concept of the literary but re-inscribe it on another level of
                    formality. Not-reading involves articulating a sort of <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#ranciere2009">unconscious truth</quote> of literature grounded no
                    longer on individual works but on the literary itself. Kirschenbaum’s work on
                    the digital forensics of electronic literature suggests just such a notion of
                    the literary with its critique of what he calls the <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#kirschenbaum2008">screen essentialism</quote> in which <cit>

                        <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="34"/>

                    work. This status of data accorded to literary works, as we will see, undergirds
                    the notion of the literary that emerges in the wake of not-reading.</p>
                <p>It is precisely here that the depiction of machine reading in Ghosh's <title
                        rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> will allow us to address the
                    question of the digital literary. Ghosh’s novel is a text that is famously
                    difficult to classify: an historical novel set in the future that uses science
                    fiction to pose questions about how the existence of a comprehensive, worldwide
                    electronic archive refigures the possibility of cultural history. The narrative
                    of the novel is reconstituted in between the gaps and silences of the archive,
                    weaving together traces of the literature of imperialism and other varieties of
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2001">colonial modernism,</quote>
                    including the writing of military scientists and other officials, documents of
                    European Spiritualism, and modern Hindi and Bengali vernacular literature <ptr
                        target="#ghosh2001"/>. Vernacular literature is thematized in the novel in
                    the figure of the writer named Phulboni, a name that inverts the pseudonym of
                    the historical Bengali author Banaphool.<note> I am grateful to Bishnupriya
                        Ghosh for this insight.</note> If the novel situates vernacular literature,
                    in the figure of the Bengali novelist, next to other records of the digital
                    archive, it does so in order to give it too the status of data in an archive of
                    electronic textuality. Ghosh’s work thus engages with the digital in order to
                    imagine how to read the silence of the vernacular within the archive of
                        modernity.<note>There is an important body of criticism on the vernacular in
                        modern and postcolonial literature. See Michael North, <title rend="italic"

                    a way to figure the silence (also a form of not-reading) around the vernacular,
                    the recovery of which involves engaging with the <soCalled>forensic
                        imagination</soCalled> at a moment of archive fever. I begin, then, with an
                    investigation of the role of world literature in the digital archive as a way to
                    understand <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title>’s interest in
                    situating the status of vernacular literature alongside the extreme inscription
                    of electronic textuality. In this way, Ghosh’s exploration of the status of
                    world literature <foreign>vis à vis</foreign> the digital archive allows us to
                    think through the function of the literary in our own techniques for
                    not-reading. </p>

                <p>The category of world literature is useful to think about in terms of the
                    depiction of machine reading in <title rend="italic">The Calcutta

                    suggested in the context of the study of world literature. I refer of course to
                    Franco Moretti’s proposal for <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2000">distant

                    thinking about not-reading in the context of world literature. <title
                        rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> after all focuses on a New
                    York-based Egyptian-born knowledge worker named Antar who uncovers the research
                    of a Calcutta-born amateur historian of medicine named Murugan regarding a
                    British scientist in India. Both Antar and Murugan have been employed by a
                    non-profit named LifeWatch, which has since been swallowed up by a transnational
                    corporation named the International Water Council, which undertakes among other
                    things a cataloguing and investigation of global water resources in a near
                    future suffering from <cit>

                        <ptr target="#ghosh2001" loc="7"/>
                    </cit>. Antar investigates Murugan’s mysterious disappearance with the help of a
                    digital archive and artificial intelligence named Ava. Antar and the reader are
                    then led through a series of digital forensic operations, including Ava’s
                    recovery of a deleted email sent by Murugan. Antar discovers that Murugan was in
                    the process of solving a medical mystery, namely the secret behind the British
                    colonial scientist Ronald Ross’s <soCalled>official</soCalled> discovery of the
                    mechanism of malaria’s transmission. Through his research, Murugan uncovers the
                    existence of a loosely organized group of indigenous scientists and
                    Spiritualists who had developed a technique for the transmigration of souls
                    while using cerebral malaria to treat syphilitics in Ross’s lab. It was thus an
                    indigenous scientist named Mangala and her assistant, a migrant laborer, who
                    allowed Ross, an otherwise mediocre scientist, to <soCalled>discover</soCalled>
                    the mechanism of malaria’s transmission for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize
                    in Medicine in 1902. </p>
                <p> In piecing together this narrative, the writing and speeches of a Bengali
                    vernacular novelist named Phulboni are crucial to the final unraveling of the
                    mystery. For, as we learn, Phulboni himself encoded the Spiritualist program for
                    the transmigration of souls in a series of short stories revolving around the
                    migrant laborer figure named Laakhan. The interpretation of the Laakhan stories
                    becomes the final step in the unraveling of the medical mystery and in many ways
                    the culmination of the novel — they reveal not only how the Laakhan figure had
                    been active in the preservation of the <soCalled>Calcutta chromosome,</soCalled>
                    but also point to Phulboni’s own involvement with the Spiritualist program at
                    the time of Murugan’s disappearance. Phulboni’s ghost stories appear as the
                    final forensic operation of many beginning with the recovery of Murugan’s
                    LifeWatch ID by Ava. The literary thus plays a starred role in the novel
                        <foreign>vis-à-vis</foreign> the digital; the vernacular literary text is
                    recovered and presented in the novel just as Murugan’s deleted email is
                    recovered from the digital ether. Placing the literary and the digital on the
                    same terrain, the writer of vernacular literature joins the global diasporic
                    knowledge worker in the novel’s imagined aesthetic utopia.<note> I am indebted
                        to John Su’s reading of Ghosh’s work in light of the <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#su2011">aesthetic turn</quote> in postcolonial criticism <ptr
                            target="#su2011"/>. Su gives a reading of Ghosh’s <title rend="italic"
                            >The Glass Palace</title> in terms of aesthetic utopianism, but the role
                        of the vernacular writer Phulboni in enabling the posthuman utopian
                        conclusion to <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> also fits
                        Su’s analysis.</note> In fact, the digital archive Ava already functions as
                    a technology of the vernacular literary; Antar, we are told, has selected a
                    localized interface for Ava in the Arabic dialect of his Egyptian village. Thus,
                    at times in Ava’s language Antar <cit>

                        he was studying, leading to the uncanny experience of recognizing voices of

                </p>
                <p> Phulboni’s articulation of literariness provides a key to understanding the
                    function of the work of literature in a novel where reading is otherwise
                    depicted as machine reading or not-reading. As I have suggested, Phulboni’s work
                    plays a significant role in the novel, not just in the form of the Laakhan
                    stories, but also as short speeches punctuating the text. As Claire Chambers has
                    noted, Phulboni’s discourse on <quote rend="inline" source="#chambers2009"
                        >silence</quote> provides a foundation for what Murugan terms <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#chambers2009">counter-science,</quote> the method
                    used by the indigenous researchers including Mangala and Laakhan to develop the <cit>

                        article.</note> At the same time, Phulboni’s speeches provide a theorization
                    of the concept of the literary that ties the novel’s depiction of literary works
                    to both counter-science and the digital archive. According to Phulboni’s
                    speeches, silence is closely connected to the concept of the literary itself: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2001">indeed the Word is to this silence
                            what the shadow is to the foreshadowed, what the veil is to the eyes,
                            what the mind is to the truth, what language is to life</quote>
                        <ptr target="#ghosh2001" loc="29"/>
                    </cit>. Precisely this notion of silence crops up again in Murugan’s description
                    of counter-science, a method that <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2001">would in principle have to refuse
                            all direct communication, straight off the bat, because to communicate,
                            to put ideas into language, would be to establish a claim to
                                <emph>know</emph>
                        </quote>
                        <ptr target="#ghosh2001" loc="104–105"/>
                    </cit>. In contrast to the claim to know implicit in scientific discourse is the
                    assertion of silence by the practitioners of counter-science including Phulboni,
                    the vernacular literary writer. Ava’s digital forensic operations thus take
                    place as yet another articulation of the relation between speech and silence
                    alongside both vernacular literature and counter-science.</p>
                <p> We can see how the depiction of the digital in the novel dovetails with
                    Phulboni’s articulation of the literary through a closer reading of Ava as
                    digital archive. Ava, we learn in the first pages of the novel, has been
                    programmed by the megacorporation International Water Council to generate
                    detailed metadata pertaining to material objects so as to collect information
                    that may someday benefit its activities. Antar’s job is to oversee and
                    facilitate Ava’s data collection: <quote rend="block" source="#ghosh2001"
                        >Somewhere along the line she had been programmed to hunt out real-time
                        information, and that was what she was determined to get. Once she'd wrung
                        the last, meaningless detail out of him, she'd give the object on her screen
                        a final spin, with a bizarrely human smugness, before propelling it into the
                        horizonless limbo of her memory. <ptr target="#ghosh2001" loc="4"/>
                    </quote>
                </p>
                <p>While digital archiving is described as a <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#ghosh2001">horizonless limbo,</quote> it is also filled with <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#ghosh2001">meaningless detail.</quote> Machine memory
                    lacks a horizon of intelligibility because it is not capable of producing
                    meaning or interpretations. Hence, the corporation has tasked Ava with the
                    recording of all the details of the world: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2001">The investigation Officers had run
                            everything they could find through Ava, all the endless detritus of

                        <ptr target="#ghosh2001" loc="7"/>
                    </cit>. Antar comes to understand, based on his own experience observing foreign
                    archaeologists in Egypt when he was a child, that the corporation’s vast
                    archival endeavor has to do with the historical consciousness of those who are
                    doing the archiving. Antar realizes that: <quote rend="block"
                        source="#ghosh2001">They saw themselves making History with their vast
                        water-control experiments: they wanted to record every minute detail of what
                        they had done, what they would do. Instead of having a historian sift
                        through their dirt, looking for meanings, they wanted to do it themselves:
                        they wanted to load their dirt with their own meanings. <ptr
                            target="#ghosh2001" loc="7"/>
                    </quote>
                </p>
                <p>Ava’s archiving therefore describes a circuit from historical meaning to the
                        <soCalled>horizonless limbo</soCalled> of memory. Ava functions through a
                    kind of archive fever in which what Kirschenbaum refers to as the <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">forensic imagination</quote> is
                    enabled by the necessary oblivion of the archive’s memory. We can thus place the
                    opposition that arises in digital archiving between <soCalled>meaning</soCalled>
                    and <soCalled>dirt</soCalled> alongside Phulboni’s opposition between speech and
                    silence, or the word and the world. In this way, the digital archive is grounded
                    on the same concept of literariness as Phulboni’s works of vernacular literature
                    and Murugan’s notion of counter-science. </p>
                <p> At issue in the novel’s discourse of the literary, I am arguing, is a concept of
                    data that underlies not only literariness but also the discourse of machine
                    reading or not-reading. As recent critics in postcolonial historiography and
                    media studies have shown, this concept of data or evidence is closely connected
                    to an historical consciousness that also encompasses the archival impulse in new
                    technologies of representation. As Dipesh Chakrabarty describes, <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#chakrabarty2007">Historical evidence (the archive)
                        is produced by our capacity to see something that is contemporaneous with us
                        … as a relic of another time or place. … A particular past thus becomes
                        objectified in the observer’s time</quote>
                    <ptr target="#chakrabarty2007" loc="238"/></cit>. If the document in the archive is
                    seen as an objectification of the past in the present, the status of evidence
                    may be compared to the photographic image as a way of capturing the presence of
                    the past in an objective form. Mary Ann Doane’s <title rend="italic">The
                        Emergence of Cinematic Time</title> has documented the way <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#doane2002">a logic of the archive</quote> functions
                    in photography and cinema’s <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#doane2002"
                        >problematic and contradictory task of archiving the present</quote>
                    <ptr target="#doane2002" loc="105"/></cit>. Specifically, the indexical theory of
                    photography that sees the photographic image as the direct emanation of an
                    object situates the status of the image as evidence in terms of historical
                    consciousness. Evidence is, then, that which in the present directly emanates
                    from what Chakrabarty calls a <quote rend="inline" source="#chakrabarty2007"
                        >particular past,</quote> from <quote rend="inline" source="#chakrabarty2007"
                        >another time or place</quote> into the present time of the observer. This
                    logic of historical evidence is inseparable from the claims of technologies of
                    representation to give unmediated access to objects in the world. For Doane, new
                    technologies of the archive present an extension and intensification of this
                    claim to immediacy.<note> As she writes, <quote rend="inline"

                    archive presents the culmination of a logic of the archive in which historical
                    evidence is seen as the immediate emanation of a past reality. </p>
                <p> Exactly this question of the status of data brings together the threads of world
                    literature and the digital archive. In her study of the British book trade in
                    colonial India, Priya Joshi emphasizes the importance of data in making visible
                    aspects of the past occluded in traditional historical accounts <ptr
                        target="#joshi2002"/>.<note> The reading of the archive of <soCalled>world literature,</soCalled>
                        particularly in the context of colonial India, is not absent from Franco
                        Moretti’s work, particularly in <title rend="italic">Graphs, Maps, and
                            Trees</title> in his analysis of Priya Joshi’s research on the British
                        book trade in colonial India <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>. Moretti points
                        out that Joshi’s research is an exception to the overall trend he notices
                        from comparative research on the <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2002"
                            >rise of the novel</quote> in a number of national contexts, which he
                        attributes to the reaction to the 1857 rebellion. (The question of how to
                        read the mutiny of 1857 also figures prominently in the email exchange
                        between Ghosh and Chakrabarty to which I refer below <ptr
                            target="#ghosh2002"/>.)</note> For Joshi, this is not a speculative
                    project but is made possible by the very data accumulated in the existing
                    archive. She writes: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#joshi2002">Within a
                        historical record that has emphasized the data of production, patterns of
                        reading as consumption nonetheless make themselves visible, paradoxically
                        within the very data and statistics that apparently eschew them</quote>
                    <ptr target="#joshi2002" loc="27"/></cit>. For Joshi, the material history of the
                    production and consumption of literature emerges from the archive in the form of
                    quantitative data. Franco Moretti also frames his proposal for distant reading
                    using quantitative methods around the question of the status of data. In <title
                        rend="italic">Graphs, Maps, Trees</title>, Moretti points out that
                    quantitative research <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">provides
                        data, not interpretation</quote> and emphasizes that his method is one of
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">explanation</quote> rather than

                    <ptr target="#moretti2007" loc="9"/>. Moretti, in his explication of distant
                    reading, repeatedly notes being struck by the surfeit of texts one encounters
                    working in the archive. Distant reading emerges self-consciously as a response
                    to the archive’s surplus; it is simply not possible to read the more than 30,000
                    novels produced just in one country in one century, so new techniques are
                    required, ones that deal with the archive by reducing texts to data for
                    explanation and no longer meanings for interpretation <ptr target="#moretti2007"/>.<note>
                        <p> Moretti sees his project as a way of displacing the question of how the
                            received canon of literary texts fits into the broader archive of texts
                            produced in just one period in one national context: <quote

                                the literary field, and re-design it in a better way, replacing the
                                old, useless distinctions (high and low; canon and archive; this or
                                that national literature . . .) with new temporal, spatial, and

                    </note>
                </p>
                <p>Among the criticisms of Moretti’s proposal for distant reading, perhaps the most
                    interesting has turned on this question of interpretation versus explanation,
                    which is to say, on the evidentiary status of data in the archive. In a reply to
                    Christopher Prendergast, Moretti revises and expands his distinction between
                    interpretation and explanation <ptr target="#moretti2006"/>. He acknowledges
                    that the two are in fact intertwined, and that explanation requires
                    interpretation. In a remarkable passage, Moretti explains this nuance with
                    recourse to the example of Freudian dream interpretation. Moretti quotes Paul
                    Ricoeur’s <title rend="italic">Freud and Philosophy</title> to say, <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#moretti2006">interpretation <emph>cannot be
                            developed without calling into play concepts of an entirely different
                            order, energy concepts</emph>
                    </quote>
                    <ptr target="#moretti2006" loc="82"/></cit>. In Freudian psychoanalysis, dream
                    interpretation can only proceed on the basis of an understanding of the
                    dream-work underlying the production of dreams, what Freud identifies as the
                    mechanisms of condensation, displacement, and the conditions of
                    representability. In other words, concepts involved in the explanation of the
                    dream are indispensable in producing an interpretation of it. Moretti compares
                    distant reading with dream interpretation, then, in which the use of <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">energy concepts</quote> are required
                    to produce an explanation of aesthetic forms. This is what Moretti means when he
                    describes <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">form as the most
                        profoundly social aspect of literature: form as force</quote>
                    <ptr target="#moretti2007" loc="92"/></cit>. An aesthetic or literary form, for
                    Moretti, is the result of operations of force from outside the text that are
                    social and material, and the task of distant reading is to grasp these forms in
                    the abstract in order to read the traces of this force. </p>
                <p>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">Form as force</quote> operates for
                    Moretti as a mode of imprint in which aesthetic forms are directly inscribed in
                    the data of literary production. Data provide a kind of historical evidence in
                    which historical meanings are one and the same as the objects of analysis. As he
                    elaborates, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2007">As in an experiment,
                        the force <q>from without</q> of large national processes alters the initial
                        narrative structure beyond recognition, and reveals the direct, almost
                        tangible relationship between social conflict and literary form. Reveals
                        form as a diagram of forces; or perhaps, even, as nothing but force</quote>
                    <ptr target="#moretti2007" loc="64"/></cit>. Moretti is interested in reading these
                    social forces and <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2000">national
                        processes</quote> that originate in the <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#moretti2000">from without,</quote> or the material world in the
                    form of the literary text, an interest he attributes to the influence of Marxist
                    criticism from the 1970s. Distant reading is then a form of reading that seeks
                    to abolish the individual work of literature in order to achieve a broader
                    identification between texts and the world. The goal is a criticism where
                    individual texts are replaced by text as such, literature by the literary, no
                    longer seen as a separate register but as one form of the data of the world, now
                    opened to social and material analysis. As we have seen, the literary is by no
                    means absent from this maneuver. Literary form has simply been isolated from
                    individual cases and grasped as an abstraction. Literary works have been
                    replaced by the literary as such, which is precisely what is at stake in
                    Moretti’s version of not-reading, as he puts it: <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#moretti2000">world literature is not an object, it’s a
                            <emph>problem</emph>, and a problem that asks for a new critical method:
                        and no one has ever found a method by just reading more texts</quote>
                    <ptr target="#moretti2000" loc="55"/></cit>. </p>
                <p>If not-reading seems to underlie the study of world literature in Moretti’s
                    influential proposals, Ghosh’s own longstanding interest in world literature may
                    provide one way to understand the function of the Phulboni character in relation
                    to the digital archive in <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title>.
                    As we have seen, the concept of world literature is significant not only to
                    postcolonial criticism but also new modes of reading associated with digital
                    humanities. In a fascinating email exchange between Amitav Ghosh and Dipesh
                    Chakrabarty, Ghosh picks up on an intuition of Chakrabarty’s that the Bengali
                    writer Rabindranath Tagore’s writing on <soCalled>world literature</soCalled> is based on a translation of
                    this concept from Goethe. While Chakrabarty acknowledges that the evidence for
                    this genealogy is only intuition, Ghosh does not hesitate to express his
                    concurrence with Chakrabarty’s insight <ptr target="#ghosh2002"/>. The exchange
                    between Ghosh and Chakrabarty is interesting in terms of assessing the stakes of
                    digital reading in Ghosh’s text inasmuch as Chakrabarty’s writing on planetary
                    reading has received attention alongside Moretti’s proposals for distant
                    reading. Tagore is an interesting figure to take up in the context of <title
                        rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> inasmuch as Phulboni’s Laakhan
                    stories are at least in part modeled on Tagore’s ghost stories.<note>
                        <ptr target="#chambers2009"/> and <ptr target="#ghosh2004a"/> both provide
                        readings of the Laakhan stories in light of their intertextual references in
                        the works of Tagore and Renu. </note> One final intertextual reference for
                    Phulboni in the novel is worthy of comment: the postcolonial Hindi writer
                    Phaniswarnath Renu, whose ghost stories have also been identified as a source
                    for the Laakhan stories. As Bishnupriya Ghosh has pointed out, Tagore and Renu
                    are important sources for the Phulboni character because they <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#ghosh2004a">saw their literary projects as crucial
                        to the formation of a national ethics beyond the narrow concerns of
                        territorial governance and sovereignty</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ghosh2004a" loc="201"/></cit>. Both writers used their cultural capital
                    as literary writers to advance political projects in colonial and postcolonial
                    contexts. This is the significance of the fact that we are first introduced to
                    Phulboni at an award ceremony: like the digital, the literary as marker of
                    prestige functions on a transnational level, literally beyond the nation. </p>
                <p>The figure of Tagore is thus significant in the novel in another, less obvious
                    way — like Ronald Ross, Tagore is a Nobel Prize winner. The Nobel Prize as a
                    marker of the literary is evident when one considers Ghosh’s reflective essay on
                        <title rend="quotes">The March of the Novel Through History: The Testimony
                        of My Grandfather’s Bookcase,</title> published in <title rend="italic">The
                        Kenyon Review </title>
                    <ptr target="#ghosh1998"/>. The essay describes the disparate collection of
                    books amassed by a certain <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh1998"
                        >book-loving uncle</quote> and <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh1998"
                        >the regime that stood between me and the bookcases</quote> when another

                    <ptr target="#ghosh1998" loc="14"/>). Despite the feeling <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#ghosh1998">that books rotted when they were not read</quote> and
                    a sense of <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh1998">injustice that nonreaders
                        should succeed in appropriating</quote> such a library, it is paradoxically
                    as a result of this experience of non-reading that Ghosh learns the meaning of
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh1998">a proper book</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ghosh1998" loc="14"/>. And it turns out that the organizing
                    principle for this collection of books had little to do with their content;
                    rather it was the status of their authors as winners of the Nobel Prize. Ghosh

                    <ptr target="#ghosh1998" loc="16"/></cit>. For Ghosh, the internationalization in the
                    idea of a world or <soCalled>universal</soCalled>
                    literature was the lesson of the novel in the former British colonies. With the
                    novel as an international genre came also a version of not-reading, the novel as
                    an institution having more to do with its globality than with the contents of
                    any one work or the style of any one author. This is why it is significant that
                    Phulboni is first introduced in the novel in the context of his appearance at an
                    award ceremony. The literary thus figures in <title rend="italic">The Calcutta
                        Chromosome</title> for this reason: because the literary is the category
                    that conveys a set of values precisely in the form of its opposite: not-reading,
                    silence, or oblivion. </p>

                <head>The Aesthetics of Machine Reading</head>
                <p>As we have seen, the novel is centered on depictions of machine reading, which
                    provide a set of aesthetics framing the text’s discourse on the literary.
                    Although <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> is Ghosh’s only
                    science fiction novel, and only novel addressing the digital, as a blogger and
                    active Twitter user, Ghosh’s own status as author is in many ways deeply
                    invested in new media. It is similarly interesting to think of email itself as a
                    genre informing the scholarly exchange between Ghosh and Chakrabarty that I
                    addressed above. Email and other digital technologies can be seen as scholarly
                    infrastructure facilitating intellectual exchange among a global community of
                    disaporic intellectuals. The depiction of machine reading and digital forensics
                    in <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> fits very much within
                    this context. The novel thus proceeds through Antar’s attempts to piece together
                    the medical mystery sparked by the disappearance of his former LifeWatch
                    co-worker Murugan and his archival work on Ronald Ross’s discoveries about the
                    transmission of malaria. This process reflects the novel’s own generic
                    instability as it pulls together textual records in a variety of formats and
                    sources, including diaries and letters of medical researchers, spiritualists,
                    Murugan’s own research, and finally the work of Phulboni, the writer of
                    vernacular literature depicted in the novel. As Bishnupriya Ghosh describes the
                    novel, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2004a">The narratives of several

                    with the assistance of Ava. Antar mines the digital archive in order to piece
                    together the sources of the narrative left behind by Murugan’s attempt to
                    unravel the mystery. Digital forensics become key to this work as Antar realizes
                    that a deleted email from Murugan containing an account of his discoveries may
                    provide the key to understanding what happened to him. To do so, Ava must <cit><quote

                    on the <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">forensic imagination</quote>
                    inasmuch as it exists as a layering of memories where earlier traces can emerge
                    to the surface through more recent traces inscribed over them. Murugan’s email
                    exists as what the novel calls a <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2001"
                        >binary <q>ghost</q>

                    medium figures in the novel. </p>
                <p>The novel thus suggests forensic analysis as a reading strategy that we situate
                    alongside a broader range of new reading practices that have been generated by
                    quantitative approaches to literary study. Regarding his own use of computer
                    forensics to read a work of digital interactive fiction, Kirschenbaum writes,
                        <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">This exercise [forensics]

                        heterogeneous information once deposited on the original storage

                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="20"/></cit>. Computer forensics of a digital
                    literary text involves analyzing the text as data, <quote rend="inline"

                    only recoverable as hexadecimal codes. The viewing of text as code may render it
                    illegible to traditional close reading but can nevertheless enable a form of
                    reading closer to the <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2007"
                        >technical praxis</quote> involved in the production of the work. The
                    reading practice that Kirschenbaum develops here exists in a continuum with
                    other forms of reading that have been proposed in conjunction with new practices
                    of electronic textuality. Specifically, the prospect of digitizing increasingly
                    wider swaths of the literary archive and of storing bibliographic information on
                    that archive in a searchable form opens literary history to new forms of machine
                    reading and quantitative methods. Elsewhere, Kirschenbaum himself has advocated
                    data mining as an approach to the analysis of poetry, which he describes as
                    continuous with a long history of changing reading practices <ptr
                        target="#kirschenbaum2007"/>. Indeed, under the influence of Moretti, data
                    mining and other quantitative methods have become known as <soCalled>distant reading,</soCalled> the very opposite of
                    traditional close reading. Kirschenbaum himself has made this connection when he
                    writes, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2007">The adoption of
                        computational techniques within the humanities allows us to build tools that

                    tools for reading is to counter the close analysis of an individual text as in

                    analysis of text as such. </p>

                    information, a point of what Kirschenbaum refers to as <cit><quote rend="inline"

                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008"/></cit>. In order for the information to be retrieved
                    Ava must not simply restore it from the material surface of a hard drive but, in
                    one of the novel’s most fantastical moments, must seek the electronic traces of
                    the information from the atmosphere, an image of the <soCalled>ether</soCalled> to which forgotten digital
                    information disappears. As the novel describes: <cit><quote rend="block"
                        source="#ghosh2001">The message might still be found, Ava told him. It would
                        just take a while. It had been typed on one of those old-fashioned,
                        contact-based alphabetical keyboards. The electronic signals emitted by the
                        keys were probably still traceable. It was simply a question of matching the
                        electronic <q>fingerprint</q> of
                        Murugan’s E-mail message to every electronic signal that was still alive in

                </p>
                <p>This depiction of Ava scouring the <soCalled>ionosphere</soCalled> is indeed a sort of limit
                    case for the forensic imagination as Kirschenbaum would put it. But what the
                    novel is doing in this account is dramatizing a fantasy of extreme
                    recoverability of electronic information enabled by digital media.
                    Kirschenbaum’s take on the discourse of the <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#kirschenbaum2008">virtual</quote> in new media underscores the
                    fact that what is thought of as the immateriality of information is in fact a
                    form of materiality that is visible given the appropriate techniques and
                    practices of detection and visualization. As he writes, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#kirschenbaum2008">the ether into which digital objects are often
                        said to vanish is a historically constructed and contested site, with a rich

                        nineteenth century</quote>
                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="67"/></cit>. This facet of digital media is
                    underscored in the novel when it turns out that Murugan’s email could be
                    recovered from a practically incalculable amount of data in only a matter of
                    minutes. The fantasy invoked here would have it that all information has an
                    electronic signature that can be located somewhere given sufficient processing
                    ability. And thus, historical memory too can be reshaped and reconstituted, new
                    narratives discovered and produced, and new meanings generated. </p>
                <p> As is already clear, Kirschenbaum’s study of digital forensics and electronic
                    literature offers a number of surprising points of intersection with Ghosh’s
                        <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title>. The imagination of the
                    digital archive in <title rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title> is very
                    much informed by early discourses on machine reading and electronic textuality.
                    At the same time, the plot of the novel turns on the use of digital forensics,
                    the fact of the indelibility of electronic inscription. As Kirschenbaum puts it
                    succinctly, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">The hard drive,
                        and magnetic media more generally, are mechanisms of extreme inscription —
                        that is, they offer a limit case for how the inscriptive act can be imagined
                        and executed</quote>
                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="74"/></cit>. <title rend="italic">The Calcutta
                        Chromosome</title> also presents a limit case for imagining the very
                    possibility of digital forensics, the idea that any electronic inscription can
                    be recovered, even inscriptions not written on to the surface of a hard drive
                    disc. The impossibility of forgetting, both culturally and materially, is a
                    constitutive property of electronic textuality. Kirschenbaum points out, <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">Computing is thus situated within
                        a millennia-long tradition of reusable writing technologies, a tradition

                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="70"/></cit>. Inasmuch as electronic inscription
                    is impervious to forgetting, what Kirschenbaum calls the <cit><quote rend="inline"

                    reusable writing, although he does not, Freud’s example of the mystic writing

                    </note> Moreover, as a science, computer forensics has a history that
                    Kirschenbaum finds to be almost uncannily close to modern textual criticism, the
                    nineteenth century disciplines of <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#kirschenbaum2008">questioned document analysis</quote> and

                    forensics counter the prevailing notion of ephemerality in digital media, but
                    also it provides a reading practice that offers an alternative to what
                    Kirschenbaum sees as the screen essentialism of prevailing accounts of
                    electronic textuality. Digital forensics makes visible for analysis the traces
                    of electronic inscription generated by digital literature, in a sense freeing
                    interpretation from screen. </p>
                <p>Ghosh is thus interested in the figure of the digital archive in part for its
                    relevance to contemporary practices of memorialization and historiography. As
                    Kirschenbaum’s interest in digital forensics makes clear, new media raise
                    significant questions about the ephemerality of cultural memory and the desire
                    for a record that is impervious to forgetting. The critic Andreas Huyssen has
                    explicated the contemporary condition of <quote rend="inline" source="#huyessen2003">memory
                        fever</quote> evidenced by the craze for museum building and other
                    memorializing projects, which seems closely connected to the imagined
                    implications for memory and forgetting offered by digitization. Huyssen
                    addresses the concern over digital archiving from a perspective not far removed
                    from Kirschenbaum’s writing on digital forensics. Huyssen writes: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#huyssen2003">Some have turned to the idea of
                            the archive as counterweight to the ever-increasing pace of change, as a
                            site of temporal and spatial preservation. From the point of view of the
                            archive, forgetting is the ultimate transgression. But how reliable or
                            foolproof are our digitalized archives? Computers are barely fifty years
                            old and already we need <q>data

                </p>
                <p>The emergence of computer forensics as a full-fledged science speaks to the need
                    to counteract forgetting. Kirschenbaum’s critique of the view of new media as
                    ephemeral aligns with this caution against over-anxiousness about digitization.
                    What he calls the <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">forensic
                        imagination</quote> is therefore nothing other than a way to describe the
                    practices of memorialization that emerge in contemporary culture to guard
                    against this fear of oblivion. As Huyssen continues, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#huyssen2003">The threat of oblivion thus emerges from the very

                    imagination are closely connected with the institutions of the archive and the
                    museum, emerging from this paradoxical relation between remembering and
                    forgetting. </p>
                <p> What, then, does this reading of the <quote rend="inline" source="#ghosh2001"
                        >forensic imagination</quote> at work in the aesthetics of machine reading
                    offer us for assessing the stakes of the digital literary? In <title
                        rend="italic">The Calcutta Chromosome</title>, while digital forensics is
                    the last of the archival strategies used in the novel to recover the fragmentary
                    texts through which the narrative proceeds to this point, once Phulboni’s ghost
                    stories are identified as the final piece of the puzzle, machine reading again
                    becomes consequential in the final assembly of the Spiritualist program for the
                    transmigration of souls. At the end of the novel, it becomes clearer why the
                    novel takes the form of science fiction at all — because the perspective for
                    taking in all the fragmentary narratives that the text assembles requires new
                    reading technologies. As Murugan speculates, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#ghosh2001">maybe they’re waiting on a technology that’ll make it
                        easier and quicker to deliver their story to whoever they’re keeping it for:
                        a technology that’ll be a lot more efficient in mounting it than anything
                        that’s available right now</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ghosh2001" loc="219"/></cit>. This technology, it turns out, is Ava.
                    Thus, the novel imagines a future of the digital in which the digital archive’s
                    capacity for nearly infinite storage allows the reader, in this case Antar, to
                    achieve the perspective of the posthuman future. The literary work, as the last
                    of the <soCalled>cut and pasted</soCalled> texts
                    of the narrative, is not peripheral to this process, but is conceptualized in
                    the novel as central to the transformations enabled by the digital. As
                    Bishnupriya Ghosh puts it in her reading of the text, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#ghosh2004a">By the end of the novel, the vernacular literary tale
                        is the <emph>only</emph> authoritative means through which the characters
                        can decode the muddled and untruthful records of scientific
                        discovery</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ghosh2004a" loc="214"/></cit>. Machine reading, then, in the novel’s
                    conclusion, is posited as the technology by which the local knowledge encoded in
                    subaltern texts — unrecognizable in conventional histories — is preserved for
                    the posthuman future of the novel’s imagined aesthetic utopia. </p>
                <p> The depiction of machine reading in <title rend="italic">The Calcutta
                        Chromosome</title> presents a number of challenges for our conception of the
                    digital literary. The novel asks questions, in other words, about how the
                    literary as such functions in light of the collapsing of distinctions by which
                    all texts become objects of computational analysis or <soCalled>not-reading.</soCalled> While it is tempting to consider that the
                    literary as a category is outmoded by <soCalled>not-reading</soCalled> (the tantalizing possibility held out by Moretti in the
                    promise of going beyond the canon), my reading of <title rend="italic">The
                        Calcutta Chromosome</title> suggests that this is not the case. In such
                    texts of the <soCalled>forensic imagination,</soCalled>
                    <soCalled>not-reading</soCalled> does not eschew the
                    literary so much as it articulates it on another level formality — the
                    historiographic register of the inscription of evidence or data, of which
                    computational methods and digital forensics may be seen as an intensification.
                    If we return by way of a conclusion to Phulboni’s speeches on writing and
                    silence we can expand on this insight: <cit><quote rend="block" source="#ghosh2001"
                        >But here our city, where all law, natural and human, is held in capricious
                        suspension, that which is hidden has no need of words to give it life; like
                        a creature that lives in a perverse element, it mutates to discover
                        sustenance precisely where it appears to be most starkly withheld — in this
                        case, silence.</quote> <ptr target="#ghosh2001" loc="25"/></cit>
            
                </p>
                <p>The literary becomes visible at the point where the object exists as a kind of
                    pure presence freed from the demands of exegesis. The literary speaks in its own
                    voice inasmuch as it does not require the critic to speak for it. Thus, the
                    paradoxical relation to memory we see in Ava’s digital archiving, where the
                    object is imbued with the meaning of the archivist and thereby consigned to the
                    meaninglessness of computer memory, is repeated. So too, the literary object
                    both speaks and is silent, is recognizable as literary inasmuch as it is silent
                    in the world, a condition that Rancière refers to as the paradoxical <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#ranciere2009">silent speech</quote> central to his notion of
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ranciere2009">literariness.</quote>
                    <note> For Rancière’s discussion of <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#ranciere2009">silent speech</quote> in relation to
                        literariness, see <title rend="italic">The Aesthetic Unconscious </title>
                        <ptr target="#ranciere2009"/>.</note>
                </p>
                <p> This conception of the literary, memory and the digital archive ties together
                    the novel’s historiographical project. In theorizing the Spiritualist program he
                    has discovered in the secret history of malaria research, Murugan describes what
                    he calls the <soCalled>counter-science</soCalled> that functions in contrast to established
                    scientific endeavor. As we have seen, Murugan assumes that silence and secrecy
                    would be foundational assumptions of the functioning of counter-science in
                    contrast to the epistemological hegemony of scientific ways of knowing. The
                    post-historicist perspective of the future adopted at the end of the novel
                    through the mediation of Ava is thus the one that brings both the secret
                    non-knowledge of counter-science and the silent speech of literature to
                    culmination. As I have been arguing, this revision of not only the historical
                    record as contained in the archive but also the entire historicist way of
                    knowing is key to Ghosh’s project. The conclusion of <title rend="italic">The
                        Calcutta Chromosome</title> in Antar’s embrace of the posthuman future
                    prepared by the Spiritualist cabal continuing the work of the indigenous
                    practitioner Mangala, discovered by Murugan’s research, and encoded in the work
                    of vernacular literature by Phulboni, is in line with Dipesh Chakrabarty’s
                    advocation of the post-historicist perspective of the future in the now.
                    Chakrabarty describes this futurity as the <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#chakrabarty2007">other futurity we could refer to as the futures
                        that already are</quote>
                    <ptr target="#chakrabarty2007" loc="250"/></cit>. This, then, is what Ghosh’s novel
                    has to say about the future of digital memory and machine reading, that new
                    reading practices function on a continuum with archival practice and literary
                    aesthetics. The <soCalled>silent
                        speech</soCalled> that is constitutive of the subaltern archive is also that
                    which enables the transformation of reading in the digital age. </p>
