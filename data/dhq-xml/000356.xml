        <body>
            <p>I did not expect a book titled <title rend="italic">Reading Writing Interfaces: From
                    the Digital to the Bookbound</title> to announce, on its first page, that it <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014">begins and ends with magic</quote>
                    <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="ix"/>
                </cit>. But Lori Emerson’s convincing argument in favor of <q>demystifying
                    devices</q> — as well as their architects and users — is full of parlor tricks
                as well as missing Statues of Liberty, Gob Bluths and David Copperfields <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="9"/>. Truly, the greatest trick Emerson pulls off is
                convincing the world that the <soCalled>interface,</soCalled> a term that sounds
                like something Will Ferrell might have come up with in a <title rend="italic">Saturday Night Live</title> George W. Bush sketch, is tied to a rich and
                far-reaching history worth exploring. Rather than <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014">simply that which opens up from one distinct space to
                        another distinct space</quote>
                    <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="x"/>
                </cit>, the interface, in Emerson’s hands, is the site which determines the very
                nature of our approach to reading, writing, and navigating the world around us,
                often with an invisible, at times even nefarious, hand.</p>
            <p>Thoughts on the relationship between magic and technology have inspired countless
                science fiction novels, comic books, and press releases in recent years. Was it
                Steve Jobs or a character from Warren Ellis and John Cassady’s <title rend="italic">Planetary</title> who bragged about the ability to send <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ellis2001">a signal to reality’s operating system</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ellis2001" loc="20"/>
                </cit>? My favorite story about the intersection between these two
                seemingly-disparate worlds is <title rend="italic">Big</title>, the 1988 Hollywood
                fable starring Tom Hanks. The architect of the embiggening that transforms the body
                of thirteen-year-old Josh Baskin (played by David Moscow) into one that resembles an
                Academy-Award-winning adult is Zoltar, a coin-operated machine who promises to grant
                wishes. Zoltar is uncomplicated. He is efficient. He is a literal plot device, an
                animatronic fortune teller that less charitable viewers might find heavy-handed (not
                to mention orientalist, given his turban and robes and angry glowing eyes). But he
                also has a well-designed, intuitive interface: he can be operated by a child with
                minimal prompting or instruction (though Baskin does have to hit the machine a few
                times to get it started). He can only perform limited functions, but his users seem
                to find little reason to pursue other avenues of inquiry. He even provides a
                receipt: a tiny <q>Zoltar Speaks</q> card that lets users know their wish has been
                granted. Viewed through the lens of Emerson’s magical thinking, he is also the dream
                of many twenty-first century users of digital technology, a device of seemingly
                limitless possibilities. If only he accepted credit cards. And fit in your
                pocket.</p>
            <p>The interface is surprisingly front and center in many parts of <title rend="italic">Big</title>. Beyond Zoltar, there is, of course, the famous scene set in New
                York City’s FAO Schwarz (RIP) where Baskin, in the midst of providing UX advice to
                the CEO of the MacMillan Toys Company (Robert Loggia!), literally stumbles across
                the toy store’s <q>Walking Piano</q> and <soCalled>magically</soCalled> performs two
                musical numbers. While the first steps on the piano are preliminary and cautious,
                Baskin and the CEO quickly master the device, speeding through <title rend="quotes">Chopsticks</title> to the delight of the assembled shoppers. The CEO is so
                impressed that he gives Baskin a job on the spot. Like many viewers, <title rend="quotes">Big Piano</title>” creator Remo Saraceni sees in <title rend="italic">Big</title>
                <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#saraceni2008">a beautiful message of innocence</quote>
                    <ptr target="#saraceni2008"/>
                </cit>.</p>
            <p>But what if we do not subscribe to this romantic notion of wisdom inherent in a
                child’s gaze? What if, like Emerson, we are aware of the ways in which <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014">the supposed naturalness of ubicomp-related gestural
                        interfaces is utterly misleading</quote>
                    <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="6"/>
                </cit>? As a kid I was amazed by how quickly this Baskin kid figured out how to play
                the piano: I didn’t have <title rend="quotes">Chopsticks</title> up my sleeve,
                because I didn’t grow up in a suburban environment that encouraged and afforded
                piano lessons. While there is some exploratory tinkering in this scene, there is no
                real trial-and-error with the device, no room for failure. These narrative
                trajectories live on in the marketing materials for new devices: for example, who
                could forget the irritating hipster star of an early Google Glass commercial, a man
                who uses his gadgets to track down a <title rend="italic">Ukelele in A Day</title>
                book and broadcast his fast and easy mastery of the instrument (with a New York City
                skyline backdrop, at sunset no less!) to impress his significant other? Why be John
                Cusack at the end of <title rend="italic">Say Anything</title> when you could buy a
                device that turns you into Peter Gabriel in less than 24 hours? </p>
            <p>The last technological interface to be introduced in <title rend="italic">Big</title>
                remains in production limbo by the end of the film. As a kid, Baskin’s dream of the
                ultimate comic – one with a <soCalled>choose-your-own-adventure</soCalled> interface
                that allows readers to pursue a wider range of stories than you’d generally find in
                a single issue – fascinated me. As his coworker Susan notes, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#big1988">the kid makes his own decision</quote>
                    <ptr target="#big1988"/>
                </cit>. That the comic’s target demographic will inevitably run out of stories is
                touted as a feature, not a bug: when someone asks what happens when a reader
                exhausts the options stored on the device’s computer chip, Susan replies that <q>you
                    just sell different adventures.</q> Instead of spending a dollar for 22 pages of
                a single story, children (and their parents!) now have the option of shelling out
                $19 for the illusion of choice <ptr target="#big1988"/>.</p>
            <p>Josh Baskin leaves before finishing his presentation on his digital comic book,
                deciding to return to the Zoltar machine and overwrite his initial wish with a wish
                to return to childhood. It’s interesting that the film chooses to stage his retreat
                at the moment when he is on the cusp of solving the problem he faced at the
                beginning of the film. The very first image we see in <title rend="italic">Big</title> is, perhaps surprisingly, a computer screen. <q>YOU ARE STANDING IN
                    THE CAVERN OF THE EVIL WIZARD,</q> it reads, underneath an image of said wizard.
                    <q>ALL AROUND YOU ARE THE CARCASSES OF SLAIN DWARFS.</q> Called to action by the
                game, Baskin types, <q>MELT WIZARD.</q> The program requires a more specific
                command. The boy seems frustrated: the thermal pod his digital avatar carries in his
                hand seems to be the obvious tool of destruction, yet it ends up dying when his
                follow-up response is delayed by a request from his mother to take out the trash
                    <ptr target="#big1988"/>. Baskin spends a significant portion of his time at
                MacMillan Toys designing a more engaging, more intuitive, more mobile version of
                this story; one that might, for instance, anticipate a user’s need to pause while he
                or she is being yelled at by their parents. Was the project a failure, too
                cost-prohibitive, not innovative enough? Are we expected to read in the immediate
                consideration of the economics of such a device the ways in which innovation is
                limited by market forces? <title rend="italic">Big</title> is obviously more
                interested in imagining the possibilities of toys designed by children, warts and
                all, than in manufacturing the real thing. </p>
            <div>
                <head>Melt The Interface</head>
                <p>Thomas Padilla argues that, <q>failure should be a goal</q> in developing digital
                    initiatives <ptr target="#padilla2016"/>. The poets and artists surveyed by
                    Emerson revel in various acts and performances of failure. They unlock the black
                    boxes of proprietary hardware and software and force the contents found therein
                    to misbehave. They pull algorithms kicking and screaming into the light of day.
                    They create works that stretch across all corners of our material landscapes,
                    messy portraits smeared with the fingerprints of their creators and the marks of
                    their tools of composition. Unlike most project managers, librarians, or
                    developers, artists can devote their energies to producing work <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014">that is deliberately difficult to navigate or whose
                            interfaces are anything but user-friendly</quote>
                        <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="4"/>
                    </cit>. But as Padilla suggests, maybe there is a need for more time, labor, and
                    institutional support devoted to explorations of difficulty and experimentation
                    in design. Maybe a wider range of digital humanists can productively resist or
                    critique user preferences for the invisible if they, like the artists featured
                    in Emerson’s book, use strategies of defamiliarization to make what seems
                    natural <emph>unnatural</emph>. We’re not going to learn how to melt wizards if
                    we’re afraid to explore the possibilities of melting wizards in the first
                    place.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the digital interfaces of daily academic labor are very much visible to
                    us, almost frustratingly so. Instructors are often strongly encouraged or even
                    required to use Canvas and Blackboard: content management systems that seem
                    designed to punish students. If your university library has decided to invest
                    more in digital ebooks than physical copies, you have likely had a great time
                    doing research in Ebrary’s web interface, apparently invented by someone who
                    hates to read. And many digital humanists have likely heard the sounds of
                    snickering from the snarkier non-DH faculty members in the room while you’ve
                    stared with horror at an unfamiliar projector interface just before the job
                    talk, or when said interface decides all of a sudden that the commands it
                    prompts you to follow are more recommendations than directives for how the
                    display might be turned on. Perhaps we’ve used words like
                        <soCalled>intuitive</soCalled> or <soCalled>clean</soCalled> to describe our
                    preferred alternatives to these technological monstrosities. Emerson is here to
                    remind us that the bargains we make in such desperate moments are almost always
                    Faustian.</p>
                <p>Specifically, Emerson critiques <soCalled>glossy</soCalled> interfaces that <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014">further [alienate] the user from having access to the
                            underlying working of the device</quote>
                        <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="xi"/>
                    </cit>. She identifies the paradox at the heart of contemporary technobabble:
                    for all the rhetoric about the ways in which <q>the boundary between human and
                        information is eradicated</q> with every new user-friendly device, the
                    reality is one where we rely more and more on tools <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#emerson2014">entirely closed off to the user</quote>
                        <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="x–xi"/>
                    </cit>. Some of the benefits of averting a future where The Singularity is

                    which predates the finger-swiping mechanics we have come to rely so heavily upon
                    in the 2000s and 2010s), poetic apps created specifically for the iPad by Jason
                    Edward Lewis and Erik Loyer (among others), projects that exploit glitches in

                    canonical web design principles and conventions (projects by Jason Nelson and

                    to new or better uses of technology; instead more often than not, their

                    work for my dissertation, which focused on poetry and digital media, I would
                    occasionally find myself shaking my head at seminal works of electronic
                    literature that were held in high regard by other audiences. I do think there is
                    still a great deal of hyperbole circulating in appraisals and defenses of
                    electronic literature, and I wonder about the negative influence of
                    institutional circuits and funding outlets who privilege particular claims about
                    its value. But I also, at times, have lacked an understanding of key contextual
                    and conceptual material in relation to particular projects, which is why I’ve
                    grown more and more appreciative of the critical and curatorial lenses of
                    authors and artists like Dene Grigar, Mark Sample and Élika Ortega (among
                    others), as well as initiatives like the Electronic Literature Collection
                    series. I don’t know if <title rend="italic">Reading Writing Interfaces</title>
                    will succeed in converting all skeptics, but I think Emerson does an admirable
                    job of connecting seemingly-esoteric work to experiences with interfaces that
                    might resonate with many of our heavily-mediated, everyday lives.</p>

                            itself and not understand that they instead offer us an increasingly
                            difficult to pin down, perhaps even insidious form of control on our
                            creative expression?</quote>
                        <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="144"/>
                    </cit>. What if we did more than wait passively for the equivalent of Zoltar and
                    his invisible hand? What if we spent less time reveling in the clean, white,
                    endless expanses of Apple and Google commercials and instead took a closer look
                    at the economic and human costs of the labor generating our devices? What if it
                    was OK to pursue creative endeavors that called attention to their present and
                    attendant material conditions, instead of wasting time writing and making
                    excuses for sententious, pretentious trash? </p>
                <p><title rend="italic">Reading Writing Interfaces</title> has helped me to more
                    productively call attention to ideas of the interface in my academic writings
                    and teaching materials. Within my immediate institutional context as an
                    instructor in Public Humanities, it has provided me with a useful framework to
                    help students and faculty members think more about the design principles
                    motivating their digital projects (as well as my own). Beyond professional
                    applications, it points the way towards new weapons to help in the war against
                    the wizards who are transforming the digital spaces we share into
                    two-dimensional kingdoms that are white, dull, and cold as ice.</p>
