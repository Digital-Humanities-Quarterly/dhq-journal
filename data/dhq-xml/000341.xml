                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>In the emerging field of digital style analysis, scholars have been dwelling on a
                    perceived irreconcilability of <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#moretti2000"/> and <soCalled>close reading</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#fish2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#ransom1937"/>. This situation is somewhat reminiscent of the
                        <soCalled>paradigm wars</soCalled> in social science, where for years, one
                    could either adhere to a quantitative or a qualitative mindset. Taking seriously
                    both the hermeneutic and the empirical traditions of (digital) stylistic
                    research, the present paper proposes <soCalled>a mixed-methods</soCalled>
                    coalition of approaches. To establish links between the mixed-methods paradigm
                    from Social Sciences <ptr target="#creswell2007"/> and stylistic practices
                    within Digital Humanities (DH), the present article discusses common methods of
                    distant, close, and ‘scalable reading’ as well as a flexibly adjustable
                    definition of style <ptr target="#herrmann2015"/>. In the practical part of the
                    paper, I report a ‘mixed-methods digital stylistics’ study on Franz Kafka’s
                    prose. Scaling the degree of abstraction and contextuality of the data according
                    to particular research questions, I combine (1) <soCalled>quantitative
                        hypothesis testing</soCalled> (examining Kafka’s stylistic
                        <soCalled>uniqueness</soCalled> by means of a stylometric measure); (2)
                        <soCalled>quantitative exploration</soCalled> (analyzing the first hundred
                    statistically overrepresented words in Kafka); and (3) <soCalled>qualitative
                        text analysis</soCalled> (KWIC and close reading to investigate the
                    functions of a particular style marker in the context of Kafka’s <title rend="italic">The Judgment</title> [<title rend="italic">Das
                    Urteil</title>]). Generally, for digital stylistics, I propose (a) raising
                    epistemological and methodological awareness within the field, and (b) framing
                    the research within the mixed-method paradigm that in fact seems very well
                    suited to DH.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p> A whole new generation of scholars has recently been entering the world of
                    digital stylistics, appreciating the availability of digital resources in the
                    form of data, tools, and infrastructure. The recent proliferation is visible for
                    example in monographs (e.g., <ptr target="#hoover2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>
                    <ptr target="#mahlberg2013"/>), easy-to-access analysis tools (e.g., <ptr target="#anthony2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#sinclair2016"/>
                    <ptr target="#eder2016"/>) and guides to text analysis in programming languages
                    such as <term>R</term> and <term>Python</term> (<ptr target="#bird2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2014"/>), just to name a few. Contributions to the digital
                    analysis of style abound in journals such as <title rend="italic">DH
                        Quarterly</title>, <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarship in the
                        Humanities </title>(formerly <title rend="italic">Literary and Linguistic
                        Computing</title>), the newly founded <title rend="italic">Digital Literary
                        Studies and Cultural Analytics</title>, the proceedings of the <title rend="italic">Workshops on Computational Linguistics for Literature</title>,
                    as well as in <title rend="italic">Language and Literature</title> and the
                        <title rend="italic">International Journal of Corpus Linguistics</title>.
                    Last, but not least, the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) has
                    formed the new special interested group (SIG) <title rend="italic">Digital
                        Literary Stylistics</title> (<ref target="http://dls.hypotheses.org/">SIG-DLS</ref>). This is an exciting time, with a discipline of digital
                    stylistics in Digital Humanities emerging, expanding, and gradually maturing. </p>
                <p>However, despite these recent developments, and despite a substantial tradition
                    of digital analyses of literary style across fields (see <ptr target="#biber2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#burrows1987"/>
                    <ptr target="#holmes1998"/>
                    <ptr target="#mahlberg2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#semino2004"/>
                    <ptr target="#steen2010"/>), <soCalled>digital stylistics</soCalled> as a
                    discipline is still in a nascent status. This can be directly linked to its
                    interdisciplinary character, with a kaleidoscope of methods, research paradigms,
                    and world views. This heterogeneity is as much a potential source of confusion
                    as well as a great asset:</p>
                <p>On the one hand, the diversity may pose disadvantages. Those digital
                    stylisticians who are trained in hermeneutics see themselves confronted with
                    handling the requirements of an empirical quantitative research paradigm, with
                    issues such as standardized research designs, procedures of data sampling, and
                    analytical strategies, including statistics. Others, who come from fields based
                    around computing, such as natural language processing (NLP), computational
                    linguistics, and corpus linguistics, may be unsure what to do with the
                    deliberate open-endedness of qualitative, hermeneutic research and the important
                    role ascribed to subjectivity and context (cf. <ptr target="#vanzundert2015"/>).
                    Yet others may be very skeptical about the possibility of clearly defined
                    ‘methods’ for digital stylistics in the first place, because of a perceived
                    irreconcilability of numerical and hermeneutic approaches. Overall, a number of
                    reasons accounts for a perceived lack of clear methodological standards,
                    procedures and designs.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the juxtaposition of hermeneutic and scientific-empirical
                    traditions provides a great potential for literary style research within DH.
                    Qualitative approaches such as literary criticism and stylistics have developed
                    a rich expertise in describing and understanding the aesthetic effects of
                    literary artifacts. Quantitative approaches such as corpus linguistics,
                    quantitative linguistics, computational linguistics, and data science generally,
                    have concentrated on exploring and explaining large-scale and general language
                    models by linguistic features. In digital stylistics, approaching aspects of
                    style from different angles – be these probabilistically obtained feature
                    patterns, predictive and descriptive accounts of quantitative style
                    distributions, or in-depth interpretations of stylistic phenomena in particular
                    textual contexts – opens up a truly multi-methodological research panorama.</p>
                <p>In fact, digital stylistics, with its many branches and predecessors, has seen
                    method-mixing for a long time (see, e.g., <ptr target="#biber1988"/>
                    <ptr target="#burrows1987"/>
                    <ptr target="#craig1999"/>
                    <ptr target="#leech2007"/>
                    <ptr target="#spitzer1961"/>). Yet, we are presently dwelling on a perceived
                    irreconcilability of a form of <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#moretti2000"/> on the one hand, and <soCalled>close
                        reading</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#ransom1937"/> in a more aesthetically oriented variety <ptr target="#fish2012"/> on the other. Where distant reading applies aggregating
                    measures that are designed to produce quantitative evidence with statistical
                    backup, hermeneutic reading maintains a more qualitative relationship with
                    (whole) texts, explicitly calling for open-ended and subjective dimensions of
                    interpretation. Between these two <soCalled>paradigms</soCalled>, many see close
                    reading as <soCalled>old-fashioned</soCalled> for being anecdotal, overly
                    subjective, or uncontrolled, whereas to others, distant reading appears
                        <soCalled>perilous</soCalled> for being reductionist, deterministic, or
                    neo-/postpositivist. This situation is reminiscent of the <soCalled>paradigm
                        wars</soCalled> in social science, where for years, one could either adhere
                    to a quantitative or a qualitative mindset (cf. <ptr target="#creswell2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#punch2014"/>).</p>
                <p>My suggestion for DH is not to fortify an <soCalled>either-or</soCalled>-mindset
                    (possibly mistaking digital stylistics for a distant-reading only paradigm, cf.
                        <ptr target="#gooding2013"/>), but to work on a principled coalition of the
                    two views, propelled by a simple and pragmatic view of selecting the best
                    fitting method for any given research question (cf. <ptr target="#creswell2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#creswell2007"/>
                    <ptr target="#symonds2010"/>). In line with the recently emerged mixed-method
                    paradigm of the social sciences, I thus suggest that DH stylistics should move
                    beyond the dichotomies of <soCalled>close vs. distant</soCalled>,
                        <soCalled>qualitative vs. quantitative</soCalled>, <soCalled>explanatory vs.
                        exploratory</soCalled>, <soCalled>inductive vs. deductive</soCalled>,
                        <soCalled>understanding vs. explaining</soCalled> – and, possibly even
                        <soCalled>hermeneutic vs. empirical</soCalled><note> One should note that
                        mixed-methods is essentially an empirical research paradigm. This is
                        compatible with a digital stylistics that understands
                            <soCalled>empirical</soCalled> in the wide sense – as the
                            <soCalled>acquisition of knowledge through observation</soCalled>
                        (“Wissensgewinn durch Beobachtung”) <ptr target="#eibl2013" loc="23"/>.</note>. However, <soCalled>moving beyond</soCalled> here cannot possibly
                    mean resorting to an <soCalled>everything-goes</soCalled> approach that
                    defocuses the nitty-gritty details of difference, but an informed perspective
                    that enables scholars to choose particular research designs by their particular
                    objectives. Seen from the perspective of an emerging discipline of digital
                    stylistics, the challenge is now to provide a common framework for the disparate
                    approaches to stylistic inquiry. This includes a transparent and systematic
                    overview of the different approaches and methods actually employed, as well as a
                    sort of inventory for what kind of method is suitable for what kind of research
                        aim.<note> This may possibly even entail striving for some unifying
                        epistemological perspective. Some mixed-methods scholars advocate
                        pragmatism, such as Creswell who assumes a strong link between

                        constructivist, participatory, pragmatic) and research methods <ptr target="#creswell2014"/>. Others, such as Kelle describe weaker links

                <p>That quantitative style metrics may combine with in-depth studies of style
                    patterns of individual texts has already been proposed from within DH and
                    labeled as <soCalled>middle-distance reading</soCalled> (<ptr target="#craig2013"/>, for a similar approach, see also <ptr target="#craig1999"/>), or <soCalled>scalable reading</soCalled> (<ptr target="#mueller2012"/>, see <ptr target="#jannidis2014" loc="30–31"/>, <ptr target="#weitin2017"/>). These propositions, however, have just begun to
                    receive broader attention. In fact, many may have mistaken them for the
                    examination of <soCalled>mid-sized data sets</soCalled> that are neither
                        <soCalled>big data</soCalled> (for a recent discussion of this term, see
                        <ptr target="#borgman2015"/>) nor individual texts, but something in
                    between. In my view, this data-size-driven reading of the term is overly
                    simplistic. Rather, the emphasis should lie not so much on the scale in terms of
                    the <emph>size</emph> of the data volume examined, but on the <emph>research
                        process</emph>. <soCalled>Scaling</soCalled> here means complementing one
                    methodology with another, compensating for weaknesses of each approach, and
                    building on the combined strengths. Mueller, in an analogy of using Google
                    earth, describes the essence of scalable reading as to <cit>

                    states that the tension <q>between algorithmic analysis and hermeneutic close
                        reading should not be overstated</q>, since their relation is often <cit>

                    </cit>, mixed-methods research is a process of combining discrete qualitative
                    and quantitative steps, motivated by some degree of methodological and
                    epistemological awareness. It thus needs to address the role of
                        interpretation<note> Within mixed-method approaches, interpretation is being
                        recognized as a vital operation, linked to the tradition of hermeneutic
                        inquiry: <cit>

                        </cit>. Good mixed-methods research in DH stylistics should fulfill criteria
                        that allow for complementariness (cf. <ptr target="#miles2014" loc="311–314"/>) – and methodological awareness. If such criteria are met, subjectivity
                        and phases of open-ended interpretation are highly justified. These become
                        problematic only where introspection and impressionistic observations are
                        used in an opaque way, which however is true for any quantitative-scientific
                        study as well <ptr target="#rudman2016"/>. Problematic is also a dogmatic
                        rejection of (aggregated) <soCalled>data</soCalled>. Indispensable practical
                        factors of sound mixed-method research are clear language use and the
                        definition of concepts and terms.</note> and the degree of open-endedness
                    and subjectivity involved <emph>in either form</emph> of research – issues that
                    have received some attention also from within DH (e.g., <ptr target="#gius2015"/>

                    <ptr target="#vanzundert2015"/>). Mixed-method research highlights the
                    hermeneutical dimension of quantitative approaches, not least by emphasizing
                    that quantitative researchers are traditionally <cit>

                    <p>The most basic distinction between qualitative and quantitative methods
                        concerns the nature of the data examined, which is normally numerical vs.
                        non-numerical data <ptr target="#creswell2014"/>
                        <ptr target="#punch2014"/>. For digital stylistics, this may be simplified
                        as '<emph>numbers derived from aggregations of words/texts</emph>'
                        (quantitative) vs. '<emph>(elements of) meaningful textual
                            configurations</emph>' (qualitative). This discrimination relates to the
                        more common distinction between big and small data sets. One of the most
                        fruitful distinctions is that between <term>variable-oriented</term> and
                            <term>case-oriented</term> analysis: variable-oriented analysis (e.g.,
                            <soCalled>style variation across author, genre, time in German Modernist
                            literature</soCalled>) is more often quantitative, and well-suited for
                        finding probabilistic relationships among variables in a large population,
                        whereas case-oriented analysis (e.g., <soCalled>paradoxical style of Franz
                            Kafka’s <title rend="italic">The Judgment</title></soCalled>) is more
                        often qualitative, geared towards finding specific, concrete, historically
                        grounded patterns common to small sets of cases <ptr target="#punch2014" loc="307"/>. <soCalled>Variable-approaches</soCalled> have difficulties
                        with the complexities of causal relationships, while findings of
                            <soCalled>case-approaches</soCalled> often remain particularistic, i.e.
                        cannot be easily generalized. </p>
                    <p>Quantitative, variable-driven research overall strives for a high degree of
                        control, using standardization and tests of reliability to ensure
                        replicability and generalizability. It takes care that its measures and
                        results are not dependent on a particular researcher
                            (<soCalled>objectivity</soCalled>). In combination with representative
                        data sampling, it thus aims at overall descriptions of situations and
                        phenomena in a systematic and comparable way. In its stereotypical form,
                        quantitative research uses <soCalled>close-ended</soCalled> data collection
                        tools to <soCalled>settle the discussion</soCalled>, and to delimit the
                        range of possible interpretation of its results. </p>
                    <p>By contrast, qualitative research is more sensitive to context and process,
                        and aims for in-depth and holistic understanding, in order to do justice to
                        the complexity of a given phenomenon. Samples are usually small, and
                        sampling is guided by theoretical rather than probabilistic considerations.
                        Methods are less formalized than those in the quantitative approach, less
                        replicable, and have greater flexibility <ptr target="#punch2014" loc="307"/>. In its stereotypical form, qualitative research uses
                            <soCalled>open-ended</soCalled> data collection designed to
                            <soCalled>opening up the discussion</soCalled>, i.e. to generate new
                        hypotheses and theories and widen the range of possible perspectives on a
                        phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>This (simplified) distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches
                        is enlightening when considering the actual practices in digital stylistics.
                        For example, a prominent approach, <title rend="italic">algorithmic

                            <soCalled>scientific</soCalled> approaches and what he calls algorithmic
                        hermeneutics. In Ramsay’s view, the <soCalled>scientific</soCalled> approach
                        is exceedingly closed-ended, aimed at providing <cit>

                        </cit> – he thus appears to deny digital text analysis the epistemological
                        potential that lies in iterative (quantitative) hypothesis-testing. What is
                        more, by putting such a strong emphasis on the role of post-hoc
                        interpretation, he perilously defocuses the implicit assumptions that feed
                        into the algorithmic modeling itself <ptr target="#sculley2008"/>. </p>
                    <p>In my view, the scientific and humanistic paradigms as sketched by Ramsay
                        should <emph>both</emph> contribute to our discipline’s multi-methodological
                        setup, establishing a rich interconnected network of possible research

                        discussions as well as clear-cut conclusions about stylistic facts.
                        Eventually, people engaged in DH stylistics should <q>generate more

                    <p>The interesting point about mixed-method approaches is that they maintain the
                        basic distinction between quantitative and qualitative methods, while
                        simultaneously transcending it. Thus, they firstly acknowledge the two
                        paradigms, noting their strength and weaknesses, and then propose to: <cit>
                            <quote rend="block" source="#johnson2004">[c]ombine the methods in a way that achieves

                            <ptr target="#johnson2004" loc="18"/>
                        </cit> With this general rationale at its core, mixed-methods research has
                        been established as a third empirical paradigm<note> Recently, scholars like
                            Symonds &amp; Gorard have emphasized that a distinction between
                                <soCalled>quantitative</soCalled> and
                                <soCalled>qualitative</soCalled> research is a stereotypical
                            idealization <ptr target="#symonds2010"/>. As such, it indeed helps
                            structuring our understanding of practices. However, it may be
                            misleading to use a dichotomy as a basis for invoking a mixed-methods
                            paradigm, since research processes ‘in the wild’ are not necessarily
                            paradigmatic. Rather, they lie on a continuum between
                                    <emph><soCalled>open-endedness</soCalled> vs.
                                    <soCalled>closed-endedness</soCalled></emph> (data collection
                            tools), <emph><soCalled>non-numerical</soCalled> vs.
                                    <soCalled>numerical</soCalled></emph> (data types), and
                                    <emph><soCalled>interpretation of natural occurring
                                    data</soCalled> vs.

                            (analytical techniques). A gradual character of
                            quantification/qualification is actually evident in digital stylistics:
                            there are many quantitative studies that aim at exploration, rather than
                            at explanation through hypothesis testing (e.g., data science in the
                            sense of <ptr target="#manovich2015"/>). At the same time, close reading
                            can be used to test hypotheses derived from statistical quantitative
                            analyses (e.g., revealing what mode of thought representation is
                            actually invoked by a certain verb type that contributes significantly
                            to a factor analysis of genre style). However, I believe that working
                            with research paradigms has a useful structuring function and therefore

                    <head>Mixed-methods Digital Style Analysis</head>
                    <p> The strengths of mixed-methods can be directly applied to digital
                        stylistics: close and distant reading complement each other when adding
                        meaning to numbers, and precision to hermeneutically obtained insight. Also,
                        the generalizability of qualitative findings can be increased, as
                        quantitative findings can be grounded in context-driven analyses. Results
                        from both approaches can be validated through corroboration and convergence.
                        Another great asset of such a coalition of approaches is mutual methods
                        critique <ptr target="#kelle2008"/>, which likely increases the validity of
                        data and results as much as that of methods. And finally, a broader range of
                        research questions can be asked, which leads to a varied and flexible
                        generation of knowledge <ptr target="#johnson2004"/>.</p>
                    <p>In digital stylistics, we are confronted with the fact that
                            <soCalled>style</soCalled> is a heterogeneous category – already within
                        literary studies, and ever more so when adopting interdisciplinary and
                        international perspectives (for an overview of distinct philological
                        definitions of style, see <ptr target="#herrmann2015"/>). A definition that
                        allows for a quantitative as well as for a qualitative perspective on style,
                        and mixed approaches, is the following one: <cit>
                            <quote rend="block" source="#herrmann2015">Style is a property of texts constituted by an
                                ensemble of formal features which can be observed quantitatively or
                                qualitatively.</quote>
                            <ptr target="#herrmann2015" loc="44"/>
                        </cit> A quantitative, variable-driven approach may be interested in
                        extracting formal features from a large data set devoid of context, for
                        example gauging the <soCalled>similarity</soCalled> of authors by looking at
                        the most frequently used words (the dominant stylometric measure), whereas a
                            <soCalled>case-driven</soCalled> approach may be interested in aspects
                        of the holistic gestalt of single texts, or the function of previously
                        extracted featured within that context. A third kind of approach may use a
                        quantitative measure for exploring possible new variables (and thus, as a
                        quantitative-heuristic approach may not fit the simplified
                        quantitative-qualitative dichotomy). </p>
                    <p>The next section starts with a short (and by no means complete) overview of
                        qualitative and quantitative methods relevant for digital stylistics,
                        including a view on their respective strengths and limitations. It is
                        followed by a sketch of my own mixed-method study, which will then be
                        reported in more detail in section (3). Section (4) will subsequently draw
                        conclusions for practices in digital stylistics as an emerging field within
                        DH.</p>

                <head>The Method of the Art </head>
                <p>In actual stylistic research, the <soCalled>ensemble of formal
                        features</soCalled> is as a rule viewed either from a predominantly
                    quantitative or from a predominantly qualitative angle. With their predominant
                    qualitative perspective, literary criticism, (digital) stylistics, aesthetics,
                    and (digital) narratology have traditionally relied on versions of close
                    reading. This mode of scrutinizing analysis and synthesizing interpretation of
                    literary artifacts exploits the kind of situated and intuitive knowledge that
                    human evolution has produced in concert with scholarly expertise (for a
                    discussion of hermeneutics in DH, see <ptr target="#vanzundert2015"/>. In
                    stylistics, it has been most typically applied to: (a) explorations of the
                    effect of certain stylistic features in textual interaction, and (b) determining
                    the stylistic character of a piece of art as a coherent unit, including the
                    contributing elements <ptr target="#herrmann2015"/>. Goals of close reading are
                        <soCalled>linguistic observation</soCalled> as much as <soCalled>literary
                        insight</soCalled>, in the sense of Spitzer’s hermeneutic circle <ptr target="#leech2007" loc="11–12"/>. </p>
                <p>Applications of close reading to stylistic analysis are documented by a vast
                    literature, with its typical concentration on particular cases (and, alas,
                    sometimes vague generalizations). Variants of close reading, as a form of
                    qualitative research, are applied also in digital text analysis, including
                    computational linguistics/natural language processing (NLP). For example,
                    digital style research employs a range of visualization and manual annotation
                        tools<note> For a number of easily accessible text analysis visualization
                        tools, see the web-based tool Voyant <ptr target="#sinclair2016"/>.</note>
                    for close reading, such as KWIC (<term>Keyword in Context</term>), which is a
                    method typically applied in corpus stylistics. KWIC displays all instances of a
                    search word vertically, with the words’ direct textual context to both sides
                    (also called <term>concordance</term>). Running KWIC lists (facilitated by tools
                    such as AntConc and Voyant, as well as particular functions in R and Python)
                    allows the discerning of meaning and possibly the lexico-grammatical function of
                    a particular instance of a lemma in context (for an application in literary
                    criticism, see e.g., <ptr target="#müller2013"/>). <term>Annotation</term>,
                    depending on the basic methodological approach,<note> CATMA is a tool for manual
                        hermeneutic digital text annotation that features a comprehensive
                        narratological tag set <ptr target="#gius2015"/>.</note> may also involve
                    some form of close reading. For quantification-oriented annotation paradigms,
                    this holds true especially for the stage in which annotation (or
                        <term>tagging</term>) schemata are developed, with a typical back- and
                    forth-movement between textual context, frequency operations, and theoretical
                    conceptualization. In much the same way, the stages of <soCalled>close
                        reading</soCalled>, or qualitative analysis are applied in the development
                    of <term>machine learning algorithms</term> and <term>error analysis</term> in
                    computational linguistics <ptr target="#dipper2008" loc="86–87"/>. </p>
                <p>In order to ensure some standard of compatibility and transparency also for close
                    reading, stylisticians have established basic criteria for <soCalled>the
                        stylistic method</soCalled> (e.g., <ptr target="#simpson2004"/>), with
                        <emph>rigorous</emph> (<q>based on an explicit framework of analysis</q>),
                        <emph>retrievable</emph> (<q>organised through explicit terms and criteria,
                        the meanings of which are agreed upon by other students of stylistics</q>),
                    and <emph>replicable</emph> (<q>sufficiently transparent as to allow other
                        stylisticians to verify them, either by testing them on the same text or by
                        applying them beyond that text</q>
                    <ptr target="#simpson2004" loc="4"/>. Despite its vital role in humanistic
                    inquiry, close reading, as any approach, has its limitations. Mentioned are the
                    limited capacity in terms of data sets and time, the problems with
                    generalization, the prominent role of the scholar’s introspection, and the fact
                    that distinct features and factors are normally intermingled in complex gestalts
                    and thus may be hard to isolate. Such issues may be discussed and compensated
                    for in research that combines qualitative phases with quantitative ones.</p>
                <p>For quantitative analysis, <soCalled>style</soCalled> needs to be formalized and
                    reduced to one or few distinctive and machine-readable features (for a stylistic
                    perspective on style markers, see <ptr target="#leech2007"/>; for a stylometric
                    one, see <ptr target="#stamatatos2009"/>). This applies to a potentially open
                    list of linguistic and literary features (e.g., word frequency, length of
                    words/sentences, vocabulary density, but possibly also more
                        <soCalled>literary</soCalled> features, such as metaphor, or speech and
                    thought representation). Quantitative research applies a range of different
                    methods brought in from the fields of computational linguistics/natural language
                    processing (NLP) and corpus linguistics. Simple <soCalled>counting
                        operations</soCalled> (e.g., word frequencies, type-token-ratios, word and
                    sentence length) are often followed by statistics such as the chi-square test
                    and t-score, with prominent measures being collocation and keyword analysis <ptr target="#biber2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#gries2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#hoover2014"/>. Statistically more advanced are multivariate
                    methods that examine several variables at the same time (e.g., loglinear
                    regression mainly used in corpus stylistics, as well as ANOVA, principal
                    component analysis, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, and factor
                    analysis; (cf. <ptr target="#biber2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#diversy2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#gries2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#hoover2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>; see also <ptr target="#heyer2006"/>). One of the
                    currently most popular techniques of quantitative stylistics is cluster analysis
                    of stylistic similarity (e.g., using Burrows’s Delta; <ptr target="#burrows2002"/>). This kind of analysis operates on the basis of (standardized) measures of
                    the most common features within and across texts <ptr target="#eder2016"/>
                    <ptr target="#hoover2004"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>. A typical objective is to quantitatively
                    scrutinize a particular period for its style, disambiguating an <soCalled>author
                        effect</soCalled> from other (hidden) kinds of effects, such as
                        <soCalled>genre</soCalled>, and <soCalled>time.</soCalled> To this aim, a
                    viable way is to pick this style indicator and generalize over large sets of
                    literary data (see <ptr target="#eder2017"/>; also <ptr target="#jockers2013" loc="70–77"/>). In stylometry, using supervised machine learning to identify
                    the <soCalled>strength of the stylistic signal</soCalled> currently probably
                    comes closest to the core of the prototypical quantitative paradigm, ruling out
                    confounding factors and establishing clear cause-effect relationships (here, the
                    cause would be one or more of the examined factors author, genre, time; the
                    effect is the <soCalled>stylistic signal</soCalled> observed in most common
                        words).<note>See <ptr target="#underwood2017"/>, whose article on the
                        genealogy of distant reading was not yet available at the time of writing
                        and will thus not be discussed in depth. His key argument is that the basic
                        distinction of what he calls <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled> from other
                        forms of literary criticism is <q>the practice of framing historical inquiry
                            as an experiment, using hypotheses and samples (of texts or other social
                            evidence) that are defined before the writer settles on a
                            conclusion.</q> (5). He thus draws a basic distinction between
                        exploratory (<soCalled>other forms of literary criticism</soCalled>) and
                        explanatory (<soCalled>distant reading</soCalled>) inquiry. Although, as
                        explained above, I see a great value in mapping the distinction of
                            <soCalled>distant vs. other forms of reading</soCalled> onto the basic
                            <soCalled>quantitative vs. qualitative</soCalled> paradigms, I do not
                        fully agree with Underwood’s general characterization of “distant reading”
                        as an <soCalled>experimental</soCalled> hypothesis-testing endeavor. There
                        is, after all, a great number of <soCalled>distant
                        reading</soCalled>-studies that uses data aggregation methods and big data
                        sets to explore (emerging) patterns. Such studies, which are fully valid, as
                        I will show below, do not apply hypothesis-testing in the strict
                        sense.</note></p>
                <p>However, quantitative methods (such as factor analysis, multi–dimensional
                    scaling, principal component analysis, and so on) are in fact often used in a
                    more open-ended and exploratory way, something traditionally ascribed to
                    qualitative research. Quantitative stylistic exploration may find new features
                    and relations between known factors, for example between canonicity and writing
                    style. For example, Algee-Hewitt et al. compared what they call the
                        <soCalled>archive</soCalled>, that part of ever-published fiction that is
                    now available in digitized form, to canonical sets of novels. Among their
                    findings is that <soCalled>archive texts</soCalled> in comparison with canonical
                    ones are stylistically more similar to a written mode of communication, even in
                    their <soCalled>spoken passages</soCalled>
                    <ptr target="#algeehewitt2016" loc="2, 10"/>. This finding was not made in
                    answer to a specific hypothesis, but is a valid one. Similarly, the growing
                    number of NLP-adaptations to the literary domain (including neural networks,
                    machine learning, and advanced modes of data mining, cf. <ptr target="#hoover2013"/>; see also the proceedings of the workshops
                    Computational Linguistics for Literature<note> Retrievable under <ref target="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W15/#0700">http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W15/#0700</ref></note>) is typically
                    used for exploration – hypothesis testing in the strict sense is (still) less
                    common. NLP methods, as well as those of data science<note> Scholars like
                        Manovich (2015) and Anderson (2008) take a relatively extreme stance,
                        proclaiming that with the large available repositories of data, the nature
                        of numerically transformable data is fundamentally changing: instead of
                            <soCalled>long data</soCalled>, which is (traditionally) organized in
                        few variables with many pertaining cases, the new type is <soCalled>wide
                            data</soCalled>, clustered in many variables with a huge amount of
                        individual cases <ptr target="#manovich2015"/>. In <soCalled>data
                            mining</soCalled>, data exploration techniques incl. dimension reduction
                        are most important for predictive analysis and machine learning based on
                        probabilities of correlations. While correlative/association analyses have
                        long been established in computational and corpus linguistics (as in social
                        sciences), <soCalled>big data science</soCalled> appears in a new quality.
                        In its most prominent formulation it forsakes the quest for causality (and
                            <soCalled>theory</soCalled>) altogether <ptr target="#anderson2008"/>.
                        Seen from the perspective of mixed-methods, however, there is no reason for
                        why one should not include stages of zooming in on causal
                        relationships.</note> that crunch <soCalled>big data</soCalled> to
                    aggregated variables (e.g., <ptr target="#manovich2015"/>), are able to observe
                    new patterns and correlations, allowing for a multitude of possible factors to
                    be examined.</p>
                <p>However, regardless of being used exploratorily or explanatorily, with regard to
                    the questions of literary stylistics, at the present point in time, the
                    quantitative types of analysis often appear superficial. Features are
                    necessarily restricted to those than can be reduced to a machine-readable format
                    and used in automatic analysis. Quantitative stylistics, despite a tendency to
                    adapt more complex models, is as a rule decontextualized, operates at the
                    variable level, and is reduced to observing particular types of features. Under
                    certain conditions, precisely these characteristics may foster progress.
                    However, in order to attain a more complete degree of linguistic and literary
                    insight for <soCalled>style</soCalled>, quantitative examinations need to be
                    complemented by qualitative ones.</p>
                <p>To flesh out these thoughts, in the following I will report on my own
                    mixed-methods study on Franz Kafka’s prose in Newer and Modern German Literature
                    (corpus of about 5.9 million words). </p>

                <head>Making the test bed</head>
                <p>From the reservoir of digital methods on the qualitative–quantitative scale, I
                    selected three easy-to-access, yet established ones. With style operationalized
                    as an ensemble of formal features (see above), I reconstructed a hypothesis
                    about Kafka’s style from literary studies, which was then examined in a
                    complementary successive analysis:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item><emph>Hypothesis Generation from Literary Criticism.</emph> I distilled
                        from literary criticism converging evidence for a relatively broad
                        assumption about Kafka’s style, the
                        <soCalled>solitariness</soCalled>-hypothesis (see below). Finding convincing
                        observations and arguments from the existing literature is thus a necessary
                        step in hypothesis generation. This view has been put forward on the basis
                        of qualitative, hermeneutic interpretations of separate texts (involving the
                        description of linguistic features and literary effects). The kind of
                        evidence given so far offers no firm ground for generalization.</item>
                    <item><emph>Quantitative Hypothesis Testing.</emph> My first empirical step was
                        quantitative hypothesis testing. Extending on prior research <ptr target="#herrmann2013a"/>, I examined the
                            <soCalled>solitariness</soCalled>-hypothesis on a wider data basis
                        (comparing Kafka’s texts to texts by more than 20 other German authors
                        across time).<note> As will be seen below, this is a somewhat loose
                            understanding of hypothesis testing. Explanatory hypothesis testing in
                            the strict quantitative sense would have selected a combination of
                            hypothesis and method that leaves much less room for confounding
                            variables. The particular analysis is thus a typical example for the
                            current state of the field, pending more rigorous and wide-spread
                            applications of hypothesis testing.</note> For the sake of quantitative
                        breadth, I relinquished the rich complexity of case-driven analysis, using
                        as an indicator of <soCalled>style</soCalled> a standardized aggregate
                        measure of most frequent words, <term>Delta</term> (see below) and cluster
                        analysis. A problem with this type of analysis is that it does not provide
                        insights into the particular features that may be responsible for Kafka’s
                        (assumedly) distinctive style.</item>
                    <item><emph>Quantitative Exploration.</emph> The second analysis applied another
                        frequency-based measure, <term>keyness</term>, to explore the stylistic
                        patterns possibly underlying the results from the cluster analysis. Keeping
                        the time signal relatively constant, I compared Kafka’s word use to four
                        authors belonging to the same literary epoch, Modernism. Style was here
                        identified as a statistically defined <soCalled>norm</soCalled> (the
                        numerical reference being the same corpus used in the first analysis),
                        treating word forms that are significantly more frequent than that norm as
                            <soCalled>stylistically marked</soCalled>. Building on prior research
                            <ptr target="#herrmann2013b"/>, I manually grouped the top 100
                        overrepresented word forms into (potential) word classes. A category of word
                        forms emerged as particular to the Kafka sample that may be used for subtly
                        managing modality. However, even though this analysis tackles style at the
                        feature level, it is still strongly decontextualized. More context was
                        needed to add value and insight to my observations. </item>
                    <item><emph>Qualitative Text Analysis.</emph> In a qualitative close reading of
                        one of Kafka’s stories (<title rend="italic">The Judgment)</title> taken
                        from the same corpus as before, I focused on just two potential modal
                        particles derived from the previous step. Using <term>KWIC</term> (<title rend="italic">Key Word in Context</title>) to systematically analyze
                        their local usage, taking into account the context of Kafka’s story
                        (including the plot), I examined their use and potential functions
                        throughout the unfolding story <ptr target="#herrmann2016"/>. From here,
                        further analysis may take up several possible leads given by the results.
                        These may involve a larger data set and increased statistical rigor – as
                        well as the qualitative detail of other texts and features (modal particles,
                        negations, and adverbs).</item>

                    <p>In Kafka studies, the most basic tenet on Kafka’s style is that it is not
                        only unique, but even <soCalled>solitary</soCalled>: Scholars converge in
                        finding that among his generation, nobody else writes like him (cf. e.g.,
                            <ptr target="#dhaen2012"/>
                        <ptr target="#frenzel1990"/>

                        <ptr target="#trost2008"/>). The proposed solitariness has been related to a
                        special lexical precision and <soCalled>scantiness</soCalled>, features of
                            <soCalled>elevated everyday language</soCalled> and technical language,
                        together with an accumulation of modal adverbs, a hypotactic sentence
                        structure, and a frequent use of inner monologue and especially free
                        indirect discourse. The narrative effect of his language use has been stated
                        as the <soCalled>objective</soCalled> registration of <emph>external</emph>
                        events, accompanied by a simultaneous limited <emph>internal</emph>
                        perspective of literary characters (e.g., <ptr target="#engel2010"/>
                        <ptr target="#oschmann2010"/>
                        <ptr target="#scheffel2002"/>
                        <ptr target="#trost2008"/>). The adjective <term>kafkaesque</term> generally
                        means <q>complicated, confusing, and threatening</q>
                        <ptr target="#kafkaesque"/>, and this label corresponds with a consensus on
                        the irritation that Kafka’s prose instills in readers, be they naïve or
                        professional: <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#adorno1981">Each sentence says 'interpret me', and none will

                        </cit>.<note> It is an open (empirical) question how much of this effect of
                            Kafka’s prose may in fact be attributed to his ‘style’, and in how much
                            it is a matter of <soCalled>plot</soCalled>. Since both dimensions tend
                            to feed into each other, further research is needed to creatively
                            establish ways of description and measurement.</note></p>

                    <head>Study 1: Quantitative Hypothesis Testing</head>
                    <p>For my first study, I selected an indicator of style that is firmly
                        established within stylometry: the most frequent words (mfw) of a text and
                        text set. The (relative) frequencies of the most common words per text in a
                        given text set are used to compute a distance measure, which determines the
                        stylistic similarity/dissimilarity of each text from each other text. I used
                        a version of Burrows’s Delta (<ptr target="#burrows2002"/>
                        <ptr target="#eder2016"/>
                        <ptr target="#hoover2004"/>), which standardizes the mean word frequency (by
                        calculating the <emph>z</emph>-score) for each text and then computes the <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#burrows2002">mean of the absolute differences between the
                                    <emph>z</emph>-scores for a set of word-variables in a given
                                text-group and the <emph>z</emph>-scores for the same set of
                                word-variables in a target text</quote>
                            <ptr target="#burrows2002" loc="271"/>
                        </cit>.<note>
                            <emph>Z</emph>-scores represent the distance between the individual raw
                            frequencies and an observed group mean, in units of the standard
                            deviation. </note> In a subsequent cluster-analysis, which employed the
                        ward-linkage algorithm <ptr target="#eder2016"/>, the large matrix of
                        distances scores between individual texts was reduced to hierarchically
                        aligned groupings of texts that are visualized, the so-called clusters. I
                        chose a distance measure with cluster analysis because it is a robust
                        measure of text similarity and has been shown to reliably identify signals
                        of author, genre, and time <ptr target="#eder2016"/>
                        <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>, also in German literary texts <ptr target="#jannidis2014"/>.<note> Stylometric measures, first developed
                            for authorship attribution, and lately adopted by DH for mostly literary
                            history studies, have in fact been used widely for exploratory purposes
                                <ptr target="#jannidis2014"/>. This shows that a
                            quantitative-explanatory mapping is too facile; the way in which a
                            measure is applied essentially depends on the research
                        question.</note></p>
                    <p>My hypotheses were as follows: </p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>H1: Kafka’s texts are <emph>more similar to each other</emph> than
                            they are to other texts, and, as a group, are by comparison more
                                <emph>dissimilar from other (groups of) texts</emph>. For the
                            cluster analysis, this means two things: (a) a similarity-cluster can be
                            observed for Kafka’s texts; (b) the observed Kafka-cluster shows
                            distances from other (potential) clusters that are greater than any
                            other distances observed.</item>
                        <item>H0: Kafka’s texts <emph>do not show a greater similarity to each
                                other</emph> than to any other text. In the cluster analysis,
                            Kafka’s texts do not cluster with each other. However, as authorship is
                            a strong predictor of style, clustering by author is generally
                                expected.<note> None of the texts used in the analysis are of
                                disputed authorship, and the genre signal was kept relatively
                                constant, with all texts labeled as ‘prose’. The genre signal is a
                                major confounding factor in authorship attribution <ptr target="#rudman2016" loc="318"/>.</note> Therefore, H0 may be
                            reformulated: Kafka’s texts as a potential group of texts related by
                            similarity <emph>do not show greater dissimilarity</emph> to other
                            groups of texts by comparison. In the cluster analysis, any
                            Kafka-cluster of texts thus has a similar distance to other potentially
                            observed author-clusters as these have from each other.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>When considering these hypotheses before the background of the chosen method,
                        a caveat is due: in this application, cluster analysis does <emph>not allow
                            statistical hypothesis testing in a strict sense.</emph> In other words,
                        there is no way of determining the probability of falsely rejecting the H0
                        (type I error, <emph>p</emph>-value) or the probability of rejecting a true
                        hypothesis as incorrect (type II error, the failure to reject a false null
                        hypothesis, a <soCalled>false negative</soCalled>, i.e., failing to detect
                        an effect that is present). This means I cannot determine causal or even
                        correlational relations between variables (authorship as influencing style
                        as measured by mfw).</p>

                            Walser were extracted from Gutenberg.org. Those texts, as well as ones

                        the lower one to 800 mfw.<note> The lower margin was set to 800 mfw in
                            accordance with Jannidis &amp; Lauer, who however set the upper limit to
                            3,000 mfw <ptr target="#jannidis2014"/>. I set the upper limit to 1,500
                            mfw, thus capturing the range of values where Eder’s Delta’s appears to
                            perform best (between 1,000 and 1,500 mfw; cf. <ptr target="#jannidis2015"/>). However, Evert et al. (2015), who
                            replicated Jannidis et al. (2015) with more feature samples, state that
                            the number of features (mfw) remains <cit>

                            </cit>. The results thus need to be further tested.</note> Figure 2
                        shows that Kafka’s texts indeed form a cluster (the light green cluster to
                        the upper right). It also depicts a number of branches that join texts by
                        distinct authors (thereby demonstrating style similarity), most pronouncedly
                        the two main branches in the lower half (both with subbranches of more than
                        seven authors), as well as two smaller branches each joining two authors
                        (Keller/Goethe and May/Achleitner). Most of Kafka’s direct contemporaries
                        are thus joined by the big branch at the lower left (Bonsels, Wassermann,
                        Falke, Hesse, Mann, Schnitzler), while the branch at the lower right suggest
                        similarities between older texts (Goethe, Brentano, Arnim, Hoffmann) and the
                        Swiss (historical) realist Meyer. </p>
                    <p>In opposition to authors in both these groups, Kafka’s cluster starts
                        directly from the center, which means that Kafka’s texts are more similar to
                        each other than to other authors’ texts. However, the same is true for
                        Gerstäcker, Heiberg, Sapper, Fontane, and Spyri. Note that the consensus
                        tree is not informative about the distance of any two branches starting from
                        the root. Hence, the first cluster analysis does not falsify the assumption
                        that Kafka writes in a solitary way. However, despite being a relatively
                        robust measure of stylistic similarity (incorporating repeated runs), the
                        consensus tree provides rather limited information.</p>

                    <p> Figures 3 and 4 are more informative with regard to the actual similarities
                        between texts than Figure 2. These <term>dendrograms</term> (two of the
                        eight separate dendrograms underlying the consensus tree of Fig. 2) are
                            <soCalled>snapshots</soCalled> that reflect the particular clustering of
                        texts with feature-parameter set uniquely to 1,100 mfw and to 1,300 mfw,
                        respectively. Both depict a situation in which Kafka’s texts indeed form a
                        cluster, which means that they are more similar to each other than to any
                        other text in the study. Also, Kafka’s texts (as a group) are at a
                        relatively long distance from the nearest neighbors, Spyri, Fontane, Sapper,
                        and Gerstäcker (Fig. 3), and Spyri, Fontane, and Sapper (Fig. 4).
                        Additionally, forming a group with the four/three nearest neighbors, Kafka
                        is removed from the rest of the corpus. </p>
                    <p>Like Fig. 2, despite slight differences, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 do not falsify the
                        assumption that Kafka writes in a solitary manner. However, we need to take
                        into account the company in this <soCalled>outlier group</soCalled>, two
                        children’s books authors (Johanna Spyri, author of <title rend="italic">Heidi</title>, and Agnes Sapper) as well as Germany’s chief proponent
                        of poetic realism (Theodor Fontane), and an author of popular adventure and
                        travel prose (Friedrich Gerstäcker). In opposition to Kafka, the other four
                        were immensely popular during their own and Kafka’s lifetime. Without making
                        too strong assumptions on the basis of the two particular dendrograms<note>
                            Stylometric methods such as cluster analysis applied to literary data
                            typically involve a series of tests with different parameter settings,
                            including varying the distance measure, the number of mfw, the linkage
                            algorithm, and others (cf. <ptr target="#eder2017"/>
                            <ptr target="#evert2015"/>
                            <ptr target="#jannidis2014"/>, for German literature). It has been
                            pointed out that this kind of scenario is prone to <soCalled>cherry
                                picking</soCalled>, i.e. omitting results that do not fit the
                            expected/desired outcome <ptr target="#rudman2003"/>. The overall
                            results, specifically the bootstrap consensus tree, however, give some
                            reason to assume that Kafka is indeed an author with a distinct – if not
                            solitary – style. Yet, the single dendrograms vary with regard to Kaka’s
                            nearest neighbors. Therefore, all obtained results need to be further
                            evaluated, and possibly sided by experiments with other parameter
                            settings.</note>, these results may be used as a heuristic for
                        furthering the stylistic research into Kafka’s prose: It is common ground in
                        literary studies that Kafka achieved the commonly attested <soCalled>refusal
                            of making sense</soCalled> (<q>Sinnverweigerung</q>),<soCalled>with the
                            techniques of the European tradition of narration</soCalled> (<q>mit den
                            Mitteln der europäischen Erzähltradition</q>). In Fig. 3 and 4 this tradition appears to show itself in
                        the form of the nearest neighbors, all of which allegedly use a
                            <soCalled>realistic</soCalled> writing style (with a great amount of
                        concrete detail and vividly rendered descriptions, as well as dialogue).
                        Further study needs to establish whether there really is a stylistic
                        similarity with these authors (and among them), and, if so, what features
                        contribute. What is more, Kafka research has shown that he liked reading
                        books for younger readers, as well as (popular) adventure literature and
                        journey descriptions in general (e.g., <ptr target="#blank2001"/>). There is
                        hence some reason to assume that the nearest neighbors may reflect some of
                        Kafka’s own reading habits <ptr target="#herrmannlauer2016"/>. This kind of
                        speculation merits further pursuing.</p>
                    <p>This is where the analysis of this particular quantitative measure stops,
                        letting the aggregated data speak for itself. However, in the present
                        context, it is not really much it can say, despite a relatively weak
                        corroboration of the reported hypothesis, which originates from rich
                        hermeneutic observations. One problem with the measure is here that we do
                        not know which particular textual features are responsible for the
                        dissimilarity (or similarity) of styles: it computes the relative stylistic
                        differences between a whole range of texts, based on a ‘bag-of-words’
                        approach that has to take <term>a priori</term> decisions about the number
                        of mfw, the linkage algorithms, and other parameters. This combination of
                            <soCalled>black box</soCalled> and <soCalled>cherry picking</soCalled>
                        problems (for a critical overview, see <ptr target="#eder2017"/>) is rather
                        frustrating, especially to the philologist, who would like to pin down the
                        specific textual features that make Kafka unique (for quantitative
                        approaches to features, see for example <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>
                        <ptr target="#klaussner2015"/>). The next step is applying a so-called
                            <term>keyness</term> analysis, which allows for an exploration of the
                        features responsible for stylistic differences between distinct texts and
                        text collections.</p>

                    <p>To pry open the black box of the Delta measure to examine the features that
                        actually make a difference in an author’s style, I selected keyness analysis
                            <ptr target="#herrmann2013b"/>. This established measure of corpus
                        stylistics compares the frequencies of single words (or part-of-speech tags,
                        or semantic tags) included in some text (collection) with those obtained in
                        a (normally larger) reference corpus. It outputs a long list of words that
                        deviate statistically from that reference corpus <ptr target="#rayson2012"/>
                        <ptr target="#scott2006"/>. Here, the reference corpus acts as a statistical
                            <soCalled>norm</soCalled> against which the word use in the text(s)
                        under scrutiny may be compared. The examined words, depending on whether
                        they deviate positively or negatively, are thus <soCalled>over-</soCalled>
                        or <soCalled>under-represented</soCalled> with regard to that norm. Keyness
                        analysis traditionally applies a Log-likelihood (LL) measure of difference
                        in word usage (which is here more reliable than chi-squared analysis, cf.
                            <ptr target="#rayson2012" loc="2"/>). </p>
                    <p>In order to ensure internal validity across sub-studies, I used the same
                        corpus as in the cluster analysis. The same Kafka samples included in the
                        first study thus formed a <soCalled>Kafka corpus</soCalled>, and the
                        remaining 67 texts samples now worked as a reference corpus. In addition to
                        the Kafka corpus, I compiled four new author corpora, extracted from
                        TextGrid: Peter Altenberg, Gustav Meyrink, Arthur Schnitzler, and Georg
                        Trakl (see Table 1 for a summary of the author and reference corpora). In
                        order to control as many factors as possible, the time signal was kept
                        relatively constant: authors were selected from the literary epoch Modernism
                        (roughly 1880-1930). Also, all authors are male, and ideolect was
                        controlled: the four authors share with Kafka a place at a
                            <soCalled>southern German language continuum</soCalled>
                        <ptr target="#becher2012"/>
                        <ptr target="#nekula2003"/>. However, given the particularities of Kafka’s
                        (many very short texts and his particular technique of rendering narrative
                        perspective), I deliberately did not control genre, and included drama
                        (Schnitzler’s dramatic work, with its high proportion of fictional
                        dialogue), poetry (Trakl’s poems with their highly subjective and sensual
                        perspective), and (short) experimental prose (Altenberg’s
                            <soCalled>narrative poems</soCalled> with a
                            <soCalled>disengaged</soCalled> perspective, impressionistic description
                        of sensual perception, and usage of colloquialisms). Through this, I hoped
                        to allow for emerging stylistic patterns particular to Kafka.</p>

                    <p>The distribution of word classes among the top 100 keywords in each
                        author-corpus rendered a number of interesting findings (see also <ptr target="#herrmann2013b"/>). For the current purpose, however, the most
                        interesting one is this: Among the words most strongly overrepresented in
                        Kafka’s prose, a variety falls into a category of potential <soCalled>modal
                            words</soCalled>, which I operationally defined as word forms that (a)
                        possess few semantic features when decontextualized; and (b) are typically
                        used as adverbs, negations, and modal particles (but may have functions as
                        conjunctions or other types of particles). For reasons of focus, I excluded
                        (modal) verbs from the analysis. The observed types (e.g., <foreign xml:lang="de">aber, nicht, allerdings, vielleicht, schon, ja,
                            auch</foreign>) are semantically very flexible, potentially exerting
                        distinct functions across different co(n)texts, e.g., to manage
                        doubt/certainty, limit/broaden scope of assertions, and for
                        negative/positive evaluation. </p>

                    <p>Figure 5 shows the number of <soCalled>modal words</soCalled> identified in
                        the keyness analysis for each of the five authors: The distinct types show
                        up among the 100 statistically overrepresented word-forms (e.g., the types
                            <foreign xml:lang="de">ja, doch, schon</foreign> amounting to three
                        counts). Fig. 5 reports that Kafka’s usage of this category is more
                        substantial (N=27) than Altenberg’s (N=13)<note> Altenberg was newly
                            introduced for the present analysis. Because of his colloquial style, I
                            extrapolated that he might use adverbs, negations, and modal particles
                            in a similar way as Kafka. However, the result is very similar to that
                            of Schnitzler, and the number of types among the top 100 keywords is
                            only half of Kafka’s.</note>, Schnitzler’s (N=12), Meyrink’s (N=7), and
                        Trakl’s (N=1). Given the reference corpus, Kafka’s prose is hence marked by
                        a more varied use of <soCalled>modal words</soCalled>.<note> The present
                            analysis has good external validity, as shown by prior analysis <ptr target="#herrmann2013b"/> based on a much larger and more varied
                            reference corpus (~ 93,000 texts, ~ 600 authors, ~ 134 million words,
                            diverse genres). Comparison shows very similar results for Kafka (N=24
                            (big reference corpus) vs. N=27 (present corpus)) and Schnitzler (N=10
                            (big reference corpus) vs. N=12 (present corpus)), and numerically
                            identical ones for Meyrink (N=7) and Trakl (N=1). Since the larger
                            corpus is closer to an assumed <soCalled>true population</soCalled> of
                            newer German literature, there is good reason to assume that the
                            findings obtained can be generalized by taking as a stylistic
                                <soCalled>norm</soCalled> a larger population (of texts, genres, and
                            authors across time). </note> Specifically in their use as modal
                        particles, words like <foreign xml:lang="de">ja, schon, doch,</foreign> and
                            <foreign xml:lang="de">nur</foreign> may exert very subtle, but
                        important, pragmatic functions of negotiating shared knowledge and beliefs.
                        Note that they belong among the most frequent words of the German language
                        generally, but are still overrepresented in Kafka’s prose – at least when
                        compared with our reference corpus of literary texts. They may thus be a key
                        to explaining (aspects of) Kafka’s subtly disconcerting style. However, more
                        analysis is needed to further test this assumption.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, the application of keyness analysis to Kafka and other Modernist
                        authors has pointed to a quantitative style pattern in Kafka’s prose, a high
                        frequency of lemmas that may perform <soCalled>modal</soCalled> functions in
                        the discourse. While it is clear that more research is required – for
                        example varying reference corpora with principled attention to the variable
                            <soCalled>genre</soCalled> (the used corpora contain narrative texts as
                        well as poems and dramatic texts), and using more author-corpora – the
                        analysis has shown that an exploration of quantitative patterns in terms of
                        single words is quite useful. Indeed, it provides a first take at answering
                        the question of what underlies the clustering observed in the
                            <term>Quantitative Hypothesis Testing</term>. It could not falsify the
                        philological finding that Kafka’s style is defined by a particular use of
                            <soCalled>modal adverbs</soCalled> (e.g., <ptr target="#trost2008"/>).
                        However, the identified category of lemmas needs disambiguation as to their
                        grammatical categories and local functions in textual passages. We thus need
                        more context.</p>

                    <p>The third step of my project breaks down the complexity of the broad list of
                            <soCalled>modal</soCalled>-type words run up by the keyword list, by
                        zooming in on just two lemmas, namely, <foreign xml:lang="de">ja</foreign>
                        and <foreign xml:lang="de">doch</foreign>
                        <ptr target="#herrmann2016"/>. As modal particles, both have been well
                        described in the linguistic literature and belong to the most frequent
                        German modal particles <ptr target="#hentschel1986"/>. Generally, modal
                        particles cater to intentionally attaching an utterance to the
                        conversational frame, structure the common knowledge base of the
                        interlocutors by indicating common ground, give prompts as to the felicitous
                        interpretation of utterances in the given context, indicate subjective
                        stance of speakers, and establish anaphoric reference with prior
                        discourse.</p>

                        was a digital type of close reading of the text. – I used a digital KWIC
                            (<term>Keyword in Context) </term>tool for a starting point.<note> There
                            are many KWIC tools available online, e.g. in Voyant, AntConc, as well
                            as functions in R and Python.</note> Figure 6 shows that of the N=18
                        instances of <foreign xml:lang="de">ja</foreign>, n=12 may be identified as
                        modal particles; and a similar picture can be observed for <foreign xml:lang="de">doch</foreign>, where of N=19 retrieved instances, n=9 are
                        clear modal particles. This frequency roughly equals the proportion of each
                        word found in natural <foreign xml:lang="de">spoken</foreign> discourse in
                        German <ptr target="#hentschel1986"/>. </p>
                    <p>The combined linguistic/narratological examination of the usage of <foreign xml:lang="de">ja</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="de">doch</foreign>
                        throughout the story revealed that the two lemmas mostly do not accord with
                        the causality structure of the narrated world (for details, see <ptr target="#herrmann2016"/>: The two characters, a father and his son, do
                        not communicate on the basis of a reliable common ground. Instead, there are
                        constant shifts in basic beliefs, and thus, in part due to the use of modal
                        particles (or accompanied by them as symptoms of underlying communicative
                        shortcomings) the management of information fails epically, resulting in the
                        death of the son. In particular, <foreign xml:lang="de">ja</foreign> is
                        normally used to signal that interlocutor A assumes that interlocutor B
                        maintains a shared knowledge/belief at the present point in time; <foreign xml:lang="de">doch</foreign> is normally used to signal that
                        interlocutor A assumes that interlocutor B is presently not aware of an
                        allegedly shared knowledge/belief. However, in <title rend="italic">The
                            Judgment</title>, the characters often use them in an infelicitous way,
                        not respecting conventional pragmatic principles. The fact that in terms of
                        frequency, the modal particles in Kafka’s fictional narrative roughly equal
                        the natural distribution in spoken language may explain the overuse
                        identified in the keyness analysis, especially when assuming that modal
                        particles are overall not as frequent in fictional writing. Speculatively,
                        one may adopt the idea that the use of <foreign xml:lang="de">ja</foreign>
                        and <foreign xml:lang="de">doch</foreign> in <title rend="italic">The
                            Judgment</title> is typical for Kafka’s use of modal particles in
                        general, especially taking into account that modal particles are indicators
                        of free indirect discourse, which is one of the properties frequently
                        assigned to Kafka’s prose. </p>
                    <p>Yet, more (quantitative and qualitative) analysis is needed to further flesh
                        out and test these hypotheses. For now, it may be stated that the use of two
                        specific modal particles indeed seems to contribute to the <q>elevated
                            everyday language</q> described as typical of Kafka’s style (in <title rend="italic">Metamorphosis</title>, cf. <ptr target="#trost2008"/>).
                        The examination of two modal particles in one particular text used the local
                        lexical/syntactical context as well as that of the story world with its
                        complex social-communicative relations. Since modal particles are heavily
                        dependent on contextual analysis, both levels are essential when striving to
                        make well-informed statements about their function in Kafka’s style. </p>
                    <p>To sum up, this article has presented new findings on Kafka’s prose (compared
                        to other authors writing in German) gathered in complementary successive
                        analysis. It tested philological findings by means of a method of data
                        aggregation operating on a comparably large data set, explored author’s
                        style by looking at the probabilities of word frequencies, and eventually
                        zoomed into the possible functions of two modal particles within the text
                        world of one story. To ensure compatibility, my study kept the reference
                        corpus constant, and varied the style measure only subtly (both quantitative
                        analyses work with raw quantities of inflected word forms, and two of these
                        word forms were queried through KWIC in the particular story <title rend="italic">The Judgment</title>). </p>
                    <p>Yet, my main objective was to raise awareness of the methodological issues of
                        doing digital stylistics. The different steps varied in the way in which
                        they approached Kafka’s style – quantitatively and qualitatively,
                        explanatory and exploratory, deductively and inductively, and also in the
                        degree of speculation and interpretative freedom licensed. With regard to
                        quantitative analysis, I have highlighted that hypothesis testing in the
                        strict sense of the term is still a desideratum in my work. The same holds
                        for analysis of statistical correlations and interactions on a broader data
                        basis. My future research will take care of this: We are currently building
                        a <soCalled>Corpus of Literary Modernism</soCalled> (KOLIMO, see footnote
                        above) for examining the possible relations between factors such as author,
                        genre, time of publication etc. and style variables such as part of speech,
                        lexical density, and readability, but also more traditionally literary
                        features such as metaphor <ptr target="#herrmann2018"/>.</p>

                <head>Conclusions </head>
                <p>Above, I first proposed that the interdisciplinary setup of DH stylistics has
                    advantages and disadvantages, depending on how we handle the issue, and that in
                    fact, DH style studies may be a natural environment for the mixed-methods
                    paradigm. To contextualize this, I have reported on my own research, assuming
                    that in terms of its general character, it may be quite representative of
                    digital text analysis, even though the range of methods and questions found in
                    DH stylistics is naturally much wider. For reasons of focus, further crucial
                    dimensions of doing DH stylistics that relate to research design have not been
                    mentioned, such as programming, sample selection, edition and publication. </p>
                <p>I pointed out that in some moments, in line with a ‘quantitative paradigm’, we
                    may strive for open questions to be settled, and possibilities for
                    interpretation of results to be delimited in order to achieve significant and
                    replicable results. At other points of the research process, we may tap into the
                        <soCalled>qualitative paradigm</soCalled>, in line with our hermeneutic
                    tradition, allowing higher degrees of (aesthetic) subjectivity, generating
                    ideas, and opening discussion of alleged securities. Pointing towards a
                        <soCalled>mixed-methods paradigm</soCalled>, I would now like to conclude by
                    considering Moretti’s take on distant reading: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#moretti2000">If we want to understand the system in its entirety, we
                            must accept losing something. We always pay a price for theoretical
                            knowledge: reality is infinitely rich; concepts are abstract, are poor.
                            But it’s precisely this ‘poverty’ that makes it possible to handle them,
                            and therefore to know. This is why less is actually more.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#moretti2000" loc="578–8"/>
                    </cit> My point in this paper has been to embrace distant reading's
                    variable-driven principle, but to complement it by a paradigm that is
                    case-driven, looks at smaller samples, and may indulge in open-ended
                    interpretation about connections between different variables. Both general
                    approaches have their merit, and tapping into the methodological flexibility
                    offered by a mixed-methods paradigm will allow for the interaction of different
                    mindsets in a structured way. </p>
                <p> By mutual methods critique, we may more vigorously utilize the meaning potential
                    of crunched numbers, as well as sharpen hermeneutically obtained insight to a
                    new degree of precision. Here, the digital turn is possibly what really
                    accelerates the growth of a third culture in the sense of Snow <ptr target="#snow2012"/> – one that has explanatory as well as exploratory
                    moments, with <soCalled>thick</soCalled>’ understanding as well as the
                        <soCalled>poverty</soCalled> of aggregation mentioned by Moretti. A
                    mixed-method paradigm includes approaches for ‘opening up the discussion’ as
                    much as those that ‘settle it’. </p>

                <p>Many thanks to the editorial team, led by Joris van Zundert, for invoking and
                    guiding the volume, as well as for their feedback at multiple stages of the
                    publication process. Thanks also to the three anonymous reviewers who provided
                    me not only with detailed and constructive feedback, but who also were generous
                    in pointing out the things they valued. A big thank you to Andrea Hense, an ally
                    from the <title rend="italic">Sociological Research Institute</title> Göttingen
                    (SOFI) and to Steffen Kühnel of the <title rend="italic">Center of Methods in
                        Social Sciences</title> at Göttingen University, both of whom made time for
                    discussing my research. And finally, many thanks to Camilla di Biase-Dyson, who
                    proof-read an earlier version of the paper, and to Zsófia Demjen, for
                    proof-reading the final version. Any remaining errors are my own.</p>
