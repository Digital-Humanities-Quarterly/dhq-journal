        <body>
            <p>Recently, Digital Humanities have garnered much attention all over the world. Concrete
                results have been produced by the collaboration between humanistic studies and the
                interdisciplinary research of semantic technology and information science. Most of
                these studies rely on the deep excavation of cultural assets, and the complete
                reorganization and cross-border interlinking of information resources held by
                libraries, archives, museums (LAMs), digital centers, data repositories, and
                more.</p>
            <p>In this rapidly evolving field of cross-disciplinary studies, two imperatives have
                emerged that require further research and discussion: (1) How to construct Knowledge
                Organization Systems (KOS) following current Semantic Web standards and best
                practice guidelines? This involves combining various methods applicable to digital
                humanities, and conducting studies aiming to promote, utilize, and preserve cultural
                heritages along with the digital datasets based on and created for them; (2) How can
                we structure and express the data in the digital assets so they can be handled and
                understood by both ordinary users and machines? This question is raised because the
                creation, linking, enhancing, and reusing of a semantic-rich dataset depends on the
                usability, flexibility, and reliability of its knowledge organization structure and
                encoding schema.</p>
            <p>To explore in greater depth these two essential needs which have come to light in the
                field in recent years, the <title rend="italic">Academia Sinica Center for Digital
                    Cultures</title> organized the <title rend="quotes">Knowledge Organization and
                    Cultural Heritage: Perspectives of the Semantic Web</title> conference on June
                2, 2016 in Taipei <ptr target="#ascdc2017"/>. Speakers came from mainland China and
                Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait, as well as the United States. Topics included
                methods and theories of Linked Open Data (LOD), the modeling of ontologies and
                knowledge bases, the historical and structural review of knowledge organization and
                representation, practical approaches used in exploring cultural assets, and the
                efforts of standards development for preservation and management of digital data.
                All topics were presented from different perspectives and were extremely well
                received by the attendees. As a result, after the conference, speakers were
                encouraged to submit full papers to the peer-reviewed <title rend="italic">Journal
                    of Library and Information Science</title> (ISSN 0363-3640). These papers led to
                the publication of a whole special issue of the journal (vol. 43/no.1) in April 2017
                    <ptr target="#zeng2017"/>. Each full article (in Chinese) includes a long
                English abstract, and all are openly available on the Web from the journal’s website
                at <ref target="http://jlis.glis.ntnu.edu.tw/ojs/index.php/jlis/issue/view/89"

            <p>The nine papers presented in this special issue of the <title rend="italic">Journal
                    of Library and Information Science</title> put forward answers to the
                aforementioned challenges that LAMs and other cultural heritage organizations
                encounter. The reported solutions utilized semantic technologies in conjunction with
                knowledge organization methods in order to progress from digitization to
                datafication. Datafication is critical because it makes possible production of data
                that is not just machine-readable but truly machine-understandable, -processable,
                and -actionable. While these are challenging topics, they hold the most up-to-date
                concepts and breakthroughs of interest to humanities researchers, information
                scientists, and Sematic Web developers, in addition to practical answers for the
                pressing needs of LAMs, digital centers, and repositories. The papers are presented
                in four broad areas:</p>
            <list type="ordered">
                <item>To address the problem of reusability of structured data, the paper titled
                        <title rend="quotes">Reuse of Structured Data: Semantics, Linkage, and

                    at Academia Sinica, Taiwan (Huang, Lee, and Chuang) presents in detail the five
                    cross-domain knowledge bases and seven special domain knowledge bases
                    currently using LOD approaches. The paper further reports the results of data
                    quality analysis and the relations between metadata and data provenance,
                    providing a lightweight ontology voc4odw for describing data reuse and
                    provenance. The website data.odw.tw stores and converts the collection of
                    metadata into semantically-structured linked data, reflecting the steps taken
                    from original cataloging data to semantic linked data segmentation.</item>

                    organization systems) keep up with the 21st century Web, especially embracing
                    the wave of new ontology development? Three papers in this special issue
                    reported national-level efforts on the development of classification, thesauri,
                    and metadata standards demonstrating how this can be done.<lb/>

                <item>All the latest developments in the digital age and knowledge organization
                    require a theoretical perspective to aid in understanding. Thus, the last paper

                    paper age, a single informational item is like an isolated island in terms of
                    knowledge organization, whereas in the Internet age there is a drastic change.
                    Traditional methods of identification and searching are replaced by linked and
                    multi-oriented methods which allow clues and knowledge to be reconstructed,
                    organized, and interpreted to generate new knowledge. In this Internet age,
                    knowledge organization contributes to how humans comprehend knowledge. The paper
                    further proposes a kind of education for future knowledge organization

            <p>In conclusion, this journal issue gathers the latest research developments of Taiwan
                and Mainland China across the Taiwan Strait, exploring multiple aspects via
                collective efforts, studies, and examples. The conference and this special issue
                intend to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and discussion between knowledge
                organization professionals and Semantic Web developers, as well as to contribute to
                the growing body of digital humanities research by sharing experiences and promoting
                interdisciplinary communication. The current role and function of knowledge
                organization is revisited, and implementation requirements articulated. As
                demonstrated by the contributors of this conference and special journal issue, for
                those researchers in need of historical data, the information resources provided by
                LAMs and digital centers have extraordinary value. Knowledge organization theories,
                models, systems, and practical approaches are fundamentals to: enabling the deep
                excavation of cultural assets, transforming semi-structured and unstructured data
                into structured and machine-processable data, contextualizing and linking of
                existing structured data across data silos, and enabling one-to-many usages of LAM
                data in supporting digital humanities.</p>
            <p>This collection of papers from many experts came from different perspectives, but the
                central idea embodied is clear: from the Semantic Web perspective, knowledge
                organization systems and knowledge organization methods are in the midst of a
                paradigm shift. Opportunities brought by semantic technologies are driving us to
                redefine the definition of knowledge organization, encouraging us to re-examine the
                changes, potentials, and breakthroughs in information science.</p>
