                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>This article presents a new model for emotion mining, resulting from the research
                    project <soCalled>Embodied Emotions</soCalled>. This project aims: 1. to trace
                    historical changes in emotion expression and in the embodiment of emotions, and
                    2. to develop methods to trace these changes in sizeable corpuses of digitized
                    texts. Up to now, the mining of sentiments or emotions has mainly been
                    restricted to modern, or even very recent text corpora, such as social media.
                    Sentiment mining techniques are often based on relatively simple emotion models
                    of binary (positive/negative) oppositions, or limited sets of ‘basic’ emotions
                    and are not yet able to deal adequately with the complexity and the historical
                    contingency of emotions and their expression. To meet these challenges, we have
                    developed the Historic Embodied Emotion Model (HEEM), built on a test case of 29
                    Dutch language theatre plays written between 1600 and 1800 and annotated
                    manually with HEEM labels for emotions and body terms. In this article, we
                    present this model and compare it with other sentiment mining techniques: 1) off
                    the shelf linguistic analysis software LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count),
                    2) a version of LIWC that has been adapted for the analysis of Dutch historical
                    texts, 3) a new Dutch translation of WordNetAffect. We conclude that, although
                    different forms of sentiment mining have their value and use, HEEM provides new
                    opportunities for emotion mining and analysis of embodied emotions in historical
                    texts.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction: combining the affective and digital turns</head>
                <p>Over the last decade, sentiment and opinion mining have become important fields
                    of research, both within academia and for companies and organizations that have
                    started to utilize this information for reputation management and marketing
                    purposes. Many techniques and resources, e.g. Sentiwordnet <ptr target="#baccianella2010"/>, Harvard General Inquirer Database <ptr target="#stone1996"/>, Liu’s Opinion Lexicon <ptr target="#liu2015"/>, focus
                    on single word mining of overall sentiment (thumbs up/down) or coarse-grained
                    opinions in contemporary language. Research conducted with these lexicons tends
                    to suffer from <soCalled>short-termism</soCalled>: the data analyzed is often
                    limited to recent, short time periods, with a bias towards social media. </p>
                <p>Historians are interested in long-term developments, e.g. in opinion and emotion
                    expressions across time. Historians stress that the experience and expression of
                    emotions is subject to social and cultural changes <ptr target="#frevert2014"/>.
                    However, to date, sentiment mining techniques are not able to deal adequately
                    with the complexity and the historical contingency of emotions and their
                    expression. They focus on explicit utterances of emotions (I am angry), and
                    ignore the fact that the body is an important vessel for emotion communication.
                    Human emotions are a complex of neuro-physical, social and cultural actions and
                    reactions. They are expressed not only in words but also in gestures, facial
                    expressions and physical reactions.</p>
                <p> Over the last years, emotions and their history have become a focus point for
                    research <ptr target="#rosenwein2002"/>
                    <ptr target="#boddice2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#frevert2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#matt2013"/>
                    <ptr target="#plamper2015"/>. Centers for emotion studies were founded in
                    Berlin, London, Australia, France, and Amsterdam, specialized journals (e.g.
                        <title rend="italic">Emotion Review</title>) and discussion forums provide
                    platforms for emotion researchers (e.g. H-EMOTIONS, EMONET-L, HIST-EMOTION). The
                    cultural and historical complexity of emotions has been analyzed in a multitude
                    of studies, providing insight in the complex relations between mind and body, in
                    the constantly changing vocabularies used to address emotions, and in the
                    changeable appraisal of emotions. However, up to now, most of the (historical)
                    research in emotion studies relies mainly on traditional hermeneutical methods
                    of research <ptr target="#leemans2017"/> (for examples of historical sentiment
                    mining see e.g. <ptr target="#sprugnoli2016"/>).</p>
                <p> In our project, we aim to test existing sentiment mining techniques for their
                    capacity to analyze emotion expression in previous ages, and to develop an
                    enriched form of sentiment mining based on an <soCalled>embodied emotions
                        model</soCalled> that is capable of tracing historical changes in the verbal
                    and bodily expression of emotions over time. </p>
                <p>To analyze the emotional practices of the past, we chose to focus on Dutch
                    language theater texts of the early modern period (1600-1800). Theatre texts are
                    rich sources for emotion research since staging emotions is one of the main
                    goals of this genre. Characters tend to be very explicit in indicating their
                    feelings, while stage directions and speech lines give us information about the
                    bodily enactment of emotions. Although the communication on stage seems to have
                    little in common with daily speech, the way emotions were described, expressed
                    and enacted nonetheless appealed to a very large audience that apparently
                    recognized and immersed itself in the tribulations and emotions of the
                    characters.</p>
                <p>Theater texts offer an excellent case to explore the possibilities of historical
                    emotion mining over a longer period as it is one of the oldest literary genres
                    that remained popular over centuries. Moreover, the two hundred years between
                    1600 and 1800 witnessed fundamental changes in emotional culture and the
                    enactment of emotions on stage. During the 18th century, the classic view on
                        <soCalled>passions</soCalled> as highly embodied, strong and threatening
                    impulses waned and a more positive appreciation of the senses and sensibility as
                    source of human knowledge and morality came to the fore. New theatre forms, e.g.
                    the bourgeois tragedy or the <soCalled>Comédie Larmoyante</soCalled>, replaced
                    the traditional fierce passions from the tragedy – such as anger, revenge,
                    remorse, shame and despair with <soCalled>smaller</soCalled> emotions or
                        <soCalled>sentiments</soCalled> such as sadness, infatuation, bliss and
                    sensibility <ptr target="#leemans2013"/>. The medical conception of the humoral
                    system considered the condition of the blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile
                    as of great influence on emotional health <ptr target="#plamper2015"/>. This
                    view remained dominant throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries but
                    at the same time new medical theories came to the fore. The presumed physical
                    determinants of emotional wellbeing seem to have shifted gradually from the
                    bodily fluids to the nerves, the muscles and the skin <ptr target="#plamper2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#frevert2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#dixon2003"/>. Although we expect that with these migrations, the
                    bodily expressions of emotions changed as well, systematic research into this
                    change is still lacking.</p>
                <p>Within the Dutch language area, hardly any digital research has been conducted
                    into the history of emotions, nor into early modern theatrical or literary
                    culture. Current text, concept or sentiment mining projects tend to focus on
                    20th- and 21st-century data sets, e.g. social media, newspapers, journals, or
                    novels (see e.g. <ptr target="#wevers2017"/>
                    <ptr target="#eijnatten2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#pandermaat2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#dalenoskam2013"/>
                    <ptr target="#vossen2013"/>. For the 19th century, Dutch biographical datasets
                    have been sources for digital textual research that extracted biographical
                    information and conceptualizing <soCalled>events</soCalled> from these datasets
                        <ptr target="#braake2015"/>. </p>
                <p>For the early modern period, the ePistolarium project is one of the few projects
                    researching textual culture in the Dutch language with computational tools.
                    ePistolarium provides a web application that allows users to browse through
                    20.000 digitized letters from Dutch scholars and from scientists who stayed in
                    the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. This letter collection has been the
                    base for exploratory topic modeling <ptr target="#wittek2011"/>. So, while
                    digital research into Dutch language texts is developing rapidly, our work on
                    early modern Dutch literary texts opens up fresh territory. </p>
                <p> One of the reasons for the delayed employment of digital research tools by
                    researchers of early modern history is that current text mining tools developed
                    for modern language texts do not work well for older texts as vocabulary,
                    meaning and spelling altered importantly over time. Moreover, spelling in early
                    modern texts is highly inconsistent. For early modern texts, lexicons or
                    classification schemes of emotions are not available.</p>

                <head>2. Development of Historical Embodied Emotions Model (HEEM) </head>
                <p>For the corpus selection of this project, we collaborated with DBNL (Digital
                    Library of Dutch Literature) and with Nederlab - a project that aims to provide
                    online access to all digitized Dutch language texts since the Middle Ages. We
                    selected 280 theatre texts from the period 1600-1800, representing different
                    periods (Renaissance 1600-1669, Classicism 1670-1749, Enlightenment 1750-1800)
                    and different genres (tragedies, comedies and farces). Most of the theatre texts
                    were xml represented according to TEI standards (<ref target="http://www.tei-c.org">http://www.tei-c.org</ref>), so we could
                    differentiate between scenes, characters, speaker turns, and stage
                    directions.</p>
                <p>We selected 29 texts from our corpus of 280 plays to annotate manually. The
                    selection ensured coverage of different theatre genres (tragedy, comedy, farce),
                    and different periods. We converted the TEI XML files into Folia and used the
                    KAF annotator for our annotation process.<note> FOLIA: <ref target="http://proycon.github.io/folia">http://proycon.github.io/folia</ref>; KAF: <ref target="http://www.cltl.nl/results/software/kafnafannotator/">http://www.cltl.nl/results/software/kafnafannotator/</ref></note>
                </p>
                <p>This set of annotated files is employed in different ways. First of all, as it is
                    a representative sample of the entire HEEM-corpus, it provides preliminary
                    answers for our research questions concerning the changes in emotion expression
                    over time. Furthermore, it serves as a test and training set for the development
                    of machine learning methods aiming at automatically annotating the entire corpus
                    of 280 plays. The results of this process will be the subject of a later
                    publication. In this article, we present the results of the model development on
                    the basis of the 29-corpus. We will use this model and corpus as a test set for
                    comparisons with other sentiment mining methods.</p>

                    <head>2.1. HEEM annotation guidelines</head>
                    <p>In our project we distinguished emotions from related categories such as
                        mood, trait, cognitive state, physical state, edonic state, attitude and
                        sensation (cf. WordNet-Affect - <ptr target="#strapparava2004"/>). We
                        decided to focus on emotions proper, although the adjacent category of
                            <soCalled>moods</soCalled> turned out to be hardly distinguishable from
                        emotions in some cases. Additionally, we adopted the definition of emotions
                        by Klaus Scherer who defines an emotion as a strong feeling deriving from
                        one’s circumstances or relationships with others involving cognitive
                        appraisal, bodily symptoms, (a readiness for) action, motoric expression
                        (for instance in face or voice) and subjective awareness <ptr target="#scherer2005" loc="697, 703–5"/>. Besides emotions we are also
                        interested in the simultaneous occurrence of bodily reactions. In total, we
                        developed five annotation categories (Table 1).</p>
                    <p>In the annotation guidelines we further defined the five categories and
                        provided lists of examples (see HEEM-Github for more detailed information).
                        Starting from these definitions and after a preliminary exploration of a
                        subset of corpus texts, we composed a list of 37 emotions relevant for the
                        interpretation of early modern theatre texts (Table 2).</p>

                    <p>Words were annotated and interpreted in context, which means that a
                        polysemous word like the Dutch noun <soCalled>hoop</soCalled> which has two
                        meanings (<term>heap</term> and <term>hope</term>) will only be identified
                        if it is used in its second meaning. Likewise, body related concepts, i.e.
                        body parts, bodily processes and body sensations, are only identified if
                        they are involved in an emotion expressed in the text. In the case of bodily
                        processes, for instance, the reaction must be triggered by an emotion and
                        not by any other phenomenon. For example, <term>trembling</term> is
                        annotated in a sentence such as <term>she trembles with anger</term>, but is
                        not annotated in: <term>she trembles from the cold</term>. </p>
                    <p>Each annotated concept is classified into one of the 37 classes of the HEEM
                        emotion classification. Consider, for example, the following sentence and
                        its annotations: Ex. (1) <q>Ik kreeg van haar daar zulk gekyf; / Dat noch
                            het hart beefd in me lyf</q> (<q>She scolded at me so terribly that my
                            heart is still trembling in my body</q>). The word
                            <soCalled>gekyf</soCalled> (<term>scolding</term>) can be identified as
                        an emotional action and linked to the emotion class Anger.
                            <soCalled>Hart</soCalled> (<term>heart</term>) is annotated as a body
                        part and, in this case, linked to the emotion class Fear. Likewise, <q>beefd
                            in me lyf</q> (<term>tremble in my body</term> / <term>breast</term>) is
                        identified as Bodily Process and also linked to the emotion class Fear. In
                        the annotations, no distinction was made between the references to body
                        parts or bodily processes in a literal and a metaphorical sense. The reason
                        for this decision was that such a distinction is often quite difficult to
                        make in early modern texts, where expressions which we now consider to be
                        metaphorical often had a quite material basis in humoral theories of the
                        passions.</p>

                    <head>2.2. Inter-annotator study</head>
                    <p>The annotation was performed by a group of experienced readers of early
                        modern Dutch (theatre) texts. An inter-annotator study was carried out to
                        check the consistency and reliability of the annotations. Five annotators
                        annotated independently 2 documents with a total of approx. 1100 sentences.
                        Agreement is calculated following the metric <emph>agr</emph> as proposed by
                            <ptr target="#wiebe2005"/> and <ptr target="#read2010"/>, who calculate
                        agreement on similar data. This metric calculates pair-wise agreement by
                        first measuring precision of annotator A’s annotations on B’s annotations,
                        and then measuring precision of annotator B’s annotations on annotator A’s
                        annotations. Agreement between 2 annotators is the mean of the 2 scores. We
                        only report overall agreement (Table 3 and 4), which is the mean of the
                        pair-wise scores. </p>
                    <p>One of the problems of these kinds of annotations is that different
                        annotators are likely to choose different unit lengths while marking up what
                        is essentially the same. If we consider again example (1), we cannot know
                        whether an annotator identifies only the word <soCalled>beefd</soCalled>
                            (<term>trembles</term>) or whether he considers the whole sentence
                            (<soCalled>het hart beefd in me lyf</soCalled>) as a Bodily Process. We
                        took a lenient approach and considered an overlap of one word as
                        matching.</p>

                    <p>We first measured agreement on the identification of the different concept
                        types in text. Table 3 shows that the concept types Emotion, Body Part and
                        to a lesser extent Sensation are reliably identifiable, with overall scores
                        of 73, 73 and 61%, respectively. Bodily Processes and Emotional Actions,
                        however, have low agreement scores, which do not allow for definite
                        conclusions. On the basis of these results we decided to drop the categories
                        Emotional Action and Bodily Process for our model development. The lack of
                        agreement in these two categories is caused by the fact that some annotators
                        tended to include more expressions than others. Plays are literary texts
                        that artistically play with words and that are larded with metaphors. In the
                        following sentence body part and emotion are easy to identify: <soCalled>Wat
                            nevel van verdriet bezwalkte uw blinckende ogen</soCalled> (<term>What
                            haze of sorrow drapes your gleaming eyes</term>). There is sorrow
                        connected to the eyes, but what exactly happens to the eyes? And should that
                        be taken literally? We agreed to take metaphors and expressions literally
                        even though it could be a literary construction and thus that a phrase like
                        this should be tagged as the description of a bodily process. Nonetheless
                        this type of <soCalled>bodily processes</soCalled> could be easily
                        overlooked.</p>
                    <p>We also measured agreement on the classifications of emotions into one of the
                        specific HEEM emotion categories. On this task the annotators achieved an
                        agreement of 85%. The numbers show that the identification of emotions
                        (0.73) is harder than their classification into subcategories once the
                        expressions are identified (0.85). </p>

                    <p>While we were developing HEEM, we also started experimenting with
                        off-the-shelf sentiment mining tools. We chose Linguistic Inquiry and Word
                        Count (LIWC) as the most promising sentiment and embodiment mining technique
                        for further exploration. LIWC is a text analysis software program, which
                        provides a simple but effective way of measuring tendency and strength of
                        emotions (and other psychological properties) in text <ptr target="#pennebaker2001"/>
                        <ptr target="#pennebaker2015"/>. The LIWC dictionary was translated into
                        Dutch and tested by Dutch social scientists <ptr target="#zijlstra2004"/>.<note> LIWC has been updated and expanded in 2015 (LIWC2015, see <ptr target="#pennebaker2015"/>). However, since the Dutch translation of
                            LIWC2015 has not yet been published and integrated in LIWC2015, we have
                            made use of the previous version (LIWC2007)</note>

                    <p>The LIWC software processes each word of a text by searching for matches with
                        a categorized dictionary, including around 4,500 words and word stems. As
                        the software is developed by and for psychologists, it provides lists of
                        words on wellbeing, affect, cognition, biological processes, social
                        practices, and some specific emotions, e.g. anger, anxiety, sadness <ptr target="#tausczik2010"/>
                        <ptr target="#kahn2007"/>.<note> The LIWC output consists of: 1. General
                            descriptor categories (total word count, words per sentence, punctuation
                            etc), 2. Standard linguistic dimensions (percentage of pronouns,
                            articles, etc.), 3. Word categories indicating psychological constructs
                            (e.g., affect, cognition, biological processes), 4. Personal concern
                            categories (e.g., work, home, leisure activities) <ptr target="#pennebaker2001"/></note> The categories Posemo and Negemo
                        cover a broad range of terms that express positive and negative
                        appreciations and sentiments including adjectives and adverbs like
                            <term>nice</term> or <term>edgy</term>, as well as states or situations
                        that could allude to moods or indicate positive or negative appraisal such
                        as <term>alone</term> or <term>gloomy</term>. See Table 4 for an example of
                        some of the calculations of LIWC on an early modern Dutch theatre text:

                        will analyze the results of this table later in this paper. But first, we
                        need to discuss the reliability of LIWC for researching early modern
                        texts.</p>

                    <p>LIWC has been previously applied on historical data sets, without an
                        evaluation of the performance of the software <ptr target="#borowiecki2013"/>
                        <ptr target="#leemans2013"/>. As LIWC is designed for modern texts, it
                        underperforms in historical texts. To diminish this problem, we extended the
                        Dutch LIWC dictionary with historical data by linking it to GiGaNT, a
                        lexicon service provided by the INL (INL Lexicon Service). GiGaNT offers
                        spelling and word variants of Dutch language, from the 15th to the 20th
                        century. We used a subset covering the period from 1600-1800. The
                            <soCalled>historical Dutch LIWC</soCalled> (HD-LIWC) was created by
                        adding spelling variants for all words to the original Dutch LIWC (cf. the
                        spelling normalization procedure applied in <ptr target="#zwaan2015"/>). The
                        original Dutch LIWC dictionary contains 6,512 terms, while the HD-LIWC
                        contains 8,757 terms. Table 5 shows that most historical terms map
                        unambiguously to a single modern variant (96%). For historical terms that
                        mapped to multiple modern variants, a single variant was selected randomly. </p>

                    <p>Applying the <soCalled>historical Dutch LIWC</soCalled> (HD-LIWC) to our
                        corpus resulted in higher coverage as more words were labeled with one or
                        more LIWC categories. Table 4 shows percentages of words found for the
                        positive emotions (Posemo), Negative emotions (Negemo), and Body categories
                        using the original Dutch LIWC and HD-LIWC in one selected play: <title rend="italic">Achilles</title> by Balthasar Huydecoper (1719). However,
                        the higher percentages achieved by HD-LIWC must be interpreted with care,
                        because our method of developing HD-LIWC introduced noise into the list. We
                        identified three types of noise that were introduced. First, for historical
                        words that map to multiple modern alternatives, one alternative was selected
                        at random. For example, the historical term <soCalled>vreed</soCalled> is a
                        spelling variant of both <soCalled>vrede</soCalled> (<term>peace</term>) and
                            <soCalled>wreed</soCalled> (<term>cruel</term>). In the historical LIWC,
                            <soCalled>vreed</soCalled> only maps to <soCalled>vrede</soCalled>, the
                        meaning of <soCalled>vreed</soCalled> as <soCalled>wreed</soCalled> is
                        missed. The second source of noise is caused by the way in which the
                        LexiconService returns spelling variants for verbs. Regardless of the tense
                        of the verb entered, the LexiconService returns spelling variants in all
                        tenses. This means that LIWC categories Present and Past are unreliable and
                        should not be used. The third source of noise is introduced by
                        inconsistencies in GiGaNT/the LexiconService. For example, the term
                            <soCalled>gehoond</soCalled> (<term>mocked</term>) is retrieved as a
                        spelling variant of <soCalled>gezond</soCalled> (<term>healthy</term>) and
                        counted in the LIWC category Body, where it obviously does not belong. </p>

                    <p>As an experiment, we also compiled another emotion wordlist for Dutch based
                        on the English resource WordNetAffect <ptr target="#strapparava2004"/>.
                        WordNetAffect is built as an extra layer on the Princeton WordNet <ptr target="#fellbaum1998"/> semi-automatically labeling each set of
                        synonyms with a so-called affect type (such as mood, trait, emotion,
                        behavior, etc.). Part of these synsets is additionally labeled with a set of
                        fine-grained emotion classes such as anger, fear, disgust, etc. We
                        transferred these labels from the Princeton WordNet to the Dutch WordNet
                            <ptr target="#vossen2008"/> using the equivalent links between the two
                        WordNets. We then selected the words labeled with the affect type
                            <soCalled>emotion</soCalled> and expanded the set with historic variants
                        adopting the same strategy as followed for the historical version of LIWC.
                        For the tests presented in this paper we did not take into consideration the
                        fine-grained emotion classification.</p>

                        mainly due to erroneous or missing equivalent links or even to the fact that
                        the original English resource has been built also in a partly automatic way. </p>

                <head>4. Comparing HEEM with D-LIWC and D-WNAffect</head>
                <p>In this section, we will present a quantitative comparison between HEEM
                    annotations and the four wordlists: the Dutch version of LIWC (D-LIWC), the
                    historical Dutch version of LIWC (HD-LIWC), the Dutch version of WordNetAffect
                    (D-WNAffect) and the historical Dutch version of WordNetAffet (HD-WNAffect). To
                    be able to perform the comparisons, we merged the LIWC classes ‘posemo’ and
                    ‘negemo’ into one single class ‘emotion’ and compared the result with the HEEM
                    emotion classes. Additionally, we compared the LIWC class ‘Body’ with the HEEM
                    class ‘Lichaamsdeel’ (Emotion related Body part). </p>
                <p>The results in absolute numbers can be seen in Table 7. The numbers of HEEM
                    entities differ considerably from the numbers identified by both D-LIWC and
                    HD-LIWC, which is caused by the broad definition of the LIWC categories of
                    emotions and body related terms compared to the corresponding HEEM classes. We
                    also see that HD-LIWC has higher coverage than LIWC. </p>

                <p>We established the precision of D-LIWC in finding emotions and body parts when
                    compared to the manual annotations of HEEM. Here precision indicates how many
                    entities found by D-LIWC and HD-LIWC are also identified as emotions or body
                    parts by HEEM. Table 8 shows that only 13,5% and 10.1% of the words identified
                    as emotions by D-LIWC and HD-LIWC, respectively, are labeled as emotions by
                    HEEM. Likewise, only 10.9% and 7.4% of the body terms identified by D-LIWC and
                    HD-LIWC are listed by HEEM as emotion related body parts. </p>
                <p>The low precision score is illustrative for the difference between sentiment
                    mining (LIWC), which returns a wide variety of opinions and affective
                    expressions and the manual expert annotations according to the model developed
                    for HEEM, which is very precise and more restrictive in its identification of
                    emotion words and terms for body parts involved in the embodiment and expression
                    of emotions. </p>
                <p>Recall scores measure how many words have not been found by D-LIWC and HD-LIWC
                    when compared to HEEM. The score of 60,2% for the recall on emotions implies
                    that still 40% of the emotion words in the 29 plays were not found by the
                    historicized LIWC. HD-LIWC gives higher recall than the D-LIWC but its lower
                    precision scores uncover that the noise introduced by the extra words is
                    substantial. </p>

                    <p>The tables 9, 10 and 11 present correctly found, and missed emotion words,
                        and words that HD-LIWC counts, but HEEM ignores. These lists provide insight
                        into the way HEEM works in comparison to D-LIWC and HD-LIWC. Table 9 shows
                        the most frequent words correctly found by HD-LIWC. The words in bold such
                        as <soCalled>vreezen</soCalled> (<term>fear)</term>,
                            <soCalled>vreugd</soCalled> (<term>joy</term>) and
                            <soCalled>spyt</soCalled> (<term>reget</term>) are historical variants
                        of emotion words that are correctly found by HD-LIWC, and that are missed by
                        D-LIWC. Table 10 shows the most frequent words that are still missed by
                        HD-LIWC. Many words such as <soCalled>gramschap</soCalled>
                            (<term>anger</term>), <soCalled>toorn</soCalled> (<term>anger</term>)
                            <soCalled>min</soCalled> (<term>love</term>),
                            <soCalled>minnen</soCalled> (<term>to love</term>), and
                            <soCalled>mededogen</soCalled> (<term>compassion</term>) are archaic
                        emotion words that are no longer in everyday use or even obsolete. These
                        words are not included in the HD-LIWC as they are not variants of
                        contemporaneous words with an affective meaning. It also shows that some
                        historical form variants are still lacking in HD-LIWC (e.g.
                            <soCalled>jalouzij</soCalled> (<term>envy</term>),
                            <soCalled>lijefd</soCalled> (<term>love</term>),
                            <soCalled>liefd</soCalled> (<term>love</term>),
                            <soCalled>haaten</soCalled> (<term>hate</term>) etc.) although their
                        modern counterparts (i.e. <soCalled>jaloezie</soCalled>,
                            <soCalled>liefde</soCalled> and <soCalled>haten</soCalled>) are present
                        in D-LIWC.</p>

                    <p>Table 11 constains the words that are found by HD-LIWC, but are ignored by
                        HEEM. It includes words such as <soCalled>goed</soCalled>
                        (<term>good</term>), <soCalled>ryk</soCalled> (<term>rich</term>),
                            <soCalled>held</soCalled> (<term>hero</term>) which are appraisals and
                        judgments rather than emotions in the stricter sense. In HEEM only
                        descriptions of emotions as defined by Scherer (see paragraph IV) are
                        annotated while LIWC includes all kinds of sentiment words including
                        emotions, attitudes, appraisals and beliefs as well as concepts that are
                        strongly associated with positive or negative feelings such as
                            <soCalled>hemel</soCalled> (<term>heaven</term>) or
                            <soCalled>straf</soCalled> (<term>punishment</term>). </p>
                    <p>A second set of highly frequent errors comes from incorrectly found form
                        variants. The verb form <soCalled>moet</soCalled> (<term>must</term>) and
                        the adverb <soCalled>eer</soCalled> (<term>before</term>) are wrongly
                        considered as historic form variants of the noun <soCalled>moed</soCalled>
                            (<term>courage</term>) and the noun <soCalled>eer</soCalled>
                            (<term>honor</term>), respectively. It seems worth trying to solve these
                        confusions by filtering on part-of-speech, but this is currently not an
                        option as well-performing NLP tools are not yet available for historical
                        Dutch. </p>

                        overestimates the sentiment value of texts since it classifies ambiguous
                        words like <soCalled>alleen</soCalled> (<term>alone</term>) and
                            <soCalled>vry</soCalled> (<term>free</term>) as negemo and posemo, and
                        lists <soCalled>social</soCalled> pronouns such as <soCalled>we</soCalled>
                        as positive sentiments. The polysemous noun <soCalled>hoop</soCalled> has an
                        affective meaning (<term>hope</term>) and a non-affective meaning
                            (<term>heap</term>). The theater texts include both usages as in
                            <soCalled>van alle hoop ontbloot</soCalled> (<term>deprived from all
                            hope</term>) and <soCalled>een hoop geboeyde slaven</soCalled> (<term>a
                            lot of chained slaves</term>). In HEEM the former usage is annotated as
                        an emotion and the latter is not, whereas LIWC is not able to distinguish
                        between them. Likewise, we can see that a word like
                            <soCalled>lust</soCalled> (<term>desire</term>) appears both on the list
                        of correctly found words (cf. Table 9) and on that of the incorrectly found
                        words (cf. Table 11). It will therefore be difficult to achieve high scores
                        with a word counting method like LIWC on an early modern literary corpus.

                    <head>4.2. Bodies and physical states</head>
                    <p>The LIWC category <soCalled>Physical</soCalled> will return body parts such
                        as <term>hands</term>, <term>eyes</term>, <term>womb</term> or
                            <term>ears</term>, and bodily processes or reactions such as
                            <term>trembling</term>, <term>bleeding</term> or <term>blushing</term>,
                        but also general physical states such as <term>awake</term>,
                            <term>sleepy</term>, <term>wounded</term>, or illnesses
                            (<term>anorexia</term>, <term>angina</term>, <term>AIDS</term>), and
                        even loosely related body words such as <term>alcohol</term>,
                            <term>bathroom</term>, <term>bathrobe</term>, <term>cook</term>,
                            <term>kitchen</term> and <term>dishes</term>. HD-LIWC even broadens this
                        category including words like <soCalled>schoon</soCalled>, which can mean
                            <term>clean</term> and <term>beautiful</term>, but in early modern Dutch
                        is in many cases used for <term>however</term>
                            (<soCalled>(of)schoon</soCalled>). Also, the indicated problem that
                        HD-LIWC introduces noise in spelling variants in verb tenses, is visible in
                        the returns HD-LIWC gives on the historical corpus. One of the words with
                        the highest recall rates in the category physical is <term>was</term>. This
                        past tense of the verb to be, is indicated as physical since LexiconService
                        has <term>was</term> listed as a verbal conjugation of
                            <soCalled>washing</soCalled>. The broad range of the LIWC category
                        Physical, and the noise created by HD-LIWC therefore renders this category
                        as not very indicative for research into physical states or reactions to
                        emotions.</p>
                    <p> The LIWC category Body is more precise and concise (400 words) than Physical
                        (648 words). But again, noise is introduced by HD-LIWC.
                            <soCalled>zich</soCalled> (<term>his</term>) is indicated as a body
                        term, as a spelling variant of <term>sight</term>
                            (<soCalled>zicht</soCalled>), just as <soCalled>vry</soCalled>
                            (<term>free</term>), as a conjugation of <soCalled>vrijen</soCalled>
                            (<term>making love</term>), <soCalled>tien</soCalled> as a variant of
                            <soCalled>teen</soCalled> (<term>toe</term>), and
                            <soCalled>arme</soCalled> (<term>poor</term>) as spelling variant of
                            <soCalled>arm</soCalled> (<term>arm</term>). Altogether 25% of the
                        indicated body terms is incorrect. Although this is a high percentage, it is
                        quite easy to correct, since the same noise words keep coming back and their
                        percentage is quite high (of the 25% of noise 75% is caused by the word
                            <soCalled>zich</soCalled>).<note> Of 420 HD-LIWC indicated body terms in
                            1 theatre play, 98 were obviously noise: zich (77), gehoond (10), vry
                            (4), hoog (3), hangt (2), schede (2). </note> For future use HD-LIWC
                        could be cleared of these easily traceable mistakes. Apart from these
                        apparent over-interpretations, HD-LIWC indicated many words as body terms
                        that are ambiguous. <soCalled>Vryen</soCalled> can mean <term>to make
                            love</term>, but in most instances it is an inflection of
                            <soCalled>vrij</soCalled> (<term>free</term>). As long as LIWC only
                        counts single words, without taking context in consideration, this will
                        remain a problem.</p>

                <p>In the last section of this article, we will dive deeper into the texts and
                    provide some examples as to how applying LIWC and HEEM can help us to analyze
                    early modern texts. In Table 4 we presented the (HD)-LIWC analysis of an
                    18th-century Dutch tragedy by Balthazar Huydecoper. Table 12 draws a comparison
                    between this tragedy and a comedy from around the same period by Jacob Campo
                    Weyerman.</p>

                <p>The comparison leads to some interesting observations. Firstly, the comedy seems
                    to be far less joyful than the tragedy as the relative frequency of positive
                    emotions (Posemo) is lower (0.90 / 2.06%) in Weyerman than in Huydecoper (2.23 /
                    3.51%). Secondly, the tragedy seems to be more emotional over all, whereas the
                    comedy seems to stage less emotional scenes. As expected, emotions like sadness,
                    anger and anxiety are far more dominant in Huydecoper’s tragedy. Also, death is
                    addressed more often in the tragedy. Body terms are used less in the comedy - a
                    fact that may be connected to the lower degree of emotional expressions.
                    However, since LIWC does not interconnect these categories (as HEEM does), we
                    cannot verify this hypothesis. </p>
                <p>What puzzled us at first is that exclusive modern-day categories such as TV also
                    returned results in the early modern texts. A check of the dictionary showed us
                    that this is due to the fact that this category also includes words like
                        <soCalled>vermaak</soCalled> (<term>entertainment</term>), which is a rather
                    common description of being amused in early modern Dutch. We can conclude that
                    (HD)-LIWC shows interesting results when comparing individual texts. Comparing
                    these two texts with the overall results of (HD)-LIWC analysis of 29 Dutch
                    theatre texts, taught us that they follow main trends. Overall, modern
                    categories such as Sports, School and TV return low results (between 0,03 and
                    0,2% - and most of the 0,2% depended upon the word
                    <soCalled>vermaak</soCalled>). The category Swearing is even almost completely
                    absent (0,01%). This can be due to the civilizing zeal of the playhouse
                    (swearing was hardly tolerated on Dutch stages), and to the fact that swear
                    words are cultural and time sensitive. The Dutch are famous for swearing with
                    diseases <ptr target="#sanders1998"/>. As the most threatening diseases change
                    over time, so do the swear words. Religious swear words (e.g. devil, holy) have
                    gone out of fashion.</p>
                <p>Religion does show up as a category of interest for Dutch plays (around 0,70%).
                    This is striking since the Amsterdam theatre did not admit biblical plays on
                    stage, and frankly discouraged play writers from addressing matters religious on
                    stage <ptr target="#leemans2013" loc="267–8"/>. That early modern plays were
                    meant to arouse and temper the passions is quite clear from the data: both
                    tragedies and comedies show high results for physical and emotional categories:
                    Early modern Dutch comedies present a posemo percentage of 2,7% and a negemo of
                    1,75%, and tragedies 3,30% posemo and 3,54% negemo. This is overall
                    significantly higher than the average pos/negemo percentages of English language
                    novels (2.67% posemo, 2.09% negemo), or of the New York Times (2.32% posemo,
                    1.35% negemo). Current social media, however score much higher on the sentiment
                    scale than early modern Dutch drama (LIWC 2015). </p>
                <p>To compare the performance of (HD)-LIWC and HEEM we can also check the results in
                    distinguishing between different genres over 29 Dutch theatre plays. Figure 1
                    shows that HEEM seems to be better in distinguishing comedies and tragedies.
                    Quite astonishing is the fact that LIWC hardly seems to be able to distinguish
                    between tragedy and comedy on the basis of their sentiments: positive and
                    negative sentiments in both genres score around 50%. HD-LIWC has similar results
                    for tragedies, but finds comedies more positive than negative. According to HEEM
                    tragedies are far more negative than positive, and although HEEM does not seem
                    to find comedies significantly more positive, it does show that in percentage,
                    comedies are much merrier than tragedies.<note> Although HEEM does not have
                        specific categories for positive and negative sentiments, we clustered the
                        emotions in these two categories for this analysis. (see also <ptr target="#zwaan2015"/>).</note>

                <p>For scholars who work on historical texts HEEM is an interesting tool not only
                    for its preciseness in measuring positive and negative emotions, but even more
                    for its ability to trace the relative dominance of certain emotions in a
                    specific period of time, and the chronological development of <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#frevert2011">emotions lost and found</quote>
                        <ptr target="#frevert2011"/>
                    </cit>. Moreover, HEEM can analyze where in the body emotions such as wrath are
                    located and how that changes over time (Figure 1). In general, HEEM can trace
                    trends in the locations of emotions in the body, finding for instance the rise
                    of the heart as an important seat for emotions over the early modern period
                    (Figure 2). The data presented in these graphs are the results of the machine
                    learning process that we carried out on the basis of the HEEM model we discussed
                    so far in this article (see for a discussion of the development of the machine
                    learning: <ptr target="#zwaan2015"/>). We have used the HEEM model to analyze a
                    significant larger set of theatre texts (N = 280). The results of this analysis
                    will be presented in a following publication. In the meantime, the HEEM tool is
                    already made available in open access (HEEM-Github).</p>

                <p>HEEM and HD-LIWC can also be applied on single plays in order to explore

                    negative sentiments in the course of one Dutch theater play. The ‘sentimental’
                    development can be visualized per character and per speaker turn. The
                    visualization shows that the two main male characters (Achilles and Patroclus -
                    blue and red lines) are overall in despair, although Achilles seems to
                    temporarily brighten up by the presence of Brizeïs (orange line).</p>

                <head>6. Conclusion</head>
                <p>This article presents a new model for historical emotion mining in Dutch language
                    texts: HEEM. We have described why and how we developed HEEM for the mining of
                    embodied emotions in historical Dutch language texts. We have presented our
                    evaluation data of HEEM development, and compared HEEM performance with the off
                    the shelf sentiment mining tool LIWC, and with a historicized version of Dutch
                    language LIWC.</p>
                <p>We conclude that especially a historicized version of Dutch language LIWC
                    (HD-LIWC) could be apt for sentiment mining in historical texts. Some of the
                        <soCalled>non-emotion</soCalled> categories LIWC registers also seem
                    relevant for historical texts (topics such as <soCalled>death</soCalled> or
                        <soCalled>religion</soCalled>, usage of we/I/you), whereas some categories
                    are too time specific to be of any use (TV, sports, school, swearing). </p>
                <p>Overall, LIWC is a text analysis program based on single word recall. Although
                    LIWC offers some classifications of specific emotions, these are biased towards
                    negative emotions (sadness, anger, anxiety). Researchers interested in emotions,
                    as opposed to a larger category of sentiments, seem to be better off with HEEM. </p>
                <p> HEEM also has a more fine-grained vocabulary for the detection of body terms in
                    historical texts and relating those to emotions. It allows us to map changes in
                    the embodiment of emotions on the Dutch Stage over a long period of time. For
                    the future, improvements could be made to HD-LIWC by developing stricter
                    spelling variants and including part of speech tags, to diminish noise. Together
                    with the Dutch LIWC team, we are exploring possibilities to improve HD-LIWC, and
                    apply it on the Dutch translation of LIWC2015.</p>
                <p>Combining LIWC and HEEM could bring new perspectives to future research: it could
                    give an indication of the physicality of a text (how many body terms are used in
                    general?) and of the percentage of emotional physicality: what percentage of the
                    physical terms is indicated as emotionally charged?</p>
