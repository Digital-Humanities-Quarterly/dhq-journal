        </front>
        <body>
            <p>Timothy J. Welsh’s monograph <title rend="italic">Mixed Realism: Videogames and the Violence of Fiction</title> comes
                at an appropriate time in American current events. In Welsh’s introduction, he
                tackles the question that continues to haunt new media scholars and literary
                scholars: does violence in media lead to real-life violence? After the recent
                Parkland, Fl. high school massacre, President Trump placed blame on violence in
                video games, a tactic that has been used since the Columbine tragedy to center fault
                around one piece of media, rather than looking at the individualized and networked
                contexts <ptr target="#ducharme2018"/>. Welsh directly addresses this question in his
                introduction, arguing this logic centers around the immersion fallacy: video games
                and literature (the two types of media he explores) are simultaneously seen as
                immersive in that they remove us from the <soCalled>real,</soCalled> and influential in that they
                directly affect the <soCalled>real</soCalled>. For Welsh, the problem with this fallacy is the
                real/virtual dichotomy it sets up; this dichotomy does not recognize the very real,
                material consequences of wired culture – and not necessarily in the manner Trump and
                others believe. In order to further explore this notion, Welsh coins the phrase
                <quote rend="inline">mixed realism,</quote> a methodology that examines both the <cit><quote rend="inline">virtualities and the lived
                contexts in which we engage them</quote> <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="18"/></cit> by analyzing the affective and
                material experiences that result from consuming and participating in digital media.</p>
            <p>Just like the media Welsh explores in his book, <title rend="italic">Mixed Realism</title> is not a
                comfortable (in the affective sense) read, especially for an avid gamer and reader
                such as myself. The violence portrayed in media–particularly around guns and
                vengeance–permeates the video games and literature that Welsh examines. Welsh’s
                choices are not necessarily cherry-pickings, either, as a large percentage of
                commercially popular video games revolve around violence in some way.
                His methodology demands consumers of violent video games and literature to
                be accountable for how they choose to read and analyze media. In the
                introduction, Welsh frames his argument by examining the controversy around the game
                <title rend="italic">Super Columbine Massacre RPG!</title>, a game that was
                simultaneously critiqued for its inadequate representation of the massacre and its
                power to influence another school shooting that followed the game’s release. Welsh
                argues, though, that the importance of <title rend="italic">Super Columbine Massacre
                    RPG!</title> is not necessarily to represent the shooting in a <soCalled>realistic</soCalled> way, but
                rather make explicit <cit><quote rend="inline">one’s position as media user within a culture steeped in
                violence and in turn acknowledge responsibility…for the real-world violence that
                happened that day</quote> <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="15"/></cit>. Although he is not arguing that violence in
                video games causes the horrors of a school shooting, he reframes the role consumers
                play in the reproduction of violent media and culture. His move reflects the <term>mixed
                realism</term> methodology by beginning to think about the role of virtual media in the
                material consequences and experiences that occur from users’ interaction with the
                virtuality.</p>
            <p>Welsh spends the first major half of the book working through the history, theory,
                and methodology that has led him to develop this lens using <title rend="italic">In
                    Cold Blood</title> by Truman Capote and several self-reflexive video games. In the
                first chapter, he pours through different theorists’ interpretations of immersion
                and Hayles’ notion of embodiment – a new model of readership – to better demonstrate
                how the lens of immersion fails in Capote’s non-fiction, New Journalist novel that
                claims to show what <quote rend="inline"><emph>actually happened</emph></quote> in the murder of the
                Clutter family. Welsh argues that this novel simultaneously makes explicit the
                constructedness of the narrative while also asking the reader to interpret what
                <soCalled>actually happened,</soCalled> yet Capote presents the novel as the objective truth. While
                this argument is compelling in demonstrating the immersion fallacy and arguing the
                paradoxical nature of claiming a representation is what <quote rend="inline"><emph>actually
                happened</emph></quote>, Welsh seems to use Capote’s novel to build up to the core of
                mixed realism – how does the explicit constructedness of a <soCalled>true</soCalled> representation tie
                into the <cit><quote rend="inline">virtualities and the lived
                contexts in which we engage them</quote> <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="18"/></cit>?</p>
            <p>Welsh begins to tackle this question in the next chapter titled <title rend="quotes">Incomplete Worlds</title>,
                which centers around how the constructedness of narratives always leaves gaps. He
                uses <title rend="italic">Super Mario 64</title>’s video mechanics as an example: the user
                can control both Mario and the camera watching Mario. By drawing out these
                paradoxes, the user is always aware of the constructedness of media narratives while
                also recognizing their role in following (or challenging) the rules of the game.
                Finally, The <title rend="quotes">Gaming in Context</title> and <title rend="quotes">Metafiction</title> chapters pull from the
                theoretical discussions Welsh brings into the piece in the former chapter in
                exploring several self-reflexive games that make explicit their constructedness.
                Exploring the gaps and constructed nature of narratives in media is a compelling
                argument, but I found myself again wanting more from these sections, especially
                <title rend="quotes">Incomplete Worlds</title>. These chapters paid little attention to the real and urgent
                problem of wired culture and the representation of violence; Welsh even admits in
                one moment towards the end of the book that his argument was initially not concerned
                with violence, but one of his colleagues pointed out how central violence was in his
                argument. This first section seems to stand apart from the rest of the book because
                of this change.</p>
            <p>The latter half of Welsh’s book is where his argument begins to shine. He implements
                his <term>mixed realism</term> lens to examine two pieces of media: <title rend="italic">House of
                    Leaves</title> by Mark Danielewski and the controversial videogame
                <title rend="italic">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</title>. Welsh
                addresses the problematics of violence and gaps in narratives by showing how those
                media make explicit these problematics. For <title rend="italic">House of Leaves</title>,
                Welsh focuses on the section <quote rend="inline">describing</quote>
                <note xml:id="ftn1">
                    <p>I use the scare quotes around <q>describing</q> here because there is actually
                    very little description of Jed’s death.</p>
                </note>
                Jed’s death. In this section, the form of the book follows its content, or as Welsh argues, the
                <cit><quote rend="inline">real-world <soCalled>happening</soCalled> of reading the book belongs to the novel’s fiction</quote>
                <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="104"/></cit>.
                Similarly in the previous chapters’ focus on the explicit
                constructedness of narratives, Welsh looks at Danielewski’s choices in literal gaps
                on the page as representative of the gaps in narratives. Although this argument is
                based off Welsh’s previous chapters, chapter six gets at the core problem of the
                narrative gap as both a form of violence and a failure to represent violence;
                <cit><quote rend="inline">analysis, discussion of the event, and even descriptions on the page are always
                inadequate, always tangential, and always too late</quote> <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="117"/></cit>. By
                acknowledging these failures and gaps, we can better understand our own individual,
                social, and contextual positions as we consume texts as well as take responsibility
                for our interpretations of the narratives.</p>
            <p>The most powerful chapter in Welsh’s book revolves around the controversial <term>No
                Russian</term> level in <title rend="italic">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</title>’s (<title
                    rend="italic">CoD:MW2</title>) campaign. I want to emphasize the importance of
                chapter seven as it provides a model for not only how to explore a text through the
                mixed realism lens, but also for how to handle sensitive and traumatic topics such
                as war-at-a-distance and drone warfare. In the <title rend="italic">CoD:MW2</title> level, a player
                participates in a terrorist attack at an airport and makes the choice to either kill
                or stand by and watch others kill innocent civilians. Instead of diving right into
                this level, he looks at the context of the rest of the game, examining how the
                different events in the game mirror the very real and urgent <q>war-at-a-distance.</q>
                Such war is fought in the digital realm and values faceless enemies until there is
                need to justify the violence, as Welsh explains in his analysis of the face-to-face
                combat portion of the campaign. For Welsh, the ways in which <title rend="slant(italic)">CoD:MW2</title> mirror and
                replicate drone warfare, or bombing of an area from a distance,
                are more frightening than the controversial <term>No Russian</term> level. In fact, Welsh
                argues the <term>No Russian</term> level is when users may feel empathy and disgust as they
                watch the horrors of warfare on innocent civilians (or pixilated representations of
                innocent civilians) unfold; meanwhile, the drone warfare prevents players from
                engaging and empathizing with victims as the user bombs pixelated shadows.
                What Welsh begins to explore here is one of the most
                powerful moments in his piece: how do users ascribe value to the millions of pixels,
                the algorithmic responses, the rules of a game, and the narrative gaps that are
                presented?</p>
            <p>In his conclusion, Welsh has a paragraph that mentions GamerGate, the Arab Spring,
                NSA surveillance, and other current events in which mixed realism might be applied <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="160"/>.
                The sandwiching of these event mentions in the conclusion with
                the Columbine and other tragedies feels rushed, but by doing so, Welsh offers his
                readers a chance to pick up where he leaves off. I do believe Welsh’s lens can
                extend across media and ponder more deeply the portrayal of <quote rend="inline">real violences, both
                local and global</quote> in media. He ends his book by bringing in seemingly amoral media:
                Cormac McCarthy’s <title rend="italic">Blood Meridian</title> and <title rend="italic">Red
                Dead Redemption</title>. For those two pieces of text, he argues that there is
                little in the presentation of violence to provide an ethical and moral guide for
                users; however, what Welsh finds valuable are the <cit><quote rend="inline">unguessed kinships</quote> <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="170"/></cit>
                that users form with characters, thus ending the book in a surprisingly
                optimistic manner. I cannot help but wonder, though, kinships for whom?</p>
            <p>Welsh’s methodology is important for exploring affect and the very real dangers and
                violence that can result from wired culture. Because he spends so much time framing
                his <term>mixed realism</term> lens in the first section, though, many of his choices in media
                and topic left me wanting more. Welsh addresses this in his introduction when he
                says <cit><quote rend="inline">mixed reality circulates a little differently in each and every configuration,
                sometimes turning on a unique interaction or specific media affordance…reading mixed
                realism is a process of careful tracing, following sometimes a singular aspect of
                the virtual as it reframes entirely our engagement with it by situating us within
                the broader media ecology</quote> <ptr target="#welsh2016" loc="18"/></cit>. In our broader media ecology of digital
                humanities and new media studies, though, there is already acknowledgement of the
                very real and tangible influences of wired culture; new media scholars–such as N.
                Katherine Hayles and Elizabeth Losh <ptr target="#losh2015"/>–have already been thinking about how we
                place value on the billions of pixels we consume every day. What Welsh’s methodology
                offers is an extension of this, but he does not take advantage of some necessary
                critical lenses: embodiment and feminist gaming studies. While Welsh is able to be
                critical of the gaps in textual narratives, there is a lack of attention to race,
                gender, and socioeconomic class; those who are most heavily affected–and often
                erased–by these narrative gaps are people in marginalized groups. <note xml:id="ftn2">
                    <p>I do want to acknowledge that Welsh uses the <q>she</q>
                        pronoun when talking about gamers, a move that seems to be a response to
                        GamerGate and the policing of women, especially women of color, in
                        gaming.</p>
                </note></p>
            <p>When thinking about violence in gaming, first person shooters are an obvious place to
                look. Patriarchal ideologies of violence and individualism are often embedded in
                violent texts and video games–like <title rend="italic">Call of Duty</title>, <title rend="italic">Halo</title>,
                <title rend="italic">Fortnite</title>, and several texts mentioned by Welsh.
                I also would have liked to see him dive further into the ways in which games,
                both the violent content and the ways in which these games are taken up,
                encourage toxic behaviors, especially for young men and further explore how
                these toxic behaviors may stifle empathy and compassion. He also mentions GamerGate
                and Anita Sarkeesian in passing, but does not take time to emphasize the violence of
                online harassment, not just for feminist gaming critics like Sarkeesian, but for
                gamers whose voices suggest they are not white cis-men (for those gamers brave
                enough to venture onto their mic) or even gamers whose usernames may be read as
                feminine. I would have liked to see him do more work focusing on games' violent
                representations of and online harassment towards women (especially women of color),
                queer people, and other marginalized gamers and consumers. How might the mixed realism lens shift when
                looking at violence towards pixelated characters who represent very real people who
                have historically and currently had very real systematic violence enacted upon them?</p>
            <p>As Welsh points out, games are narratives woven through a series of rules and
                algorithmic response, but in commercially popular video games, these narratives are
                typically violent in nature. When talking about gaming, it is difficult to avoid
                conversations of violence. As gamers, readers, and new media scholars, how do we
                wrestle with the idea that the medium we care about is often violent? How do we
                continue to prioritize games’ politics, as Ruberg and Phillips call for
                in the introduction to the <title rend="italic">Game Studies</title> special issue on
                <title rend="quotes">Queerness and Video Games</title><ptr target="#ruberg2018"/>? Merging feminist gaming scholarship and Welsh’s mixed
                realism centers the material experiences and consequences of wired culture as well
                as the ways in which we as users, consumers, and critics are responsible for how we
                engage with and analyze media.</p>
