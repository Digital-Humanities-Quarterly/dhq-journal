         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>This article argues that Sherwood Anderson’s <title rend="italic">Winesburg,
          Ohio</title>, while it cannot be considered a text straightforwardly concerned with
          technology, offers a modernist version of the story cycle that anticipates the delocalized
          and highly structured interconnections facilitated by the network. Unlike today’s
          seamlessly embedded networks, however, the prototypical form depicted in <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> functions as a kluge, <cit>

               </cit>. Anderson’s kluge augurs network technology and therefore suggests that the form
          loomed large in modernists’ mind. However, <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>
          illustrates the network’s propensity to foster users’ inner alienation while enabling

            <p>Although published in 1919 as a modernist pastoral, Sherwood Anderson’s <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> depicts a prototypical network that sounds a
          warning rather than a welcome to the network’s 21st-century iterations.</p>

            <p>It is now a matter of fact that the nonlinear, nonhierarchical, and delocalized
          functioning of the network has transformed the ways that many individuals define
          themselves, establish themselves in relationships, situate themselves in and apart from
          communities, and accumulate knowledge about what can be known in and about the world.
          While today’s most pervasive network — the Internet — facilitates posthumanist
          demonstrations of the power of ameliorative, (according to theorists Barry Wellman and
          William J. Mitchell), connectivity, the Internet and the virtual identities and
          communities it fosters also facilitate far more complex and ambivalent
          connections.<note>Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, and N. Katherine Hayles have usefully named and explored posthumanist theory.</note> Perhaps unsurprisingly, pundits and journalists
          have been largely responsible for warning against the network’s potentially negative and
          even harmful effects. While members of the media increasingly focus on the Internet’s
          detrimental impact and point to social networking platforms for evidence of the shallow
          and ultimately false promise of community that networks extend to users, Twitter and
          Facebook are only the most recent manifestations of the network’s long tradition of
          fostering users’ inner alienation while enabling their unprecedented connection.</p>
            <p>Rather than proceeding <term>in media res</term> and looking to the Internet to
          understand networks and to comprehend the dynamics of network culture, I take my cue from
          N. Katherine Hayles and look to literature. Apparently antithetical to the culture of the
          blurb, literature reveals <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles1999">the complex cultural, social, and representation issues tied up
              with conceptual shifts and technological innovations</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hayles1999" loc="24"/>
               </cit>. Its representational capabilities stem in part from its own status as an evolving
          technology, a point explicitly demonstrated by the continued publication of electronic
          texts and hypertexts and implicitly demonstrated by William Powers in his recent
          bestseller, <title rend="italic">Hamlet’s Blackberry</title>. Literary forms illustrate
          technology’s varied promises to and pitfalls for individuals and the communities to which
          they do and do not belong, but so too does literary content. In science fiction, for
          example, technology often leads to the <quote rend="inline" source="#suvin1972">cognitive estrangement</quote> that
          results in the fragmentation of individuals and the disintegration of their tenuous
          relationships to one another <ptr target="#suvin1972" loc="372"/>. Similarly, <soCalled>systems novels</soCalled> generally
          display technology’s propensity to abet its own out-of control proliferation <ptr target="#mchale2006" loc="175"/>. Ultimately,
          literature’s dependence on and representations of technology and technology’s effects on
          its users make it an ideal medium through which to investigate what network theorists
          Shaviro and Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker describe as the antagonistic quality of
          the network’s rhizomatic structure.</p>
            <p>While it cannot be considered a work of science fiction, a systems novel, or even a text
          straightforwardly concerned with technology, Sherwood Anderson’s modernist pastoral <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> uses the story cycle form to offer an illustration
          of the ambivalent future technology promises. Although seldom considered a contribution to
          any modern comprehension of electronically inflected networks, the text, published in
          1919, features a town poised at a technological divide: its inhabitants look back to their
          agrarian past in which relationships were dependent on proximity and information was
          disseminated by storytelling, but they also look to the specter of the future where
          relationships are more arbitrary and excessive information is routed along the information
          superhighway. The town and townspeople, denied the connections of the past but unable to
          convene as a community of the future, form instead the tenuous connections based on the
          delocalized organization of a nascent network. Unlike today’s seamlessly embedded
          networks, however, the network in <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> serves as a
          stopgap measure; it arises from out of an explicitly liminal space and can only awkwardly
          connect the text’s grotesque forms and deformed bodies. Rather than hailing what will
          serve as the network’s 21st-century iteration, <title rend="italic">Winesburg,
            Ohio</title> warns against the network, suggesting that while it may offer the only
          means by which a community can be connected, that community is not only monstrous and
          deformed, but functions as a trap.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, although Galloway and Thacker claim that the
            <quote rend="inline" source="#galloway2007">the idea of connectivity […] so highly privileged today</quote>
           has <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#galloway2007">only recently attained any level of authority as a dominant diagram
              for mass social organization and control</quote>
                  <ptr target="#galloway2007" loc="26, 15"/>
               </cit>, <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> suggests that the network loomed
          large in modernists’ imaginations. Because the model of community that traverses the
          technological breach in <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> is characterized by
          its awkwardness and lack of refinement, however, the term <soCalled>network</soCalled> may
          be a misleading descriptor. A network cannot help but assume the craftsmanship necessary
          to producing a <soCalled>work of net</soCalled>, and in Anderson’s work, manual
          craftsmanship is relegated to that pre-technological past that Winesburg and its denizens
          no longer inhabit. Accordingly, that community, which exists in the space between the
          past’s emphasis on manual craftsmanship and the future’s emphasis on communicative
          technology, depicts an incipient, not yet fully formed network that might be better termed
          a <soCalled>kluge,</soCalled> an awkward but effective makeshift device that precedes
          technical progression. </p>
            <p>Although Gary Marcus, in <title rend="italic">Kluge: the Haphazard Evolution of the Human
            Mind</title>, has recently revived the concept of the kluge as a helpful metaphor for
          the <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#marcus2008">inelegant — but surprisingly effective</quote>
                  <ptr target="#marcus2008" loc=""/>
               </cit> solutions to the problems constantly encountered by the human mind, the kluge’s
          contemporary meaning is rooted in early computer jargon. J.W. Granholm's parodic guide for
          <quote rend="inline" source="#granholm1962">computer hardware men</quote> in the 1962 publication of <title rend="italic">Datamation</title> popularized the term kluge (or
          <soCalled>kludge</soCalled>) as a word that <quote rend="inline" source="#granholm1962">stands ready...220 VAC
            source.</quote> 
               <quote rend="inline" source="#granholm1962">One of the most beloved words in design
          terminology,</quote> a kluge is an inelegant bricolage, a transitional tool comprised of
          an <quote rend="inline" source="#granholm1962">ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts.</quote>  It
          works, but its unnatural shape and aberrant arrangements <quote rend="inline" source="#granholm1962">form a
          distressing whole</quote> that constantly calls attention to its awkward construction
          and its unlikely usefulness, and likely temporary usefulness <ptr loc="30–32" target="#granholm1962"/>.</p>
            <p>Because kluges — effective and progressive but distressing and ugly — belong to the
          lexicon and job requirement of computer hardware men, they underscore the early and
          anticipatory efforts towards the interconnection and delocalization that characterize
          information systems and models of interconnection and organization. Kluges are especially
          relevant to network technology: indeed, in <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#granholm1962">the lashing together of whole modules of equipment […] the
              opportunity for applied kludgemanship presents itself to the hilt</quote>
                  <ptr target="#granholm1962"/>
               </cit>. In part because <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#granholm1962">the lashing together of whole modules of equipment</quote>
                  <ptr target="#granholm1962"/>
               </cit> aptly describes Anderson’s take on the story cycle form, the kluge provides an
          important emblem for <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>. The term calls
          attention to the transitional and intermediary nature of the vision of community imagined
          in Anderson’s text, but it also supplies a technologically relevant context for
          understanding why the progression towards the networked future can be considered
          monstrous.</p>
            <p>Published before <soCalled>kludge</soCalled> or even <soCalled>network</soCalled> became
          a crucial part of computer glossaries, <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> was
          nonetheless considered by many of its early readers to be a distressing collection of
          interconnected but ill-assorted parts. Its modernist version of the short story cycle
          garnered unfavorable reviews claiming that it was disjointed, that it violated the
          pastoral it appeared to represent, and that it described too vividly the immoral lives of
          America’s provincials. Heywood Broun of the <title rend="italic">New York Tribune</title>,
          for example, argued that Anderson’s work was marred by his apparent obsession with
          neurotics, and an anonymous reviewer for the <title rend="italic">New York World</title>
          hoped that Anderson <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#broun1919">would one day learn to censor his unnecessarily ugly
              stories</quote>
                  <ptr target="#broun1919"/>
               </cit>. Despite such pans, positive reviews welcomed the text as innovative. According to
          these critics, Anderson’s text ushered in a new era for the short story via the new, or
          newly recycled, form of interrelated stories. Writing for <title rend="italic">The New
            Republic</title>, M.A. called <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> a <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#andersonm1919">challenge to the snappy short story form, with its planned

               </cit>,<note>Probably penned by Maxwell Anderson.</note> and H.L Mencken claimed that the

          .</p>
            <p>According to its supportive readers, the ill-assorted parts of <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> were particularly appropriate to narrating modernity’s
          influence on America’s post-industrial small towns. These readers implicitly recognized
          the discontinuity that characterized the twentieth-century’s bifurcated landscape between
          rural and urban America and understood that the story cycle, once a tool used to unify
          disparate poems or tales, could also be used to underscore difference. The story cycle,
          unlike traditional novels, lashes together disconnected and often discordant stories to
          capture what Llewellyn Jones describes in reference to Anderson’s work the <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#jones1919">significant episode[s]</quote>
                  <ptr target="#jones1919"/>
               </cit> that characterize twentieth-century rural America. Indeed, consequent to Jones’s
          description and the widespread influence of <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>,
          the short story cycle came to be accepted as an appropriate means by which to chronicle
          the episodic and seemingly increasingly discontinuous lives of small-town America.</p>
            <p>Although Anderson’s text’s contribution to the story cycle’s modernist resurgence can be
          gauged in part by the story cycles that followed in its wake,<note>Jean Toomer’s Cane,
            Ernest Hemingway’s <title rend="italic">In Our Time</title>, William Faulkner’s <title rend="italic">The Unvanquished</title>, among many others.</note> the text’s mixed
          reviews and its readers’ reactions to the <soCalled>grotesque</soCalled> figures at the
          center of its stories have made the text’s lasting significance (and most all of Sherwood
          Anderson’s other works) a matter of debate.<note>Indeed, as early as 1926 Ernest Hemingway
            parodied Anderson’s oeuvre to dispel critical comparisons to his own craft, and forty
            years later, Susan Sontag called Winesburg, Ohio’s melodrama <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#sontag1966">bad to the point of being laughable</quote>
                     <ptr target="#sontag1966" loc="284"/>
                  </cit>.</note> Today, however, critics such as Robert Dunne, citing the text’s modernist
          revision of a traditional form, seek to redeem Anderson’s work from its increasingly <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#dunne2005">minor […] place within the American canon</quote>
                  <ptr target="#dunne2005"/>
               </cit>. Referencing Robert Spiller’s <title rend="italic">Literary History of the United
            States</title>, Dunne claims that Winesburg, Ohio deserves deeper and more complex
          contemporary interpretations because Anderson <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#dunne2005">‘liberat[ed] the American short story from a petrifying

            <p>Contemporary interest in the text’s emancipatory version of the story cycle, although
          calling for renewed attention to Anderson’s text, overlooks its kinship to a kluge. While

               <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> provides a model of affiliating disconnect individuals who, in an increasingly urban, information-oriented environment, are no longer linked by meaningfully sharing a geographic space or by participating in shared labor with one another. The text therefore merits the contemporary
          critical attention for which Dunne calls, but such attention should focus on the ways in
          which the text’s modernist version of the story cycle anticipates the delocalized and
          therefore highly structured interconnections facilitated by a network. In situating
          Winesburg as less a meaningful geographic space and more a potential hub able to connect
          isolated nodes, the text envisions the social group that can be made to materialize after
          more traditional social groups, such as those formed through shared stakes in a common

          called <title rend="quotes">The Book of the Grotesque.</title> The narrator claims that

          technology, and information do not enable the (implicitly more valuable) kind of communication
          exchanged during the shared, hands-on labor of more traditional communities.</p>
            <p>Before returning to <title rend="quotes">The Book of the Grotesque,</title> it is worth
          pointing out that seventeen years after the publication of Anderson’s text, the same
          information saturation and degradation of meaningful communication functions as the
          subject of Walter Benjamin’s essay <title rend="quotes">The Storyteller</title>. In his
          work, Benjamin describes the process by which “secular productive forces of history”
          outstripped communities that were once defined and held together by the communicable
          experiences of storytellers and the symbiotic relationship between storytellers and
          craftsmen. According to Benjamin, the forces of history contributed to the proliferation
          of information, and because information
            <quote rend="inline" source="#benjamin2002">does not survive the moment in which it was new</quote>, it functions as an insidious
            <quote rend="inline" source="#benjamin2002">form of communication</quote> that

            <p>
               <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>, which separates the past’s meaningful
          communication from the future’s excessive information, anticipates and illustrates
          Benjamin’s analysis. The narrator and Willard, by mediating the grotesques’ modern
          condition, help to provide this illustration. Together, they cast a Janus face over the
          text’s divide: the narrator looks longingly back to a time before the <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#andersons1919">coming of industrialism</quote>
                  <ptr target="#andersons1919"/>
               </cit>, while Willard looks optimistically forward <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="70"/>. Illustrating Benjamin’s trajectory, the narrator’s voice begins <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>. Because, however, he — like the grotesques — cannot
          accommodate the information age he describes, he cedes his storytelling role to Willard.
          As Winesburg’s young journalist, Willard represents the future. Because he looks forward
          to the realization of his dream of becoming an urban reporter, it is the story of his
          departure from Winesburg that ends Anderson’s text.</p>
            <p>Although the entirety of <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> narrates the shift
          from the traditional communication constituted by storytelling to the modern communication
          constituted by informationalism, in <title rend="quotes">The Book of the Grotesque</title>
          that shift is most conspicuous. There, the typological relationship (or
            <soCalled>mythopoetic</soCalled>, in Benjamin Spencer’s words) between the storyteller
          and the master craftsman is revised away from symbiosis and towards division. The
          relationship, which Benjamin in <title rend="quotes">The Storyteller</title> claims
          defines the storytelling age, and its modification in the wake of information’s influx
          augurs the storyteller’s increasingly liminal role in the twentieth century and his
          ultimate replacement by the journalist.</p>
            <p>In <title rend="quotes">The Book of the Grotesque,</title> an exchange between an old
          writer and an inept carpenter the writer hires to fix his bed illustrates the alteration

            <p>The old writer’s unpublished, uncirculated book depends for its expression on the
          narrator, a figure who, standing on the threshold of the text’s technological divide, can
          connect the theme of <title rend="quotes">The Book of the Grotesque</title> to the
          procession of grotesques that constitute Winesburg’s nodes. Yet, as suggested above, the narrator positions himself as part of storytelling’s dying tradition. When he refers to Winesburg as <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#andersons1919">our town</quote>
                  <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="203"/>
               </cit>, he reveals that he, like the grotesques he describes, remains figuratively trapped
          in Winesburg. Additionally, and according to his own account, the narrator also suffers
          from a communicative disability: he is unable to interpret the <cit>

               </cit> into anything approximating a master craft. Although the narrator claims in <title rend="quotes">Hands</title>, the first story following the prologue, that <cit>

               </cit>.</p>
            <p>The narrator’s efforts to overcome the grotesques’ isolation by establishing those links
          that connect them to one another and to Winesburg are undermined by his admission that he
          is more like the grotesques than not. Similar to the depletion of the traditional
          storyteller that follows from the emergence of information as a major mode of
          communication, the narrator is crippled in his effort to link Winesburg to the mode of
          communication he works to illustrate. George Willard, however, offers an antithesis. His
          job as Winesburg’s newspaperman makes him the recorder of the town’s significant episodes
          and enables him to implicitly predict Winesburg’s role in the information age Benjamin
          later identifies and describes.</p>

            Willard’s development proceeds along lines similar to Anderson’s own.</note>
          Unsurprisingly, however, this enables Willard to function as a more useful hub than the
          town itself. Through his work, he ensures that as long as the Winesburg Eagle provides a
          log of the town’s denizens, the grotesques cohere, even if only nominally, into a social
          group and community. Consequently, Edwin Fussell’s argument that Willard can only

            <p>Willard’s occupation in Winesburg ensures that he represents the only figure capable —

          the inadequate storyteller, the failed poet, and the inept craftsman. The journalist,
          opposed to the artisans from whom he descends, trades in the currency of information, that
          which Benjamin suggests is, like the newspaper that features it, imminently disposable.

          way, information, inherently excessive and therefore expendable, disrupts meaningful
          communication by necessitating explanation, clarification, and commentary. While Willard’s
          career aspirations adapt him to this proliferation, the narrator bemoans industrialism’s
          shift towards a culture defined by the information conveyed by a newspapers instead of

            <p>According to <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>’s narrator, the excess of

            <p>Little symbolizes this early picture of information overload so well as that ubiquitous
          city newspaper to which Willard aspires. Today, social media critic Paul Gillin and his
          website newspaperdeathwatch.com attest to the inability of newspapers to compete with
          twenty-first-century information technology’s multiple and immediate distributions of
          data, but in <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> newspapers offer an early
          analogue for the network.<note>In many cases such data is also gratis, the cost of a
            computer and access to a network notwithstanding.</note> Mikhail Bakhtin gestures
          towards this point, although certainly not in relation to Anderson’s text, in <title rend="italic">Problems with Dostoevsky’s Poetics</title>. While Bakhtin examines
          polyvocal discourse,<note>Castellucci Cox argues that analysts have often used polyvocal

          associated with the heteroglossia enabled by networks and hypertexts, his claim that
          newspapers offer <quote rend="inline" source="#castellucci1998">a living reflection of the contradictions of
            contemporary society</quote> invokes the diverse nodes, multiple contexts, and
          transferential accruals of meaning that also characterize the network <ptr target="#castellucci1998" loc="30"/>.<note>See <title rend="italic">The Dialogic
              Imagination</title> and Robert Glenn Howard.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For Bakhtin, the newspaper’s polyvocal discourse demands the reader or user’s active
          participation in the construction of meanings and thus foretells the network’s promise to
          give every user a figurative voice <ptr target="#bakhtin1965" loc="30"/>. In Bakhtin’s
          favorable formulation, newspapers provide and therefore anticipate what Sproull and
          Kiesler describe as the network’s <quote rend="inline" source="#sproull1991">free exchange of
            information,</quote> a forum that both enables and requires discourse and debate.
          Willard, in <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>, is suited to participate in this
          polyvocality: when he adheres to his newspaper’s one policy — recording as many names as
          possible in each newspaper’s issue — he gestures towards his aptitude for making the
          otherwise isolated grotesques assemble into a discourse rendered temporarily meaningful by
          the newspaper’s intermediary record. Notwithstanding Bakhtin's salutary description, however, the early analogue for the network represented by newspapers in <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> offers another instance of a
          kluge. Indeed, aside from Willard and the names he writes on its pages, no other character
          in Anderson’s text appears to contribute to or read the newspaper. <title rend="italic">The Winesburg Eagle</title> does not, therefore, provide a forum for the discourse and
          debate that strengthens interlocutors’ connections; instead, it characterizes the
          connectivity assigned by Anderson to a nascent network by its inability to assemble
          fragmented and otherwise monstrous or distorted individuals into anything more than a
          transitory community. The paper’s apparent departure along with Willard not only suggests
          its transformation into the city newspaper for which Willard hopes to work, but it also
          underscores every newspaper’s temporariness and transience.</p>
            <p>Such impermanence depends on the disposability that makes material the confrontation with
          meaning forced by the newspaper’s trade in excessive information. In Anderson’s text, this
          confrontation extends from Willard’s newspaper to his notepad and to the papers that
          belong to the grotesques. For example, although he carries <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#andersons1919">a
              little pad of paper</quote>
                  <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="106"/>
               </cit> in his
          pocket to record the stories passed on by his sources, Willard accumulates only the
          information that enables him to adhere to his paper’s superficial policy. More
          emphatically, in <title rend="quotes">Paper Pills</title>, the second story following the
          prologue, papers signify the disposability of information and the disarticulation of
          meanings from stories. In <title rend="quotes">Paper Pills</title>, Dr. Reefy writes
          <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#andersons1919">ends of thoughts, beginnings of thoughts</quote>
                  <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="37"/>
               </cit> on scraps of paper
          that he stuffs into his pockets until they become trash. When
          Dr. Reefy takes <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#andersons1919">handfuls of paper balls</quote>
                  <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="36"/>

          his one friend, saying, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#andersons1919">‘this is to confound you, you blithering old

               </cit> he seems to comment on the sentimentality of the expectation
          that papers contain any communicable meaning at all.</p>
            <p>Over time, the doctor, whose name joins a title indicative of health with a surname
          indicative of disease (
            <q>reef</q>

                  <ptr target="#oed"/>
               </cit>), has become unable to communicate his thoughts: meaningless to others and to
          himself, his words, in his pockets, harden into rubbish.<note>Although Dr. Reefy finally
            unravels the scraps to, read to his wife, he afterwards crumbles them, <cit>

            a year after their marriage <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="38"/>. He constitutes one
            of Winesburg’s nodes, but Dr. Reefy adds neither his voice nor his thoughts to its
            network.</note> Although the paper Willard carries in the form of the notepad in his own
          pocket suggests Willard’s adaptability to the future’s information age and therefore
          appears in contrast to Dr. Reefy’s disposable scraps, Willard’s newspaper (which does not
          attempt to tell its readers Dr. Reefy’s indescribable thoughts) functions instead as a
          similar symbol of superfluity. Expirable and daily consigned to scraps, the newspaper’s
          relevance must be renewed every day.</p>
            <p>The grotesques’ disposable papers, which oppose the old writer’s absent and unpublished
          book in <title rend="quotes">The Book of the Grotesque</title>, indicate the superfluity
          that makes communication meaningless in an information age and finds representation not
          only in these needless papers, but also in the needless appendages attached to the
          grotesques’ bodies. As indicated above, because it claims among its many meanings both 
            <q>distortion</q>
           (
            <q>twisted out of shape</q>) and 
            <q>exaggeration</q>
           (
            <q>heaping or piling up</q>
          ), the word 
            <q>grotesque</q> assumes the negative inflections of excess <ptr target="#oed"/>. Accordingly, the grotesques are marked
          as such by a corporeal mutation that indicates their collective inability to adapt to
          technological progression. The superfluity of hands in <title rend="italic">Winesburg,
            Ohio</title>, for example, suggests the grotesques’ failure to navigate informational excess. As
          disconnected from meaning as those papers they write upon, hands distort the grotesques
          and disable them from offering more than empty gestures.</p>
            <p>The meaningless of those hands engaged in producing a meaningless record of information
          is embedded in the text at a semantic level: <soCalled>hand</soCalled> or
            <soCalled>hands</soCalled> appears 201 times in this 224-page text. Unsurprisingly
          however, given the community’s distance from its traditional agrarian past, few — if any —
          of these hands can be described as participating in significant craft or construction.

               </note> Willard’s notepad consequently anticipates both the place of the
          newspaper, for which it functions as precursor, and the activity hands occupy in the
          information-centric future of a post-industrial America. He replaces the narrator’s
          self-proclaimed clumsy effort at poetry with an urban journalism that depends on the
          ability to assemble the fragments — in the sense of broken and isolated pieces — from
          which newsworthy information springs.</p>
            <p>It is with this handiwork that Willard reenacts and reinterprets the grotesque’s
          inarticulate gestures. In filling his pad, Willard’s hands suggests both the hands that
          create the newspaper’s bylines and anticipates the hands that leaf through the newspaper’s
          pages and enable their reader to see the network of polyvocal babble on the page and
          therefore read the discordant conversations that constitute the community the newspaper
          obliquely represents. In this manner, while <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>
          laments the disappearance of the craftsman’s skilled hands and the hands that work the
          soil in rural communities (as well as the corollary disappearance of the gestures that
          once augmented a story’s meaning), Willard’s hands act out an entirely new set of tactile
          activities. In fact, Willard’s hands assemble a kluge: while Anderson’s text indicates the
          newspaper offers a poor substitute for community, the newspaper to which Willard
          contributes does fill the void that traditional communities have left. Signifying a
          perhaps distressingly ugly technological progression, the newspaper also functions as the
          network’s early analogue: it anticipates the <quote rend="inline" source="#shaviro2003">physical
            experience</quote> of the computer whereby the continual movement of fingers and hands
          extend not the ear (even the prosthetic ear Willard offers), as a poet or traditional
          storyteller would have it, but the eye <ptr target="#shaviro2003" loc="6–7"/>.</p>
            <p>Its representation of the grotesques as both excessive and necessary to the future
          indicates that <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> remains profoundly ambivalent
          about the concept of community it ultimately represents. Their interpolation into the
          expendable present signified by Willard’s notepad ensures a community but the community is
          transient, made only temporarily meaningful by the newspaper’s disposable immediacy and
          poised to become even more isolated and irrelevant as a result of Willard’s departure.
          Without this kind of kluge, however, the 
            <quote rend="inline" source="#ingram1971">gesturing figures, […] fragmented people, [and] <soCalled>unused

          connectivity <ptr target="#ingram1971" loc="n. 20, 151"/> that makes them embody Shaviro’s
          description of the network’s <soCalled>Leibnizean paradox</soCalled> whereby those in the

               <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>, which begins with an unfinished map
          (illustrated by Harald Toksvig for the book’s first edition) that features unfinished
          streets and undelineated boundaries, suggests that <title rend="italic">Winesburg,
            Ohio</title> is, like a network, a place that is no place.<note>Critical comparison to
            Anderson’s hometown of Clyde, Ohio notwithstanding.</note> Yet the nascent network named
          by Winesburg constitutes a trap. In fact (and in spite of Willard’s narrative status),
          neither the narrator nor Willard affects a complete escape from <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title>’s grotesquerie.<note>Nor is it completely clear that the
            narrator and Willard are not themselves grotesques.</note> Willard departs Winesburg in
          the last story, but the train conductor notes that <soCalled>a thousand George
            Willards</soCalled> have already undertaken his journey. He may have outgrown Winesburg and
            <q>become taller than his father</q>, but Willard has not
          appreciably advanced in intelligence, <q>one looking at him would not
            have thought him particularly smart.</q> Even the commencement of Willard’s journey
          is thwarted when he glances out the train and sees <q>the train […]
            still in Winesburg.</q> He departs, but as he does so he thinks not of his future,
          but of the <q>Turk Smollet […] Butch Wheeler [….] Helen White.</q>
          Ostensibly <q>a background on which to paint the dreams of his
            manhood,</q> Winesburg, in the form of the names still written in his notebook,
          attends Willard’s escape.<note>In <title rend="italic">Images of Idiocy</title>, Martin
            Halliwell claims that Sherwood Anderson views everyone as possessing a grotesque quality
            and <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#halliwell2004">sees the antidote to it in communal compassion and
                sympathy</quote>
                     <ptr target="#halliwell2004" loc="163"/>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the grotesques of <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> — in their
          implicit sickness and their unboundedness from geography — illustrate the meaninglessness
          of <soCalled>escape</soCalled> and point to the pervasiveness of the network <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> implicitly critiques.<note>The sickness the
            grotesques carry may indeed be the sickness of nostalgia, which, according to the OED,
            can be <quote rend="inline" source="#oed">regarded as a medical condition.</quote>
               </note> The network
          brings the outside in and makes intimate what is otherwise distant; it, like Winesburg,
          captures users, making their <quote rend="inline" source="#shaviro2003">escape […] nearly impossible</quote> 
               <ptr target="#shaviro2003" loc="4"/>. It is consequently no accident that Willard’s
          incomplete flight from Winesburg merely reenacts the other grotesques’ attempts.<note>Most
            notably Elmer Cowley who beats up Willard before <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#andersons1919">[s]pringing aboard a passing train</quote>
                     <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="201"/>
                  </cit>
               </note>. Indeed, Willard, like all of the grotesques, returns to Winesburg if only
          by virtue of the fact the narrator calls forth and connects their stories <ptr target="#andersons1919" loc="204"/>.</p>
            <p>If, as Shaviro argues, the modern conception of the network is a system whose <quote rend="inline" source="#shaviro2003">shape</quote> depends on <quote rend="inline" source="#shaviro2003">the force of all the
            messages, as they accrete over time</quote> 
               <ptr target="#shaviro2003" loc="24"/>, the
          shape of <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> — formed by proliferating papers on
          which nothing of lasting meaning can be written and superfluous hands clumsily failing to
          engage in a new kind of labor — is the shape of a kluge. Although it is also appropriate
          to describe the network connected in Anderson’s narrative in terms of the grotesque and
          its denotation of unnatural, odd, or distorted shapes, <soCalled>grotesque</soCalled>
          hearkens back to an older form (<quote rend="inline" source="#oed">grottesca,</quote>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#oed">‘a kinde of rugged vnpolished [sic] painters worke, anticke
            worke’</quote>), while a kluge both underscores the technology that yokes Winesburg to
          the information age, via the newspaper as an analogue of the network, and represents the
          accidentally-integrative role the urban journalist serves in the temporary communities he
          defines <ptr target="#oed"/>.</p>
            <p>Similar to the prologue’s badly-fixed, but nonetheless story-inspiring bed, a kluge
          emphasizes the awkward transition from a pre-technological past, rich in tangible
          connections and endemic identity, to a hyper-connected, networked future. Accordingly, the
          grotesques upon which the text centers are the awkward and alienated casualties of the
          post-industrial rise of information that makes the networks to come both necessary and
          inevitable. While the network ultimately envisioned in <title rend="italic">Winesburg,
            Ohio</title> provides a stopgap measure that kluges together an unraveling community,
          the bandage affixed to the site of its communicative disease provides only temporary
          relief and does not enable restorative progression. Rather than celebrating the network’s
            <soCalled>heroic tones</soCalled> and <soCalled>countercultural ideology</soCalled>
          (despite its militaristic roots), the grotesques in <title rend="italic">Winesburg,
            Ohio</title> embody a lamentation for information’s pervasiveness and the corollary
          degradation of more meaningful communication <ptr target="#castells2004" loc="354"/>.
          Consequently, while <title rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</title> suggests that the
          transition to the network as a dominant mode of contemporary organization is ugly, sick,
          and distressing, it also suggests that the transition is inevitable. An emblem of this
          transition, Willard transforms the old writer in <title rend="quotes">The Book of the
            Grotesque</title>: carrying uncannily close at hand the fragments of Winesburg, Willard
          redefines the meaning of a viral journalist to indicate the diseased nodes and alienated
          circuitry that enables the network’s connectivity.</p>
