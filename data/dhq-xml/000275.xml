                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p> The field of humanities has now grown into a digital environment challenging
                    educators and scholars to create, manipulate, and curate data for research and
                    instruction. The humanities is faced with a digital medium that is changing the
                    way scholars conduct their exploration of research. This study encourages the
                    examination of imagery through qualitative coding, or annotation, to reveal
                    themes and visual stories to further unravel the layers of a visual object.
                    Images from the work of 1960s pop artists James Rosenquist and Roy Lichtenstein
                    were evaluated using ATLAS.ti to determine common themes, visual stories, and
                    aesthetic differences. Qualitative coding is usually associated with textual
                    data, but using a software analysis tool such as ATLAS.ti can centralize the
                    collection of data to efficiently code imagery, text, audio, and video. This
                    case study will be used to introduce researchers, faculty, and students to
                    qualitative analysis tools and the usefulness of coding to reveal themes in
                    imagery. Furthermore, librarians have an opportunity to facilitate the learning
                    of these tools in combination with the various proprietary and open access image
                    databases housed in the library.</p>

                <p>For librarians looking to strengthen connections with the humanities faculty they
                    serve, introducing educators and researchers to the benefits of investigating
                    data can uncover themes and connections within their research interests. Data or
                        <soCalled>Big Data</soCalled> is solely not just for the STEM fields. The
                    humanities is rich with textual, audio, video, and image data that can be
                    harnessed for in-depth evaluation through qualitative methods. Digital archives
                    of images are now at our fingertips and can be more easily explored for
                    scholarly research. Medina states, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#medina2015">It is expected that the explosion
                            of Big Data will contribute to a radical transformation of Arts and Art
                            history research, analysis and practice</quote>
                        <ptr target="#medina2015" loc="19"/>
                    </cit>. As librarians who promote image resources, we can facilitate and
                    encourage the usage of image data that many students do not know is available
                    through existing digital libraries and collections. </p>
                <p>Images are constantly projected in every aspect of life. Understanding the
                    contextual properties of imagery can provide essential analytical skills in
                    deciphering the meaning and messages hidden within the underlying details.
                    Barich and Kotler state, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#barich1991">We use the term
                                <soCalled>image</soCalled> to represent the sum of beliefs,
                            attitudes, and impressions that a person or group has of an object. The
                            impressions may be true or false, real or imagined. Right or wrong,
                            images guide and shape behavior</quote>

                    </cit>. Images communicate and resonate with the viewer on a basic, affective
                    level. Determining how images affect us at primary level can be difficult <ptr
                        target="#winters2014"/>. Qualitative analysis can be used to address this
                    difficulty by dissecting the flattened layers of an image. Various techniques
                    and computational analysis allow the viewer to rethink the identity, purpose,
                    use, and substance of objects. The observer can ask questions about production
                    history, style, and technique at a micro and macro level beyond traditional
                    analysis <ptr target="#drucker2013"/>.</p>
                <p>Paintings and artwork that have traditionally been viewed in person have engaged
                    a new frontier through digitization and electronic surrogates. Manovich
                    explains, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#manovich2001">In contrast to old media where

                <head>Grounded Theory, Visual Grounded Theory, and Image Coding</head>
                <p>Coding enables the researcher to apply notations to qualitative data to reveal
                    themes and stories. Pre-determined codes can be utilized to assist a researcher
                    with coding data sets, or researchers can code through grounded theory,
                    discovering theory from data <ptr target="#glaser1999"/>. Example data sets can
                    consist of text, numbers, images, audio, and video. A grounded theory approach
                    to data allows content to direct emerging findings and theories <ptr
                        target="#liebenberg2012"/>. Code lists can establish pre-determined themes
                    and assumptions to be applied to data. This can be problematic if the data does
                    not yield results towards these pre-established codes. Selecting data for an
                    established category or property can hinder the generation of new categories due
                    to effort being concentrated on data selection. Emergent categories, or open
                    coding, are generally checked for ongoing relevance and meaning against the
                    data, and tend to be the best fit <ptr target="#glaser1999"/>
                    <ptr target="#boeije2010"/>. The researcher can discover and interpret the
                    images while simultaneously defining the codes as the data presents itself.</p>
                <p>Visual grounded theory relies on visual data for constructing categories,
                    describing properties and generating/constructing theoretical hypotheses <ptr
                        target="#konecki2011"/>. Analyzing iconography can <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#howells2009">reveal ideological alignments
                            that demonstrate how images may serve as culture icons – windows into a
                            social world or historical moment that offer insightful evidentiary
                            value for social and historical explanation</quote>
                        <ptr target="#howells2009" loc="9"/>
                    </cit>. Using images as visual data to decipher meaning or to look at the layers
                    of an image for insight into an artist’s work, can greatly assist with viewing
                    imagery through a more critical approach.</p>
                <p>There have been very few studies analyzing imagery with ATLAS.ti. Two studies in
                    the last 5 years reviewed travel blogs and tourism photos using the qualitative
                    analysis software, ATLAS.ti. In 2011, Li and Wang reviewed travel blogs
                    pertaining to tourism in China analyzing the <soCalled>destination
                        image,</soCalled> the visual component when marketing travel vacations to
                    international tourists. This study reviewed written entries to determine the
                    tourists’ perception of the images they saw and how their behavior was
                    influenced by depictions of a location. This study assigned 125 individual codes
                    grouped into 10 categories (or code families) to travel blog entries. They
                    notated positive and negative comments, revealing positive themes towards
                    museums and historic sites versus negative responses to local infrastructure and
                    transportation. </p>
                <p>Pan, Lee, and Tsai conducted a study using 145 photos published in The New York
                    Times Travel Section <title rend="quotes">Why We Travel</title> from 2008 to
                    2012. The authors evaluated the images <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#pan2013">quantitatively through content
                            analysis and qualitatively through semiotic analysis</quote>
                        <ptr target="#pan2013" loc="61"/>
                    </cit>
                    <ptr target="#albers1988"/>. Through coding the images and accompanying captions
                    with ATLAS.ti, the researchers found that 54% of the photo suppliers were male
                    and 46% were female. Coupled with <term>WordStat</term>, a text analysis module,
                    they were able to determine emotional connections attributed to the photos based
                    on context of the photo poster’s caption. They utilized positive and negative
                    connotations to describe the photos. Pan et al. found that 28% of the photos
                    were arousing, 28% pleasant, 21% relaxing, 17% exciting, 2% distressing, 2%
                    unpleasant, 1% gloomy, and 1% sleepy. Their intent was to understand the
                    connection between tourism, motivated by emotional interpretation, and the
                    destination image. These studies are of interest because they utilized
                    qualitative analysis software to encode and decipher the connection between the
                    human eye and an emotional response towards an image. </p>

                <head>Image Set</head>
                <p>For this study, an image set of 40 paintings were curated from the work of Roy
                    Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist. The image set was curated to experiment with
                    the various tools and coding abilities of the software. The images selected are
                    reproductions and originated from ARTstor and various monographs focusing on
                    each artist and their work in the 1960s. Twenty images representing each
                    artist’s work during the Pop Art era were curated and ingested into ATLAS.ti.
                    The Pop Art era was compromised of artists creating work from the late 1950s to
                    1970. Lawrence Alloway coined the phrase <soCalled>Pop</soCalled> in 1958 to
                    describe the movement to and enjoyment of mass-culture. The artwork during this
                    time distinctly resembled the <soCalled>effects</soCalled> and
                        <soCalled>artefacts</soCalled> of mass-culture. The artists who produced
                    work that tended to reflect popular, gimmicky, or glamourous subject matter that
                    appealed to mass audiences <ptr target="#shanes2009"/>. </p>
                <p>Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997) came on the Pop Art scene in the 1960s with his
                    comic-strips and iconic Ben-Day dot screens reflective of commercial printing
                        <ptr target="#vanwyk2013"/>. His work during this movement was influenced by
                    commercial art, war-time imagery, and romance, but lacked the innocence of his
                    contemporaries such as James Rosenquist, Andy Warhol, and Claus Oldenburg <ptr
                        target="#tomkins1988"/>. Some of his imagery did lean towards the consumer
                    culture with <title rend="italic">Hotdog</title> (1963), <title rend="italic"
                        >Sponge II</title> (1962), and <title rend="italic">Trigger Finger</title>
                    (1963). His later work explored his versions of Picasso, Cezanne, and Monet. </p>
                <p>James Rosenquist (1933 - ) is best known for his large sized artwork portraying
                    illustrations of politics, celebrity, and consumerism in society in the 1960s.
                    As a former billboard painter in the 1950s, Rosenquist depicted movie stills
                    featuring Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, and products such as Coca Cola,
                    larger than twenty-five feet high. The skill to scale his work up translated
                    into his paintings when transitioning to an artist. As Rosenquist was finding
                    his inspiration post billboards, he recognized that disrupting the picture plane
                    by creating images so large that they would overwhelm the viewer, might push
                    outward towards the onlooker <ptr target="#rosenquist2009"/>. His work developed
                    through collecting images from magazines, advertisements, and photographic
                    reproductions pinned on his studio walls. As he utilized his background in
                    billboard advertising plus social and political imagery, his early work
                    coincided with the Pop Art movement. Notable work includes <title rend="italic"
                        >Marilyn Monroe</title> (1962), <title rend="italic">President Elect</title>
                    (1960-61), and <title rend="italic">Two Spaghetti </title>(1963). As time
                    progressed his work became more distinct and his methods broader as he continues
                    his work today <ptr target="#hopps2003"/>.</p>

                <head>A Study to Code Images in ATLAS.ti</head>
                <p><ref target="http://atlasti.com/product/features/">ATLAS.ti</ref> is powerful
                    computer-aided qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) with the benefit of
                    tracing and documenting the analysis process that can be modified within the
                    software <ptr target="#friese2014"/>. This software can be used to assist the
                    researcher in developing themes, stories, and visual attributes through
                    qualitative notation. The efficiency of the software allows the researcher to
                    curate images, text, and audio in one virtual environment. The interface
                    provides the researcher with a left hand document pane to retrieve the image and
                    a right hand pane to display coding. Up to four document panes can be displayed
                    side by side to analyze images. Large image files are unnecessary for use in ;
                    Freise suggests that 1024 x 768 pixels is sufficient for getting started. Drop
                    down menus are provided across the tool bar to access documents (images),
                    quotes, codes, and memos. </p>
                <p>The program also allows the data curator to store notes, citations, and
                    additional documents to complement the coding analysis and categorization of
                    codes. ATLAS.ti uses the hermeneutic unit (HU) to capture the researcher’s
                    project files. The HU is the researcher’s project within the ATLAS.ti
                    environment <ptr target="#solutions4u"/>. This includes the actual data or
                    documents ingested through ATLAS.ti, in addition to memos, notations, and codes.
                    The data sets are stored locally on the researcher’s own hard drive, but
                    ATLAS.ti can quickly generate the content into the navigation panes. This tool
                    can assist a researcher in complex data interpretation and provide a
                    comprehensive environment to create and curate image sets. </p>

                <head>Themes Revealed</head>
                <p>ATLAS.ti was utilized to reveal themes and compare image codes against the set of
                    images. In this study, 98 individual codes were created based on the visual
                    interpretation by the researcher and the paintings’ attributes observed from a
                    two-dimensional standpoint. Applying visual grounded theory allows the paintings
                    to reveal intricacies through in-depth observation. Static images appear to be
                    flat, but upon further investigation they change when the eye sees more after
                    continuous viewings <ptr target="#elkins1997"/>. Identifying the richness and
                    vitality in imagery does not have to yield to interpreting the image, but can
                    contribute to unfolding the surface area of experience <ptr target="#marks2002"/>
                    <ptr target="#rose2012"/>. Examining the visual brushstrokes of a painting can
                    be beneficial to interpreting and researching artwork. </p>
                <p>The 98 codes identified during the image investigation manifested from visual
                    observation and visual grounded theory techniques. The researcher drew upon
                    their personal familiarity with the artist and observed attributes from the data
                    set of paintings. Additionally, the following observational techniques and
                    questions adapted from Charmaz were used to review the image set <ptr
                        target="#charmaz2014" loc="53"/>:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>What is the purported purpose of this image?</item>
                    <item>How was the image produced? How is the image constructed?</item>
                    <item>Who was the image intended for? Who is the audience?</item>
                    <item>How does the image reflect the artist’s/artists’ assumptions?</item>
                    <item>What is the structure of the image, and which categories can you discern
                        from the image?</item>
                    <item>Does the image reflect social, historical, or organizational
                        contexts?</item>
                    <item>Are there unintended/intended information and meanings in the
                        image?</item>
                    <item>What kind of comparisons can you make between images?</item>
                </list>
                <p>Using Charmaz’s observational questions, a series of codes were developed and
                    applied to the image set by assessing each image individually. With grounded
                    theory, the researcher is invited to observe and code based on their own
                    personal interpretation, allowing the data to dictate the code. As a former
                    student in the fine arts, prior knowledge of the painting techniques,
                    attributes, and context of these two artists were applied to the coding process.
                    The medium for each artwork was captured from the paintings’ description. For
                    undergraduate students, who may not have expertise or past knowledge of an
                    image, pursuing the coding through a combination of visual first impressions
                    (coding for color, object, and weight of line) and scholarly research would be
                    appropriate as an assignment. </p>
                <p>An example of the software analyzing the image, <title rend="italic"
                        >Necktie</title>, is demonstrated below <ptr target="#rosenquist1961"/>.
                    This representation illustrates the ability to select portions of an image and
                    continually code and even overlap codes if needed by the researcher. The right
                    hand side of the image displays the codes. The researcher simply right clicks
                    the image and the coding option appears in a quick links drop down list. The
                        <soCalled>Open Coding</soCalled> option allows the researcher to create
                    codes as they review the image. Once a code is developed, the researcher can
                    easily continue to select the same code from one image to the next within the
                    Coding tool, under <soCalled>Select Codes(s) from List.</soCalled> A box is
                    drawn on the selected area of the image, and then a new or existing code can be
                    identified and attached. </p>

                <p>The individual image codes were developed through grounded theory techniques
                    using the researcher’s knowledge of the images in context of technique and
                    societal impact, the painting processes, and the information provided by the
                    artist. This exercise can be described as <soCalled>aesthetic

                <p>ATLAS.ti controls multiple codes and themes by allowing the researcher to
                    categorize codes by shared similarities into Code Families. The researcher can
                    evaluate their initial coding and then disperse the individual codes into
                    overarching themed categories. Code occurrences are tabulated based on the
                    number of applications of the codes applied to the images; a quantitative
                    representation of the coding analysis. The Code Manger below demonstrates the
                    categorization of creating code families. Individual codes are created first
                    through initial evaluation and interpretation of the images. Then the researcher
                    can determine similarities and differences by grouping the single codes into
                    complementary Code Families. The Code Manager also provides the code
                    occurrences, or number of times the single code was used in the evaluation of
                    the image set. </p>
                <p>Further interpretation and distribution of codes revealed eight code families,
                    categorizing the 98 individual codes in Table 1. The individual codes were
                    evaluated for common themes and trends to develop the following code families
                    based on similarities. A definition follows each code family. </p>

                <p>In both graphs, <soCalled>Objects</soCalled> has the highest frequency for
                    representing the most individual codes developed and applied to the image set.
                        <soCalled>Objects</soCalled> was created as a code family to include the
                    myriad of common household or environmental items depicted in Lichtenstein and
                    Rosenquist’s work, such as a stool, spoon, or food. In Figure 4,
                        <soCalled>Color/Hue</soCalled> was coded in 61 occurrences, which
                    demonstrates how a researcher can record the precise variations of color in a
                    painting through qualitative software, although with reproductions of artwork
                    the integrity of the medium can be limiting as a digital copy.
                        <soCalled>Artist</soCalled> is verification that a total of 40 images were
                    used based on two artists artwork. The codes for <soCalled>Material</soCalled>
                    were gathered from the descriptions of the images themselves. These descriptions
                    generally accompany the images when printed in a monograph or digitally
                    reproduced. The codes for <soCalled>Material</soCalled> included 16 individual
                    codes applied to 40 images. <soCalled>Famous Figures</soCalled>, like
                        <soCalled>Objects</soCalled>, are the actual presence of celebrities or
                    politicians, people in society that are recognizable which accounted for six
                    individual codes that only occurred once in the image set.
                        <soCalled>Gender</soCalled> was interpreted as a masculine or feminine theme
                    based on societal norms in the art work understood by the author.
                        <soCalled>Gender</soCalled> was noted in 22 code occurrences and
                        <soCalled>Social Context</soCalled> was present in 33 code occurrences.</p>
                <p>The Query tool allows the researcher to compare and contrast the differences,
                    similarities, and themes within their data to quantify observational
                    categorizations. The researcher can visually display the semantic relationships
                    between codes, memos, and documents utilizing the Network tool. Memos, another
                    feature, are essential to maintaining notes, research, and citations alongside
                    the qualitative data set. Memoing creates a paper trail for analytical process
                    as well as documenting research decisions and rationales for making those
                    decisions along the way. Digitizing, mapping, and keeping everything on file
                    assists with organizing research content <ptr target="#clarke2015"/>. An example
                    of the Query Tool is below with the codes that originated from this image set. </p>

                <p>Through this tool, the images in the set were evaluated and categorized on a more
                    granular level and recorded based on visual first impressions. Comparing
                    individual codes in the Query Tool, revealed that seven images created by
                    Rosenquist contained consumerism. The depiction of an open mouth was present in
                    13 images in total amongst the two artists. A masculine or feminine theme was
                    present in 22 images collectively by Lichtenstein and Rosenquist. The Kennedy
                    family was prominent in two of the images under the code family <soCalled>Famous
                        Figures</soCalled>. These visual observations can assist students when
                    theorizing the purpose and intention of the painting. These artworks may have
                    been viewed in a different context when first presented to patrons in the 1960s,
                    but modern day observation will inevitably be seen through the eyes of a
                    different generation. These are but a few examples of how combining a powerful
                    tool can assist with visual research and discovering the extensive context of an
                    image. </p>

                <head>Impact for Humanities Scholars, Researchers, &amp; Students</head>
                <p>The next step for researchers is to utilize this data to draw conclusions on the
                    two artists investigated through this study, or through their own study of
                    selected imagery. For instance, Rosenquist’s work encompasses the 1960’s era and
                    portrays images of political personas and common everyday household objects.
                    Lichtenstein similarly utilized objects native to consumerism and depicted
                    iconic cartoon characters. How is this different from a traditional visual
                    inspection of artwork? Observing artwork in person is the ideal method of
                    inspection, but in less urban university settings, reproductive surrogates can
                    be a more than satisfactory substitute. As art history courses are taken online
                    for distance education, this method of research can be useful for students
                    studying outside of a physical classroom. Adapting the art history curriculum
                    beyond physical engagement to include virtual observational and qualitative
                    analysis not only introduces the students to digital images, but also to an
                    analytic process to evaluate the objects. Through using a qualitative analysis
                    tool, scholars, researchers, and students can develop a new technical skill set
                    and utilize the expansive image archives available via web or through the
                    library’s databases to analyze imagery. </p>

                <head>Implications of Study</head>
                <p>This study allows for alternative methods of analysis and engagement with image
                    collections. As libraries subscribe to proprietary image collections or develop
                    archives from digitized collections, combining a qualitative data analysis tool
                    with digital images can allow for increased engagement in or out of the
                    classroom. Padilla attributes unusable interfaces as a barrier to manipulating
                    humanities data. Library interfaces are generally geared towards engaging with
                    data through page turners and image zooming designed towards a single item <ptr
                        target="#padilla2016"/>. Many digital image collections only offer the
                    object or image as a surrogate to the original, but utilizing a qualitative
                    analysis software can enhance the experience the student has with the object.
                    Similar to the artist critique in the studio classroom, students potentially can
                    engage with their instructor on the constructs and attributes of an image set
                    selected for an assignment. Students can develop and critically assess an image
                    through a method of visual exploration and one word or short phrase coding to
                    collect and consolidate their image notations. These image notations can then be
                    used to write detailed analyses of the artwork or images. Instead of viewing the
                    image as one flattened file, the exercise is progressed to strip the layers and
                    construction of the digital image apart for greater critical thinking and
                    analysis. Instructors can engage students in discussion on their interpretations
                    of the artwork, rather than assume the students’ opinions and interpretations
                    are concurrent with established opinion. Critical discourse can be applied to
                    expand students’ perceptions through analysis and evaluation, rather than
                    popular opinion <ptr target="#leshnoff1995"/>. </p>
                <p>Lazo and Smith conducted a small study to assess how 17 year old students could
                    develop critical thinking skills through images. Teachers and students were
                    selected purposively for this study, with one teacher stating, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#lazo2014">We look at images to create a
                            foundation, analysing stylistic approaches, intentions and meanings.
                            Then students can springboard from that to really create their … own
                            language through a broad range of visual arts making</quote>
                        <ptr target="#lazo2014" loc="103"/>
                    </cit>. The curriculum encouraged a student-centered model, allowing the student
                    participants to brainstorm self-selected subject matter and develop their own
                    artistic creations through writing and hands-on assemblage. The learning
                    environment was created to encourage exploration and discourse despite students’
                    unfamiliarity with the images, processes, or artworks. The results revealed that
                    students took a deeper look at the image as a creator and as the viewer,
                    thinking more critically about the formal principles and the philosophy behind
                    creating an image. </p>
                <p>As evidenced by Lazo and Smith’s study, imagery was contextualized to determine
                    the implications for critical thinking in a visually enriched curriculum-based
                    environment. In combination with a qualitative analysis tool to propel students
                    into a virtual environment to categorize and assess imagery, analysis of visual
                    elements, principles, and the perceptions through the eyes of the creator or
                    artist can be investigated. Francis Alter describes students as autonomous
                    thinkers when evaluating artwork. Alter argues, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#alter2011">…there is an expectation that
                            students will seek reasons for, and provide evidence to support, their
                            own response to art</quote>
                        <ptr target="#alter2011" loc="12"/>
                    </cit>. Since some students may not have access to the original artwork hanging
                    in a museum, digital surrogates of the artist’s work are more easily obtainable
                    through museum websites, databases, or localized digital collections. </p>

                <p>Digitization of imagery, text, audio, and video has allowed for a wider reach of
                    participation and engagement between patrons and online collections. Databases
                    such as <title rend="italic">Artstor Digital Library</title> have provided
                    endless digital image collection in humanities, performing arts, fine arts, plus
                    a wide scope of content in sciences, technology, and industry. In addition to
                    proprietary content, archives, museums, and libraries have digitized collections
                    and made them freely accessible online. The Library of Congress provides the
                        <ref target="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/">Prints &amp; Photographs Online
                        Catalog (PPOC)</ref> with a broad range of popular prints, drawings, and

                    also has digitized over 600,000 items from their collection for public use.
                    Museums have also provided online access to collections for more interactivity
                    with patrons through the web. <ref

                    online entry into the vaults of libraries, museums, and archives, educators can
                    utilize the vast quantity of digitized collections as a curriculum source for
                    teaching. Coupled with qualitative analysis software, the student can work

                <head>Coding to Encoding Images</head>
                <p>The author’s study to analyze and categorize attributes from a curated data set
                    of Rosenquist and Lichtenstein paintings is similar to notation and markup when
                    coding and encoding images in a digital environment. Many universities and
                    research centers are developing their own digital repositories from physical
                    collections transformed into digital surrogates. Green and Courtney conducted a
                    qualitative study with humanities faculty members on their perceptions and use
                    of digital collections to inform <ref target="http://www.projectbamboo.org/"
                        >Project Bamboo</ref>. The researchers found faculty were most concerned
                    with the following functionalities when utilizing a digital image collection:
                    downloading capabilities, editing tools, metadata, usability and user-friendly
                    interfaces, and searchability. Specifically, Green and Courtney found that there
                    was a greater need for annotation and editing tools. The authors found that, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#green2015">three core areas of need emerged:
                            tools and analysis, content, and search/discovery and

                    </cit>. These results attest that better metadata and coding are needed for
                    increased accessibility and usability for faculty utilizing digital collections
                    for research. The introductory process of image analysis through ATLAS.ti and
                    other qualitative software could be used as a preliminary
                        <soCalled>springboard</soCalled> and data set to inform markup and metadata
                    of digital image collections. </p>
                <p>Several researchers have developed or experimented with tools to analyze and
                    assess imagery in a more meaningful and digitally accessible way. Martin Holmes

                    </note> to annotate and select areas for classification. His tool is designed
                    for novices with little experience that require XML files for image markup. The
                        <title rend="italic"><ref target="http://hyperimage.ws/en/">Hyper Image
                            Virtual Research Environment</ref></title> is a toolkit that focuses on

                        target="#kuper2014"/>. In addition to textual annotations, similar to coding
                    in ATLAS.ti, this toolkit allows links and external URLs to be created in the
                    analysis process. The software supports linking one image to external data.
                    Kuper and Loebel are exploring the implications for art and art history
                    scholarship, and how this tool can enhance the images context. Planned
                    enhancements include standardized XML format for archiving and processing. </p>
                <p>Rath conducted a study to evaluate whether <ref
                        target="http://tamsys.sourceforge.net/">TAMS (Text Analysis Markup System)
                        Analyzer</ref> and Viewshare were viable tools for data sharing and creation
                    for digital humanities scholarship <ptr target="#rath2016"/>. She found that
                    coding text, images, and video-based files with open source TAMS Analyzer was
                    comparable to other proprietary qualitative analysis software. She concurred
                    that using a qualitative analysis tool, like TAMS Analyzer, supported learning
                    new tools, developing management and workflow strategies for coding projects,
                    and sharing knowledge between the librarian, faculty, and students. Could this
                    exercise then be translated into image encoding into digital collections? The
                    next steps for these tools may be whether they are useful introductions for
                    faculty and students to experience and <soCalled>play</soCalled> with coding
                    data before leaping into a digital collection platform. Unfamiliarity with
                    digital tools and computer coding languages could prompt a dissuasion towards
                    participating in a digital collection project. Qualitative analysis tools could
                    be a useful introductory tool to introduce and provide a low-risk setting for
                    scholars to experiment with coding imagery. </p>

                <p>After studying non-textual data for this case study, my intent is to create
                    workshops to introduce and highlight qualitative research tools to humanities
                    faculty and students on the Texas A&amp;M campus. Beyond workshops, engaging in
                    a research study with a Humanities discipline instructor locally or at another
                    institution, would be ideal to trial image data combined with qualitative coding
                    software in a physical or online classroom setting. Engaging in qualitative data
                    analysis will provide new skillsets that enhance faculty vitas and student
                    resumes for the ever-changing job market. Students will be able to demonstrate
                    the curation of images and utilization of image databases through qualitative
                    research and coding. The evaluation of images for research can be used for
                    criticism, interpretation, and revealing similarities and differences amongst
                    artwork and artists or other humanity centric data. ATLAS.ti or other
                    qualitative software can teach researchers to develop their data into a
                    manageable environment to be stored and revisited, past an initial assignment or
                    research project. Likewise, qualitative software allows the researcher to
                    continually contribute and add to existing research. Qualitative data analysis
                    is not manageable solely by ATLAS.ti. <ref
