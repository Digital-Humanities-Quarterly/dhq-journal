         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>This critical essay was written for the Prairie Art Gallery catalogue presenting Kate
               Armstrong's and Michael Tippett's <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title> Its
               argument, implied in the catalogue version, can be stated explicitly in the present
               scholarly format, namely that <emph>narrative</emph>, associated with the development
               of the modern novel in print, is distinctly unsuited to literary arts produced in and
               for the electronic medium. Narrative in the <title rend="italic">Dynamo!</title> is
               not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into question. The same holds for the
               place of argumentation in critical writing. The <title rend="italic">Dynamo!</title>
               develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and by the popular and literary
               narratives it samples; the essay develops similarly, in blocks of partly
               autobiographical, partly analytical text. Propositions emerge not sequentially or
               through feats of interpretation, but at the moment when a block of text encounters a
               cited image from the <title rend="italic">Dynamo!</title>
            </p>
            <p>Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of
               Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of contemporary
               fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative was only ever a mode, one
               among many and not necessarily the dominant mode, in print literature itself.
               References are made to Pynchon's <title rend="italic">Gravity's Rainbow</title>, to
               Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear,
               non-sequential narratives by Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are
               as open to innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter. In this
               context, <title rend="quotes">Graphic Sublime</title> also introduces a major, as yet
               unpublished novel from the early 1970s by Phillip Wohlstetter, <title rend="italic">Valparaiso</title>. </p>

                  appears in the course of James Ellis's critique of James Wood, a reviewer at
                     <title rend="italic">The New Yorker</title> and fierce apologist for narrative
                  and a kind of tempered psychological realism in mainstream publishing. Ellis's
                  essay is under consideration for publication in ebr <ref target="http://www.electronicbookreview.com">www.electronicbookreview.com</ref>.</note> One character, finding himself
               dispossessed of devices, throws himself off the roof of his apartment building, so
               painful is the feeling of disconnection. More fortunate residents in the same
               building are the couple Lenny and Eunice, who put one another through a careful
               self-screening of characteristics, by no means matching but nonetheless necessary to
               their connection: <q>categories of net-worth, <q>fuckability,</q>
                  child-abuse scales, and other measures achingly important to Americans in
                  Shteyngart's fictional world.</q> (Ellis) </p>
            <p>
               <emph>Narrative</emph>, evidently, is the default setting for new media — as media
               present themselves to the imagination of current print realism. Novels concerned with
               happiness and sadness, truth, love, and, not least, <emph>story</emph>, have no
               trouble absorbing devices as though they were all part of our culture's ongoing
               sentimental education. The sad truth of this particular novel by Shteyngart might be
               stated as an allegory of what happens when narrative is personalized and its display
               is facilitated from one moment to the next, even as the narrated experience is under
               way. Biographical notations in new media, updated continually, need to be validated
               by being shared, over long distances and <emph>in the present</emph>. Users need to
               know, always, where they stand within self-organizing, self-interested systems of
               professional networking, dating, entertainment, travel, etc. The delay mechanisms in
               print (separating hand and eye, composition and later presentation on the published
               page to a relatively amorphous audience) can no longer be tolerated by a sensibility
               grown accustomed to a life arranged in media. A post is like a phrase spoken in
               conversation in that a response is needed for its completion. Dynamism, rather than
               reflection, is more the norm in new media.</p>
            <p>The self-conscious migration of literature into new media has been a fevered
               reconstruction (and continuous presentation) of narrativity, by which I mean the need
               for constant connection and to make present (as an ongoing story) the events of one's
               life over time and across distances. The idea, a given for many scholars and most
               mainstream fiction writers today, that a life worth living must be lived narratively
               — that an experience worth sharing had best be told as a story — has been carried
               into new media but not, as we might have anticipated, through hypertexts and other
               kinds of born-digital literary writing. Nor can digitized novels, long poems, or
               continuous dramas have anything approaching the cultural presence of the kinds of
               narrative now associated with handheld devices and social networks.<note>The
                  distinction between <q>digitized</q> and <q>born-digital</q> literature, I take
                  from <ptr target="#bouchardon2012"/>.</note> Even games in new media are said to
               need a narrative, to justify themselves as educational or fulfilling. (By contrast,
               nameless designers of the old board games never had to apologize for pleasures that
               were taken, for the most part, episodically and without narrative reconstruction,
               with the roll of a dice, the gain of a few millions in play cash, or the construction
               of a very long word over squares of varying value.)</p>
            <p>Could anyone have expected that this one literary element — narrativity — would have
               come to inhabit new media so thoroughly? That the social and the affective would
               re-assert itself with such a vengeance, in an environment grounded in what is
               calculable, useful, and instrumental? Most surprising of all is the way this
               self-assertion has been reinforced by media whose operations (based in calculations
               and high speed binary selection) in themselves could not be further from narrative.
               Even in the realist tradition in print, narrative was never so thoroughly realized,
               so firmly tied to characters whose desires could be measured from one moment to the
               next, given a value, and hence made available for <emph>exchange</emph>. What can be
               held in place, in the mind of a reader who might regard himself as a character in
               various ongoing fictions, can be reinforced, certainly, by devices held in the hand
               and suited to the interrogation of others — concerning their traits, their
               whereabouts (and ours) at any given time, our present availability for social,
               sexual, or work relations.<note>Shteyngart, born in Leningrad (not St Petersburg) and
                  hence a child of post-Soviet Russia, must be aware of the convergence of his
                  imagined <term>äppäräti</term> and the social control formerly entrusted to
                  apparatchiks.</note> Life-narratives no longer need to be displaced into the more
               reflective genres of novelistic fiction. And what's more: our narratives have become
               newly calculable, measurable from one moment to the next, and hence available for
               direct participation in an economy of "passionate interests" <ptr target="#latour2010"/>.<note>In <ptr target="#latour2010"/>, the author has
                  noticed the renewed relevance to our present new media culture of Gabriel Tarde's
                  19th century theory of an economy based not in the exchange of commodities, but in
                  the calculation of <q>passionate interests.</q> The difference is that
                  calculations that were, in Tarde's time, tacit and held in consciousness, are now
                  explicit and held in databases, more ranging in their sample, and capable of being
                  carried out quickly.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Does the present re-situation of our personal narratives from novels to apps imply a
               transformation of literary engagement generally? It might, if one holds that
               narrative is essential to literature — even as some claim (with very little objective
               justification) that narrative is essential to a well-lived life. But narrative, in
               fact, has been only one, arguably a minority, element in the long network of literary
               fiction in print<note>Gaylen Strawson offers another context for this argument
                  (against the mainstream of cognitive approaches to literature), when he insists
                  that the majority of humanity (for most of history) have experienced their lives
                  without resorting to narrative explanations. Notably, Strawson cites Joyce and
                  Musil as literary figures whose non-narrative fictions are more in line with his
                  own cognition, and his own lack of interest in the narrative shaping of life
                  experiences. (See <ptr target="#tabbi2011"/>)</note> – whose canonical texts more
               often demonstrate episodic, fragmentary, and situational aspects of knowledge (even
               within the realm of 19th century realism, but certainly in epical, allegorical, and a
               rich variety of modernist forms that tend to explore consciousness more than
               connection). Musil, Joyce, Proust, Pynchon, and Wallace are no less a part of the
               literary mainstream than Dickens and Austen. Similarly, our present äppäräti, however
               great their commercial market share, are only a small portion of what the current
               technological culture produces, in comparison with databases and supporting
               softwares. (Consider, for example, how little press coverage is given to the CEO of
               the German company that holds rights to the enabling software used in every Apple
               app.) The tendency to focus on that small portion of technology that falls under our
               individual narrative control is no more accurate or desirable, when it comes to
               technologies, than is the tendency to equate realism in fiction with a
                  <emph>narrative realism</emph>.</p>
            <p>A largely impersonal, non-narrative form also can have a place in new media, though
               not those media that come down to us in the form of <emph>devices</emph>. When one
               considers databases, codework, or any of the hundreds of streaming media that refresh
               the screen that we happen to have open at any given time — the possibilities for
               other kinds of meaning making become readily apparent. The literary re-opens, when
               demands for immediacy and for interaction are lowered. When freed from the need
               always to be responding instrumentally, readers and viewers can cultivate habits of
               reflection that might echo the experience of print reading but remain wholly within
               the possibilities and constraints of new media. Such are the literary qualities that
               I discovered during a period of several months in 2008, when I was asked to write on
               a digital art installation by Kate Armstrong and Michael Tippett. <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title> is a networked cultural artifact that
               includes arbitrary associations between texts and images drawn from RSS feeds on the
               Web. The work is a sort of network comic book, which pulls together texts written by
               Armstrong with more or less random images pulled in from LiveJournal and Flicker. The
               work was observed, during that particular period, in much the way that I observe most
               works of born-digital writing — that is to say, in a state of semi-distraction and
               occasional reflection. I had the <title rend="italic">Dynamo!</title> running on one
               or two windows, behind or to the side of other windows that required more immediate
               attention. Those interfaces, apps, and emails at the front of my screen must exist,
               somewhere. I don't intend to return to these everyday communications, and I hope
               nobody else will have occasion to want to do so.</p>
            <p>For the present collection of <title rend="italic">DHQ</title> essays on new media
               writing, I return to the written record of my experience with the <title rend="italic">Dynamo!</title> The text that follows originally was included as a
               catalog essay put together by the Prairie Art Gallery, when the work was exhibited in
               Grande Prarie, Alberta. I was not able to attend the exhibition and I have not
               checked to see if the event was documented in new media, but that is not the
               experience I wish to present here. Rather, the essay offers a sense of how a range of
               literary qualities can exist, almost accidentally, within or around the instrumental,
               highly narrativized spaces of new media. Precisely because the work is so minimal —
               more a matter of framing than narrativizing — there is not so much in the way of
               stated authorial intention to divert our critical attention; with no need ever
               actively to <emph>respond</emph> to the images and text organized for us by "the
               device," a space emerges for unmolested viewing and reflective reading. There will be
               instances in what follows, where my own conceptual shifts might seem no less
               arbitrary than the image that happens to be pulled from the LiveJournal at any given
               moment, on any given screen. The just mentioned <q>device,</q> which (according to
               one of the hundreds of text snippets) is <q>lost in the general
                  flux of ideas,</q> had no connection, in my earlier reading, with the devices
               in Shteyngart (whom I had not read at the time). Other, more visual connections (to
               Roy Lichtenstein's prints, for example), occurred to me too late, to be worked into
               the body of the written text. These connections emerged only on re-reading, and while
               looking again at the image clips I pulled from LiveJournal (which are not the same as
               the ones reproduced in the catalog, or the ones presented here, in this slightly
               revised version for <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title>).</p>
            <p>In this sense, the present essay is also a kind of autobiography, but one that is
               without the usual, strong narrative that so often attaches itself to new media, and
               without the strong argumentative thread that characterizes professional literary
               criticism. Here I am interested in what it means to inhabit the much more extensive
               environment of streaming images and streaming text, which does not in itself exhibit
               narrative qualities, which precludes argument, and which only accidentally can be
               said to have literary qualities. I am increasingly persuaded that electronic
               literature, if it should ever come to be a widely recognized practice, will emerge
               not because artists self-consciously interrogate the aesthetic or literary
               affordances of this or that specific technology.<note>An early, and still influential
                  call for <q>media specificity</q> in writing about born-digital literature was
                  made by N. Katherine Hayles during her keynote lecture at the 2001 meeting in
                  Santa Barbara of the Electronic Literature Organization.</note> Rather, literature
               is poised to enter our mediated lives in much the way that literature has always done
               — at those moments when we cease to involve ourselves too fully or immediately in
               what can be reported, and we engage not exclusively with characters who can be known
               and stories that can be told but rather with modes of consciousness and
                  cognition.<note>Shteyngart's soon to be middle aged narrator is not optimistic

            <p>We still like to think of it as <q>out there</q>: the Web, the World-System. We've
               had it long enough for a generation of children to reach adulthood using computers,
               and for a generation of new media artists to build bodies of work. No longer are we
               looking at literary migrations; hybrids are capable now of being born digital, not
               carried over from Fprint, punch card, or canvas to the screen. We go there, to the
               terminal, to look things up, to book our vacations, to network, to post resumes, to
               find the jobs that keep us sitting, for the most part, in front of terminals. Or it
               comes to us – on a mobile, handheld, cell, or pod. <q>How old
                  world</q> it seems, to Kate Armstrong and her generation of literary and
               graphic artists, how labor intensive and exploratory, to go in <q>search</q> of
               information when it can be brought to us through an RSS feed: a Rich Site Summary,
               RDF Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication. <quote rend="block" source="#armstrong2008">

            <p>For several months over the Spring/Summer of 2008, the <title rend="italic">Dynamo</title> came to be interspersed with my own writing life, which
               increasingly takes place online. The habits of attention and (no less important)
               negligence I've developed over the years are not disturbed by what the <title rend="italic">Dynamo</title> sends me, a Running Sense Stream of snapshots and
               clips from around the world. The images cycling through the panels are not resized –
               sometimes only part of a picture fits inside the frame, and this, too, gives the mind
               something to do. There is always <q>more</q> to an image than what we see, and there
               are also always more images, whose happenstance positioning with each other and with
               Armstrong's sentences generate meanings potentially no less significant, and much
               more patterned and expansive, than (what I can find on) my own. <quote rend="block" source="#armstrong2008">The relationship to the screen, to the digital page, is changed by having

            <p>Over centuries of print literacy, scholars got used to visiting archives in
                  <q>search</q> of information. We used to <title rend="italic">re</title>search
               documents, we were taught to discern arrangements, patterns, and structures that
               other writers put there before our arrival, or that they failed to see for reasons of
               ideology, racial or gender bias, or their position in a medial ecology different from
               that of today. We tried to bring forward something of the past and, when we finished,
               we left our results in books and in archives, to be built on and corrected (or not)
               by future scholars. At the same time, people living their regular lives left everyday
               documents of their own, the tiniest fraction of which could be retrieved by
               researchers and converted by authors into history, and stories. All this required
               time – the long time of art and scholarship but also the incredibly short time it

               <p>I'm a literary scholar and an editor, by profession – the kind of person who used
                  to keep 3X5 cards in my shirt pocket, who would then, after a bit of mental
                  processing (and much forgetfulness), transfer some of these notes to my word
                  processor. When I read, even now, I make marks – I think about what the author is
                  saying but I also think ahead to what I'll be saying about the author, or about
                  topics an author treats and I may want to treat differently. Commissions like this
                  one, to write catalogue copy on a work that could be art, could be electronic
                  literature, or some new amalgam or anomaly, run contrary to habits that I've
                  internalized throughout a career that's concentrated, mostly, on words in print. </p>
               <p>The images that cycle through <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title> have

                  digital cameras and posted on blogs and websites. I can remember seeing Roman,
                  Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, and Chinese characters among scraps of text that appear
                  in the photos. (The purchase of the source site by the Russian firm, SUP, may have
                  tilted the frequency toward the Cyrillic.) The images appeared to early

                  characterization. We don't even know if she's a he or he's a she: that will depend
                  perhaps as much on the image that happens to be attached to the text, as on any

                  texts were written. Armstrong says she was drawn initially to science fiction and
                  1940s spy fiction: <quote rend="block" source="#armstrong2005b">I was loving the brilliant innocence of
                     both comics and that literature, where everything happens in either London or

               <p>Armstrong's words arrive on the screen in the form of captions, thought, and
                  speech balloons. They are pulled randomly from the author's flat file, and
                  sometimes they appear long enough for me to read one and view the accompanying
                  image before I turn my glance to the next panel, and the next. If I'm quick, I can
                  clip a text and paste it to a file of my own, for later reference. But that sort
                  of careful, accurate, and attributed citation really is suited more for print
                  projects. Here, on the screen, the news from London and Damascus reaches me

                  early one morning by way of a V-2 Rocket dropped on London, were now as common as
                  the arrival of the morning email. In 1973 Pynchon, too, was playing off the
                  staples of spy fiction and comics: someone, some somebody, a bureaucrat with a
                  sense of humor, went to the trouble of replacing the bomb the Rocket was meant to
                  carry with a little black box containing coded instructions. It's also, for
                  Pynchon, something of a stretch to bring an imagination of technology and
                  international intrigue to the forms of conventional narrative. But readers at the

                  off so much by 700-plus pages of coruscating, brainy prose, as they are simply
                  unwilling to go beyond their own suspicions, their self-reliant conviction that
                  the materials they've gathered on the world are no less valid than what can be
                  compiled by any literary author, living or dead, white, male, or otherwise.</p>
               <p>This culture of suspicion, in some ways, is itself a legacy of the paranoid
                  culture deliniated by writers of Pynchon's generation. Technology and information,
                  in the worlds of <title rend="italic">Gravity's Rainbow</title> and <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo,</title> each can inflict its own violence on the
                  texture of everyday life, but each is also capable of evolving. As cultures
                  differentiate themselves internally through contact with an enemy in wartime, so,
                  too, can one medium come more fully into its own when a new medium appears. This
                  intermedial encounter is enacted in the <title rend="italic">Dynamo</title> when
                  the texts Armstrong had written take on new meanings through contact with the
                  unforeseen images: <quote rend="block" source="#armstrong2005b">As I was working with these themes I found
                     myself adding references to things that seemed more current, like evangelicals,
                     lobbyists and apocalypse, and started to pull in other concerns, not usually
                     associated with comics or hard-boiled crime novels, such as existential freedom
                     &amp; metaphysical structures like extra-temporal essence. These things started
                     to feed back on each other so that all of a sudden I was discovering
                     implications that philosophical states were being influenced by these
                     mysterious machines, or that powerful non-specific figures were motivated by
                     the desire to have outre religious experiences. So that's how the material
                     evolved in the beginning. When it started to run against the influx of images I
                     was happy to see that these associations became even more complex. <ptr target="#armstrong2005b"/>

               <p>The best account I've read of the interaction between comics and technology (and
                  the battle within comics between text and narrative, sound and dialogue, image and
                  word) is in print but remains, as yet, at the time of this publication,
                  unpublished. </p>
               <p>For the past few days, the manuscript on my coffee table has been a memoir in
                  novel form by Phillip Wohlstetter; working title: <title rend="italic">Valparaiso.</title> Going from the screen to the page, <title rend="italic">in
                     media res</title> and literally between media, I have reached Wohlstetter's
                  narrative of the military takeover of Chile on September 11, 1973. Is it so
                  strange that, under fire, Wohlstetter's narrator should enter into a digression
                  about, of all things, the art of comics? <quote rend="block" source="#wohlstetter">
                     <p>I wonder if the people who drew comic books were vets. Sound bubbles with
                        bold capitals and exclamation points don't exactly reproduce the noises or
                        explosions to which they allude, but they do capture their importance –
                        their constant and imposing presence – by offering them equal space with
                        dialogue or narrative, and I will follow their lead for a page. . .</p>

               <p>In his own fashion Wohlstetter, like Armstrong and Tippett, draws on the
                  comic-strip genre even as he reflects on a national tragedy experienced at first
                  hand. With no democratic leaders emerging at this moment to defend the Chilean
                  government, with a personal will to resist the usurpers but no clear political
                  agenda to follow, Wohlstetter (or his narrative persona) follows the lead of comic
                  artists. The list that starts on manuscript page 200 turns into an all-over blast
                  on page 201, filling the left- to the right-hand margin by the same sounds,
                  repeated over and over (with an occasional <q>
                     <hi rend="bold">POK!…</hi>
                  </q> here and there a <q>

                     <hi rend="bold">RATA-TAT-TAAT!!</hi>
                  </q>). Thereafter, Wohlstetter's account of the coup continues as conventional
                  reportage, or rather, a report of a halting record-in-progress: <quote rend="block" source="#wohlstetter">
                     <q>I am standing here in Santiago, Chile, a corner across from La Moneda

               <p>We are here, in front of <title rend="italic">La Moneda</title> palace, with a
                  narrator who will soon be running to escape the flames. Or rather, we might
                  imagine ourselves in a photograph, a famous one (reproduced in the Wohlstetter
                  manuscript) that shows a few civilians taking cover (but now running) under a
                  billboard advertising Schick razors: <quote rend="block" source="#wohlstetter">
                     <q>That one hit the roof,</q> says someone. Meaning it didn't hit us. The
                     planes draw away. I can feel in the crowd of onlookers a kind of collective
                     exhalation, an unwinding in the gut, or maybe that's just me. <q>Close
                        shave,</q> says Fedora. He nods at the billboard atop our kiosk. It touts
                     the chromium edge of the newest Schick razor blade. <ptr target="#wohlstetter" loc="188"/>
                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>The contrast between Wohlstetter's narrative and the dynamic presentation by
                  Armstrong and Tippett is instructive: In <title rend="italic">Grafik
                     Dynamo!</title>, there's no narrator around to say, <q>it didn't hit us</q>; no
                  need, no reason, to establish a sense of place when the reader inhabits all places
                  at once and is always <q>here,</q> safe at home, secure in an office, processing
                  images on a screen.</p>
               <p>It's a <q>close shave</q>, for sure, between a moment of lasting historical change
                  and its contemporary representation. For a richly diverse, extended period in
                  North American literary history, it seemed that the novel could still register
                  political changes by noting down the expressive changes in contemporary languages,
                  not least the professional languages that were evolving along with a technological
                  society. An account of the whaling industry in <title rend="italic">Moby
                     Dick</title>, the development of the German-American <q>Rocket State</q> in
                     <title rend="italic">Gravity's Rainbow</title>, and the establishment of a
                  neo-liberal autocracy in <title rend="italic">Valparaiso</title>, could each fill
                  in for the emergence of an entire world-system. The quest for domination, by Ahab,
                  by Blicero, by Robert Coover's comedian character, Richard Nixon, might have been
                  strange accounts of a single, overreaching personality. But these narratives were
                  able, nonetheless, to point a direction through the culture at large, to uncover a
                  living aspiration toward world-domination within current arrangements.</p>
               <p>The ever open, ever ambiguous literary representation can hold an audience, it
                  seems, only so long as the world-system itself remains incomplete, and only so
                  long as a sense of wonder exists in readers. Once a world-system takes hold in
                  reality (as in Pinochet's Chile), its representation in literature largely ceases.
                  If the short-lived socialist state under Salvator Allende was unique, conforming
                  neither to Marxist nor Maoist precepts, the counter-revolution and authoritarian
                  capitalism that followed would become all too familiar. Although outright military
                  force was usually avoided, the innovations of the U.S. backed Pinochet government
                  were to be picked up and further developed by the Thatcher, Deng, Reagan, Yeltsin
                  administrations and their successors. The revolutionary impulses of the Sixties
                  and early Seventies, it was discovered, could be reigned in not through military
                  force alone, but with a more ambitious, more subtle, and long-term expansion of
                  the military into the social and the economic spheres (even as the military itself
                  would be reconstructed on a corporate model: soldiers to be replaced, largely, by
                  security forces, military engagements overseas decided in days or weeks, from the
                  air, and other innovations described by the Mexican philosopher and sociologist,
                  Manuel DeLanda, in <title rend="italic">War in the Age of Intelligent
                     Machines</title>).</p>

               <p>In North America, world fictions such as <title rend="italic">Gravity's
                     Rainbow</title>, <title rend="italic">The Public Burning</title>, <title rend="italic">JR</title>, and <title rend="italic">The Names</title> ceased to
                  appear as the world-system established itself nearly everywhere, peacefully in
                  some times and places, violently in Chile. <q>The generation of '73,</q>
                  Wohlstetter's generation, the generation of Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, William
                  Gaddis, and Thomas Pynchon, produced narratives that were as open to innovation,
                  formally, as they sought to be expansive in subject matter. The embrace, by these
                  writers, of comic forms can be seen in retrospect to have been more scandalous
                  than the obscenities and broken sexual taboos, a generation or two earlier, in the
                  work of James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Anais Nin. This latest,
                  arguably the last, generation of world-epical story-tellers in the United States
                  felt an attraction to the more popular, generic appeal of the comic strip, its
                  ability to range from the joke to issues of cosmic importance, and its deflation
                  of the high seriousness of modernist fiction between the World Wars. Knowing that
                  the world was changed forever by technological violence, post-modern,
                  post-World-War II writers in North America still went <emph>out</emph> into the
                  world, they researched their themes, at times exhaustively, seeking power in
                  knowledge. These writers sought not just literary materials, but also political
                  alternatives in the countries where they traveled: Allende's Chile, Castro's Cuba,
                  Mao's China, America itself during the colonial, revolutionary, and antebellum
                  eras. (Pynchon, for decades, was rumored to be walking the length of the
                  Pennsylvania/Maryland border in preparation for <title rend="italic">Mason and
                     Dixon</title>, published in 1997). </p>
               <p>In the restless tradition of Herman Melville, Henry Adams, Henry James, and
                  Gertrude Stein, U.S. writers of the generation of '73 often felt at home only
                  among a community of expatriates. </p>
               <p>Despite their cosmopolitanism, these writers worked, for the most part, alone. And
                  their medium remained, for the most part, print: the medium of memory, the medium
                  of language heard in the head, not in the ears. </p>

                  authors don't hold onto manuscripts very long – after events. But can there be
                  said to be an <q>after</q>, or a <q>before</q>, to be experienced while watching
                  the graphic, dynamic images collected by Armstrong and Tippett? There are many

                  <q>suddenlies,</q> and other signifiers of conflict and change. Repetitions and
                  recurrences abound, contexts multiply but there is never a design-governing
                  principle that would allow a narrative or an argument to develop. We still have,
                  frequently, the drone of jet planes and the sounds of life during wartime. The
                  unprecedented and generalized violence of the past century shows no signs of
                  abating, in the new one. History, as such, is nowhere present in the <title rend="italic">Dynamo</title> – not if we mean, by history, a narrative to be
                  told about the rise and fall of nations, the formation and re-formation of
                  imperial powers, the flows, blockages, collective aspirations, and economic
                  segregation of populations. Neither is history present, significantly, in much
                  fiction in the U.S. since the Eighties. Writers in print, during the past twenty
                  or thirty years, have generally reigned in the previous decade's worldly
                  ambitions. Authors have learned to limit themselves to the domestic sphere, its
                  intellectual range contained by the incorporation of writers into academic
                  Programs, its subjective power channeled into the demands of possessive sexuality
                  and commercial culture.</p>

                  through the Eighties and Nineties in the U.S. and Europe, by electronic media in
                  which text itself could change. Experiments in hypertext and interactive fiction,
                  for example, brought blocks of text together using hyperlinked words or phrases,
                  producing alternative trajectories through a narrative and in principle, avoiding
                  closure. Yet the programming, that made possible such freedom, was still in the
                  hands of the author, so that the claim of readerly freedom proved largely
                  illusory, like much else in a culture based on consumer <q>choice</q>. Such work

               <p>The requirement of the new, post-war, post-imperial order is not simply that all

               <p>By contrast, the work on our screen at this moment, a kind of designwriting
                  practiced by Armstrong and facilitated by Tippett, is quite stable, formally and
                  in its use of technology. The images change, to be sure, and the scripts
                  themselves might appear one time as a caption, the next as a thought balloon. But
                  the words themselves – what Armstrong actually wrote – are the same each time, and
                  the simple, unchanging three-panel structure makes it possible for multiple
                  meanings to be glimpsed in each sentence and sentence fragment, for associations
                  to occur, complexities to develop. </p>

                  can be at once received and held at a distance. Texts can be written, not as
                  commentary or analysis, but as affective outbursts, capable of combining but only
                  randomly, never through authorial purpose or intention.</p>

               <p>Still, as nature abhors a vacuum, minds (those accustomed to reading novels,
                  watching films and TV, and listening to radio) cannot live without narrative – and
                  so we respond to narrative's absence by imagining stories of our own. I indulged
                  the impulse <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#greene2006">to engage in mental construction</quote>
                  <ptr target="#greene2006" loc="31"/></cit> on the day when I happened to clip those two
                     <title rend="italic">Dynamo</title> scripts about someone who <q>would fight
                     me</q> and someone else, or maybe the same man (why not?) who was trembling.
                  This happened to be the day that Eliot Spitzer resigned as Governor of New York
                  State, hoisted by his own petard when a Federal wiretap recorded his calls to an
                  escort service. A coincidence? Maybe, maybe not – but suddenly the line I'd been
                  noticing for weeks, concerning the man who is about to <q>lose everything</q>,
                  puts that other line about the prostitute with <q>startling news</q> in a kind of
                  perspective. Meaning begins to accumulate.</p>
               <p>Or not.</p>
               <p>I know that the texts were written before Spitzer became a headline. In the mind
                  of the author, Kate Armstrong, these sentences can have had nothing to do with
                  Spitzer, but that's the story I, the reader, happened to be following, offline in
                  the news, those days.</p>

                  Barack Obama, as it happens: the Democratic Party primary campaign was still under
                  way. Around this time, Tuesday 4 June 2008 (the day of caucuses in Vermont, Rhode
                  Island, Texas, and Ohio), I also caught a glimpse of a T-Shirt, <q>Hot for

               <p>We can be sure that events are happening, unreported and unavailable to the
                  dynamic of Web capture. This knowlege, somehow, is comforting. But not once, not
                  ever, is there more than an accidental connection between one affective moment and
                  another. Narrative is kept, literally, out of the picture.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There's affect everywhere</q> — emotion, pathos, psychological involvement. The
                  scripts, capitalized and presented often as exclamations, might be said to combine
                  the spare diction and thematic expansiveness associated with the classical
                  tradition of the Sublime. The word turns up, I notice, in at least two scripts:
                  There's the man who's <q>clothed in sublime richness.</q> The crowd, a frequent
                  appearance in the <title rend="italic">Dynamo</title> whose collective agency is
                  more consequential than any individual's, is said to be <q>struck, as one, by the
                     sublime mystery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But even if the word itself never appeared, Armstrong's scripts would still be
                  sublime in their frequent concern precisely with what is <emph>not said</emph>.
                  Even as the images depict what cannot have happened (not to us), we are made to
                  sense, through combinations of image and text, those places where language has
                  reached its limit.</p>
               <p>The Sublime is what Romantic poets felt in the presence of nature. It's what Henry
                  Adams felt confronting the first electronic Dynamo, whose powers he felt would
                  usurp those previously associated with sex and religion. It's why Frank Zappa
                  can't say where she's coming from when he's just met a girl named Dynamo Hum. It's
                  the sum total of all expression at any moment on the LiveJournal, as captured and

               <p>The <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title> graphic – where have I seen this
                  before? </p>
               <p>I remember seeing something like it the other day on Travelocity, when I was
                  booking a flight (Chicago to Vancouver, Washington, where Kate Armstrong would be
                  presenting her work, then on to Berlin). There has to be a deeper visual history,
                  I know. Without exactly remembering, I have seen something similar on show
                  posters, in prints, on television, and sure enough an Internet search brings me
                  back to those earlier media. The curvilinear title – it descends from Buffalo Bill
                  Cody posters from the 19th Century, that's where Armstrong and Tippett got the
                  lettering, the drop shadow, gradient red range. It seems to have been a popular
                  choice for monster movies, and the <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title>
                  certainly channels plenty of modern monstrosities, mutants, impossible
                  permutations: those animals with diminishing atomic weight, those mysterious
                  things of science, the undisclosed doings, <q>meanwhile</q>, at the fumigation
                  center and so forth.</p>
               <p>The graphic appears also in shows on Vaudeville and in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
               <p>Oh and there it is, the most famous of all probably: the Ben Hur movie poster,
                  foremost among dozens of adventure film titles that I found on <ref target="http://www.GRAPHICINTENETSIT.COM">GRAPHICINTENETSIT.COM</ref>.</p>
               <p>Where will I see it, once I've lived with it in my browser window for some several
                  weeks? </p>
               <p>In the city of Kiev, en route to somewhere else, I saw it in Cyrillic on a
                  billboard advertising <foreign>Индиана Джонс</foreign> (Indiana Jones). <title rend="italic">Ben Hur</title> and its filmic tradition have gone global. In
                  Kiev, one can see almost the same curvature as can be seen in the
                  Armstrong/Tippett title, the same lettering in black and orange.</p>
               <p>The curvature, I only just now notice when I glance at my bookshelf, is found also
                  in the second word in Scott McCloud's book title, <title rend="italic">Understanding Comics</title> – the very book a designer friend lent me, so
                  that I might write knowledgeably about <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title>
                  The oversized critical-essay-as-comic-book (offering <q>a ring-side seat for the
                     battle of words and pictures</q>) went with me on the plane to Croatia, then to
                  Kiev, back briefly to Chicago and then to Vancouver, Washington, where I returned
                  the book to the friend who lent it to me, so that he could return it, in turn, to
                  his library at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. I was given, in turn, Phillip
                  Wohlstetter's novel-in-manuscript, to read on the plane home.</p>
               <p>The Wohlstetter manuscript was passed to me by Rob Wittig at the 2008 meeting of
                  the Electronic Literature Organization in Vancouver, Washington. Kate Armstrong,
                  whom I met there for the second time in four years, followed up by kindly sending
                  me details on the production of <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title>
                  Networks, and occasionally narratives, are capable also of forming
                     <emph>around</emph> a work of electronic literature. There is a practice of
                  everyday life for many who create e-lit involving travel, conferencing,
                  collaboration and attempts at co-production, to keep the work circulating in
                  multiple media. As McCloud's wording suggests, the medial encounter between words
                  and images can be itself part of a <q>battle</q>, but there is also the
                  possibility of opening new cognitive possibilities in the spaces <q>between</q>
                  media. In comics, there are mysteries within each panel – the head that comes off
                  the torso with a tip of the hat, is the example McCloud provides. And then the hat
                  that comes off the head. </p>
               <p>It's heady stuff, for sure, what the panel can convey with its lexicon of lines,
                  symbols, icons, and images in combination with words: the way a line, by itself,
                  can convey either <quote rend="inline" source="#mccloud1994">fear, anxiety, and madness,</quote> or
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#mccloud1994">calm, reason, and introspection</quote>; either warmth and
                  gentleness, savagery and deadliness, or a rational, conservative disposition <ptr target="#mccloud1994" loc="88"/>; the way that the sketched expression on a
                  face produces the same expression in ours, while reading – even as, in life, we
                  react to others unconsciously with our own expression – and all this happens
                     <title rend="italic">prior</title> to verbal communication. </p>
               <p>All that happens within a panel, or inside the panel created when one living body
                  comes into visual range of another – as a friend or enemy, depending on what's
                  communicated pheremonally and muscularly, in a face-off.</p>
               <p>But, for McCloud, <quote rend="inline" source="#mccloud1994">It's the power of closure between
                     panels</quote> that is most interesting.</p>

                  <quote rend="block" source="#mccloud1994">We already know that comics asks the mind to work as a sort of

               </p>
               <p>I think so, too. Within a panel, as McCloud notes, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#mccloud1994">We can
                     only convey information visually</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mccloud1994" loc="88"/></cit>: word balloons and transliterations (CHOP!
                  CHOP! CHOP!) can only <emph>suggest</emph> sounds (but suggestion usually is
                  enough); the squiggly lines above a boiling pot can be all it takes to locate us
                  in a kitchen, where we know something about smells. The same squiggles above a
                  pile of garbage, locate us in an altogether different setting, stimulating several
                  senses at once. </p>
               <p>Still, strictly speaking, the visual is the only sense in use, in us, when
                  reading.</p>
               <quote rend="block" source="#mccloud1994">But <hi rend="bold">between</hi> panels, none of our senses are
                  required at all. Which is why <hi rend="bold">all</hi> of our senses are engaged!

               </quote>
               <p>The total engagement – Arthur Rimbaud would have said the <q>derangement</q> or
                  unruliness – of sense experience. <title rend="italic">Le dereglement des tous les
                     sense</title>: this too, is a characteristic of the Sublime, the aesthetic of
                  disruption, the aesthetic of war (in contrast to the Beautiful, which has more to
                  do with sensual life and loves). McCloud has zeroed in on the right aesthetic, for
                  recognizing and realizing the potential of his own <q>invisible art</q> of comics.
                  But the engagement, to the point of <emph>disorganizing</emph>, the senses is not,
                  in itself, the full story: the liminal space between frames is all on the side of
                  perception, not communication – and you do not have art without a movement from
                  one to the other, perception, communication, and back, continually. What engages
                  the senses, necessarily, is <emph>operative</emph>: it makes something happen in
                  our minds, but pre-reflectively, and in a way that cannot be communicated to
                  another mind (except by force, even if it's the genial force of a smile in one
                  person conveying a smile in the other).</p>
               <p>Perception works, in aesthetics as in cognition, precisely <emph>because</emph> it
                  is kept offscreen (in comics) and out of consciousness (in face-to-face
                  encounters). When perceptions are fully engaged, this is of course a powerful
                  experience – hence the power of the Sublime in aesthetics, and the highly evolved
                  perceptual power that each person possesses, and has possessed since before the
                  emergence of rational thought. But that power, which necessarily blocks conscious
                  awareness, is only a stage in the development of an artform. The completion comes
                  with reflection, and communication – and for this we need precisely a medium that
                     <emph>reduces</emph> sense experience, which can be conveyed not directly (like
                  light, sound, and touch) but indirectly, as when we grasp a
                  <emph>meaning</emph>.</p>
               <p>The medium that remains best suited to such communications, as far as I can tell,
                  is the printed word.</p>
               <p>The skilled use of this medium, even in the age of the word's technological
                  obsolescence, is what distinguishes critical comics by McCloud and the graphic
                  sublime of the <title rend="italic">Grafik Dynamo!</title>
               </p>
               <p>McCloud's work is not criticism, and Armstrong/Tippett's work, as I have argued,
                  is not narrative. But these works have the virtue of letting us know, sensually,
                  what it is we're missing – in an era that systematically denies the development of
                  critical and narrative experience.</p>
