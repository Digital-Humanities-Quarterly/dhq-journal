            <dhq:abstract>
                <p> John Unsworth recounts that he first became involved with computing in the Humanities c.
                    1989 as a new faculty member at North Carolina State University where he was
                    hired to teach post-World War II American literature. He and his colleagues
                    wanted to set up a new journal as only one other journal existed in that area.
                    They were introduced to the recently released LISTSERV software and the first
                    issue of the journal was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was
                    called <title rend="italic">Postmodern Culture</title> and twenty-two years later is still published by Johns
                    Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed electronic journal in
                    the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior colleagues were in favour of it
                    and, as a junior faculty member, his participation in it. He recounts that was
                    not able to avail of formal training in computing but he did have technical
                    knowledge of computing, mostly picked up while procrastinating on this PhD. By
                    the early 1990s he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused
                    on electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and non-academic
                    projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia where he directed the
                    Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the
                    wide range of people and projects that he worked with and that it was around
                    this time that he became involved with the community now known as digital
                    humanities. He reflects in detail on the first digital humanities conference he
                    attended in Paris in 1994 and concludes by discussing some of the changes that
                    the advent of the Web has heralded. </p>

                <p> Dr John Unsworth is Vice-Provost for Library and Technology Services and Chief
                    Information Officer at Brandeis University. From 2003-2012 he was Dean of the
                    Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) at the University of
                    Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In addition to being a Professor
                    in GSLIS, at Illinois he also held appointments in the department of English and
                    on the Library faculty; also, from 2008 to 2011, he served as Director of the
                    Illinois Informatics Institute. From 1993-2003, he served as the first Director
                    of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, and a faculty member
                    in the English Department, at the University of Virginia. For his work at IATH,
                    he received the 2005 Richard W. Lyman Award from the National Humanities Center.
                    His first faculty appointment was in English, at North Carolina State
                    University, from 1989 to 1993. He attended Princeton University and Amherst
                    College as an undergraduate, graduating from Amherst in 1981. He received a

                    from the University of Virginia in 1988. In 1990, at NCSU, he co-founded the
                    first peer-reviewed electronic journal in the humanities, <title rend="italic">Postmodern Culture</title>
                    (now published by Johns Hopkins University Press, as part of Project Muse). He
                    also organized, incorporated, and chaired the Text Encoding Initiative
                    Consortium, co-chaired the Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly
                    Editions, and served as President of the Association for Computers and the
                    Humanities and later as chair of the steering committee for the Alliance of
                    Digital Humanities Organizations, as well as serving on many other editorial and
                    advisory boards. More information is available at <ref

                <p> At various stages in this interview Unsworth reflects on the changing shape of the
                    field of digital humanities, along with his initial impressions of it. For example,
                    he recalls the segregation that he observed between English and French-speaking
                    sessions at the first Digital Humanities conference that he attended in Paris
                    (ALLC-ACH 1994). Further, while he found those at the conference to be friendly
                    he also had the sense that the community already knew each other and had
                    developed a set of mores and codes, albeit for the most part unspoken. In order
                    to categorise the way he feels that the community has changed and developed over
                    the past years he chooses the interesting metaphor of a spiral staircase: <q>you
                        pass the same point but at different levels over time, so the community gets
                        bigger and there are moments when it seems more homogeneous and then there
                        are other moments where it seems to be opening up</q>. </p>

                        now think of as digital humanities? And what was then Computing in the
                        Humanities? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>John Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> So, the first step in that direction was not really intentional. I was a new
                        faculty member at North Carolina State University, and I'd been hired to
                        teach post-World War II American literature. There weren't really many
                        journals, academic journals, in that area, there was just one actually,
                        called <title rend="italic">Boundary II</title>, and so with a couple of
                        friends, one was a friend from graduate school, who also ended up on the
                        same faculty a year later, we decided to start a journal in that area. NC
                        State was in a budget crisis, public higher education always is as far as I
                        can tell, so there was no money for printing and there was no money for
                        mailing. So, we consulted with a university librarian, a woman named Susan
                        Nutter, who I think is still head of the libraries at NC State, she
                        introduced us to people in the Campus Computing Organization, who introduced
                        us to some brand new software that had just come out, called LISTSERV. This
                        was in 1990, and actually probably '89, and so we put together the first
                        issue that we circulated on email lists and bulletin boards and stuff [as
                        well as] Information about the journal. We solicited contributions. We
                        actually then went out and recruited contributions from people who had
                        nothing to lose professionally by publishing in a new journal in a new
                        medium. And we had quite a good line up in the first issue and there was no
                        mark up, you know we could have distributed files in a word processing
                        format but we wanted to have them be broadly accessible, so we didn't want
                        to limit our audience to people who used a certain kind of hardware or
                        software. </p>
                    <p> So, we just distributed the articles in plain text, one article per message,
                        we were actually very doctrinaire about formatting though, we maintained a
                        sixty-five character line because in sixty five characters in Courier ten
                        point, you could print out on an eight and a half by eleven page and the
                        lines would break correctly. And we had two spaces after every period, so
                        you could distinguish between sentences and ellipses, which only have one
                        period, one space, and so on. And our big innovation was we numbered
                        paragraphs, actually, because we wanted people to be able to cite this, but
                        there wouldn't be page numbers, or the page numbers wouldn't necessarily be
                        consistent. So we mailed the first issue out, all ten articles, we had a
                        popular culture column, and we even had some ad exchanges with print
                        journals and pretty much that crashed everybody's mailbox, who got the first
                        issue of the journal because nobody had any capacity at all in their mailbox
                        and to get, you know, like a journal's worth of text, even though it's just
                        plain text made — you know, their mailboxes were essentially inaccessible to
                        them until they contacted their campus computing people and said <q>Help, my
                            journal has crashed my mailbox.</q> So after that, we just sent out the
                        table of contents with instructions for people on how to retrieve articles
                        from LISTSERV and then later when FTP came along, we put it up for FTP and
                        when Gopher came along and gave you a menu for FTP, we put it up on Gopher
                        and when the web came along, we put the back issues up on the web and I
                        think our first issue that was designed for the web was in January 1994. And
                        it actually proved to be very useful that we had been doctrinaire about
                        formatting 'cause we could write shell scripts to go back and mark up the
                        back issues. So that was a good thing. I didn't mean to get into electronic
                        publishing, it was sort of fiscal necessity and also being at a technical
                        university, where there were people around who were interested in this kind
                        of experimentation but it was <title rend="italic">Postmodern
                            Culture</title>, still published by <title rend="italic">The John
                            Hopkins University Press</title>, it's in its twenty-second year now, I
                        think, currently edited by my brother-in-law and it was the first
                        peer-reviewed electronic journal in the Humanities. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> Wow, that's amazing. How much technical knowledge did you have yourself at
                        the point when you were starting off? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> Not that much, certainly no formal training. Most of my technical knowledge
                        came from procrastinating in the course of writing my dissertation. So, I
                        wrote it on a word processor — Sanyo CPM machine with WordStar — and I
                        learned a little bit of BASIC, I would go in and edit the compiled code to
                        change the messages on my splash screen. We're talking about ways to waste
                        time instead of writing your dissertation. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> That sounds entirely sensible to me. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> And I had started using email as a graduate student at Virginia and there
                        weren't a lot of people to exchange email with, but that was kind of
                        interesting. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> And culturally? What you're saying really chimes there, I can remember email
                        coming in and just how amazing it was, but culturally, did you feel that you
                        were ahead of a curve or were you just really focused on getting this
                        product out or what was the kind of attitude to the whole computer side of
                        things, can you remember how you felt about it? Was it <q>oh this is really
                            exciting</q> or-? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> Yeah, I thought it was interesting and it was pretty clearly against the
                        advice that any sensible senior person would have given me, I mean beginning
                        with editing a journal as a junior faculty member cause that's service, not
                        research and putting your time into editing a journal that didn't get
                        printed ... [A senior faculty member] at NC State, at one point this guy
                        took me aside and told me, I won't name any names, told me it was
                        inappropriate for a junior faculty member to be running a peer-review
                        process in which we passed judgement on our seniors in the profession...
                    </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> Completely different culture ... </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> I said <q>thank you very much for that perspective.</q> But we were
                        convinced that just for financial reasons, that all academic journal
                        publishing would quickly follow suit and five years on the outside, all
                        academic journals were going to be electronic. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> That was the year of the paperless office — everything was going to be
                        electronic. So in terms of meeting other people, you said that on your
                        campus because it was very tech-focused you'd met a lot of people who were
                        good technically. So in terms of meeting other people, maybe off-campus, who
                        were using computing in the Humanities, do you remember your first
                        encounters of that kind? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> Well, mostly in that period from '90 to about '93, when I was at NC State,
                        most of the people that I was meeting were in conferences organized by
                        libraries and focused on electronic journals. And, you know, I was reading
                        things in <title rend="italic">Humanist</title> also, but the people that I
                        was meeting at conferences were pretty much other people involved in doing
                        electronic journals in an academic context and that was a very small and
                        heterogeneous group of people. We had a guy who had a journal in hospitality
                        research, there was Paul Ginsberg from the High Energy Physics Archive
                        Project — I think he still works on that, Stevan Harnad was at some of these
                        conferences and people from completely different disciplinary backgrounds,
                        who, you know, the only thing they had in common was that they were trying
                        to do electronic publishing, electronic scholarly publishing. And they had
                        very different ideas about, you know, what was the best business model and
                        should you charge for it, or should it be free. I remember the guy from the
                        hospitality research, he was adamantly opposed to what we didn't then call
                        open access but publishing things for free, he was like, <q>people only
                            value what they pay for; you gotta charge for it.</q>
                    </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> Old school. One of the things that we have noticed as younger scholars in
                        the field, is that when people talk about that particular era, it seems like
                        this kind of heterogeneity was a lot more prevalent. Recently, there seems
                        to be move towards trying to open up and become more heterogeneous, but
                        we're not sure whether that observation on our part is myopic and restricted
                        to just standing where we are and looking back at something we don't know.
                        So, how do you feel about the field and with regard to that, how it's
                        developed. This idea of the randomness, brought together by a need for the
                        particular technology that you were just describing. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> I think you still see that around emerging technologies. So, people will
                        pick up some new technology, and people who have very different disciplinary
                        backgrounds, if you look at it in the post-recession what people are doing
                        with text mining now, these people would never meet at any other conference,
                        because the content that they're working with is extremely different, but
                        they meet here, because there is a shared interest in the method. I think
                        the digital humanities community as a whole goes through phases of
                        consolidation and diversification. You're not circling, [it's] more like a
                        spiral staircase: you pass the same point but at different levels over time,
                        so the community gets bigger and there are moments when it seems more
                        homogeneous and then there are other moments where it seems to be opening
                        up. One of the problems that we have right now is that there is more ... we
                        have a conference format that can't accommodate all of the interested people
                        we have in participating, so there is a lot of pressure right now to open
                        things up. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> Yeah, that makes sense, it's a cyclical thing, it's a perspective you can
                        only have when you've been in any field for a long time really. It's quite
                        interesting. One thing I'm interested in, or that we're both interested in
                        really, is the other people who were around at the time and in terms of your
                        own research, who you would look back to or look up to and think <q>I want
                            to adopt their methods</q>, or has everything that you've done been
                        along the same model that you mentioned: you had something that you wanted
                        to do, you found a tool that could do it and developed your career along
                        that way? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> Well, in 1993, I moved from North Carolina State to University of Virginia,
                        and that was a much broader job. I was also in the English department, and
                        on a tenure track, so I had four years in rank at that point at NC State,
                        but I got hired to direct the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
                        Humanities at Virginia, much to their surprise, I have to say, I'm not sure
                        they meant to hire me, they just, everybody else pissed somebody off and I
                        was the last one standing, so they said well, give that one a try. And
                        there, you know, I worked with Jerry McGann, I worked with Ed Ayers, I
                        worked with Thorny Staples, who now works for Fedora Commons/Duraspace
                        Group. I worked with a bunch of faculty at Virginia and at other places who
                        were early adopters, the people from the Whitman Archive over here, that
                        project started at the institute, the Blake Archive Project started at the
                        institute, Jerry's Rossetti archive, the Whitman in the Emily Dickinson
                        project that Martha Nell Smith runs. There's a myth actually that it was a
                        sort of spin off in some ways of the institute as was the centre of
                        Nebraska. I worked with a lot of great students: Matt Kirschenbaum was a PhD
                        advisee; Steve Ramsay was a student in the English department and an
                        employee at the institute, when he was a graduate student; Amanda French was
                        there; there's just tons of, you know there is a real sort of Virginia
                        diaspora from that place and that moment, where you can trace people who are
                        now all over the field who were there as faculty fellows or were there as
                        graduate students. So, that was a real opening up in terms of projects and
                        topics and disciplines and methods and for me it was great. My interests are
                        in scholarly communication ultimately, so that was the best lab you can
                        imagine — all these people many of whom had a long history doing book
                        scholarship figuring out how to sort of reinvent that, you know in an
                        electronic form a lot of their projects were electronic textual editing
                        projects, they ended up. For a chunk of that time I was chair of the Modern
                        Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions. We produced a book
                        that they still sell called <title rend="italic">Electronic Textual
                            Editing</title> which was to bring the kind of principals of scholarly
                        editing that the CSE represented together with text encoding principles from
                        the TEI to give people fairly practical guidance actually about how to do
                        electronic scholarly editing. We re-did the guidelines for the CSE so that
                        they would be able to review electronic editions, which they did, they
                        reviewed the Blake Archive and gave it high marks, so that was just you know
                        from 1994 to 2004, when I was at Virginia, that was a real opening up into a
                        much broader world of people, that's when I started coming to this
                        conference actually, in 1994, it was my first, in Paris. So, that's, you
                        know, when I took that job and a broader horizon opened up. That's when I
                        really became involved in this community. </p>

                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> And how did you find the community when you first encountered it? Because
                        going to any new conferences can be quite daunting; so how did you find it
                        when you arrived on to this international scene? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> It was a small conference, it was pretty friendly but there was also the
                        sense that, you know, there were a lot of people here who knew each other
                        quite well, and had a sort of established value system, that wasn't
                        necessarily obvious. So, some of the early experiences was, you know, I'm
                        not sure if I'd just stepped in something. Maybe I did. So, there was a
                        little bit of that, which is inevitable, I think. But it certainly wasn't an
                        unfriendly place. The first conference was a little weird. It was half in
                        French and half in English, it was strictly segregated, you know, the French
                        sessions and the sessions in English. We had just set up a web server, which
                        was big deal in 1994, and we set it up for these projects that we were going
                        to do in Virginia, it was a sort of decision. When I got there actually,
                        they thought they were going to build the scholars' workbench, and I had
                        been working with the web at NC State, a little bit before coming to
                        Virginia, I said <q>no, no, the point is communication and a hermetically
                            sealed software environment is not, no matter how good it is, is not
                            what you want. People, scholars, want to communicate with each other,
                            and the way they are going to do that is through the web. So we should
                            put our efforts on finding durable ways to do things, because the web is
                            going to change really quickly, but we need to translate things for the
                            web and that needs to be the medium of distribution. </q> So, we'd set
                        up a webserver, we had a Unix laptop, an IBM Unix laptop, which probably
                        weighed about thirty-five pounds, I don't know, it probably wasn't even a
                        one GB driver, probably five hundred megabytes, but that was huge, and it
                        ran all the software for the website right on there, so you could just
                        address the website from localhost, and we kept communicating with the
                        people at the Sorbonne, <q>we want to bring this over, we want do a demo as
                            part of our session, show the website</q>. We didn't actually start with
                        the laptop idea, the first question was, does the Sorbonne have a network
                        jack, like can we get on a network and show this at home, and the guy at the
                        other end would write back saying <q>the Sorbonne, she is an old lady.</q>
                        We'd write back and said, <q>Does the old lady have a network jack?</q>
                        Eventually it became clear that the old lady did not have a network jack, so
                        we put together this laptop and said, <q>OK, we want an overhead projector.
                            Can we get an overhead projector?</q> He said, <q>Yes, you can get an
                            overhead projector.</q> So, we lugged this thing through airport
                        security, they were very interested, we had to take the external hard drive
                        apart and show them that it wasn't a bomb, and we got it all the way to
                        Paris, set it up in the room, and out comes ... we had an LCD panel,
                        remember those? That you'd put on an overhead projector, and that was just
                        like a see-through LCD screen, and it would display, you know, it was before
                        they had data projectors, so the LCD panel that sat on an overhead
                        projector, the light shines through and then you get an image through the
                        overhead projector of what was going on on the screen. So, this was what we
                        had and they brought out their overhead projector and it was an opaque
                        projector, which is completely useless, from this point of view, cause an
                        opaque projector just bounces light down and back up off the thing, it
                        doesn't project through the bottom. So opaque projectors are what you use if
                        you have a piece of paper and you want to write on it and have people see
                        what you're writing. It's not orientated for transparencies. So, we looked
                        at that, and we put everything away, got the marker out, and went to the
                        whiteboard instead and said, <q>See, this is what a webserver is like.</q>
                        We started drawing things. So, the whole conference experience was a little
                        strange, but it was Paris, and I do think part of the appeal of this
                        conference is that it happens in interesting places, and so I clued into
                        that pretty early. It took me a while to understand the importance of the
                        social programme of this conference, you should always attend but then every
                        year since going, I've hosted it twice ... </p>

                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> Thinking outside academia, can you tell us a little bit about how you think
                        the general public perceived the computer in the era that you were working
                        in — because you're moving from the eighties right through to the
                        mid-nineties in the projects that you've been talking about today. So, was
                        there any kind of perception there? It's really the era of the birth of the
                        web, isn't it? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> Right, the computer was a sort of specialized piece of office or research
                        equipment for the early part of that time, not that — it wasn't that
                        uncommon, I mean, the computer that I had was a hand-me-down from my Dad and
                        I also had another hand-me-down of his, it was a little TRS-80 that kept
                        its data on a cassette recorder and ran basic programmes. So, you know,
                        people had these things but they were usually only people in sort of
                        academic or business settings who would think of having them at home really,
                        because they had them at work. And there was the web. In 1994 really, is
                        when people started talking about the web in the New York Times and
                        suddenly, then very rapidly [it] became something that was for everybody, and
                        that was a huge game changer for academic computing because we would never
                        have had the same impact on our colleagues as that did, because that swept
                        up everybody. And also, because the information resources that it presented
                        were so large and so varied, not right away, but even at the beginning they
                        were various enough to be interesting. But the skill was really different at
                        the beginning, and when the first graphical web browsers came out, when
                        Mosaic first came out it had a what's cool list built into it, it was like a
                        bookmarks list that was built into it, and <title rend="italic">Postmodern
                            Culture</title> was on that list, because there were so few cool things
                        that we were on it. </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> Coming back to what you initially said about distributing through LISTSERV
                        and how that made it more available, I mean, I guess that opens up the whole
                        question about email and what the state of play was with email in that
                        period, how many people actually had an email account? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> By the mid-nineties, most people on university campuses had email, at least
                        the universities that I dealt with, but it was not really until the web
                        swept everybody up that it was common to have, you know, for your
                        grandmother to have an email account. But people had email at home, people
                        had AOL, [...] there were bulletin boards and chat rooms and
                        other kind of things. I belonged to one of the first network discussion
                        groups that I found was called tattoo, and it was on body modification and I
                        subscribed to it, because it was like the only thing out there, and I was
                        like <q>I wanna see how this works</q>. So I learned a lot about body
                        modification and discussion groups. And they were very active. </p>

                    <speaker>Welsh</speaker>
                    <p> It must have been a very different environment. Nowadays, we talk an awful
                        lot on campuses about public engagement and the independent scholar and the
                        scholar outside the walls of the campus and back then, the electronic thing
                        was quite gated in a way? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Unsworth</speaker>
                    <p> Well, the universities ran it and it wasn't privatized until the early
                        nineties. So, it really was-, there was initially, you know, a military and
                        research network, then an academic network, and then a public network. </p>

                        so much and shut the recording down at that point. </p>
