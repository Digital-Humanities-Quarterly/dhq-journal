                    used to digitize the Malcolm Francis McGregor Epigraphic
                    Squeeze collection held by the Department of Classical, Near

                    library system called Digital Initiatives. The squeezes are
                    photographed using a TTI Repro-Graphic Workstation 4060,
                    Sinar 86H cameraback and digital CMV lenses using
                    CaptureShop image processing software. The images undergo
                    further processing using Photoshop CS6 and the HDR merge and
                    Photomerge tools. The result creates a stunningly clear
                    image which fully captures the details of the squeeze and

                <p>As the field of Digital Humanities grows and the interest in
                    digital resources for teaching and research increases,
                    scholars are finding new and innovative ways to make
                    traditionally inaccessible or restricted material available
                    to a wider audience. Due to the fragile nature of some
                    teaching and research collections, especially those
                    comprising material from the Greek and Roman worlds,
                    curators are constantly presented with the challenge of
                    finding photographic techniques which safely and effectively
                    replicate the objects in digital format. Many such projects
                    include the University of Florida’s Digital Epigraphy and
                    Archaeology project, the Smithsonian’s digitization of the
                    Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery
                    Archives and Cornell University Library’s Photographs of
                    Stones – Mysteries at Eleusis.<note>Digital Epigraphy and

                        digitization of the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur

                        Cornell University Library’s Photographs of Stones –
                        Mysteries at Eleusis: <ref target="http://eleusis.library.cornell.edu">eleusis.library.cornell.edu</ref></note> The
                    Department of Classical, Near Eastern and Religious Studies
                    (CNERS) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) has
                    recently digitized such a collection, one which contains
                    over 1000 squeezes of inscriptions from ancient Greece
                    dating from the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century to
                    the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> century BCE.</p>
                <p> While a squeeze in general refers to a molding, cast,
                    impression, or copy of an object or design made by pressing
                    a pliable substance around or over it, an epigraphic squeeze
                    in particular is the impression of an inscription on stone.
                    This specific variety of squeeze utilizes filter paper, a
                    porous paper for filtering liquids most often employed in
                    the field of chemistry. The process of creating a squeeze is
                    quite simple: first, the filter paper is dampened and placed
                    atop the inscription. Next, a horsehair brush is used to hit
                    the paper so that the paper is pressed into the grooves of
                    the stone. Finally, once the paper has dried, it is
                    carefully peeled off and a mirror copy of the inscription is
                    revealed. <ptr target="#woodhead1981" loc="78–80"/></p>
                <p> The final product is known as an epigraphic squeeze and is
                    an invaluable tool for research in the field of Greek and
                    Latin epigraphy – when encountered in the field,
                    inscriptions are most commonly located on immovable stones,
                    either due to their substantial size or their secondary use
                    as <emph>spolia</emph> (the intentional inclusion of ancient
                    artifacts and building materials in later structures). For
                    example, if an inscription is on a stone which is built into
                    a church, a private residence, a wall, etc., or if the stone
                    itself weighs several hundred pounds, the only way to study
                    said inscription is on-site. Photographs of the stone,
                    depending on the lighting, can obscure letters or
                    misrepresent the incongruities of the stone. A squeeze,
                    however, offers an affordable and practical solution to this
                    problem: epigraphic squeezes allow scholars to virtually
                    transport the stone to research institutions worldwide.
                    Unlike photographs, a squeeze provides three-dimensional
                    information and is an exact replica of the original
                    inscription. This squeeze can then be photographed, scanned,
                    digitized, and manipulated in a variety of ways. A
                    well-curated squeeze collection can allow for detailed and
                    comparative study of a range of inscriptions, quickly and
                    systematically.</p>
                <p> Although the advantages of using squeezes for research far
                    outweigh the disadvantages, there are some issues associated
                    with their use. First, squeezes are difficult to store and
                    to maintain long-term. While the modified filter paper does
                    provide a mirror copy of the inscription, the paper itself
                    is thin, fragile and prone to disintegration, tearing, water
                    damage, and mold. Second, the squeezes themselves must be
                    stored flat and separated into small piles of only a few
                    squeezes so that the weight of the topmost squeezes does not
                    flatten the letters on those below. For this reason they are
                    commonly stored in thin drawers in customized cabinets made
                    expressly for this purpose. Third, because the direct
                    impression of the inscription is found on the underside of
                    the squeeze, epigraphic squeezes are often read backwards
                    since the letter forms are more legible on this side. The
                    reader must then read the squeeze from right to left, using
                    a magnifying glass to see all of the details necessary for a
                    thorough analysis of the inscription. Finally, the curators
                    of epigraphic collections of many museums – including one of
                    the only epigraphic museums in the world, the Athens
                    Epigraphical Museum – have issued a ban on the creation of
                    additional squeezes for fear of further damaging the stone
                    inscription The implication of this ban is that
                    already-established squeeze collections are likely to be the
                    only such collections that will ever exist. This fact
                    renders the existing collections all the more precious, and
                    the various digitization projects even more significant. The
                    fragility of squeeze collections highlights the importance
                    of creating digital records of these important historical
                    documents which preserve the detail and three-dimensional
                    nature of the squeeze and the information contained within
                    it.</p>
                <p> This article outlines an innovative photographic technique
                    that was employed by the CNERS department at UBC, in
                    collaboration with a branch of the UBC library system called
                    Digital Initiatives. This technique effectively reproduces
                    the three-dimensional quality of the squeeze. Once the
                    images have been uploaded to the digital collections website,<note>

                    </note> the image can be enlarged to 100% magnification,
                    allowing for more detailed study of the letter forms,
                    fractures, and other incongruities. These images in the
                    digital collection are open-access and readily available for
                    any interested party who may want to actively engage with
                    the study of epigraphy through digital analysis and
                    investigation.</p>

                    Collection</head>
                <p> The McGregor squeeze collection was donated by Dr. Malcolm
                    McGregor, renowned scholar of Athenian history and Greek
                    epigraphy and a former professor in the Department of
                    Classics (before it was merged with Near Eastern and
                    Religious Studies) at UBC. His collection largely comprises
                    inscriptions from Attica from the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century BCE, some inscriptions from Nemea
                    (approximately 100 km south-west of Athens) from the same
                    period, and several decrees dating to the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> century BCE. This collection
                    contains 1051 squeezes and, although this number includes
                    several duplicate copies of select inscriptions, access to
                    this large amount of material allows for the possibility of
                    studying inscriptions from these geographic areas and
                    periods in one place. The most notable squeezes in the
                    collection are the squeezes of the Athenian Tribute Lists
                    (ATLs), which were the main focus of McGregor’s research for
                    many years and the subject of his formative work: together
                    with H.T. Wade-Gery and B.D. Merritt, McGregor authored the
                    definitive volumes on a reconstruction of these lists which
                    include both texts and translations of the documents
                    (Meritt, Wade-Gery, McGregor 1939-1953). The McGregor
                    squeeze collection at UBC is a result of the research and
                    study carried out for these volumes. The original
                    inscriptions are held in the Athens Epigraphical Museum and
                    are difficult for scholars to study firsthand, as their
                    monumental height (3.5 m at their tallest) reduces
                    visibility.</p>
                <p> The Athenian Tribute Lists themselves are enormous
                    dedications to Athena which once stood on the Acropolis of
                    Athens. These inscribed records list the annual
                        <emph>aparchai</emph> (<q>first-fruits</q>) dedicated to
                    the goddess Athena by members of the Delian League, a group
                    of allied cities who pooled their resources against the
                    threat of a Persian invasion of Greece. The
                        <emph>aparchai</emph> represent one-sixtieth of the
                    overall tribute paid to the treasury to be used for this
                    purpose <ptr target="#jim2014" loc="204–205"/>. The lists of
                    dedications began to be inscribed in 454 BCE, when the
                    league’s treasury was moved from Delos to Athens, and the
                    contents of the lists are often used as a way to study the
                    development of the so-called Athenian Empire. Because the
                    annual <emph>aparchai</emph> by each member of the Delian
                    League was re-assessed every four years, the lists trace the
                    progression and comparative tribute exacted from these
                    communities as well as the wealth that was placed under the
                    control of Athens. They also provide details on revolts by
                    particular members from the league, as the offerings from
                    these respective members would often disappear from the list
                    for a few years. Overall, the ATLs are an important resource
                    for understanding the economic and political climate of the
                        5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century BCE Aegean.</p>
                <p> The largest stone, the Lapis Primus (literally, <q>first
                        stone</q>) records the <emph>aparchai</emph> for fifteen
                    years, from 454/3-440/39 BCE, and will be undergoing
                    restoration in the next few years. The 180 fragments which
                    constitute the Lapis Primus are currently being held
                    together by metal rods that are deteriorating, and the
                    current director of the Athens Epigraphical Museum, Dr.
                    Angelos P. Matthaiou, has initiated a movement to replace
                    the rods with superior titanium counterparts.<note> Personal
                        communication, February 2014.</note> The proposed future
                    dismantling of the ATLs will give scholars the first
                    opportunity to examine the marble blocks in their entirety
                    since the construction of the current display in 1927. Many
                    experts will, for the first time, have the opportunity to
                    examine all sides of the stones and may even propose
                    alternative combinations of the lists for reassembly. The
                    digitization of the McGregor squeeze collection,
                    particularly the ATLs, will make the squeezes of these
                    fragments available to scholars worldwide prior to the
                    eventual dismantling of the stones. The significance in this
                    lies in the fact that the collection also includes
                    McGregor’s original epigraphic charts – his drawings of his
                    own reconstructions of the ATLs based on the stone
                    fragments. This data will be made available not only to
                    expert scholars and researchers aiming to make new
                    discoveries with the disassembly of the Lapis Primus, but
                    the open-access format will allow any interested party to
                    actively engage with this collection. At a time of new
                    developments and inquiry in the world of Greek Epigraphy –
                    and the ATLs specifically – this new digital collection will
                    preserve for posterity digital copies of the squeezes of the
                    original stone fragments as they were studied and configured
                    by Malcolm McGregor and his colleagues.</p>

                <p> The greatest challenge in creating superior digital images
                    of epigraphic squeezes is the three-dimensional nature of
                    the squeeze as an object. The letter forms of most squeezes
                    are only slightly indented, due to the shallow carving on
                    the stones themselves and, as mentioned above, scholars
                    working with the squeezes themselves generally find them
                    easier to read by reading the underside so that the letters
                    are raised – the implication of this methodology is that the
                    words are read backwards, from right to left. A simple
                    photograph of the squeeze produces a flat and often
                    illegible image that does not allow for a detailed study of
                    the letter forms, eliminating potential reconstructions of
                    fragmentary inscriptions. Alternatively, flatbed scanning
                    runs the risk of flattening the raised letters, forever
                    altering the quality of the original squeeze. One research
                    group attempting to digitize squeezes has pioneered the use
                    of surface reconstruction to create a three-dimensional
                    image from a two-dimensional photograph of the epigraphic
                    squeeze <ptr target="#barmpoutis2010"/>. Although this
                    procedure is affordable as it requires only a flatbed
                    scanner and a particular computer algorithm, it relies on
                    shape reconstruction of particular letter forms. This
                    presents a problem for squeezes that are damaged or have
                    fractures or incomplete letter forms. Other
                    inscription-digitization projects have relied on laser
                    scanners <ptr target="#landon2006"/> and Reflectance
                    Transformation Imaging Systems <ptr target="#earl2011"/>
                    which can highlight letters and other details on the stone
                    that have worn away through time or have been obscured
                    through reuse of the stone for another purpose. These
                    technologies provide detailed surface maps of the artifact
                    in a three-dimensional model but are potentially prohibitive
                    to a larger audience due to the need of specialized hardware
                    and/or software to view and study the images.</p>
                <p>The original goal for the digitization of the McGregor
                    collection was to find a non-destructive process that would
                    generate crisp, detailed images that retained the
                    three-dimensional nature of the squeeze. In the summer of
                    2013, two assistants from the UBC Library’s Digitization
                    Centre (generally referred to as Digital Initiatives, or
                        DI),<note> Digitization centre: <ref target="http://digitize.library.ubc.ca/">http://digitize.library.ubc.ca/</ref></note> Lesley
                    Field and Chris Pugh, worked with a small sample of squeezes
                    using the TTI Repro-Graphic Workstation 4060 to determine
                    the viability of DI collaboration on the digitization of the
                    McGregor collection. After surprisingly little trial and
                    error, they created a workflow that creates stunningly clear
                    images which fully capture the details of the original
                    squeeze.</p>

                <p>The TTI workstation features a 4x6 foot vacuum table with
                    mounted lights and a suspended camera. The underside of the
                    squeeze is then placed facing up as this is the part of the
                    squeeze which has come into direct contact with the stone of
                    the inscription and thus it retains the direct imprint of
                    the inscription. This is the most important image to capture
                    faithfully in the digitization process. The squeeze is
                    photographed using a Sinar 86H cameraback and digital CMV
                    lenses which uses CaptureShop image processing software. The
                    camera shoots four frames per image in an X-pattern, from
                    top left to bottom right, then bottom left to top right,
                    shifting by a single pixel per frame. </p>

                </figure>
                <p>CaptureShop then merges the resulting four frames into a
                    single image. The single pixel shift creates a composite
                    image that is an extremely precise representation of the
                    original item being photographed. While this is the standard
                    procedure used by Digital Initiatives, capturing the unique
                    three-dimensional quality of the squeezes requires clarity
                    and definition in both the highlights and lowlights.
                    Expanding on a technique developed for creating Polynomial
                    Texture Maps and for Reflectance Transformation Imaging <ptr target="#malzbender2001"/>
                    <ptr target="#earl2011"/>, this project uses High Dynamic
                    Range Imaging - often abbreviated as HDR or HDI - an imaging
                    technique that merges different exposures of an image to
                    produce a greater range of shadows and highlights than a
                    single exposure offers. For the squeezes, the bracketing
                    options in CaptureShop are set to take three images – one
                    overexposed, one properly exposed and one underexposed. </p>
                <figure>
                    <head>Screen shot of the HDR merge tool</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p>The RAW image files are imported into Photoshop CS6 where the
                    automated HDR merge function is used to create a single
                    image with all of the dynamic range of the three different
                    exposures. RAW files are used in this case because they
                    retain the maximum amount of information from the captured
                    images; compressing the image to TIF or JPG format results
                    in both a loss of detail and images incompatible with the
                    HDR merge tool. In the case of the larger squeezes,
                    Photoshop’s Photomerge tool was used to fully capture the
                    original squeeze. Even though the vacuum table of the TTI
                    measures 4x6 feet, the total area captured by the camera is
                    much smaller even when the camera is raised to its highest
                    level on the support arm. In these situations, a series of
                    pictures are taken, ensuring that there is at least a 30%
                    overlap of pixels within each image. Photoshop can then use
                    this overlap to seamlessly stitch the images together using
                    the Photomerge tool. It is more time-effective to take four
                    photos with considerable overlap than to attempt this
                    maneuver with only three photos – this often leads to
                    insufficient pixel correlation to create a collage and one
                    must then start over. The photographic and post-processing
                    techniques described above create an image with the texture
                    of the paper beautifully enhanced.</p>

                </figure>
                <p> Next, the image of the squeeze undergoes further editing in
                    Photoshop: flipping it horizontally allows the letters to be
                    read left to right and the image is straightened so the
                    text, not the edge of the filter paper, is horizontal to the
                    reader. While epigraphists are accustomed to reading
                    squeezes backward, or right to left, the flipped images
                    available on our website makes the resource more accessible
                    to students of ancient Greek. Other edits, including the
                    insertion of a neutral grey background and drop shadow, are
                    purely aesthetic, but are performed to match the images in
                    other digital collections in the University of British
                    Columbia’s library. The images are then uploaded to the
                    library’s digital collections website with basic metadata
                    including the title of the inscription, references, date of
                    the inscription, and number of squeezes and fragments
                    relating to this inscription in the collection.<note>

                <p>The squeezes have been digitized, and we are currently
                    expanding the metadata to include transliterations,
                    translations, relevant bibliography, and other additional
                    notes. Initial research by student volunteers has been
                    focused on obtaining information about the physical stones
                    containing the inscriptions – their dimensions, findspots
                    and current locations. In July 2015, Chelsea Gardner
                    obtained a permit from the Athens Epigraphical Museum to
                    photograph some of the original inscriptions that we hold in
                    our collection. The purpose of this collaboration was to
                    better illustrate the squeezes at the core of the
                    collection, including the Athenian Tribute Lists, and select
                    inscriptions we use most frequently for undergraduate
                    instruction. The stones of the ATL’s Lapis Primus have been
                    reconstructed into the 3.5 meter-high replica of the
                    original stele. While this allows the museum to showcase the
                    inscriptions' monumental scale, this type of display makes
                    photography of the stones decidedly difficult. Despite this,
                    we were able to acquire the necessary images of the original
                    stone inscriptions which will be added to our website for
                    additional context for the squeezes. The addition of the
                    photographs from the Epigraphical Museum will facilitate the
                    use of the database as a comprehensive research and teaching
                    tool for epigraphers, scholars, and students alike, since
                    photos of many of these stones are not readily available
                    elsewhere. By displaying the photograph and squeeze
                    side-by-side on the website, interested parties (students,
                    scholars, and the general public) can compare the quality of
                    the words on the stone versus the squeeze for themselves and
                    explore all resources available.</p>

                    view and manipulate the images without requiring additional
                    software, offering a range of file sizes to download and an
                    impressive zoom feature for detailed study of letterforms or

                <p>The test collection proved that the equipment in Digital
                    Initiatives would provide both the image-quality and
                    interface required for detailed study of the squeezes in the
                    McGregor collection. This digitization project was fortunate
                    enough to receive a grant from the University of British
                    Columbia for the express purpose of making archived material
                    digitally available through the university’s library system,
                    or in their own words <q>to ensure the
                        authentic, long-term preservation of these digital
                        holdings for the future.</q><note>

                    Initiatives has completed twenty-two projects to date, and
                    currently manages twelve current projects (including the
                    digitization of the McGregor Collection) and has two
                    upcoming projects. The partnership between the CNERS and
                    Digital Initiatives further ensures the longevity of the
                    archives and their regular maintenance, as DI will manage
                    the Epigraphic Squeeze Collection in the same manner as all
                    other collections under their supervision.</p>

                <head>Viability of Replication at other Institutions</head>
                <p>Although the TTI Repro-Graphic 4060 assemblage used in
                    Digital Initiatives is prohibitively expensive, we strongly
                    believe that the quality of our images and a similar
                    workflow could be achieved at a lower cost to anyone
                    interested in replicating our imaging process. The camera
                    model and light array are available at different price
                    points and in different sizes. The vacuum table is not
                    essential and can be replaced with any flat surface. The
                    most important aspects for reproducing our photographic
                    technique are a camera stand to mount the camera over the
                    squeeze; remote shutter capabilities to ensure that there is
                    no shadow cast on the squeeze; and a bright, neutral light
                    array installed on one side of the camera, placed at a 45
                    degree angle. While CaptureShop software automates the
                    process of taking three different exposures of the squeeze,
                    the same process could easily be done manually. In fact, DI
                    upgraded from CaptureShop to CaptureFlow in September of
                    2014, and different program features – including the loss of
                    the automatic bracketing feature used to photograph the
                    majority of the squeezes – forced us to find an alternative
                    method. We completed the squeeze photography by taking a
                    single shot with the Sinar 86H camera and created bracketed
                    images with Photoshop by creating two duplicate files and
                    changing the exposure settings. From there, the process is
                    identical to what was described above.</p>
                <p>Photoshop C2 or newer is essential to replicate the overall
                    quality of the images: this was the first version of
                    Photoshop with the HDR-Merge tool. HDR merge will combine
                    the RAW camera files of three different exposures into a
                    single image, while still retaining the highlights and
                    shadows from the over- and under-exposed images. For larger
                    squeezes, the same technique as outlined above can be
                    applied by taking multiple photos and then stitching them
                    together using Photomerge. The process of digitally
                    stitching images together with Photoshop is entirely
                    automated and can be easily mastered by anyone with basic
                    technological proficiency. Using this fundamental
                    methodology, similar projects can replicate our process
                    without the full technological arsenal that this project
                    employs. DI is equipped with Photoshop CS5 and CS6, which
                    have improved upon the early HDR-merge tool so we cannot
                    attest to the usability or quality of merged images with
                    earlier versions of Photoshop. </p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p> Scholars in the field of Greek epigraphy have long been able
                    to make squeezes of inscriptions but sharing them with the
                    broader academic community has been a continuous challenge.
                    The earliest publications of inscriptions – for example the
                    Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum (SEG) and the
                    Inscriptiones Graecae (IG) - focused on providing
                    transcriptions of the text due to financial and practical
                    constraints of including photographs when the field of
                    photography was in its infancy. Thus, scholars had access to
                    the text of the inscriptions but vital contextual and visual
                    information was notably absent. A visual representation of
                    object itself is necessary for a balanced appreciation of
                    the inscription both as a text and as an archaeological
                    artifact <ptr target="#tupman2010"/>. The Internet has
                    expanded the availability of images to broader audiences but
                    the digitization of epigraphic sources, particularly
                    squeezes, continues to challenge the curators of epigraphic
                    collections. For example, Oxford University’s Centre for the
                    Study of Ancient Documents (CSAD) began an early imaging
                    project in 1997.<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/csad/">http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/csad/</ref></note>
                    Although the challenges faced by their project are the same
                    issues all other such projects face today – namely finding a
                    non-destructive means of digitally rendering the images and
                    providing access for their detailed study – CSAD’s project
                    was also confined to smaller image sizes due to server
                    constraints that are not a problem for more recent servers.<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/CSAD/Imagebank.html">http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/CSAD/Imagebank.html</ref>
                        - accessed September 23, 2014. Archival image standards
                        are 600 dpi and CSAD’s initial experiments worked with
                        images of 300 dpi and 150 dpi which were then scaled
                        down to derivative images.</note> Current digitization
                    projects are not constrained in the same way, due to
                    advances in technological capabilities and online storage
                    facilities – full-size archival standard image files no
                    longer present storage challenges for most users. However,
                    the images from CSAD are nonetheless legible, and, more
                    importantly, they represent the foundation for all other
                    digitization projects that have followed since. </p>
                <p> The imaging process presented in this article is simply the
                    latest in a long line of predecessors; our project follows
                    in the two-decade-old digital tradition, yet fully exploits
                    the technological advancements and digitizing techniques
                    used by recent projects in epigraphy, paleography,
                    papyrology, and artifact digitization. This work undertaken
                    by <title rend="italic">From Stone to Screen</title> is part
                    of a larger trend in the Digital Humanities scholarship
                    towards the development of innovative methods to fully
                    capture the three-dimensional nature of epigraphic squeezes.
                    The development of these techniques relies heavily on
                    scholarly collaboration and interdisciplinary discussions
                    both within particular university communities (such as our
                    collaboration on this project with Digitial Initiatives) and
                    with the larger academic community. In September of 2014,
                    the EAGLE (Europeana network of Ancient Greek and Latin
                    Epigraphy) International Conference on Information
                    Technologies for Epigraphy and Digital Cultural Heritage in
                    the Ancient World met in Paris.<note>

                        - accessed September 23, 2014.</note> This network aims
                    to create an e-library for Digital Epigraphy and a network
                    of scholars, students, museum curators and any one else
                    interested in Epigraphy and Cultural Heritage. Our project
                    participated in the conference and we look forward to being
                    involved in this network and future collaboration with other
                    digital projects not only to promote and discuss our own
                    collection and digitization methods but also to be part of
                    the vibrant and dynamic field of digital epigraphy. To quote
