                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>As Matthew K. Gold acknowledges in his introduction to <title rend="italic"
                        >Debates in the Digital Humanities</title>, there are some gaps, some
                    preferred object orientations, if you will, in the digital humanities. Many of
                    us and our work fall into these gaps, cracks, and in some cases, void space.
                    This work is not intended to indict the two collections examined here, <title
                        rend="italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</title> and <title
                        rend="italic">Companion to Digital Humanities</title>, and in fact I am
                    represented in <title rend="italic">Debates</title> in a piece entitled, <title
                        rend="quotes">This Digital Humanities That Is Not One.</title> The piece at
                    hand intends, rather, to apply a basic computational humanities method,
                    frequency of keyword occurrence, to bring to the surface what is and what is not
                    visible or embodied across the scope of digital humanisms. </p>
