                <p>Rather than seeing hypertext as offering only distracted reading, this paper
                    argues that annotation software provides students with the opportunity to
                    perform recursive reading: a process that facilitates knowledge transfer and
                    encourages intersectional critical approaches to texts. As hypertext editions
                    and online reading communities have proliferated, scholars have theorized that
                    these layered, interactive modes of reading produce distracted readings of
                    texts, especially in pedagogical contexts. With annotation software, however,
                    researchers and students have the opportunity not just to consume these
                    distracted readings, but to produce them. Within the classroom, annotation
                    software assignments require a deeper psychological investment from students
                    than simply consuming a hypertext edition. By choosing how and where to annotate
                    a particular text, students’ distributed modes of attention are re-focused on
                    the text itself, pulling disparate threads of thought together.</p>

                <p>It has become a cultural cliché to lament the dawn of the Internet age as the
                    death of intellectual thought. One need not look far in popular media to find
                    the myriad thinkpieces suggesting that the <ref
                        target="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/20/internet-altering-your-mind"
                        >distractibility of youth is at an all-time high</ref>, <ref

                    audiences <ref target="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-34213693">consume only
                        clickbait</ref> rather than <soCalled>real news.</soCalled> These
                    (ironically) online arguments are supported by illustratively titled volumes
                    about the evils of online reading, such as Nicholas Carr’s <title rend="italic"
                        >The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains</title> and Mark
                    Bauerlein’s <title rend="italic">The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age
                        Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes the Future</title>
                    <ptr target="#carr2010"/>
                    <ptr target="#bauerlein2008"/>. According to these authors, readers who consume
                    text exclusively or mainly online have lost the ability to concentrate on a
                    single text from beginning to end: or in other words, they are no longer linear
                    readers, dedicating their time and energy to the words on the page in the order
                    they appear. Instead, these readers are hopelessly distracted by the online
                    reading experience, as ads, embedded links, and mouse-over hovertext pull their
                    attention several directions at once, ensuring that nothing of substance enters
                    long-term memory. In this view, supported by educational studies that
                    demonstrate that reading online encourages selective consumption and lesser
                    recall <ptr target="#liu2005"/>
                    <ptr target="#carr2010"/>, the Internet’s incredible potential for information
                    sharing and computing power is too easily overshadowed by the possibly more
                    numerous possibilities for distraction and procrastination.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, defenses of reading and intellectual thought in today’s
                    hyper-connected world have become nearly as common as their critiques. In
                    particular, Jerome McGann argued early on that reading online, especially text
                    enhanced with hypertext, enables radial reading rather than (or in addition to)
                    linear reading, which <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann1991">involves decoding one or more of
                            the contexts that interpenetrate the scripted and physical text</quote>
                        <ptr target="#mcgann1991" loc="119"/>
                    </cit>. The embedded links that direct readers to images, sources, and
                    supplemental information, the online dictionaries that define words as they are
                    read, and the sheer potential for directed individual research all add up to a
                    deeper and broader reading of a text, rather than a shallower one. According to
                    McGann, moreover, hypertext only makes manifest the fact that all texts, to
                    greater and lesser extents, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann1991">function in a radial field</quote>
                        <ptr target="#mcgann1991" loc="126"/>
                    </cit>. Books have never existed in a vacuum, and to some extent the linear
                    reader who starts at the beginning of a text and reads through to the end is
                    largely a fiction: a <soCalled>linear</soCalled> reader may stop to consult with
                    a dictionary or historical source, flip to the endnotes or critical works in an
                    edited edition, or mentally or physically compare the work at hand with any
                    number of other related texts. In other words, linear reading is interrupted by
                    radial thinking. A well-designed online text, by embedding all of these
                    possibilities in a single web page, might paradoxically allow for a more
                    continuous reading experience than a physical book that would need to be put
                    down to acquire the same information. To a medievalist, hypertext can also
                    function as a modernization of a long-standing practice: consider a
                    heavily-glossed medieval Bible, in which scribes used the margins of the page to
                    both reproduce and contribute to interpretations of the text such that on some
                    pages the distinction between Biblical text and commentary is nearly erased. It
                    is difficult to argue that such commentary, while undeniably distracting, is
                    either shallow or anti-intellectual. Nor does online reading disallow or destroy
                    more traditional linear reading practices: David Dowling describes the
                    phenomenon of online reading groups communally reading <title rend="italic">Moby
                        Dick</title>, for example, and points to the revival of longform news
                    articles that are no longer limited in length by the physical standards of the
                    printed page <ptr target="#dowling2010"/>
                    <ptr target="#dowling2014"/>. Recent studies in education also suggest that the
                    reading comprehension gap between print and screen is closing <ptr
                        target="#cull2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#eden2013"/>. According to this perspective, the Internet age
                    offers new horizons of insight, knowledge, and shared intellectual work.</p>
                <p>These defenses complicate the too-attractive binary that longform linear reading
                    is <soCalled>good,</soCalled> under attack, and must be recovered in online
                    communities, while hypertext-enabled radial reading is <soCalled>bad,</soCalled>
                    distracted, and deliberately erodes traditional thought. Yet in the classroom,
                    we often reproduce such assumptions unthinkingly, assigning traditional reading
                    and writing assignments that can clash poorly with a student who is
                    accomplishing these tasks on a phone or tablet. There is also little doubt that
                    a student occupied with Facebook both contributes and learns less than one not
                    so distracted. The hyperbolic clash between naysayers predicting the end of
                    human civilization and enthusiasts pointing to a blessed new dawn faces a far
                    more prosaic reality in the classroom: that the Internet age presents neither
                    our salvation nor our damnation, but instead a set of tools. Hypertext and other
                    aspects of online text can undoubtedly enhance our students’ understanding by
                    encouraging radial reading. They can also present considerable distractions, as
                    anyone who has gone on a late-night Wikipedia binge can relate. In the
                    classroom, then, our task is to harness the potential of hypertext without
                    falling prey to the unproductive kind of distraction.</p>
                <p>In order to accomplish this goal, we considered how we might encourage students
                    to consume texts online in deliberate, scholarly ways. Many studies have already
                    indicated that online hypertext annotations can combat the tendency towards
                    shallow digital reading that <ptr target="#carr2010"/> notes in <title
                        rend="italic">The Shallows</title>. <ptr target="#porter-odonell2004"/>
                    demonstrates that annotated content promotes greater reading comprehension in
                    digital contexts than the same content without such annotations. <ptr
                        target="#chen2014"/> likewise report statistically significant improvements
                    in elementary-age students’ reading abilities with the use of a collaborative
                    annotation system. The majority of these studies, however, focus on reading
                    comprehension as the primary goal, which in the college English classroom is
                    only the necessary first step in teaching students how to critically engage with
                    a text. Our goal is not to have students simply understand the content of a
                    text, but instead to teach them to see the multivalent, polyphonic possibilities
                    in every text. We hypothesized that we could harness the same deeper reading
                    encouraged by online annotation in order to produce what we call recursive
                    reading: a process that goes beyond simple comprehension in order to facilitate
                    knowledge transfer and encourage a layered and intersectional critical approach
                    to texts.</p>

            <div>
                <head>The Role of Recursive Reading in Knowledge Transfer</head>
                <p>In pursuit of that aim, we considered how we accomplished one of the most basic
                    goals of English literature classes: teaching students to read critically. In
                    our methods class at our small liberal arts college, we teach our students
                    methodologies and theories for approaching literature — such as formalism, new
                    historicism, psychoanalytic criticism, queer theory, etc. — and we do this
                    either overtly by calling attention to the names and histories of these
                    practices, or implicitly through our own emphasis on certain approaches with
                    certain texts. For instance, if we are teaching Charles Dickens’ <title
                        rend="italic">Oliver Twist</title>, we might choose to engage new
                    historicist methods by exploring the historical implications of
                    industrialization, including background on the Poor Laws, mortality rates, and
                    the general squalor of nineteenth-century London. Alternately, if we teach
                    Chaucer’s <title rend="italic">Wife of Bath’s Tale</title>, we might approach
                    gender studies by discussing medieval conceptions of sex and gender and how both
                    are implicated in the question of authorship.</p>
                <p>Immediately problematic, however, is that while we might spend a great deal of
                    time teaching a methodological or theoretical approach in conjunction with one
                    text, that approach seemed to disappear as soon as we moved to the next text.
                    Students siloed their knowledge of a particular methodological approach, such
                    that they could apply new historicism only as it pertained to Dickens or gender
                    studies as it applied to Chaucer. What we as instructors saw as lenses a
                    critical reader might use to interrogate <emph>any</emph> text became fixed to a
                    single text, or at best a time period. The difficulty of knowledge transfer
                    became clear: students resisted seeing these concepts as dynamic, intersecting,
                    and malleable, instead fusing particular theories with individual texts or time
                    periods. There was no transfer across texts, no return to prior knowledge to
                    integrate it as we moved forward on our syllabi. </p>
                <p>In all fairness to our hard-working students, research shows that knowledge
                    transfer is difficult. As the authors of the book <title rend="italic">How
                        Learning Works</title> note: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block">Most research has found […] that (a) transfer occurs
                            neither often nor automatically, and (b) the more dissimilar the
                            learning and transfer contexts, the less likely successful transfer will
                            occur. In other words, much as we would like them to, students often do
                            not successfully apply relevant skills or knowledge in novel
                            contexts.</quote>

                    </cit> Therefore, our students’ inability to read across theoretical and
                    methodological approaches did not originate from laziness or lack of engagement,
                    but from the need for this skill to be explicitly taught rather than assumed. In
                    their germinal work on knowledge transfer, David Perkins and Gavriel Salomon
                    posit that there are a range of types of transfer. One kind of transfer <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#salomon1989">involves the spontaneous, automatic
                        transfer of highly practiced skills, with little need for reflective

                <p>Turning to the role of writing in supporting knowledge transfer, in <title
                        rend="italic">Writing Across Contexts</title>, Kathleen Yancey, et. al. ask: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#yancey2014">how we can help students develop
                            writing knowledge and practices that they can draw upon, use, and

                        <ptr target="#yancey2014" loc="2"/>
                    </cit>. Thinking about transfer in the writing context, Yancey et. al. suggest
                    sequential writing assignments which emphasize return and revision in the
                    writing process as a way of encouraging transfer. As <title rend="italic"
                        >Writing Across Contexts</title> indicates, most work about knowledge
                    transfer has considered it in the context of writing, and as a problem that can
                    be solved with writing solutions, such as assigning drafts and multiple rounds
                    of peer and instructor feedback. Yet as we continued to encounter difficulties
                    with knowledge transfer while teaching literary theory, it seemed to us that the
                    problem preexisted the writing aspect of our courses. We have all experienced
                    the student who, when faced with commentary that requires a full revision,
                    chooses to interpret that feedback in the least revelatory manner possible,
                    making few to none of the necessary changes. While for some students this
                    behavior can be linked to lack of time or interest, others with the same issue
                    lacked neither motivation nor time. What we came to discover was that for many
                    of these students, the problem lay not in their skills in writing, but to those
                    in reading. These students, once they had committed their ideas to paper, ceased
                    to regard their rough draft as <emph>writing</emph> – that is, in the full
                    present progressive sense, an idea still in progress – and instead began to see
                    it as <emph>reading</emph>. No longer was it a fluid form easily changed, but
                    instead a fixed point, more akin to one of their primary texts than their own
                    handiwork. This mindset made it almost impossible to engage in the kind of
                    revision that recursive writing requires.<note> See <ptr target="#carillo2015"/>
                        for a lengthier discussion of the role of reading in composition and
                        literature classrooms.</note> Moreover, this mindset makes it incredibly
                    difficult to learn multiple modes of theory. If, to our students, reading is a
                    fixed point, then by reading critical race theory alongside <title rend="italic"
                        >Othello</title>, it becomes impossible for students to then transfer it to
                        <title rend="italic">The Tempest</title>. In order to help solve the problem
                    of knowledge transfer, then, we needed to think more not just about writing, but
                    about how students read and interface with the texts we assign them. </p>
                <p>John Bean’s <title rend="italic">Engaging Ideas</title> lays out that for
                    students to become what he refers to in the research as <quote rend="inline"

                            predicts what will happen next, asks questions, and thinks about the use
                            of language. One of the most important steps, however, is to connect the
                            manuscript [students] are reading with what [they] already know and to
                            attach facts, ideas, concepts or perspectives to that known

                    </cit> Bean, along with Roberts and Roberts, agrees that for students to read
                    well and read deeply, they must engage and form associations with the text.
                    Elsewhere, scholars make the overt connection between recursive processes in the
                    writing practice and strong reading skills. The much-used anthology <title
                        rend="italic ">Ways of Reading</title> suggests, <cit>

                    </cit>. For Bartholomae and Petrosky, interacting with the text fuses the
                    process of reading and writing together. The recurring idea that reading and
                    writing should together emphasize a process of return and connection-making
                    suggested a method that could help us to surpass our students’ particular
                    cognitive difficulties. Furthermore, the idea of getting students to form <quote

                    content, as proposed by Roberts and Roberts, immediately called to mind digital
                    tools. Echoing McGann’s discussions of <quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann1991"
                        >radial reading</quote> that replaces linear reading, Rosenwasser and

                    </cit> The recursivity scholars like Yancey saw as so crucial to writing, and
                    Rosenwasser and Stephen to thinking, we realized was equally crucial in reading.
                    We needed to teach our students to view reading not as a one-and-done singular
                    act, but instead as a process of returning and rethinking. More than simply
                    reading a text multiple times, we needed to teach them to be recursive readers,
                    continually returning to the text (whether their own or someone else’s) with new
                    information and encountering it afresh, integrating their new knowledge with the
                    old. If we could encourage visualization via digital tools that spurred our
                    students to be recursive readers, we might begin to dismantle our particular
                    problem of siloed knowledge and encourage students to transfer knowledge across
                    contexts within our classrooms. </p>

                <head>Building the Annotation Module</head>
                <p>How could digital humanities help us teach our students to read recursively?
                    Annotation assignments seemed the obvious choice, but annotation, or text
                    markup, is not limited to digital tools, as our epigraph suggests. Interacting
                    with the text is a long-standing, analog literary practice, but one that we
                    wanted to revisit for a particular set of pedagogical outcomes. We needed to use
                    a tool that would encourage a textual interaction that was both fluid and visual
                    and that allowed students to return to the same text again and again in order to
                    emphasize rereading. We also wanted our students' work to be available to the
                    class as a whole.<note> Novak, Razzouk, and Johnson’s literature review on
                        social annotation tools further details desirable factors for annotation
                        systems <ptr target="#novak2012"/>.</note> These goals together suggested
                    that a digital annotation tool was the solution to our pedagogical problem.
                    Looking for options to enhance learning, we turned to Todd Bryant, Language
                    Technology Specialist in Dickinson College’s Academic Technology department. </p>
                <p>Bryant built a local Drupal 7 site utilizing two modules, Annotation and
                    Annotator, that allowed us to highlight and annotate text. (Code available on
                    the Drupal community site: Annotation — <ref
                        target="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation"
                        >https://www.drupal.org/project/annotation</ref> and Annotator <ref
                        target="https://www.drupal.org/project/annotator"
                        >https://www.drupal.org/project/annotator</ref>). A single Drupal 8 module
                    providing the same functionality has since been created by Sai Grandhi, a
                    Computer Science student at Dickinson College, for projects running the latest
                    version of Drupal. (Code available on the Drupal community site: <ref
                        target="https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/bryantt/2528442"
                        >https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/bryantt/2528442</ref>). Our argument for
                    using a locally hosted Drupal site over other, hosted annotation projects was
                    long-term reliability and the advantages to having a custom-built site for our
                    needs. Using a Drupal site meant that we could have our texts organized and in a
                    single location as opposed to having students share multiple Google or Office
                    365 documents. Over time, classes at Dickinson are able to add to the site as
                    well as utilize the work of previous students as examples of quality annotations
                    if desired. We also maintain the ability to make sections or even individual
                    pages of the site publicly available or private.<note> This project was approved
                        by Dickinson College’s IRB and all students directly quoted signed consent
                        forms granting us permission to cite their work.</note> Bryant also pointed
                    out, by hosting the site and the database ourselves, we would retain complete
                    access to the data created by professors and students for future digital
                    humanities projects.<note> For example, Kersh used Grandhi’s module for Drupal 8
                        to create an <ref target="https://michaelfield.dickinson.edu/">online,
                            annotated edition</ref> of the 1892 volume of poems <title rend="italic"
                            >Sight and Song</title> by Michael Field. This project uses the same
                        annotation software, but puts it to a different kind of use insofar as it
                        allows for students to encounter a volume of poetry annotated with hypertext
                        background, images, and citations. The module’s flexibility lies
                        particularly in its ability to be utilized in multiple ways: for instance,
                        as a process-oriented and ongoing project (this essay), or a footnote-style
                        augmentation of a text (<title rend="italic">Sight and Song</title>).
                    </note> In the end, a custom-built tool provided us with maximum flexibility
                    when thinking about the future use of text annotation. While we crafted a
                    highly-focused annotation project for our classrooms, the tool’s uses could
                    extend far beyond what we lay out in this essay. Additionally, by developing in
                    open source, the tools demonstrated can be utilized by others and modified to
                    fit new kinds of annotation projects. </p>
                <p>Our program allows students to log in and access their class poems. Once logged
                    in, students can add annotations by highlighting text and then typing into the
                    text box. The resulting mouse-over annotations can be edited and multiple
                    annotations can be overlaid on the same text. (See <ref target="#figure01"
                        >Figure 1</ref> for two visualizations of a poem; one with highlighted areas
                    and one showing mouse-over hovertext.) <figure xml:id="figure01">

                <p>Annotation programs, however, are not new, and if building our own Drupal site
                    had been out of the question, we could easily have turned elsewhere. Indeed,
                    other classrooms interested in the possibilities offered by annotation software
                    can look to places like Rap Genius (<ref target="https://rap.genius.com/"

                        conversations about using digital tools in the classroom, our work diverges
                        from that body of literature in that we are less interested in the social
                        aspect of annotation. While filled with the potential to allow students to
                        teach other students, we turned our attention to fostering critical thinking
                        on an individual level. Students in our classes could see other annotations,
                        but they were only responsible for their own poem. Secondly, our focus was
                        less on reading comprehension, though we see the foundational necessity for
                        their skill, and instead on higher-order metacognitive skills that allowed
                        students to see dissonance and multivalency in a single text.</note></p>

                        examines several texts of different kinds (e.g., novel, poetry, film, comic

                        puts texts in conversation with several of the critical theories and
                        methodologies that shape the discipline of literary study today (e.g.,
                        Marxist theory, new historicism, formalism, gender theory, postcolonial
                        theory, ecocriticism, etc.). This course helps students frame interpretive

                        rend="italic">Introduction to Literary Studies</title> implicitly demands
                    students learn how to utilize the knowledge of critical theories and
                    methodologies as they apply to a variety of literary objects. This means that
                    students will need to be able to transfer knowledge of theories and methods to
                    new texts within our <title rend="italic">Introduction to Literary
                        Studies</title> course as well as to later courses which will build on the
                    foundational work of the class. Using the annotation tool developed in
                    consultation with Bryant, we created an assignment where each student chose a
                    poem and annotated it throughout the term. The catch was that each student
                    returned to the <emph>same</emph> poem again and again through the class,
                    annotating it each time with at least two new annotations utilizing the
                    methodology or theory we were currently studying.</p>
                <p>What we found over the course of the term was that students began to see how the
                    theories and methodologies interacted, how their own highlighting and
                    annotations overlapped and intersected, and how repeatedly annotating the poem
                    allowed them to discover something new with each reading. This ability to return
                    to a particular reading and visually change and augment it was a moment of
                    reading deeply. Students read and re-read a text from many angles, viewing it
                    through a variety of different methodological or theoretical lenses. The
                    annotation module facilitated a digital space for students to be attentive to
                    the language of their poem through a recursive reading process. </p>
                <p>Recursive reading, or returning to and annotating a single text over and over,
                    dovetailed with our methods of writing as well. As in most classes emphasizing
                    writing, the course requires students to return to and revise drafts of papers
                    as they move through the class. Emphasizing reading as a process much like
                    writing made both writing and reading recursive, and it encouraged students to
                    approach their own drafts with the same renewed flexibility as they approached
                    their chosen poem. Finally, part of what worked particularly well here was that
                    each student chose a <emph>different</emph> poem. With a variety of poems, it
                    meant that each student became an expert on the chosen poem.<note> In both
                        Skalak and Kersh’s classes, we periodically asked students to speak aloud in
                        class about their poems and/or their annotations. This further increased the
                        students’ expertise on their poems and connected our in-class discussions
                        about theories and methodologies to the work they were doing in our online
                        platform. Finally, all annotations were visible to the other members of the
                        class, but were not publicly available. </note> At the end of a semester,
                    students were left with a visual, layered, hypertext record of their process
                    (and progress) in critical thinking, resulting in more nuanced integration of
                    critical methods in their essays and in-class work. </p>
                <p>Practically speaking, as a result of their practice with recursive reading in the
                    annotation module, we saw student improvement across three distinct course
                    assignments: knowledge transfer across annotations, analytical thinking in
                    essays, and awareness of knowledge gained in reflection essays. In the exhibits
                    that follow, we present examples of this student success. First, the annotations
                    themselves demonstrate examples of recursive reading and knowledge transfer
                    across theories and methodologies. Second, we offer an example from a student
                    essay that shows how the annotations encouraged students to see and see again,
                    prompting internal feedback that led to deeper analytical thinking in their
                    writing. Third, a final self-reflection essay assignment demonstrates evidence
                    of knowledge transfer not just within our classes, but potentially to future
                    classrooms and projects.</p>

                <head>Exhibit A: Annotations</head>
                <p>In Skalak’s class, after a four-week grounding in the literary theory of
                    formalism, students encountered a new, more conceptual lens: structuralism.
                    Scores on the weekly assignment plummeted, from an average of 8.3/10 to 5.5/10.
                    This drop was not unexpected: most students have encountered formalist
                    approaches in high school, but it is the rare secondary education that includes
                    readings on structuralism. Their initial attempts have been overwritten through
                    the semester-long revision process, but the feedback on one student’s attempt is
                    indicative of the whole. In the comment accompanying the student's numerical
                    score, Skalak writes: <quote rend="block" source="#skalak">You have pointed to a
                        binary here in this line, but pointing out a binary does not make a
                        structuralist reading. The rest of your annotation is instead formalist,
                        focused on the tone and rhythm of the line. To think about this poem as a
                        structuralist might, consider the following questions: does the poem
                        construct itself around the binary opposition you notice here, or depend
                        upon the opposition being absolute and completely opposed? Why is it
                        significant to oppose these two? How does it affect our understanding of the
                        poem to see these as opposites?</quote> From Skalak’s feedback, it is
                    apparent that this student had seized upon a key vocabulary term — binary
                    oppositions — and assumed that this sufficed to produce a structuralist reading,
                    suggesting an insufficient understanding of how to apply the theoretical
                    readings we had discussed in class. Unfortunately, the student misunderstood how
                    binaries might function within a structuralist reading. In the following week,
                    however, the class moved on to deconstruction, and once again the students faced
                    a new theoretical lens through which to view their chosen poem. Skalak
                    explicitly reminded the students that they could revisit previous sections of
                    the poem, taking a look at the same lines under a different lens. Nearly half
                    the class chose to layer their deconstruction reading directly over their
                    structuralist reading of the previous week, with auspicious results. The student
                    referenced above submitted these two responses: <figure xml:id="figure02">

                    </figure>

                        <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.jpg"/>
                    </figure> The same student who had struggled with her first structuralist
                    reading had now completely replaced her old annotation with two others: one
                    structuralist, and one that directly deconstructed that first reading. Here, the
                    student’s knowledge of formalism allowed her to see the poem’s connection
                    between inanimate goods and the sensuality of female bodies, which fueled her
                    structuralist observation that the poem creates four different categories for
                    these goods/bodies, like the <soCalled>four corners</soCalled> of the globe. Her
                    immediate re-reading of this section to reject such an easy categorization of
                    the world demonstrates her newfound understanding of deconstruction and
                    structuralism both. While not a perfect example of either theory, these attempts
                    demonstrated marked improvement. Rather than leave her lackluster attempt at
                    structuralism behind as only last week’s mistake, this recursive approach to
                    reading encouraged new, integrated learning: by reading the poem a second time,
                    this time through the lens of deconstruction, the student also came to better
                    understand the structuralism to which it responded. Even better, she
                    demonstrated successful knowledge transfer within the course as the lessons of
                    the previous week carried over into the next, building on and augmenting one
                    another. These annotations also pointed forward to our later studies of feminism
                    and critical race theory, and she returned to this section with great excitement
                    in class discussion to add further nuance to her initial readings.</p>
                <p> While Kersh’s class covered a slightly different range of critical theory,
                    evidence of transfer surfaced in annotations where students began to point out
                    readings that were catalyzed by overlapping or intersecting methodologies. For
                    example, one student began her reading of Alice Dunbar-Nelson’s <title
                        rend="quotes">Sonnet</title> by carefully trying to parse the poem’s
                    approach to love in the beginning lines, <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#dunbar-nelson">I had not thought of violets late,/ The wild, shy
                        kind that spring beneath your feet/ In wistful April days, when lovers mate/
                        And wander through the fields in raptures sweet.</quote> What started as a
                    straight close reading of the symbolism of <q>violets</q> within the sonnet
                    became much more nuanced as the student reader began to theorize the metaphor of
                    violets as it related to the gender of the poet, to the time period in which it
                    was written, and then finally to race. In the annotation assignment prompt,
                    students were directed to label their annotations with parenthetical or
                    bracketed notations that identify the methodology or theory they engage (see
                    figures above). In the <title rend="quotes">Sonnet</title> annotations, the
                    student begins simply with notations such as <q>formalism</q> or <q>new
                        historicism</q> and as the weeks progress the notations begin to reflect the
                    intersections she has found labeling one <q>post-colonialism and cultural
                        materialism</q> then, more comically, <q>cultural materialism + a bit of
                        feminism.</q> While the student’s comfort with the assignment increased
                    alongside her willingness to push the boundaries of the prompt’s requirements,
                    what became increasingly clear was how in her own reading she found the poem
                    impossible to interpret using a single lens. Similar to Skalak’s student
                    analyzing <title rend="quotes">Ithaka,</title> the student working on
                    Dunbar-Nelson’s <title>Sonnet</title> improved her own reading with each new
                    annotation. Each new interaction with the poem produced not just a
                    reconceptualization of the text, but articulated an intersection of theoretical
                    lenses. (See <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>) </p>

                <p>This process of recursive reading also proved fruitful when it came to lengthier
                    analytical essays. After several weeks of annotation practice, our classes
                    required students to write a formalist essay on their chosen poem. Many chose to
                    return to subjects they had first noted in their annotations. Returning to their
                    annotations with fresh eyes, this time aimed at producing a paper-length
                    analysis, encouraged students to expand and improve upon their initial ideas. As
                    an example, consider the following student’s initial annotation (<ref
                        target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>) and subsequent thesis: <figure

                    <quote rend="block" source="#x">Through a series of startling and unexpected
                        metaphors, John Donne makes the unusual assertion that love is, essentially,
                        nothing but deleterious. Donne employs the use of, primarily, metaphors, to
                        fully convey the destructive nature of love as a battle. These metaphors,
                        paired with the overarching theme of warfare, and finally, the conceit of
                        his heart being broken glass, effectively convey the idea that love is not
                        what most people perceive it be; it is a damaging and harmful conflict in
                        which no man can escape victorious. Just as war is a mentally and
                        emotionally scarring experience, so is love.</quote> This example may seem
                    to present nothing especially exciting: after all, writers on the subject of
                    pedagogy have known for years that revising old ideas leads to better writing
                    outcomes. This is why we have all signed on to the doctrine of first drafts,
                    second drafts, and multiple sources of targeted feedback. What makes this
                    example worthy of note, however, is that it resulted not from peer or instructor
                    feedback, or from a revision of a draft, but from a student
                        re-<emph>reading</emph> the source text and independently revising his
                    thinking. He moves from a simple observation of recurring war images to a thesis
                    which takes into account the nuances of the poem’s metaphors. </p>
                <p>From a pedagogical perspective, this kind of independent work is the holy grail
                    of student revision: the student engaged in meaningful revision of <emph>his
                        own</emph> draft. While peer review and instructor feedback is crucial to
                    the writing process, we also want students to see their own shortcomings and
                    engage with internal feedback during the revision process. And, we might add,
                        <emph>without</emph> overly burdening a time-strapped professor with yet
                    another draft to grade. One may hope, of course, that students would return to
                    re-read their primary texts and think anew on their own: but with this kind of
                    annotation assignment, we can have better expectation that they will do so.</p>

                <head>Exhibit C: Student Self-Reflection</head>
                <p>At the end of any class, we typically have two questions: first, did the students
                    learn the class objectives? Second, can they articulate what they have learned,
                    so as to better prepare them to transfer that knowledge forward to future
                    classes and future assignments? Our first two sets of examples address this
                    first concern, demonstrating how recursive reading fostered engagement with
                    critical theory and analytical writing. There we see how students rereading and
                    reworking a single text from a variety of lenses produced better, richer
                    engagement with both the lens and the primary text. One way to gauge the success
                    of this second question is to ask the students to reflect on the annotation
                    process. In a final assignment, Kersh’s students wrote a reflection paper about
                    the semester-long annotation assignment addressing two key components. First,
                    they were to outline their process for annotating their chosen poem and what
                    they learned from each annotation. Second, they were asked, <q>what did
                        annotating the poem, and then writing this paper, teach you? In other words,
                        what are you taking away from this digital poetry project after the
                        semester?</q> In the first two reflections, students articulate how their
                    process of reading changed during class, showing their own ability to engage in
                    metacognition, or thinking about how they think: <dhq:example>
                        <head>Student A, <title rend="quotes">Not marble nor the gilded
                                monuments</title> by William Shakespeare [emphasis added]</head>
                        <eg>This process, while long and at times hard to do, taught me many things.
                            I believe it taught me how to continue to look at one piece of writing
                            and analyze it through multiple perspectives, and get something new out
                            of it every time. I also learned not to get frustrated when I don’t
                            understand something right away, or I don’t see a clear understanding
                            through one theory. <hi rend="bold">Sometimes it took me two or three
                                times</hi>, reading over the poem to see how I could interpret it or
                            how it made sense through a new lens. I wouldn’t give up, but I would
                            teach myself how to breathe and come back to the poem with a fresh
                            start.</eg>
                    </dhq:example> Here, she articulates that rereading allowed her to see <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">something new… every time.</quote> Moreover,
                    what is particularly compelling about this student’s response is the way in
                    which she realizes that return <quote rend="inline" source="#private">two or
                        three times</quote> is essential to the process of reading well. Also
                    fascinating is the way she imagines her own bodily responses as she thinks about
                    and works through the poem. Her claim that <quote source="#private"
                        rend="inline">I would teach myself to breathe and come back to the poem with
                        a fresh start</quote> resonates with John Bean’s imperative that students
                    devote <quote rend="inline" source="#bean2011">energy to the tasks</quote> of
                    reading <ptr target="#bean2011" loc="162"/>. Moreover, she is teaching and
                    learning from herself; developing a critical awareness of her own process.</p>
                <p> Similar to the student working on <title rend="quotes">Not marble nor the gilded
                        monuments,</title> the next excerpt demonstrates the writer’s awareness of
                    his own process. This student muses about his newfound understanding of
                    multilayered reading: <dhq:example>
                        <head>Student B, <title rend="quotes">How do I love thee? Let me count the
                                ways</title> by Elizabeth Barrett Browning [emphasis added]</head>
                        <eg>Initially, I had been sure formalism was the most noteworthy; however,
                            as I continued along, it became clear that analyzing one piece of
                            diction, regardless of the depth of its meaning, is futile without
                            context. This is why we use so many different theories and
                            methodologies; to piece together the puzzle of the literature, to bring
                            together every background and contextual piece of evidence we can gather
                            […] <hi rend="bold">one does not exist in solitude; they must both be
                                implemented and tied together</hi> paradoxically to fully develop
                            one’s own understanding of the piece. For me, this poem is many
                            different things; a feminist critique, a denial of patriarchal beliefs;
                            yet above all, its contextual background was the thing that allowed me
                            to make these observations and view the piece through multiple lenses
                            and theories.</eg>
                    </dhq:example> Here the student articulates an exciting discovery of how
                    theories and methodologies intersect in a single text. Not only has he realized
                    that methodologies and perspectives build on one another, but that multiplicity
                    is necessary. One reading or one theoretical approach <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#private">does not exist in solitude</quote> and instead he implies
                    his own hard work <quote rend="inline" source="#private">tied</quote> the
                    readings together. </p>
                <p>Moving on to two last excerpts from the reflections, these students overtly
                    articulate knowledge transfer. Indeed, most of our students began to see the
                    connections across theories and methodologies as we progressed through the
                    class, learning to apply and understand them in new contexts. In these final two
                    examples, however, recursive reading not only opened up moments of transfer in
                    class, but also allowed them to apply recursivity outside the classroom. The
                    following example is written by a senior science major. This course was her
                    first literature class in college and she reflects: <dhq:example>
                        <head>Student C, <title rend="quotes">When I have fears that I may cease to
                                be</title> by John Keats [emphasis added]</head>
                        <eg>Analyzing a work from one perspective is effective, but using many
                            allows you to generate a composite image, a dynamic study, and a nuanced
                            view of a single piece. As previously mentioned, the process of writing
                            the annotations encouraged me to fully grasp and realize what each
                            methodology meant, instead of learning them superficially for our exam.
                            Fully realizing what this project has been and reflecting on it in this
                            paper makes me appreciate how much I've learned from this class and how
                            using different methodologies to examine a work can reveal new meanings.
                            The most important thing I’ve accomplished with my annotations is a
                            deeper understanding of how to analyze literature. <hi rend="bold">I
                                think I’ll leave this class with a set of tools that I can use to
                                recognize certain things (power dynamics, the impact of the
                                patriarchy and colonialism, the modern and historical context of a
                                piece) in literary work and any other type of non-literature work I
                                read.</hi></eg>
                    </dhq:example> Suggesting that <quote rend="inline" source="#private">new
                        meanings</quote> might surface when we analyze literature or <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">any other type of non-literature work I
                        read</quote> was a thrilling moment for us as teachers. The student’s
                    understanding of Keats’ famous poem grew exponentially over the course, but she
                    also recognized the applications of lenses and perspectives outside in areas
                    outside the classroom. Echoed in another reflection piece, this newly-declared
                    sophomore English major writes: <dhq:example>
                        <head>Student D, <title rend="quotes">Love’s Music,</title> Philip Bourke
                            Marston [emphasis added]</head>
                        <eg><hi rend="bold">This whole project taught me that not only in a literary
                                context is there many different meanings and perspectives, but there
                                is in life as well.</hi> The same approach we took to developing our
                            annotations, is the same approach everyone should take when encountering
                            strangers or life experiences. More often than not, the real story isn’t
                            explicit or on the exterior; I learned to delve deeper into conversation
                            with the world and understand that there are frequently many meanings to
                            occurrences in our lives. Outside the written word, the project has
                            taught me that when going through life it is important to understand all
                            perspectives before we try to understand the bigger picture.</eg>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p> With annotation software, we were able to create an assignment that explicitly
                    taught the skill of recursive reading, encouraging our students to stay open in
                    their approaches to the text. By layering hypertext readings on top of each
                    other, we transformed what could have been a distraction – an annotation that
                    pulls students away from linear reading of the poem – into an opportunity to
                    return to the text in a new way. Students moved freely from one critical method
                    to another, from annotation to text and back again, creating a visual picture of
                    how literary criticism works. As the above examples demonstrate, this technique
                    also prevented students from quarantining one lesson from the next, which led to
                    better critical thinking and stronger papers. </p>
                <p>Most exhilarating, at least from our perspective, is that the comments in their
                    final reflection papers reveal that some students have been able to make the
                    leap to transfer their knowledge of integrated critical theory to other areas of
                    their own lives. Students experience life through text, as conversations, media,
                    or mentally narrating their own lives. Their responses over the course of the
                    semester suggest that by using annotation to encourage recursive reading, our
                    classes might be offering theoretical lenses to think about these other texts
                    they encounter, beyond the walls of the classroom. Bell hooks ends <title

                            ourselves and our comrades, an openness of mind and heart that allows us
                            to face reality even as we collectively imagine ways to move beyond
                            boundaries, to transgress. This is education as the practice of

                    our world. Teaching students the skill of recursive reading using digital tools
