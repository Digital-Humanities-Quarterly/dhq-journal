                <p>A review of Katherine Bode's <title rend="italic">Reading by Numbers: Recalibrating the

        <body>
        <p>To enhance our understanding of overarching trends and paradigms
                in literature, digital humanists have long argued that we must
                go beyond minor expansions of the literary canon and embrace
                quantitative methodologies. Matthew Jockers, for instance,
                critiques the close reading practice of drawing <quote rend="inline" source="#jockers2013">conclusions
                about literary periods from a limited sample of texts</quote> and
                asserts that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#jockers2013">generalization from the specific can be
                particularly dangerous when the texts examined are not
                representative of the whole</quote> <ptr target="#jockers2013" loc="47"/></cit>. Along these
                lines, Katherine Bode examines Australian literary history from
                a new vantage point in her 2012 book, <title rend="italic">Reading
                    by Numbers: Recalibrating the Literary Field</title>.</p>
            <p>One of the strongest points of Bode’s analysis is her refusal to
                employ simple binaries to discuss quantitative literary studies.
                She does not position distant reading as a replacement for
                careful textual analysis, but as one tool that allows us to
                explore new questions and old assumptions — not as positivists,
                not as all-knowing, objective, bean-counting gods — but as
                humanities scholars who decline to use only half the tool chest
                available to us. Far from dismissing the salient criticisms of
                distant reading, she provides a nuanced and thoughtful response
                to critics like Katie Trumpener, Robert Tally, Gayatri Spivak,
                Rachel Serlen, and Jonathan Arac. For example, she includes
                Trumpener’s argument that distant reading reduces <quote rend="inline" source="#bode2012">books to mere
                commodities…as if the book’s content (and the irreducibility of
                authorial style) was virtually irrelevant</quote> and Arac’s claim that
                synthesizing texts this way suppresses individual reader
                interpretation via <quote rend="inline" source="#bode2012">covert
                    imperialism</quote> <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="10–11"/>. In
                response, Bode acknowledges that there is indeed a complex
                <quote rend="inline" source="#bode2012">rhetoric of objectivity and truth</quote> that surrounds computational
                methods; however, she asserts that it’s impossible to completely
                avoid power inequities in research as language itself, whether
                used in qualitative or quantitative scholarship, is inherently
                imbued with hierarchies <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="12"/>.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Bode is careful to put her own research into context,
                caveating that no database can hope to capture every scrap of
                the written word and no analysis can represent the whole truth
                of publishing history (especially since her corpus was compiled
                through archiving practices, which select some entries and omit
                others.) Instead, she is clear that her mission is not to
                unequivocally defend one method of analysis or one
                epistemological view, but to uncover new patterns in literary
                history. Thus she maintains that we need to think of numeric
                interpretations in the same way we think of text,
                recognizing:
             <cit><quote rend="block" source="#bode2012">…them as a form of representation and, as such, to explore how
                they operate and the ways in which numbers accrue authenticity
                and authority. Like language, numbers provide an imperfect and
                mediated way of accessing the world; but in the absence of any
                perfect or unmediated access, they are tools we can use in our
                attempts to understand and investigate the literary
                field.</quote> <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="12"/></cit></p>
            <p>As an explanation of her methods, in the chapter <title rend="quotes">Literary
                Studies in the Digital Age</title> Bode introduces her corpus of study:
                an online archive called <ref target="http://www.austlit.edu.au/">
                        AustLit</ref> created
                through collaboration between the National Library of Australia
                and over one hundred researchers. The archive includes hundreds
                of thousands of works and authors and is updated with new titles
                frequently <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="20"/>. Over four years, Bode studied the
                database and updated her records every six months to account for
                new entries. Ultimately, her findings are crystallized in four
                content chapters and twenty-four empirical graphs.</p>
            <p>Although she is not overly explicit about her day-to-day methods
                in the book, she notes that she relied on a process of
                <soCalled>modeling</soCalled> to generate her findings and
                conducted a <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bode2012">form of
                distant reading</quote> <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="19"/></cit>. In other words, she examined
                cross-sections of <title rend="italic">AustLit </title>bibliographic
                data to test hypotheses about readership and publishing. Then,
                based on the models and graphs she built, she identified
                patterns and explored emerging points of interest in greater
                depth. Though the book’s <title rend="quotes">Notes</title> section provides more
                information on methods and URLs within AustLit, a more overt
                explanation would have been a welcome addition to the book.</p>
            <p>Also of note, Bode’s form of exploration might not mesh with
                everyone’s definition of <soCalled>distant reading.</soCalled> In fact, her book
                title might be a misnomer if one expects a book about macro
                textual analysis or teaching a computer to identify linguistic
                genre markers (e.g. Moretti’s <title rend="italic">Graphs, Maps,
                    and Trees</title>). A more appropriate title might be <title rend="italic">Trends in Historical Publishing</title> or
                <title rend="italic">The Numbers Behind Reading</title>. In essence,
                Bode’s methods constitute more of a study of the market for
                Australian literature over time than actual computer-aided
                reading. Her introduction explains her process as <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bode2012">mining,
                modelling, and analyzing data</quote> <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="1"/></cit>; in other words,
                she does not look at the text of thousands of books via
                computational practices; rather, she examines aggregate trends
                in metadata and economic markers which show authorship,
                publishing, and readership circulation during certain historical
                periods in Australia. </p>
            <p>As a demonstration of the types of information that scholars can
                uncover with quantitative methods, Bode's chapter <title rend="quotes">Beyond the
                Book: Publishing in the Nineteenth Century</title> examines the
                publishing history of Australian authors in the 1800s. She
                investigates the relationship between Australian authors and
                British publishers to explicate the perceived marginalization of
                local publishing. Whereas one hypothesis might hold that there
                was a one-way stream of publications from colonizer to
                colonized, Bode's construction shows a much richer history of
                give-and-take between Australians and Britons with a particular
                focus on local colonial publishers. For example, she explains
                the financial challenges associated with printing books in
                Australia given the innately smaller readership base in this
                colonial era. As a result, Australian publishers had to
                diversify their publishing models to make ends meet, and many
                authors considered local publishing to be <quote rend="inline" source="#bode2012">the avenue of last
                resort</quote> due to its meager economic rewards <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="33"/>.
                Publishing their work through British publishers offered
                colonial authors more stability, the possibility of more
                reprints of their work, and a certain cultural esteem.</p>
            <p>In response to these challenges, many Australian authors turned
                to serialized publication, publishing their work in local
                newspapers instead of novels. In looking at sales figures and
                other data, Bode makes a case that scholars have not examined
                periodicals closely enough to comprehend the impact they had on
                the authorial culture of the time. In particular, her studies of
                <title rend="italic">AustLit</title> show that serial publication
                became a significant mode of production a decade earlier than
                previously thought <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="37"/>. She asserts that the rise of
                serial publications actually predated the technologies of the
                1870s that were thought to be the genesis of this mode.
                Additionally, she points out that the broad regional circulation
                of local editorial content meant that the readership of local
                authors was much broader than previously thought.</p>
            <p>Bode then jumps ahead in history in <title rend="quotes">Nostalgia and the Novel:
                Looking Back, Looking Forward</title> and examines beliefs surrounding
                the <soCalled>golden age</soCalled> of Australian publishing (circa the 1970s and
                1980s). In this section, she critiques the pervasive narrative
                that this era represents the peak of local Australian
                publishing, spurred by an increase in government funding for
                publishing activities. In contrast, Bode’s data indicates that
                local publishing was at its highest directly after World War II
                and declined during the <soCalled>golden age</soCalled> (Figures 4 and 5). This
                directly contradicts the belief that publication of Australian
                works was almost entirely the purview of Britain prior to the
                1970s. Bode speculates that much of the discrepancy between
                concrete publishing figures and perception is due to
                nationalistic desires that paint certain historical periods in
                nostalgic terms. She posits that this underlying nationalism
                elevated certain works and ideologies and effectively discounted
                other prevalent genres (like pulp fiction). Therefore, this
                selective social memory has led to an inflated view of
                publishing during the golden age. </p>
            <p>Another area of marginalization that Bode explores is that of
                gender in publishing. In <title rend="quotes">Recovering Gender: Rethinking the
                Nineteenth Century,</title> she challenges various scholarly
                perceptions of female authors. For example, she demonstrates
                that women actually represented a larger percentage of the works
                published in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries than
                previously thought (Figure 15). Her work indicates that early
                female authors were a significant component of the publishing
                market — not eclipsed and ignored writers, lacking in agency
                <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="108"/>. Mapping back to the earlier discussion of
                periodicals, this chapter also shows that women were more likely
                to be published in periodicals than men in Australia between
                1860 and 1899 (Figure 16). Additionally, although colonial male
                authors were published in novel form more often, in certain time
                periods, female authors actually exceeded male authors in terms
                of books published in Britain (Figure 18). These are just a
                small sample of Bode’s complex set of findings which redefine
                many existing conceptions of gender in publishing. </p>
            <p>Finally, Bode examines macro trends in authorship and gender from
                1945 to 2009 (Figure 19) in <title rend="quotes">The Rise of the Woman Novelist:
                Popular and Literary Trends.</title> This section reveals that males
                dominated the novel publishing field up until the 1990s when
                female novelists surpassed them. This supports existing feminist
                literature which trumpets the growing prominence of female
                publishing in the late twentieth century; however, Bode calls
                for a more nuanced understanding of such trends that does not
                rely on a binary of pre- and post-female liberation. She points
                out that much of the growth in female publications corresponded
                to an increase in popular fiction genres like romance (written
                by women for women). Ironically, many scholars consider this
                type of literature to be counter to female agency and not
                emblematic of societal liberation <ptr target="#bode2012" loc="152"/>. Thus this
                increase may signal publishing growth as driven by a popular
                market and not by a political movement. This is yet another
                example of the trends and corresponding hypotheses that Bode
                advances regarding Australian publishing</p>
            <p>Overall, <title rend="italic">Reading by Numbers</title> is a
                stimulating book that brings new quantitative methods to bear on
                longstanding questions and assumptions in Australian publishing
                history. Bode effectively demonstrates the value of these
                methods in real-world contexts without over-asserting their
                primacy or authority. Instead, she argues that applying numbers
                to literary history is one meaningful form of interpretation
                that is situated and malleable, given the ever-changing nature
                of literary records and the subjectivity of the researcher’s
                decision-making process. Her findings help us better understand
                how publication format, gender, and colonizing power affected
                publishing in Australia and how local authors developed their
                own identities alongside Britain’s influences. Applied more
                broadly, this type of research data can have important
                implications for literary scholars: enabling us to form a richer
                historical picture beyond specific privileged works, helping us
                to spot changes in the macro publishing timeline, and empowering
                close readers to know where to zoom in and look more carefully
                at shifts and anomalies in history.</p>
