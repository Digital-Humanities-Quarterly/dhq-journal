            <p>Within the field of archival science, recent attention has been paid to identifying
               scholastic practices that will ensure the development of innovative research as well
               as the preparedness of future archival educators. Information science, long the
               academic frame of archival programs in the U.S. and elsewhere, currently allows for
               considerable co-expansion with digital humanities innovations when we consider the
               possibility of digital libraries, digital archives, and web-based collections
               integrating a humanist approach to display and users' interactivity with cultural
               objects. This paper reviews a workshop dedicated to charting the relationship between
               digital humanities and archival scholarship, as well as the opportunities to refine
               curricular and theoretical development in these two disciplines. The concepts
               expressed here would facilitate the efforts of practitioners to critically examine
               issues of pedagogy, practical training, and disciplinary alignment under a goal of
               sustaining the extraordinary expansion of applied humanist theory exemplified in
               research ventures we have seen thus far. </p>

         <head>Accessioning the Digital Humanities: Report from the 1st Archival Education and
            Research Institute</head>
         <p>The Archival Education and Research Institute held in July 2009 represented the
            inaugural event of a four-year project to develop strategies and examine current issues
            in archival science. Towards the study of records with enduring value, created in many
            contexts and preserved in various formats, this Institute explored varied issues shaping
            archival work and professional manuscript curation, and offered a unique forum for
            participants to share research ideas which extend into the purview of the digital
            humanities and cultural heritage preservation. Aspects of the Institute included
            curriculum and pedagogy development, methodology workshops, research presentations, and
            interactivity with the local community. The efforts of the Institute — part of <title rend="quotes">Building the Future of Archival Education and Research,</title> an
            IMLS-funded initiative <ptr target="#aeri2009"/> — are extended to a global academic
            community, incorporating diverse perspectives from several continents regarding the
            structure and nature of archival education in universities, and archivists' relationship
            to the information science infrastructure. A workshop, <title rend="quotes">Curriculum
               Development in Digital Humanities and Archival Studies</title> was held that focused
            on digital humanities scholarship, providing one of the first platforms for digital
            humanists and archival researchers to congregate in a non-virtual meeting space and
            collectively outline future directions for digital humanities research.</p>
         <p>Conveners of the workshop brought perspectives that highlighted recent advances in
            digital library and digital collection management. Stephen Davison, head of the Digital
            Library at the University of California, Los Angeles (UC Los Angeles), illustrated the
            changes wrought when traditional collection development shifts from physical
            accumulation of objects and documents, to digital projects. Archivists are familiar with
            the concept of appraisal, having been exposed to theories and practices regarding the
            evaluation of a document's <q>enduring value,</q> viability to the institution's focus,
            and scholarly relevance.</p>
         <p>But how does a digital archivist appraise a collection which consists of potentially
            thousands of digital objects, and produce a navigable, attractive digital library which
            is accessible to non-expert users? Davison suggested that digital archivists may be
            guided in their decisions by conducting an evaluation of the collection's projected
               <q>usefulness,</q> so as to ensure that the archivist's efforts are relevant to the
            greatest number of users (though niche projects also serve the needs of specialized
            scholars, such as the Rossetti Archive at <ref target="http://www.rossettiarchive.org/">http://www.rossettiarchive.org/</ref>). Davison cited the success of projects within
            Classics, Medieval, and Tibetan studies — attributable in part to the clearance of these
            materials from copyright restrictions (still applicable to numerous 20th century
            collections), the depth of host institutions' collections, and recognition that
            researchers otherwise face the difficulties of travel to access remote materials
            in-person. Davison also spoke about developing metadata standards which serve to guide
            the project team throughout the initiative, providing uniformity and overall cohesion.
            In the case of the Encyclopedia of Egyptology (<ref target="http://escholarship.org/uc/nelc_uee">http://escholarship.org/​uc/​nelc_uee</ref>), for example, the migration of
            cuneiform is faculty-directed and peer-reviewed, and the production of digital
            surrogates is overseen by a technical team. Several other Digital Library projects have
            relied on guidelines denoting the type and repeatability of certain metadata fields and
            vocabularies <ptr target="#riemer2009"/>. Collaboration remains a key component of
            digital initiatives for several reasons: 1) original source documents must continue to
            be preserved apart from digital surrogates, 2) digital archives which are
               <q>spun-off</q> from parent library or archival institutions should contribute added
            value to the institution, and 3) from digitization to server maintenance, funding and
            infrastructure partners provide necessary sustainability.</p>
         <p>Chairing the workshop was Dr. Joshua Sternfeld, who drew attention to the academic
            interest in digital libraries with regard to faculty members seeking interactivity with
            primary documents. Sternfeld suggested that as archivists have moved their collections
            to the web (or at least established an online presence), they have not simultaneously
            innovated practices in this regard, often choosing to <q>mass-digitize</q> and transfer
            bulk material that is not described at the granular level. The work of archivists is no
            less needed once objects are made available in digital form, as archivists provide
            researchers with informed knowledge of <q>where things are</q> that is absent when the
            collection at hand consists of a glut of undescribed, unclassified files and formats.
            Sternfeld challenged the workshop participants to consider how the humanist's role in
            constructing digital archives might be to make explicit (via descriptions and
            interpretation) those scholarly motivations which are implicit to humanities
            scholarship. For example, how does one visualize doubt? Sternfeld cited several cases of
            innovative digital archive projects which have balanced contributions from scholars in
            the humanities (history and regional studies), archival science, and technology
            disciplines. The History Engine (<ref target="http://historyengine.richmond.edu/">http://historyengine.richmond.edu/</ref>) permits students to search, find, and
            contribute narrative <q>episodes</q> of historical events which are then given subject
            and geographic tags to aid in retrieval. Another site, <title rend="quotes">The World at
               the Fair: Experiences of the 1893 Columbian Exposition</title> (<ref target="http://uclawce.ats.ucla.edu/">http://uclawce.ats.ucla.edu/</ref>) is the
            result of a term course dedicated to charting and organizing a model digital archive on
            a specific subject. While these sites each represent individual coherence and focused
            intention, Sternfeld suggested that general guidelines must be developed for digital
            humanities initiatives — perhaps by the workshop participants — regarding the
            determination of overall structure, display requirements, retrieval capacity, and future
            enhancements and/or additions to digital projects. The intellectual analysis that is
            performed by archivists when writing finding aids or other guides to their collections
            provides crucial context to researchers, alerting them to the scope and content of
            materials. These aids should accompany digital collections and provide a navigable point
            of entry to the database or website.</p>
         <p>Dr. Johanna Drucker described the work of humanist scholars as it contrasts with that of
            some archival and library institutions' <q>imperial impulse</q> toward automation.
            Drucker stated that while humanists are interested in providing interpretations which
            hinge on subjective analysis, end-users of digital library collections may seek
            objectivity. An example of this tension is a deep, structured level of textual analysis
            afforded to individual digitized materials (on the one hand, a digital library) and
            large-scale patterns visible within a corpus of works, on the other. Recently, new tools
            have become available which make large-scale automation possible for a variety of
            purposes: such as those used within the TAPER Project of Tufts University (<ref target="http://dca.tufts.edu/?pid=49">http://dca.tufts.edu/​?pid=49</ref>) which is
            conducting an accession of digital records, and the SpecLab of the University of
            Virginia (<ref target="http://www.speculativecomputing.org/">http://www.speculativecomputing.org/</ref>), a series of initiatives within book
            arts, temporality, and visualization. While projects may alternately display deep
            structure within individual items or broad coverage as a group, it is essential that
            digital humanities initiatives empower the individual users in some way, encouraging
            scholarly communication by making available an intrinsically rich collection to an
            online audience <ptr target="#drucker2009"/>. For humanists who consider interpretation
            to be a primary function of their work as academics, their role as partners in digital
            collection development is to specify which aspects of humane study are most relevant,
            abstruse, or otherwise unknown to the academic community, and provide theoretical
            guidance to technologist-partners in this regard. Just as many historical accounts of
            the same event prove that there are no <q>historical truths,</q> the digital humanists
            of today and of the future have the opportunity at the present moment to draw the
            frameworks which will come to define not only humanities scholarship, but digital
            collection development for many years to come.</p>
         <p>The second half of the workshop was dedicated to discussion and group study of those
            skills and experiences which will best serve the development of the digital humanities
            field. Participants spoke provocatively about envisioning how the <q>archivist-humanist of the future</q> might perform in the context of traditional
            library institutions, archival repositories, and universities. In particular, workshop
            participants outlined training requirements, a pedagogical vision, and practical
            outcomes which would result from coursework in the digital humanities. Regarding
            pedagogy, participants noted that digital humanities research is oft content-driven,
            that is, motivated by scholars' expressed quest to interact with a particular cluster of
            humanities source material through some digital interface (i.e. literary texts in the
            case of digital epigraphy). Additionally, it was suggested that the digital humanities
            discipline can (only) define itself through the achievements and realized scope of
            individual projects (and therefore when seen as a whole greater than the sum of its
            parts, the discipline is borne). This recognition led speakers to emphasize that a
            pedagogical framework for the digital humanities would closely mirror that which is
            identified and problematized in individual humanities disciplines — and
               <emph>then</emph> realized in the digital environment (with technical partners). This
            entails a certain degree of creative visualization within particular disciplines, which
            we slated to occur well before the first web page is architected. Crafting the idea and
            scope of particular digital humanities initiatives was seen as eminently more valuable a
            pedagogical exercise than any amount of digital laying-out of content, as the latter is
            more easily mutable than the intellectual framework. For these group reports,
            participants were able to respond to and incorporate ideas generated from a bibliography
            of the digital humanities <ptr target="#sternfeld2009"/>, compiled by the conveners.
            Among twenty participants, three groups assembled within the workshop presented sets of
            both duties and skills which individuals saw as beneficial to digital humanities
            scholars. Some of the ideas proposed centered on <q>hard skills</q> such as research
            methodology and subject knowledge, and some ideas centered on <q>soft skills</q> such as
            management, communication (both within and beyond the project team), and empathy. In
            terms of project management, individuals asserted that the range of activities which
            must be performed in digital work include: selection of documents suitable for
            transformation, digitization, reformatting or standardizing, application of metadata
            standards and description, uploading of content to a stable server, promotion of the
            service, and maintenance and enhancement as feedback is received.</p>
         <p>One group of participants identified three functional areas of responsibility for the
               <q>digital humanist</q> under which all required skills would be encompassed:
            management, practice, and public presentation. Management duties would include
            leadership and supervisory skills, and an understanding of end-user experience.
            Practical duties would include training the project team to perform technical work,
            securing the relevant local technology and daily operations, and supervising digital
            development and focus points. Public responsibilities would include proactive
            representation of the project to constituencies, outreach to community partners, a
            degree of networking and collaborative coordination, and periodic colloquy. Apart from
            the <q>required</q> skills outlined above, <q>preferred</q> skills identified by these
            participants included specific knowledge of established digital archival initiatives
            such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS), an awareness of current trends in a
            rapidly progressing field, and some understanding of the human-computer interaction
            (HCI) discipline.</p>
         <p>The relative youth of the digital humanities signifies that the opportunity to align
            archival practice with digital collections is nigh. Without some allowance of those
            archival specialties which include preservation considerations, selectivity and
            appraisal, description, and security (online), digital collections run the risks of
            being unable to sustain themselves and thrive in a digital world. Trained archivists
            bring an inherent set of graduate-level skills regarding the management and
            administration of collections which would provide crucial partnership in issues of
            long-term stewardship in the digital humanities. Additionally, the workshop participants
            discussed electronic finding aids as a companion tool for digital collections
            (specifically in the sense of whether a digital-humanist would need to have experience
            in composing archival finding aids — this was considered a benefit but not an essential
            one). In addition to discussion of the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) structured
            standard, participants agreed that the larger, and more looming issue is not those
            collections which have already been described in EAD finding aids, but the numerous
            collections which have <emph>not</emph> — and which comprise the <soCalled>legacy data</soCalled> backlog inherent to many repositories <ptr target="#greene2005"/>. Within the archival field, archivists in the last five years have conspicuously
            recognized the scale of their hidden collections, and earnestly made accessible these
            materials by either a detailed or collection-level description. In preparing digital
            humanities curricula, doctoral students and faculty participants shared the awareness
            that some alignment of the digital humanities with archival education will be necessary
            not only for reasons of shared research interests (i.e. that many skills useful to
            digital humanists are also valuable to archivists) but also for more obvious reasons of
            scalability, noting the small number of archival educators in general, and those with a
            humanities background. In striving for greater recognition of digital humanist
            endeavors, we researchers can align with the information science field, advocating our
            shared knowledge goals in a way that is more <title rend="quotes">Peaceable
               Kingdom</title>
            <ptr target="#hicks1834"/> than individualistically segmentary.</p>
         <p>It is crucial that the digital humanities not only refine its extant disciplinary foci,
            but also begin to think generally and reflexively about its own sustainability, and that
            of its source data. As the digital humanities community continues growing in the
            direction of data collection and curation for born-digital (and not only
            paper-to-digital, or <q>digitized</q>) materials, the field must begin to plan for
            regular surveys and monitoring of these valuable collections. Participants acknowledged
            that in many of the projects cited above, the first few years of the project have been
            devoted to collection-building, acquisition of objects, and interface design — but as
            projects enter their <q>second phase</q> of existence, now is perhaps the best
            opportunity to realistically chart: the quantity of materials, the level of metadata
            useful to the users, any digital preservation strategy that has been applied (e.g.
            migration or emulation), and integration of the digital collections into university
            scholarship.</p>
         <p>Ongoing efforts in the digital humanities at the campus on which this conference was
            held, UC Los Angeles, included at the time of the workshop the Institute for Digital
            Research and Education, the Digital Humanities Reading Group, the Visualization Portal,
            the Experiential Technologies Center, the Center for Digital Humanities, the Keck
            Digital Cultural Mapping Program, and the revitalized Horn Press. The Institute for
            Digital Research and Education assembles faculty and researchers across the university
            in support of the shared development of computing initiatives. DH Reading Group
            discussions have thus far centered on <title rend="quotes">Pedagogical uses of real-time

            three-dimensional and historically-modeled datasets with gigabit connectivity. The
            Experiential Technologies Center supports the modeling of virtual reality digital models
            drawn from global sources (some ancient), as well as development of a graphical toolbox
            for sonic and visual applications. The Center for Digital Humanities provides technical
            support for a variety of faculty initiatives, ranging from digital library collections
            (e.g. <title rend="quotes">Orient North: Mapping Nordic Literary Culture</title>: <ref target="http://www.scandinavian.ucla.edu/orientnorth/tech.html">http://​tango.bol.ucla.edu/​orientnorth/​tech.html</ref>) to departmental and
            academic web sites. The Keck Digital Cultural Mapping Program offers coursework in
            geographic and map-based technology. The Horn Press provides pedagogical learning
            opportunities in the form of letterpress and book arts experimentation, as well as
            hands-on opportunities to experience <q>bibliographic production</q> at its core. A
            research university that is home to both professional and academic graduate programs,
            this campus supports a great amount of interdisciplinary research, and the breadth of
            disciplines represented all but ensures that new connections will be made locally well
            into the future.</p>
         <p>The challenge now is to broaden the practices that have been developed, and consider new
            institutional and independent partners who would benefit from collaboration with
            archivists and digital curators. In many areas outside of the information sciences —
            including urban planning, architecture, medical records, and commercial media and film —
            the modes of delivering information have expanded from once-purely paper-based and
            in-person methods to include online portals for retrieving and experiencing content. By
            expanding the scope of the digital humanities to include all aspects of dealing with
            digital objects — and preserving them for the long-term — this community has the
            opportunity not only to chart the direction of humanities scholarship, but also apply
            the access-oriented principles of the digital humanities and archival theory (as they
            have been thusly outlined) toward ensuring that our business and organizational
            colleagues develop project accountability and growth plans well into the future.</p>
