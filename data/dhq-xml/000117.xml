         <dhq:abstract>
            <p> Comics, comic books, and graphic novels are increasingly the target of seriously
               scholarly attention in the humanities. Moreover, comic books are exceptionally
               complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual
               elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication.
               The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial
               elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with
               other complex documents studied by humanists — illuminated manuscripts, artists’
               books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake, letterpress productions like
               those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated children’s books, and even Web pages and
               other born-digital media. Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML
               vocabulary for encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and
               related documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for developing
               CBML, reviews the various content types found in comic book publications, provides an
               overview and examples of the key features of the CBML XML vocabulary, explores some
               of the problems and challenges in the encoding and digital representation of comic
               books, and outlines plans for future work. The structural, textual, visual, and
               bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the
               general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial and
               textual elements.</p>

            <p>This study provides an introduction and rationale for the development of Comic Book
               Markup Language, or CBML, an XML<note>XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a
                  widely-adopted metalanguage that specifies a set of rules for encoding documents
                  and data and for creating application- and domain-specific markup languages for
                  encoding documents and data. XML is a recommendation of the World Wide Web
                  Consortium. See <ptr target="#bray2008"/>.</note> vocabulary for encoding
               multiform documents that are variously called comics, comic books, and
                  <soCalled>graphic novels</soCalled>
               <note>I share with many comics creators and scholars a dissatisfaction with the term
                     <hi rend="italic">graphic novel</hi>, finding it unnecessary, misleading and
                  perpetuating of a false distinction. Wikipedia's article on <ref
                     target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel#Criticism_of_the_term"
                     >Graphic novel</ref> includes a useful summary of many of the criticisms of the
                  term.</note> as well as other documents that integrate comics content<note>An
                  example is Peter David's <title>Mascot to the Rescue!</title>
                  <ptr target="#david2008"/>, a superhero-themed children’s novel that integrates
                  comics content with more traditional narrative prose. Brian Selznick’s <title>The
                     Invention of Hugo Cabret</title>
                  <ptr target="#selznick2007"/> is an illustrated novel, with many of the
                  illustrations subdivided into juxtaposed images reminiscent of comics
                  panels.</note> or that share formal features with comics content. A markup
               language is a set of machine-readable textual codes, or <soCalled>tags,</soCalled>
               that are used to identify structure, semantics, and other features of documents and
                  data.<note>Readers from the scholarly markup and digital humanities communities
                  will be familiar with many of the general issues about text encoding discussed
                  here. I am also hopeful that this essay will attract readers from the comics
                  scholarship community who may not be as familiar with text encoding, and so I go
                  into more detail about general issues of text encoding than I might
                  otherwise.</note> The application of these codes to a document is typically a
               necessary stage, often the most crucial and informative stage, of editing, analyzing,
               indexing publishing, visualizing, and otherwise studying or manipulating texts in
               digital environments. The act of encoding a document is a form of discovery, or
               prospecting, in which the encoder maps a document's structure, identifies semantic
               elements of interest, and documents relationships internal and external to the
               document. Scholarly encoding is a form of both reading and writing. The reading,
               shaped by the constraints of a markup language, is inscribed upon and embedded within
               the digital text. As literary scholar and digital humanist Jerome McGann has noted, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann2001">When you mark up a text you are ipso
                     facto reading and interpreting it. A … text marked up in TEI [a scholarly
                     encoding language] has been subjected to a certain kind of
                     interpretation</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mcgann2001" loc="143"/>
               </cit>. Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, and Renear assert that markup is constitutive of
               meaning, markup is interpretive, markup is performative, markup acknowledges or
               licenses inferences about the text: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#sperbergmcqueen2000">
                     <p>Markup is inserted into textual material not at random, but to convey some
                        meaning.</p>
                     <p> An author may supply markup as part of the act of composing a text; in this
                        case the markup expresses the author’s intentions, e.g. as to the structure
                        or appearance of the text. The author creates a section heading, for
                        example, by creating an appropriate element in the document; the content of
                        that element is a section heading because the author says so, and the markup
                        is simply the method by which the author says so. The markup, that is, has
                           <hi rend="italic">performative</hi> significance. </p>
                     <p> In other cases, markup is supplied as part of the transcription in
                        electronic form of pre-existing material. In such cases, markup reflects the
                        understanding of the text held by the transcriber; we say that the markup
                           <hi rend="italic">expresses a claim</hi> about the text. The transcriber
                        identifies a section heading in the pre-existing text by transcribing it and
                        tagging it as a section heading; the content of that element is a section
                        heading if the transcriber’s interpretation is correct, but other
                        interpreters might disagree; it is plausible to imagine discussions over
                        whether a given way of marking up a text is correct or incorrect.<note>The

                     <p> In the one case, markup is constitutive of the meaning; in the other, it is
                        interpretive. In each case, the reader may legitimately use the markup to
                        make inferences about the structure and properties of the text. For this
                        reason, we say that markup <hi rend="italic">licenses certain

            <p>Julia Flanders' discussion of scholarly text encoding privileges the role of the
               researcher/encoder and likens the encoded text to the scholarly article: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#flanders2005">
                     <p>Perhaps we need to look to the pleasure of mutability. To recuperate XML,
                        politically and aesthetically, we should be looking not to the paradigms of
                        XML usage that arise from librarianship and from industry-level ideas of the
                        separability of form and content, but rather to paradigms of performance of
                        a different kind. By shifting our view we can understand XML as a way of
                        expressing perspectival understandings of the text: not as a way of
                        capturing what is timeless and essential, but as a way of inscribing our own
                        changeable will on the text — in other words, as a form of reading. Seen
                        this way, XML's presentational flexibility derives not from a separation of
                        presentation and content, but rather from the shifting vantage points from
                        which the text appears to us, the shifting relationships that constrain our
                        understanding of it, the adaptability and strategic positioning of our own
                        readerly motivations.</p>
                     <p> Ironically, this is a view which emerges most clearly at the margins of
                        current digital text practice. It is not visible in the large digital
                        library projects, whose workflow has come to resemble an industrial
                        operation complete with offshore outsourcing, detailed division of labor,
                        reliance on automation and robotics, and an emphasis, in the output, on
                        uniformity and quantity (thankfully planned obsolescence has not yet become
                        part of the strategy). But we can find it in the small projects designed by
                        individual faculty, typically in conjunction with their teaching, to create
                        digital versions of individual texts which serve as readings: often
                        idiosyncratic, unscalable, representing private insight. They function more
                        like an article than an archive, as a local, contingent expression of
                        insight.</p>

            <p> The development of a markup language that can support such scholarly reading and
               interpretation necessitates a careful study and analysis of the content, structure,
               and semantics of the class or classes of documents for which the language is designed

            <head>The <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> of Comic Book Markup Language</head>
            <p>The language under discussion here is called Comic <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> Markup
               Language in part to highlight the book-ness and bookishness of these documents, their
               material properties and bibliographic characteristics. Graphic narratives typically
               manifest as <soCalled>books,</soCalled> stapled or otherwise bound leaves, perhaps
               thirty-six pages, with an interesting and complex structure, incorporating the
               graphic narrative — the sequential art and text or <soCalled>comics</soCalled>
               content — alongside a rich assortment of paratexts: advertisements, fan mail, and so
               on. The emphasis on both <soCalled>comics</soCalled> and <soCalled>books</soCalled>
               in the title of the language signals an awareness of the full range of content in the
               material artifact and the integration of comics content with related paratextual
               content. The material properties of the book — the codex form, the leaves and pages,
               the physical properties of the paper — are inseparable from the structure, pacing,
               and design of the narrative. Certainly less page-bound organizational and
               compositional frameworks are possible, such as the newspaper strips with long-running
               narrative arcs, in which the daily <soCalled>strip</soCalled> of three or four panels
               is the basic structural unit.</p>
            <p> The traditional grouping of panels into deliberately composed groups (often
               corresponding to the physical page or the <soCalled>strip</soCalled> of a newspaper
               daily) is being challenged by changing publishing and reading technologies. iPhones
               and other smartphones have become popular devices for reading newly published comics
               as well as <soCalled>reprints</soCalled> of older comics. However, a full-page grid
               of panels is not easily readable on the smaller screen of the typical smartphone, so
               the software interfaces on such devices focus on a single panel at a time. The
               deliberate juxtaposition of graphic and textual elements in the original composition
               is shattered by the interface requirements and limitations of the reading device. As
               new comics work is increasingly targeted at such digital platforms, the traditional
               grouping of panels into compositional units resembling pages may be abandoned for new
               compositional strategies. Larger format devices like the iPad and other tablets are
               better able to represent full-page compositions of panels while also allowing zooming
               in to focus on individual panels. The isolation of a panel from its surrounding
               context is not easily achieved in print media. While the reader's eyes and attention
               may focus on a single panel at a time, other panels on the page remain in the
               reader's field of vision. The migration of comics content to digital reading devices,
               and the structural and aesthetic implications of that migration, call attention to
               the impact of the material characteristics of the comic book document.</p>
            <p>Comic books are often very formally self-conscious documents and express a
               fascination with their own bibliographic identities — creators (comic book writers
               and artists) become characters in the narrative, editorial notes refer to episodes
               from prior issues, comic books and paratextual elements, such as advertisements, are
               parodied within the comic book narrative, publication milestones (such as the first,
               fiftieth, or one hundredth issue are highlighted and celebrated. These literary,
               rhetorical, and commercial moves point to a self-awareness of the comic book as
               document and bibliographic object.</p>
            <p>CBML is intended primarily for representing, modeling, and analyzing twentieth- and
               twenty-first-century comic books, daily comic strips, longer narratives or
                  <soCalled>graphic novels,</soCalled> and Web comics and other comics content
               published on digital platforms, such as smartphones and tablets. CBML may also serve
               as a possible solution for encoding certain documents we might not normally
               characterize as comics or comic books, but which share many formal characteristics
               with comics. In his influential <title>Understanding Comics</title>, Scott McCloud's

            <head>Goals and Motivations</head>
            <p>Comic books and graphic novels have been the subject of serious critical attention
               for some time, and increasingly so with the emergence of scholarly disciplines such
               as popular cultural studies and new areas of interest in traditional scholarly fields
               such as English and American literature. In 1992, Art Spiegelman won the Pulitzer
               Prize for his <title rend="italic">Maus</title>, a comic book narrative of holocaust
               survival. In 2001, Michael Chabon won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel <title>The
                  Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</title>, which relates the experience of
               two Jewish cousins working in the nascent comic book industry at the beginning of
               WWII. Comic books and the mythologies they have spawned continue to be a vital part
               of our popular culture and national consciousness. Witness the surprising and almost
               unprecedented popularity of the recent spate of superhero feature films based on the
               characters of Marvel and DC, the two largest publishers of comic books. In the 70s,
               80s, and 90s, the Superman and Batman film franchises produced regular blockbusters.
               Since the more recent financial and critical success of Marvel’s X-Men and Spider-Man
               film franchises, the film industry has been flooded with films based on comic books,
               many based on mainstream super hero comics, others adapted from realistic, personal,
               and autobiographical graphic narratives, often published by smaller publishers. In
               2012, Marvel’s <title>The Avengers</title> film from Walt Disney Studios broke all
               previous box office records with over $200 million in ticket sales for the biggest
               opening weekend of all time <ptr target="#barnes2012"/>.<note>Additional examples of
                  recent comic book film adaptations include <title>From Hell</title> (2001),

               articles, monographs, and in school and university classrooms, demonstrate the
               continuing and perhaps increasing importance of comic books as an art form and
               cultural touchstone.</p>
            <p>Like the study of other popular art forms — film, television, jazz, rock — comics
               scholarship is a thriving field of academic research. Scholarly books about comics
               are being published by university presses<note>The University Press of Mississippi
                  publishes dozens of comics related titles. See, for instance, <ptr

               peer-reviewed journals such as <title rend="italic">The Journal of Popular
                  Culture</title>. In 2008, <title>English Language Notes</title>, published an

            <p>In light of the ongoing cultural and scholarly relevance of comics, one goal of CBML
               is to support the study and analysis of comic books in the way that digital
               collections of, for instance, English poetry or American fiction support the study
               and analysis of more traditional literary forms. A large corpus of digitized comic
               books, along with encoded transcriptions and descriptive metadata, would allow
               scholars to search the text of comic books, search for keywords related to topics of
               interest, search for the appearance of particular characters, or search for works by
               particular writers and artists. Additionally, when exploited to its full potential, a
               large CBML collection would allow searching — and other forms of computer processing
               and computational analysis — based on structural, aesthetic, and informational and
               documentary features peculiar to the genre of comic books.</p>
            <p>Large digital collections of comic books would support the types of searching that is
               now taken for granted in large digital collections of literary and other texts. This
               sort of functionality has proven incredibly useful and has transformed the ways in
               which scholars and students conduct research and <soCalled>read.</soCalled> This now
               commonplace functionality though can be particularly significant for the study of
               comics, given the complexity of the fictional universes that have developed in the
               works of many comics publishers. For instance, major characters like Superman,
               Batman, Spider-Man and Wolverine appear regularly in multiple titles. DC Comics'
               Batman is the featured character in <title>Batman</title>, <title>Detective
                  Comics</title>, and other titles; he is a prominent member of the Justice League
               superhero teams featured in a number of different titles; and he shares adventures
               with other heroes in titles such as <title>The Brave and the Bold</title> and
                  <title>World’s Finest</title>. Since Batman shares the same fictional universe
               with most of DC’s other characters, he will make frequent <soCalled>guest
                  appearances</soCalled> across their entire line of publications. One will even
               find publishers occasionally cooperating to merge their fictional universes and
               publish works that feature, for instance, Superman from DC and Spider-Man from
               Marvel. Therefore, a scholar researching the development and representation of a
               particular character cannot confine herself to a small number of publications, but
               must consider almost the full output of a publisher or even multiple publishers.</p>

            <p>We've been looking thus far at some of the more practical goals for CBML, providing a
               digital format to support digital research collections that in turn support different
               types of searching and digitally-enabled analysis. Another motivation behind the
               development of CBML is the desire to explore more generally the modeling and
               representation of the broader class of documents that tightly integrate pictorial
               images and text. Comic books are just one such type of complex graphic document;
               other examples include illuminated manuscripts; seventeenth-century alchemical
               manuscripts, with hand-drawn figures and graphic symbols; artists’ books; artists’
               sketchbooks; illustrated poems like those of William Blake; letterpress productions
               like those of the Kelmscott Press; illustrated children’s books; newspaper and
               magazine advertisements; and even Web pages and other born-digital media. Comic books
               provide some of the more obvious examples of this integration and co-dependence of
               image and text, but lessons learned in the modeling of comic books may be applied to
               other forms.</p>

            <p>The miniatures pictured in <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref> and <ref
                  target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>, tightly integrate text and image. Moreover, we
               find discreet, bordered, sequential images, similar to comic book panels, and text
               representing speech, like comic book word balloons, originating from the figures’
               mouths. In <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>, below the
                  <soCalled>panels</soCalled> we find explanatory text, similar to the narrative
               captions found in comic books. Such examples illustrate formal and structural
               features of comics shared by many other document types. The analytical and
               descriptive strategies of TEI and CBML may prove useful in studying not just modern
               comics but an even more historically and culturally diverse assortment of document
               types. </p>
            <p>Perhaps the most significant motivation behind the development of CBML is the wish to
               support for comic books and related documents the interpretive strategies and
               inscriptions of readings — discussed in the introduction above — that occur when a
               text is encoded. Unlike the traditional academic essay, in which a reading or
               analysis is sprinkled with relevant quotations from primary source materials, an
               encoded text may combine a digital representation of a full source text inscribed, in
               the form of markup, by a reading and performance of the text. Like the image and text
               of a comic book, the source text and the scholar's reading and analysis are
               inextricably intermingled in the encoded document. Encoded documents are
               metadocuments <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#drucker2009">which describe and enhance information
                     but also serve as performative instruments.… As texts that describe a language,
                     naming and articulating its structures, forms, and functions they
                     [metalanguages and metatexts] seem to trump languages that are used merely for
                     composition or expression</quote>

               </cit>. CBML facilitates more transformative reading strategies that have developed
               in response to the increasing numbers of high-quality digital and digitized
               documents. Literary scholar Franco Moretti has popularized the term <soCalled>distant
                  reading</soCalled> to describe strategies for analyzing massive numbers of
               literary and historical documents: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#moretti2000"> [I]f you want to look beyond the canon
                     … close reading will not do it. It’s not designed to do it, it’s designed to do
                     the opposite. At bottom, it’s a theological exercise — very solemn treatment of
                     very few texts taken very seriously — whereas what we really need is a little
                     pact with the devil: we know how to read texts, now let’s learn how not to read
                     them. Distant reading: where distance … <hi rend="italic">is a condition of
                        knowledge</hi>: it allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or
                     much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes — or genres and systems. And
                     if, between the very small and the very large, the text itself disappears,
                     well, it is one of those cases when one can justifiably say, Less is more. If
                     we want to understand the system in its entirety, we must accept losing
                     something.</quote>

            </p>
            <p> Digital technologies facilitate both close and distant reading strategies.
               Individual comic books and graphic narratives may be better understood through
               strategies of close reading, with careful attention paid to minute details of
               linguistic and visual language and document features, but comic books as a system and
               extended comic book narratives — which often unfold over decades in thousands or tens
               of thousands of individual documents by hundreds of creators (writers and artists) —
               benefit also from the distant reading (of text, image, and metadata) from comic book
               documents.</p>
            <p> CBML aims to support such digitally-enabled and embedded performances and readings
               in comic books and across a range of graphics-intensive documents. This motivation is
               not unique to the study of comics or the development of CBML, but comic books and
               related documents do have particular, if not unique, features that must be supported
               in markup languages if we are to realize this goal.</p>

            <head>Encoding the Comic Book</head>
            <p>The following sections examine features and content of comic book documents and
               propose encoding strategies for representing, documenting, and analyzing those
               features and content types. These encoding strategies incorporate both new elements
               introduced in the CBML customization and existing TEI elements.</p>
            <p>The comic book is a particularly complex class of document. A typical comic book,
               from the early twentieth century to the present, contains diverse content types.
               Alongside and intermingled with comics content, we may find prose fiction,
               advertisements, editorial and promotional content, fan mail, and bibliographic
               metadata about creators and publication details.</p>

               <p>By <soCalled>comics</soCalled> content, I refer to the sequential art — usually
                  combined with text — of the comics narrative. Comics content is typically divided
                  into panels (usually with clearly delineated borders) that include images,
                  narrative captions, word balloons, and sound effects (POW! SMASH! FOOM!). <figure

               <p> A great deal of comics scholarship examines these individual elements in the
                  context of the aesthetics, architectonics, and grammar of comics — how comics
                  work, the systems and semantics, the structural components, the mutual
                  dependencies of text and image, and how these textual and graphic components
                  function together to convey information, narrative, plot, character,
                     etc.<note>Comics scholarship also includes historical studies, studies of
                     individual writers and artists, and investigations of traditional literary
                     issues of theme, plot, narrative and character; as well as representations of
                     politics, class, race, and gender <ptr target="#capitanio2010"/>

                  meta-comic about the art and form of comics, that includes this frequently-cited
                  definition of comics: <figure xml:id="figure05">

                           art</soCalled>: His full definition reads: <q>Juxtaposed pictorial and
                           other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information
                           and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer.</q>

               </p>
               <p>A possible objection to McCloud's definition is its subordination of text to
                  image. In fact, McCloud's definition makes no mention of text. Certainly one can
                  find examples of comics without any words, but, as McCloud acknowledges, the vast
                  majority of comics do in fact contain a great deal of text of different types. The
                  intricate and complex interplay between text and image is one of the defining
                  features of most comic books. While we typically say that we <emph>watch</emph>,
                     <emph>view</emph>, or <emph>see</emph> a film, we more often say that we
                     <emph>read</emph> a comic. Lawrence L. Abbott, Henry John Pratt and others have
                  emphasized the characterization of comics as a <soCalled>read</soCalled> medium
                     <ptr target="#abbott1986"/>
                  <ptr target="#pratt2009"/>. Abbott stresses this characterization in part to
                  bolster his argument for the preeminence of text over image in comics: <cit>

                        the literary in comic art is one of the subtlest realities of the
                        medium</quote>
                     <ptr target="#abbott1986" loc="156"/>
                  </cit>. David Carrier places a similar emphasis, not just on text, but on the
                  distinctive text — the speech balloon — of comics: <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#carrier2000">The speech balloon is a defining
                        element of the comic because it establishes a word/image unity that
                        distinguishes comics from pictures illustrating a text</quote>
                     <ptr target="#carrier2000" loc="4"/>
                  </cit>. The ability to identify and characterize textual components of comics art
                  and to describe and analyze the interplay between text and image is one of the
                  chief aims of CBML. TEI provides a host of options to support extensive analysis,
                  textual criticism, and annotation. CBML suggests applications of existing TEI
                  markup for encoding many of the distinctive features of comics and also provides a
                  handful of additional elements for distinctive features that are not adequately
                  handled by existing TEI markup. </p>
               <p>In the discussion that follows, I shall use the terms <soCalled>comics</soCalled>

                     CBML attributes to describe the structure and semantics of the panel.</p>
                  <p>The <gi>cbml:caption</gi> and <gi>cbml:balloon</gi> elements, described in more
                     detail below, are used to encode these common components of comics panels. A
                     TEI element <gi>sound</gi> is used to encode another common panel element, the
                     graphical/textual representation of a sound in the narrative. One might imagine
                     this element to be as peculiar to comics as the narrative caption or balloon,
                     yet TEI provides the <gi>sound</gi> element, which seems to suffice. The
                        <title>TEI Guidelines</title> explain that <gi>sound</gi> is intended to

                     script, but comics and film share many similarities, and the scholarship on
                     comics often notes these similarities.<note>See for instance Johanna Drucker’s

                        <ptr target="#drucker2008"/>.</note> That the TEI element <gi>sound</gi>,
                     designed to describe a phenomenon found in film, works so well, without any
                     particularly wrenching semantic deformation, in the context of comic books is
                     further evidence of the similarities shared by these two forms.</p>
                  <p>The <att>n</att> attribute on <gi>cbml:panel</gi> is a TEI
                        <soCalled>global</soCalled> attribute, meaning it is available on all TEI
                     elements. The <att>n</att> attribute may be used to provide a number or other
                     label to the element. Depending on the needs of one’s content or analysis, one
                     could use <att>n</att> to provide a descriptive label or sequential number to a
                     panel. In the example above, <code>n="5"</code> indicates that this panel is
                     sequentially the fifth panel among a larger group of panels, such as those
                     appearing on a single page.<note>Additional global attributes include
                           <gi>xml:id</gi>, for providing an element with a unique identifier;
                           <att>rend</att> and <att>rendition</att>, two related attributes used to
                        describe how the element is rendered or styled in the source document; and
                           <att>xml:lang</att>, for indicating the language of the text in the
                        element. More global attributes, such as those used for linking and analysis
                        are added by including optional TEI modules in one's schema.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>More interesting perhaps is the <att>characters</att> attribute, a custom CBML
                     attribute used to identify the characters appearing in any given panel. The
                        <att>character</att> attribute contains, in TEI lingo, one or more <hi
                        rend="monospace">data.pointer</hi> values. In the example above
                        <code>#cap</code> and <code>#anon_man</code> point to elements, with unique
                     identifiers of <code>cap</code> and <code>anon_man</code>, in the
                        <gi>teiHeader</gi>. These elements in the <gi>teiHeader</gi> provide more
                     detailed information about the characters Captain America and
                        <soCalled>anonymous man.</soCalled> The <gi>teiHeader</gi> is a mandatory
                     and potentially very large TEI element that prefaces the encoded transcription
                     of the document. The <gi>teiHeader</gi> provides a great deal of detailed
                     descriptive information and other metadata about both the digital file and the
                     source document. And it may, for instance, provide detailed information about
                     all the characters appearing within a given document. With a large collection
                     of comic books encoded using these mechanisms from CBML and TEI, a search
                     interface could provide users the ability to retrieve instantly, from thousands
                     or tens of thousands of comics, all the panels containing a character of
                     interest, regardless of whether or not the character's name appears in the
                     original panel. </p>
                  <p>In <ref target="#eg01">Example 1</ref> above the TEI <att>ana</att> attribute
                     is used to describe the transition from the previous panel to the current
                     panel. The attribute <att>ana</att>, short for <hi rend="italic">analysis</hi>,
                     is another global TEI attribute (activated by inclusion of the optional TEI
                     analysis module) that points to one or more elements containing interpretations
                     of the element on which the <att>ana</att> attribute appears. Typically
                        <att>ana</att> points to one or more <gi>interp</gi>, short for <hi
                        rend="italic">interpretation</hi>, elements. The document from which the
                     above fragment is taken also contains this code: <dhq:example>
                        <head>CBML fragment listing a vocabulary that may be used to characterize
                           transitions from one panel to the next. The above example uses McCloud’s
                           transition types defined in his <title>Understanding Comics</title>
                           <ptr target="#mccloud1993" loc="70–72"/>. Of course, the encoder/editor
                           may choose to augment or replace McCloud’s vocabulary with any suitable
                           typology. </head>

                     responsible for the interpretations, for instance, the editor or author of the
                     encoded document. A description (<gi>desc</gi>) inside <gi>interpGrp</gi>,
                     explains the purpose and rationale for the interpretation group. Finally, a
                     sequence of <gi>interp</gi> elements lists six possible panel-to-panel
                     transitions, using a vocabulary borrowed from Scott McCloud, as explained in
                     the description for the interpretation group. The
                        <att>ana</att>/<gi>interp</gi> mechanism is an extremely flexible one
                     provided by TEI to encode multiple avenues of interpretations and analysis. One
                     could, for instance, use this mechanism to record typologies related to visual
                     motifs, actions and gestures, or gender representations and roles.</p>

                  <p> Panels, especially in print comic books, are not presented as a continuous,
                     unbroken stream of narrative units, nor are they randomly laid out in sequence
                     across a series of pages. The total collection of panels that make up a comics
                     narrative are subdivided into panel groups. The sequence of panels that a
                     reader has in her field of vision is typically an intentionally composed
                     composite component of the larger work. For instance, a panel depicting a
                     moment of high suspense might occur as the last panel of a recto page, forcing
                     a lingering suspenseful pause while the reader turns the page to reveal the
                     resolution of the suspense in the first panel of the verso page. These
                     carefully composed panel groups often correspond to a physical page, but a
                     panel group may share a physical page with advertisements or other content or
                     may correspond to two physical pages of a two-page spread, in which panels are
                     read from left to right, top to bottom across two opposing verso and recto
                     pages. To capture this level of composition, CBML adopts the TEI <gi>div</gi>
                     element, which is meant to encode a subdivision of the text. The
                        <att>type</att> attribute on <gi>div</gi> is used to indicate the type of
                     textual subdivision, e.g., chapter, act, scene, canto, etc. In this case we use
                     the string <q>panelGrp</q> to indicate the division is a grouping of panels.
                     Another attribute, <att>subtype</att>, is also available to distinguish further
                     between different types of panel groups. Of course, the generic <gi>div</gi>
                     element may also be used in CBML to encode other subdivisions, such as chapters
                     or <soCalled>parts,</soCalled> which are commonly found in comics.</p>

                  <p>A number of textual and graphic elements make up the content of individual
                     panels. Textual content is found primarily in narrative captions and word
                     balloons. Abbott provides a brief description of these elements: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#abbott1986">Narration is placed in squared-off
                           areas [narrative captions], usually colored yellow in comic books.
                           Dialogue is located in white <q>balloons</q> that include little pointed
                           projections indicating the speaker. Unspoken thoughts follow a similar
                           pattern except that the balloons are billowy, and a string of small white
                           circles leads to the thinker. Both narration and dialogue are recognized
                           as extra-visual phenomena that may share space in the panel plane with
                           the drawing but are not part of the scene. The visual assumption is that
                           narration and dialogue lie on the plane of the opening through which one
                           views the scene, augmenting the pictorial element but not part of
                           it.</quote>

                     </cit> Abbott’s description is accurate but incomplete. In addition to speech
                     and thought balloons, one may find other types of balloons in comic book
                     content. For instance, since so many genres of comics concern supernatural,
                     speculative, fantastic, and science fiction narratives,
                        <soCalled>telepathic</soCalled> balloons are not uncommon and are visually
                     distinct from standard speech or thought balloons. <figure xml:id="figure08">
                        <head>Professor Charles Xavier — leader of the X-Men, a team of
                           super-powered mutants — is one of the more famous telepathic characters
                           in comic books. The panel above shows Professor Xavier sending a
                           telepathic message to his X-Men and provides an example of the
                           distinctive balloons used to represent telepathic messages <ptr
                              target="#lee1963"/>. The balloon is styled similarly to a thought
                           balloon but has additional clusters of small straight lines radiating out
                           from the billowy, bubbly thought balloon. Such a balloon might be encoded
                           as <code>&lt;cbml:balloon type="telepathic"&gt;</code>.</head>

                        <soCalled>audio</soCalled> balloons may be found emanating from radios,
                     televisions, telephones, walkie-talkies, hi-fi speakers, and other devices.
                     These <soCalled>audio</soCalled> balloons are usually represented by jagged
                     pointy borders, perhaps suggestive of the electricity that powers the audio
                     source. <figure xml:id="figure09">

                  <p> One also finds a great deal of graphic stylistic variation among speech
                     balloons. For instance, a character like the Vision, from Marvel Comics’
                        <title>The Avengers</title> superhero team, is usually depicted with
                     stylized speech balloons that highlight his android origins. Interestingly,
                     when the Vision made his first appearance in <title>The Avengers</title> #57 in
                     October 1968, his speech balloons were not styled differently from other
                     characters. Later, the text inside the Vision’s speech balloons would be styled
                     in a hand-written italics. The rectangular balloons with rounded corners were
                     introduced in issue #91 in 1971. A yellowish tint was added to the balloons two
                     months later in issue #93 and this convention has now persisted for over
                     thirty-five years. This evolution of the graphic representation of the Vision's
                     speech might be tied to an analysis of other aspects of the character's
                     development. <figure xml:id="figure10">

                     </figure> The Vision's speech balloon is, however, still a speech balloon, but
                     it is styled differently than other conventional speech balloons. TEI is
                     equipped with a suite of elements and attributes (<gi>rendition</gi>,
                        <att>rendition</att>, and <att>rend</att>) to describe the styling, or
                        <soCalled>rendition</soCalled> of various elements in source documents. In
                     primarily textual documents, the <gi>rendition</gi> element and related
                     attributes might be used to describe details such as font family, font size,
                     justification, and son on. The rendition features of TEI may be used in CBML
                     contexts to describe graphical features, for instance to provide a detailed
                     description of the distinctive styling of the android's speech balloon. </p>
                  <p>Another convention for presenting characters’ speech and thoughts in comics
                     eliminates balloons entirely and instead uses captions that incorporate both
                     narrative text and the dialogue/monologue text usually found in balloons. At
                     the other extreme are comics that contain balloons but lack narrative captions.
                     The presence or absence of captions and balloons are particularly interesting
                     examples of meaningful structural variation found in comics. The basic
                     structures of the graphic panels and pictorial elements may be similar, but the
                     structures of the textual elements are completely different. For McCloud, who
                     privileges the pictorial, the different textual structures may be of interest
                     but do not affect the content’s status as comics. For other scholars who
                     privilege the textual over the pictorial — Carrier, for instance — the lack of
                     text balloons may mean that such documents are simply illustrated stories and
                     not comics at all <ptr target="#carrier2000" loc="4, 27–45"/>. Certainly, these
                     structures have important generic implications. The use of separate narrative
                     captions and balloons results in structures that closely resembles the textual
                     structures found in drama and film, while the absence of balloons results in
                     structures that more closely resemble prose fiction. A complete absence of
                     narrative captions is a likely indicator of the absence of a narrator in the
                     text, while comics with a high number of narrative captions might indicate a
                     very strong narrative presence. An examination of the absence, presence, and
                     frequency of narrative captions and balloons could be a useful strategy for
                     analyzing the role of narration and the narrator in comics generally or in a
                     particular title or author. </p>

                  <p>Diegetic documents are another important textual and graphic feature of comics
                     narratives. Diegetic documents appear in the comics art as part of the
                     narrative’s fictional universe. Such documents can be seen and
                        <soCalled>read</soCalled> by the narrative's characters. We find diegetic
                     documents or text appearing as street signs, store front signage, billboards,
                     newspaper headlines, or even full newspaper articles. Pratt discusses clearly
                     diegetic text and the degrees to which other text (balloons, captions, sound
                     effects) may also be diegetic: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#pratt2009">The words within comics have an
                           interesting relationship to the diegesis, the story world that is
                              <soCalled>real</soCalled> to and hence can be experienced by the
                           characters who populate it. When a street number or a postcard is
                           depicted in a comic, it is diegetic. Not only the reader, but also the
                           characters can see it. However, only the reader can see the other types
                           of words that occur in comics. The characters cannot see word balloons,
                           sound effects, or narration (leaving aside cases where, for example,
                           comics artists playfully have their characters interact with word
                           balloons: breaking them, using them to float, and so on). But these
                           features are not exactly non-diegetic. Though characters cannot see
                           speech balloons, they can hear the words in them, and presumably each
                           character is aware of the contents of his or her own thought balloons.
                           When there are sound effects, characters can hear them, though the sounds
                           heard within the diegesis may not be exactly the same as the sounds
                           depicted in words. <soCalled>Kablammo!</soCalled> may be onomatopoetic,
                           but it cannot capture the exact sound of an explosion. And characters may
                           even be aware of narration, as is the case where one of the characters is
                           also the narrator, or in the unusual situation where a character reacts
                           directly to an impersonal narrator.</quote>

               <p>Comic book fan mail has great potential value to scholars studying comics. Fan
                  mail highlights the social aspect of comic book creation and readership; the role
                  of the reader in the creation, expansion, and elucidation of the larger,
                  collective fictional universes of comics narratives; the often intense and
                  intimate interaction between creator and audience; and frequent authorial or
                  editorial commentary. Further, fan mail is often a source for important details
                  such as the explicit identification of otherwise uncredited creators, including
                  writers, artists, inkers, colorists, and letterers. There are many instances, as
                  in <ref target="#figure16">Figure 16</ref> below, in which individuals who would
                  go on to become prominent figures in the comic book industry first appeared in
                  comics as the authors of fan mail.</p>

               <head>Advertisements</head>
               <p>Print advertisements, particularly many of the types frequently found in comics,
                  are themselves extremely complex documents. One cannot study the history of
                  television in the twentieth century without careful attention to television
                  advertising. Similarly, one cannot study the comic book without close
                  consideration of the advertisements in document. In comic books from major
                  publishers such as Marvel and DC, advertisements are, in terms of quantity, the
                  dominant content type apart from the comics content.<note>As a random example,
                        <title>Fantastic Four</title> #61 (April, 1967) contains thirty-six pages,
                     including front and back covers, recto and verso. Of these thirty-six pages,
                     twenty-one are devoted to comics content, twelve to advertisements, two to fan
                     mail, and one page to other editorial content.</note> Of particular interest
                  are the many advertisements that adopt conventions from comics. The intermingling
                  of comics-based narrative with commercial advertisement becomes a key element in
                  the production of meaning in the text. In addition to advertisements for
                  third-party products, comics are rife with advertisements and other promotional
                  materials for the comic books and other products of the publisher. These
                  promotional materials contribute to the transformation of the publisher from
                  commercial entity to a club or cult<note>Stan Lee, who was both a major creative
                     force at Marvel Comics as well as its most effective and visible promoter,
                     frequently addresses Marvel readers/fans as <q>True Believers.</q>
                  </note> and to the process by which a reader becomes a <soCalled>fan.</soCalled>
                  Unfortunately, this important content is usually omitted from both print and
                  digital <soCalled>reprints</soCalled> from the comic book publishers. </p>
               <p>Advertisements are interesting on many levels. For instance, a scholar examining
                  gender roles in comics may be interested to know that certain advertisements are
                  addressed directly to boys (<q>Look, Fellows!</q>) and that participation in
                  certain activities promoted by the ads, such as selling <title>Grit</title>
                  newspaper in one’s neighborhood, required one to answer in the affirmative the
                  question, <q>Are you a boy?</q> Later versions of the same ad would replace
                     <q>Look, Fellows!</q> with <q>Look, Friends!</q> and <q>Are You a Boy?</q> with
                     <q>Male or Female?</q>
               </p>
               <figure xml:id="figure17">
                  <head>An advertisement recruiting boys to sell <title>Grit</title> newspaper is

               <p>Other advertisements found in comics are of interest because of the ways in which
                  they appropriate the characteristics of comics content, the dominant content type
                  of the <soCalled>host</soCalled> document. One finds such appropriations
                  increasingly in video and film as elaborate advertisements adopt the conventions
                  of, for instance, music videos or short films. The televised broadcast of the
                  National Football League’s annual Super Bowl championship has become a showcase
                  for such advertisements. Further intermingling of commerce and
                     <soCalled>art</soCalled> is found in the relatively recent trend of
                  advertisements in the movie theater and product placement within television and
                  film. Comics anticipate such trends, on a mass scale, decades before they became
                  commonplace in other media. Comic book documents encoded with CBML would allow one
                  easily to identify, retrieve, and analyze advertisements that contain comic book
                  elements such as panels and balloons.</p>
               <p>The following examples illustrate some of the variety found in comic book
                  advertisements and the extent to which the advertisements adopt the formal
                  conventions of comics, from advertisements that include elements like word
                  balloons to advertisements that contain miniature multi-panel comics
                  narratives.</p>

               <p>Many other publications and content types that would not typically be classified
                  as comic books incorporate the formal elements of comics. For instances, there are
                  a number of publications that combine news, interviews, reviews, and other
                  journalistic features about comics and the comic book industry. These publications
                  include fanzines, such as <title>Alter Ego</title>; official fan club
                  publications, such as Marvel’s <title rend="italic">FOOM Magazine</title>;
                  magazines such as <title rend="italic">Wizard</title> or <title>The Jack Kirby

                        or individual publications would provide readers with an opportunity to
                        formalize their status as fans by joining official fan clubs, such as
                        Marvel’s Merry Marvel Marching Society and later F.O.O.M., or Friends of Ol’
                        Marvel. These fan clubs also have publications, the digital representation
                        of which can benefit from CBML encoding. These fan publications are
                        important historical documents and include interviews with comics creators,
                        news items, comic book checklists, games and puzzles, photographs and
                        illustrations, previews, advertisements, and comics content in the form of
                        covers and sample pages and panels from upcoming issues, reprinted comics,
                        and original comics content created for the fan magazines.</head>

               <p>The existence and relevance of these many comics-related publications is an
                  important reason behind the decision to base CBML on TEI. Comic book content does
                  not exist in isolation from other document types but is often integrated into
                  essays, news articles, reviews, scholarly criticism, and so on. TEI provides
                  robust mechanisms for encoding these more familiar document types, while CBML
                  supplements TEI with features necessary for encoding the integrated comic book
                  content.</p>
               <p>One of the most noteworthy aspects of TEI is its many elements, attributes, and
                  other structures for describing components of scholarly textual editions,
                  including textual variants among multiple printings and editions, authorial
                  manuscripts and typescripts, notes, annotations, and marginalia. Like many other
                  modern documents, comic books can have complicated publication and production
                  histories, with multiple editions and reprintings. Likewise, published comic books
                  have their origins in authorial manuscripts and typescripts and original art with
                  marginalia and notes of various types. See <ref target="#figure24">Figure 24</ref>
                  and <ref target="#figure25">Figure 25</ref>. The combination of CBML elements and
                  existing TEI elements for describing manuscripts, typescripts, and textual
                  variants provides a suitable suite of descriptors for encoding such documents.</p>

            <head>Linking Transcription and Image</head>
            <p>The examples above illustrate how CBML can capture a transcription of the text found
               in a comic book. Other important features are also captured, such as the structure of
               the comic book; the sequence of pages and panels; the grouping of panels into
               compositional units that may or may not correspond to a physical page; classification
               of panel transition types and analysis of individual transitions from panel to panel.
               However, the examples above do not attempt to describe the <emph>pictures</emph> one
               finds in the comic book, nor should they. Comic books are a visual, graphic art form
               combining text and image. CBML/TEI/XML is a text format. While one could certainly
               use CBML to describe details about any or all of the pictures in a comic book
               publication, such an effort would undermine the hybrid form of the comic book. The
               visual, pictorial, and graphic design elements of the comic book simply cannot be
               fully or adequately described or translated as text. While many design features
               common to textual documents, such as text size and font characteristics, may be
               reasonably and usefully described using common TEI techniques, it would be futile and
               impractical to attempt to describe every detail of every picture in a comic book
               document. The encoded document, with markup containing and describing metadata,
               structure, transcription, and analysis, should co-exist with and be linked to digital
               facsimile page images of the comic book. Thankfully, in current digital environments
               and on the Web, such linking and display of text and image is relatively simple, if
               time-consuming, to accomplish. Section <ref
                  target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHFAX">11.1
                  Digital Facsimiles</ref> in the <title>TEI Guidelines</title> describes existing
               TEI elements and attributes for linking digital transcriptions to digital facsimile
               images <ptr target="#tei2010"/>.</p>

            <p> On the other hand, depending on the goals of any particular project employing CBML,
               some scholars will wish to add to the encoded text some description and analysis of
               the pictorial aspect of the comic book. If one has such needs, CBML and TEI provide
               suitable mechanisms. Typed TEI <gi>note</gi> elements may be used to provide detailed
               descriptions of the pictorial dimensions of the document. For example, one might use
                  <code>&lt;note type="panelGrpDesc"&gt;</code> for a <soCalled>panel group
                  description</soCalled> or <code>&lt;note type="panelDesc"&gt;</code> for a
                  <soCalled>panel description.</soCalled>

                  modes of production for comics. Traditionally, comics were lettered by hand. It is
                  now increasingly common, especially among the major comic book publishers, for the
                  lettering to be done in desktop publishing and design software using digital
                  fonts, many of which are designed to resemble traditional hand-drawn comic book
                  lettering, providing a digital illusion of handcrafted script. </head>

            <head>Challenges: Visual Complexity</head>
            <p>The basic structures of CBML were based on representative samples of common and
               relatively simple structures and panel layouts. For instance, panels normally are
               arranged in fairly regular grid patterns. 2 x 3 panel grids (three rows of two
               rectangular, nearly square panels) are very common; 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 layouts are also
               prevalent. <figure xml:id="figure28">
                  <head>A page from the Captain America feature in <title>Tales of Suspense</title>

                  <graphic url="resources/images/walsh_2012_figure28.jpg"/>
               </figure> But variation from strict and regular grid layouts is ubiquitous. Panels of
               every size and shape — circles, triangles, irregular polygons, and fluid organic
               shapes — are also common, as are borderless panels with ambiguous boundaries. <figure

            </p>
            <p> Simplistic approaches to encoding the spatial and sequential relationships among
               such panels are foiled by frequent variations and complexities in panel size, shape,
               and arrangement and particularly by ambiguous sequential positioning of panels. As
               determination of meaning in a textual document is dependent on a particular, usually
               obvious, sequence of words, so is determination of meaning in a comic book dependent
               on a particular sequence of images and panels. While a meaningful panel sequence in
               comics is usually apparent, the conventions of graphic expression in comics are not
               as fixed, well established, or as well known by general readers as the conventions
               for textual expression and narrative. And just as writers and poets break rules and
               conventions, so do comics writers and artists play with the rules and conventions of
               comics narrative. In <ref target="#figure30">Figure 30</ref> below, a single obvious
               sequence of panels is not at all clear — multiple valid sequential readings are
               possible. Also note the playful use of diegetic text, with bibliographic information
               about the creators and title of the story embedded in the pictures. Near the upper
               left of the page is a blue-tinted panel with the names of the creators of the story:
                  <q>LEE STERANKO SINNOT ROSEN in Another Epic!</q> The title of the story, <title
                  rend="quotes">Tomorrow You Live Tonight I Die!,</title> appears on a calling card
               in the panel at the lower right-hand corner of the page. <figure xml:id="figure30">

            <p>Irregular and unusual panel arrangement, composition, and presentation may pose
               challenges for <soCalled>reading</soCalled> of the visual and textual language of
               comic books, just as difficult syntax, unfamiliar vocabulary, neologisms, or
               unconventional typography and punctuation may present challenges for reading
               primarily textual content. Most comics have panels with clear borders and generous
               gutters between borders. The borders and gutters between panels correspond to the
               punctuation and spacing used to enhance clarity and readability in written and
               printed texts. Panels without clear borders and gutters introduce another type of
               visual ambiguity in comics. <ref target="#figure31">Figure 31</ref> illustrates a
               panel group with discreet pictorial moments that correspond to panels, but these
                  <soCalled>panels</soCalled> lack conventional borders and gutters. <figure

                     gestures that correspond closely to conventional comic book panels. On the left
                     is the original page; on the right, I have superimposed boxes over the image to
                     identify the discreet moments or <soCalled>panels</soCalled> present in the

                  <graphic url="resources/images/walsh_2012_figure31.jpg"/>
               </figure> At least six such pictorial moments or <soCalled>panels</soCalled> may be
               identified in Eisner's page from <ref target="#figure31">Figure 31</ref>. The top of
               the image depicts a man and woman running through Charles de Gaulle Airport; the next
               element shows, from a distance, the couple as they ride up an escalator. The lines of
               the escalator tube, extending more or less horizontally across the entire page, cause
               this image to serve simultaneously as a discreet pictorial moment <emph>and</emph> as
               a border or gutter separating the <soCalled>panels</soCalled> above and below the
               escalator scene. Two more <soCalled>panels</soCalled> are found directly below the
               escalator. On the left, the couple rush through the crowded airport; on the right,
               they arrive at their seats on the plane they have been rushing to catch. A very
               subtle <soCalled>panel</soCalled> emerges quietly below these two panels as the
               aircraft, seen from a distance, takes off through the clouds. Like the distant view
               of the escalators, this image does double duty as <soCalled>panel</soCalled> and as
               border/gutter. In the final <soCalled>panel</soCalled> of the page, the man and
               woman, reclined in their seats, relax and resume their conversation. In those images
               (the escalator and the ascending aeroplane) that function as both panel and
               border/gutter, we might say, borrowing terminology from textual criticism, that the
               substantive content has merged with the accidentals of the document. By encoding
               these graphic and textual moments within <gi>cbml:panel</gi> elements, the scholar
               encoder has imposed an interpretation and asserted various claims about the document.
               Additional <att>ana</att> attributes might be used to indicate those
                  <soCalled>panels</soCalled> that function as both panel and border/gutter.
                  <gi>note</gi> elements might also be used to discuss other issues related to the
               general graphic ambiguity of the page.</p>
            <p>In <ref target="#figure26">Figure 26</ref> above, we saw an example of a speech
               balloon crossing the gutter from one panel into another. Another type of visual
               ambiguity is introduced when pictorial elements cross panel boundaries and co-exist
               is more than one panel. Since different panels often depict different physical spaces
               and different moments in time, the presence of a pictorial element in more than one
               panel can be particularly jarring and can be used to establish complex spatial and
               temporal relationships. <ref target="#figure32">Figure 32</ref> below shows an
               example of this type of visual ambiguity in an early WWII-era comic book: <figure

               </figure>The panels above are not uniform in shape or size. Pictorial elements, such
               as the gun in the fifth panel and the purple-suited figure and motion lines in the
               bottom two panels, cross the gutter separating the panels and co-exist in multiple
               panels. These graphic moves suggest interesting spatial and temporal juxtapositions
               and facilite visual transitions from panel to panel, breaking down the clear
               separation of narrative moments and instigating a flow approaching (though still very
               far removed from) the rapid frame-to-frame transitions found in film.</p>
            <p>
               <ref target="#figure33">Figure 33</ref> below, from Morrison and Jone's <title>Marvel
                  Boy</title>

               ambiguous panel boundaries and overlapping panels. The central action — of the
               blue-cloaked golden figure lifting Marvel Boy into the air — is witness to its own
               genesis, visually encroaching on the panel depicting some moments prior in time. As
               Marvel Boy is lifted up into the underlying panel he becomes a spectator — with the
               reader — of himself within the previous moment. Likewise the blue-cloaked figure
               plants a golden boot upon a future moment that proceeds from the central action. An
               encoded CBML document might identify and analyze such transitions. One could develop
               a taxonomy to classify the sorts of overlap phenomena found in <ref

               metadata complexity. While these issues are not unique to comics, I would argue that
               the degree of complexity is distinct in comics. Comic books typically contain
               serialized narratives. Often one finds <soCalled>stand-alone</soCalled> issues, which
               contain a complete story, and often stories extend over many issues, or even many
               issues of two or more serial titles.<note>For example, the Marvel Comics
                     <soCalled>Avengers Defenders War</soCalled> storyline from 1973-74 takes place
                  in two serial publications, <title>The Avengers</title> (issues #115 to #118) and
                     <title>The Defenders</title> (issues #8 to #11).</note> In the case of
               mainstream super hero comics, regardless of whether any particular story is more or
               less self-contained within a single issue or extends over many issues, these
               narratives exist in the context of larger narratives developed over many decades by
               dozens or hundreds of individual writers and artists. Rather uniquely, characters
               like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, and the Hulk exist in ongoing,
               decades-long, cross-generational narratives created by collaborative teams of
               writers, artists, and editors. Although we find similar issues of long-running
               narratives with changing collaborative teams in film and television, none approaches
               the longevity and frequency of production found in the comic book
                  narratives.<note>The closest analog might be daytime soap operas, many of which
                  have been in production for decades and are produced more frequently (with daily
                  episodes Monday through Friday) than typical comic book issues are published. But
                  the longest-running soap opera, <title>Guiding Light</title>, which started on
                  radio in 1937, ceased production in 2009. The Superman and Batman narratives,
                  which started in 1938 and 1939, respectively, continue to be told in multiple
                  serial publications and of course in film and other media. Another analog might be
                  the repeated refashioning of mythological, biblical, and Arthurian narratives
                  throughout literary history, but such recasting of shared imaginative universes
                  are more decentralized and lack the corporate control and continuity found in the
                  ongoing comic book narratives or soap operas.</note> Most long-running comic book
               features, from Fawcett's original Captain Marvel to Spider-Man to Archie, have
               complex bibliographic histories involving networks of changing titles, creators, even
               publishers. These complex bibliographic histories, with multiple creators, are
               relevant to textual theories about the nature of authorship and the social and
               corporate nature of document production. In comic books we have examples of
               collaboratively-produced narratives coupled with collaboratively-produced visual art.
               The many metadata structures available in TEI lend themselves to description of these
               complex bibliographic histories and relationships.</p>
            <p>The evolution of characters over many decades in serialized tales poses documentary
               complications that may be addressed through encoding strategies. For instance, one
               may be interested in the DC super hero known as the Flash. The general concept of a
               super hero named the Flash, with the power of super speed, published by the comic
               book publisher DC, is some sort (or some sorts) of bibliographic entity — a
               character, a subject, a title. But there is not one Flash character (or title) in the
               DC imaginative universe. The first Flash, with the secret identity of Jay Garrick,
               was created by Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert in <title>Flash Comics</title> #1
               (January 1940). This character was revived in the 1950s, with a new costume, new
               origin story, and new secret identity — police scientist Barry Allen. Allen
                  <soCalled>died</soCalled> in the 1985 series <title>Crisis on Infinite
                  Earths</title> and remained <soCalled>dead</soCalled> for over twenty (real — not
               fictional) years . During Allen's absence, his similarly super-powered sidekick Wally
               West took on the persona of the Flash, as did Bart Allen, Barry Allen's grandson.
               Many other characters have undergone similar evolutions and transformations. </p>
            <p>TEI is well-equipped to capture these complex details of character and identity. The
                  <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html#NDPERS"
                  >prosopographical features of TEI</ref> provide a framework for modeling relations
               among both real people (e.g., comics writers, artists, and other creators) and
               fictional characters. </p>

            <head>Conclusions and Future Work</head>

            <p>Like most digital humanities projects and markup language development, CBML is an
               ongoing effort. Although many diverse examples have been shown here, the extent of
               textual and graphic variation found in the world of comics is astounding. Examples
               here have focused on superhero comics, the most enduringly popular genre in the
               history of the art form. However, many other important genres exist — romance, war,
               horror, science fiction, and fantasy comics — each with their own traditions and
               conventions. Increasingly, more realistic narratives, autobiographical works, and
               non-fiction works are presented as comics. Japanese manga and manga-influenced comics
               are very popular and possess a style and conventions distinct from western comics.
               Certainly many more difficult and challenging comic book documents will be found to
               test the general applicability of CBML and suggest additions and modifications to the
               markup language.</p>
            <p>An important issue, not yet addressed in this discussion, is the issue of copyright.
               Modern comic books, which developed in the 1930s and since, are largely still under
               copyright protection. The most popular of these, those featuring the famous super
               heroes, are owned by massive media conglomerates. DC Comics (publishers of titles
               featuring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, etc.) is owned by Time Warner.
               Marvel Comics (publishers of titles featuring Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Iron
               Man, the Hulk, etc.) was recently acquired by the Walt Disney Company. These media
               companies have reputations for jealously and fiercely protecting their copyrights.
               Copyright is doubtless a challenge for scholars studying comic books, just as
               copyright is a challenge for scholars studying film and many other twentieth- and
               twenty-first century works. But barring further restrictive copyright legislation,
               many of the older comic book publications will be entering the public domain in
               coming decades. Under current U.S. Copyright Law, <title>Action Comics</title> #1
               (June 30, 1938), featuring the first appearance of Superman, would enter the public
               domain in 2033, 95 years after publication. And many comic books from the same period
               are already in the public domain because the copyright was not renewed, when such
               renewal was still necessary for an extension of copyright protection. In 2008,
               publisher Image Comics began their Next Issue Project, a series of new comics based
               on the narratives and characters from comic books published in the 1930s and 40s that
               had fallen into the public domain. The first Next Issue Project comic book was
                  <title>Fantastic Comics</title> #24 <ptr target="#fantastic_comics24"/>. It draws
               on stories and characters from Fox Feature Syndicate's <title>Fantastic
                  Comics</title>, the final issue of which was #23, published in November 1941. The
               Next Issue Project has identified a number of other public domain titles, including
               Lev Gleason Publications' <title>Silver Streak Comics</title> (twenty-three issues),
               Quality Comics' <title>Crack Comics</title> (sixty-two issues), and Harvey Comics'
                  <title>Speed Comics</title> (forty-four issues). These four titles alone provide
               over 150 comic books that could be used for further collaborative development of CBML
               and published on the Web and in other media. Certainly there is a great deal more
               comics content in the public domain or for which permissions may be secured, and
               nothing prevents a scholar from applying CBML markup to any text as part of a
               strategy for reading, interpretation, and analysis. The end goal of markup is not and
               should not always be publication of a digital surrogate. The encoding of a text may
               be a rigorous intellectual activity that has great value as process, not just as
               product.</p>
            <p>CBML, as described here, focuses primarily on overall structure of the document,
               textual content, and metadata. Significant work remains to be done giving similar
               attention to the pictorial dimensions of the comic book. I have argued above that
               CBML should not attempt to go too far in description of individual images and
               pictorial details, relying instead on the presence of facsimile page images.
               Nonetheless, in order to analyze the visual grammar and conventions of comics,
               additional visual and pictorial features will need to be <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#tei2010">identified explicitly in order to facilitate processing by
                  computer programs</quote>
               <ptr target="#tei2010"/>. Future work on CBML will include modeling frameworks for
               analysis of pictorial and graphic features and developing taxonomies for identifying
               such features, beyond the basic structural components of panels, balloons, captions,
               and sound effects. </p>
            <p>Comic books are an endlessly fascinating medium and one from which the digital
               humanities can learn a great deal. The structural complexities of the content rivals
               or surpasses the complexity of content famously treated by digital humanities
               scholarship: fragmentary classical texts; medieval manuscripts; Blake's illuminated
               work; and Rossetti's double works. The combination of text and pictures and the role
               of visual communication in comics prefigures the multimedia and new media of digital
               environments and the prominence of pictures, graphics, and icons found on the Web and
               other modern digital interfaces. The corporate and collective authorship of many
               long-running comic book narratives and the interactive relationship between creators
               and readers/viewers/consumers of created content provide models of authorship and
               readership that are relevant to the collaboratively created digital content that we
               make and study in the digital humanities. </p>

                  >http://www.cbml.org/</ref>. One may download the most recent schemas and TEI ODD
               files (which define and document the CBML customizations of TEI) and example CBML

                  >https://iulist.indiana.edu/sympa/info/cbml-l</ref>. In addition to ongoing
               development and refinement of the CBML markup scheme, future research will involve
               the creation of a large corpus of pubic domain comics encoded in CBML and the
               development of interfaces for representing, exploring, and manipulating CBML
               documents and associated facsimile page images. </p>
