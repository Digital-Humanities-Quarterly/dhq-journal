                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>This paper explores the art history, the digital aesthetics, the technical
                    anatomy, and the restoration of Shu Lea Cheang’s early web artwork <title
                        rend="italic">Brandon</title> (1998-1999). Commissioned two decades ago by
                    the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the work is just back on view to the public
                    after a major restoration. It seems timely to consider Cheang’s artwork: a
                    collaboration between the artist and a network of programmers, designers,
                    authors and other contributors that offers a creative platform for remembering
                    and engaging with histories and issues of identity from the LGBTQ+ community. In
                    the spirit of the piece, this article is a multi-disciplinary collaboration
                    between a curator, a media art conservator, a computer scientist, and a scholar
                    of the digital liberal arts, which brings together these different areas of
                    expertise to offer an innovative and multi-faceted consideration of one artwork
                    from a digital humanities perspective.</p>

                <p>Commissioned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, <title rend="italic"
                        >Brandon</title> (1998–99) by Shu Lea Cheang is a landmark art project that
                    spans disciplinary boundaries. The multipart work comprises a sprawling network
                    of components including online digital interfaces, live public programs hosted
                    by collaborating institutions in the United States and Europe, and a multimedia
                    installation. Realized at a moment when the internet was coming into widespread
                    use, <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> is among the most ambitious digital
                    projects of its time and the first artwork in the Guggenheim’s permanent
                    collection to use the Web as a primary medium. As a memorial to Brandon Teena, a
                    trans person who was raped and murdered in Nebraska in 1993, Cheang’s work also
                    represents a crucial intervention in gender studies, raising questions about
                    rights and identity that remain urgent today. The critical questions about the
                    relationships between gender and technology that <title rend="italic"
                        >Brandon</title> raises anticipate those being asked by contemporary artists
                    who have not previously had the opportunity to interact with the work<hi
                        rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>Yet for many years, <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> had been inaccessible to
                    a wide public due to technological obsolescence. The Guggenheim’s recent
                    restoration of the work sparked a reevaluation of its art historical, cultural,
                    and technological significance. <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>’s enduring
                    importance stems from its highly collaborative structure, which incorporates
                    contributions by numerous prominent scholars, artists, and programmers. Yet this
                    sprawling form also poses unique challenges for evaluating the work. The process
                    of restoring, studying, and presenting <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> to
                    contemporary audiences must be as multidisciplinary as the work itself,
                    involving media conservators, computer scientists, curators, and humanities’
                    scholars. Only by considering the work from multiple perspectives — historical,
                    theoretical, technical, and aesthetic — can a full understanding of its
                    importance be achieved. </p>

                    commissioned for a planned “Virtual Museum.” The launch of <title rend="italic"

                    Guggenheim’s now defunct satellite venue in New York’s SoHo neighborhood.
                    Visitors to the launch event encountered an installation that included three
                    interactive computer workstations and live navigation of the browser windows

                    <p>Cheang’s work memorializes Brandon Teena, a twenty-one-year-old trans man
                        living in Nebraska who was brutally raped and murdered in 1993. Brandon
                        Teena’s story became a touchstone for bringing visibility to transgender
                        people and their struggles in the United States. Brandon Teena was the
                        subject of a 1998 documentary film <title rend="italic">The Brandon Teena
                            Story</title> and the award-winning 1999 feature <title rend="italic"
                            >Boys Don’t Cry</title>. Cheang’s response to Brandon Teena’s story
                        departs from the linear narratives and psychological realism of these later
                        films. </p>
                    <p>Instead of a biography of Brandon Teena, the artwork <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title> examines the structural conditions that have confronted
                        trans people in contemporary society. The work’s five different interactive
                        web interfaces, <title rend="italic">bigdoll</title>, <title rend="italic"
                            >roadtrip</title>, <title rend="italic">mooplay</title>, <title
                            rend="italic">panopticon</title>, and <title rend="italic">theatrum
                            anatomicum</title> (Figures 5-9), employ images and texts that meld
                        critical histories of gender and sexuality with contemporary perspectives on
                        American culture, emphasizing expressions of institutionalized violence.
                        Cheang’s project further suggests parallels between gender and the malleable
                        forms of public and private identity that can be constituted online.</p>

                        of a person in a business suit and a close-up picture of a pierced nipple.
                        Jones further invited other artists to contribute images to the archive over

                        French hermaphrodite; a Mississippi Man named James McHarris who was
                        stripped in a courtroom to determine his gender in 1954; Venus EXtravaganza,

                        for multi-user engagement in virtual reality settings that often involved

                        developed by each of the contributing writers, that appears inchoate, and
                        ever-changing. Among the ten fictitious characters whose names appear as

                        prison in which inmates occupied cells arranged in a circle around a central
                        guard tower. The web environment was inspired by Cheang’s visit to the
                        Koepel prison in Arnhem, Netherlands — one of the prototypical examples of
                        this form of architecture. Heavily informed by Foucault’s theoretical
                        analysis of the Panopticon as a metaphor for social life in modernity, the

                    <p><title rend="italic">Brandon</title> embodies interests that have been and
                        continue to be central to Cheang’s career — both in terms of its subject
                        matter and the collaborative working process that the artist initiated. Shu
                        Lea Cheang was born in 1954 in Taiwan and has lived and worked in the United
                        States as well as in Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France,
                        where she currently resides. She describes herself as an artist, filmmaker, [and] networker, as she has
                        worked in a variety of mediums: film, video, installation, and web
                            projects.</p>
                    <p>In the early 1980s, Cheang was part of the New York-based Paper Tiger
                        Television collective, a group that produced public access television
                        programs that critiqued corporate control over broadcast networks and
                        offered an alternative source of news and a platform for experimental video
                        production. Cheang began creating video installations for art spaces in the
                        early 1990s. These multiscreen pieces grappled with subjects ranging from
                        the Tiananmen Square Massacre to representations of Asian identity in the
                        mass media <ptr target="#chua1996"/>. In 1995, she realized her first
                        web-based project, <title rend="italic">Bowling Alley</title> (1995–1996),
                        for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. The commission linked the Walker's
                        galleries to a local bowling alley with a web-based video-link running on an
                        Apple PowerBook. According to Cheang, the piece was an examination of how
                        private and public spaces were becoming intertwined through network
                        technology, a theme Cheang explored again in <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon.</title></p>
                    <p>The activist orientation of Cheang’s work, as well as her career-long
                        commitment to utilizing <soCalled>new media</soCalled> — be it video, cable
                        networks, or the web — continues in the present. Cheang’s projects address
                        profound social disruptions while manifesting an underlying sense of humor
                        and taste for the absurd. One of Cheang’s most complex works, <title
                            rend="italic">I.K.U.</title> (2001), initially took the form of what the
                        artist describes as a <soCalled>Japanese Sci-Fi Porn feature</soCalled>. It
                        spawned a sequel project, <title rend="italic">U.K.I.</title> (2009-2014).
                        The latter includes a <soCalled>viral performance</soCalled> for which a
                        cast climbed over piles of junked keyboards and computers. Additionally,
                        Cheang produced an online <soCalled>viral game</soCalled> in which users are
                        pitted against a futuristic corporation that’s intent on reprogramming the human orgasm on a
                        biological information network — a corporeal World Wide Web.</p>

                    <p>In each of her previous projects, Cheang maintained a link between the
                        physical realities of embodied experience and the virtual world. The artist

                        event on June 30, 1998, three additional programs took place <soCalled>in

                        period of web-based art to maintain a physical experience of the

                    <p>On the night of August 5, 1998 at The Institute for Arts and Civic Dialogue
                        at Harvard University, Cheang staged <title rend="quotes">A Virtual Court
                            Test Trial for Brandon</title> to provide an <quote rend="inline"

                        developing a virtual court system that would open a dialogue on both real
                        and virtual crimes <ptr target="#harvard1998" loc="2"/>. The test trial
                        (under the artistic direction of Anna Deavere Smith) invited the
                            <soCalled>net public</soCalled>, as well as scholars and legal experts
                        ranging from Lawrence Lessig to Kendall Thomas, to serve as jurors for six
                        simulated court cases. The presentation of five of these sexual-assault
                        cases included actual court documents, evidence, and testimony performed by
                        five actors through a script prepared by Cheang and a team of researchers.
                        The cases included the wrongful death suit that Brandon Teena’s mother
                        brought against the county sheriff (Brandon v. County of Richardson), the
                            <soCalled>cyber rape</soCalled> case Legba v. Mr. Bungle (see <ptr
                            target="#dibbell1993"/>) and the Chanelle Pickett case (Chanelle Pickett
                        v. William C. Palmer) about a trans woman who was murdered in Watertown,
                        Massachusetts in 1995. The audience at the event was by invitation only but
                        the public could watch a simulcast and log on to a live chat room on the
                            <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> website. The performance was
                        exploratory rather than conclusive, as Cheang noted, <cit>

                    <p>Like <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>’s launch event, the third and
                        fourth live events were simultaneously staged inside the Theatrum Anatomicum
                        at De Waag and at the Guggenheim’s SoHo branch, and
                            <soCalled>simulcast</soCalled> with audio and video streams that

                        </cit>. The centerpiece was an activation of the installation designed by
                        Atelier Van Lieshout (Figures <ref target="#figure12">12</ref> and <ref
                            target="#figure13">13</ref>) based on the drawings of the Theater
                        Anatomicum by Jonas Zeuner from 1773. Recalling dissecting lessons of the
                        seventeenth century, the installation included an operating table and
                        suspended rings that held a revolving web camera which captured and
                        transmitted the live event. Instead of a live surgery as Cheang had hoped to
                        broadcast from a clinic, the main operating table held a projection screen
                        carrying images of sexual reassignment surgery and the <title rend="italic"

                        The event established parallels between medical institutions, the legal

                    <p>Though the digital form of <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> may have been
                        a new type of acquisition for the Guggenheim, the project fits into a larger
                        post-WWII tradition of artists experimenting with new media and
                        technologies. The burgeoning net.art scene of the 1990s offers the most
                        immediate context for <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>. In addition to
                        adopting networked technology, artists including jodi.org (Joan Heemskerk
                        and Dirk Paesmans), Alexei Shulgin, and Vuk Ćosić valued dispersed modes of
                        authorship and sought to circulate their work in venues outside of
                        traditional art institutions. Because many key net.art projects from the
                        time explicitly rejected museum display and required new approaches to
                        collecting, <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> represents a rare
                        opportunity to bring institutional resources to bear on understanding and
                        preserving a work from this pioneering period.</p>
                    <p>Cheang also joined artists such as the VNS Matrix collective (Virginia
                        Barratt, Julianne Pierce, Josephine Starrs, and Francesca da Rimini) in
                        utilizing the virtual space of the web to challenge fixed notions of gender
                        and sexuality. VNS Matrix are among the first artists to use the term
                        cyberfeminism to describe their practice. Cheang self-identified as a <quote

                        claiming sympathies with the broad notion of female and queer access to

                            >see 4.3</ref>). Cheang’s 1993 installation <title rend="italic">Those
                            Fluttering Objects of Desire</title> was included in that year’s Whitney
                        Biennial, an exhibition that famously brought questions about race, gender
                        and sexuality to the foreground of American art discourses.</p>
                    <p>Cheang first began working on <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> in the
                        mid-1990s and wrote a proposal by 1995 that identified it as a <quote

                        to take the work. Cheang anticipated the potential the web could provide for

                        Hanhardt had previously worked with Cheang at the Whitney Museum of American
                        Art, where he had been a curator in the mid-1990s. Hanhardt’s team at the
                        Guggenheim included Matthew Drutt, Associate Curator for Research, who

                <p>From the moment of <title rend="italic">Brandon’s</title> commission in 1998, the
                    web artwork was anticipated and regarded as an addition to the Guggenheim’s
                    permanent collection. In his official letter of intent to the artist, the
                    curator Matthew Drutt assured: <cit>

                    by a major museum, cannot be told without tracing the evolution of media art
                    conservation as an emerging practice. From a standpoint of collection management
                    and care, the Guggenheim’s curatorial vision in 1998 to not just commission and
                    stage, but to collect <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> was courageous, if
                    not daring. At that time, the Guggenheim had no media art conservator on staff
                    who could have examined the incoming artwork, ensured proper storage and
                    tracking of digital components, documented the artwork’s significant conceptual
                    and aesthetic properties, identified its functional and interactive behaviors,
                    projected the inherent preservation risks and laid out a plan for maintenance
                    and management of change. As a profession and practice, media art conservation
                    barely existed at the time, within the United States or internationally.
                    Moreover, the Guggenheim’s information technology (IT) infrastructure was not
                    advanced enough to allow in-house web hosting and maintenance of <title
                        rend="italic">Brandon</title> on Guggenheim servers. At the time, even the
                    Guggenheim’s own website, the development of which had been spearheaded by
                    Matthew Drutt in 1994, had to be hosted by an external Internet Service
                    Provider, <title rend="italic">USWeb Los Angeles</title>, which later also
                    accommodated <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> from its 1998 launch to its

                            person</soCalled> at Rhizome, as well as a friend of the artist, to

                        also suggests that Galloway may have been asked around 2000 to consolidate
                        Brandon’s code from other external sites, namely the De Waag servers <ptr
                            target="#galloway2017" loc="27"/>.</p>
                    <p>In 2002, John G. Hanhardt announced to the artist: <quote rend="inline"
                            source="hanhardt2002">...we are now looking to make [<title
                                rend="italic">Brandon</title>] part of the Museum’s Permanent
                            Collection. As a first step, we want to archive the project which means
                            we will take it offline and archive it for later acquisition</quote>
                        <ptr target="#hanhardt2002"/>. Shortly after, Galloway was commissioned by
                        Jon Ippolito, then the Guggenheim’s Assistant Curator for Media Arts, to
                        create an archival back-up of <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s code.
                        In his <title rend="quotes">Technical Notes for the Archiving of <title
                                rend="italic">Brandon</title></title>,” Galloway documents: <cit>

                                the <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> development website were

                        </cit>. Along with the CD-Rom, Galloway sent a note of concern to Ippolito:
                        “I am a little worried to tell you to pull the plug on the website, since it
                        is possible that in ignorance I have overlooked files that I don’t know
                        exist” <ptr target="#galloway2002a"/>. Galloway urged Ippolito to “Please
                        cross-check my work, or have Shu Lea do it, before you tell the ISP to pull
                        the plug”. Soon after, <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> was deleted from
                        the server and remained offline until its formal intake into the collection
                        three years later, in September 2005.</p>
                    <p>The reasons behind <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>’s delayed accession
                        and three-year off-line dormancy were not fully established within this
                        research project, but contributing factors may have included the 2001
                        departure of <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>’s commissioning curator
                        Matthew Drutt; a possible necessity to quickly remove <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title>'s code from <title rend="italic">USWeb</title> servers
                        without the technical ability to host <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>
                        on Guggenheim servers just yet; and last but not least: a general
                        uncertainty among museum staff how to apply accession, intake and cataloging
                        procedures to web artworks, or media art more generally.</p>
                    <p>The momentum that triggered the artwork <title rend="italic"
                        >Brandon</title>’s formal acquisition into the Guggenheim collection in 2005
                        was created by two coinciding requests for exhibition inclusion: Rhizome’s
                            <title rend="quotes">ArtBase 101</title> (launched 6/23/2005) and Banff
                        Centre’s <title rend="quotes">The Art Formerly Knows as New Media</title>
                        (9/17-10/23/2005). The museum’s ability to successfully process and complete
                        the acquisition this time around, however, was largely owed to the new
                        practices and resulting institutional confidence that the Guggenheim’s
                            <title rend="italic">Variable Media Initiative</title> had instilled
                        across museum departments <ptr target="#variablemedia2004"/>
                        <ptr target="#guggenheim2006"/>. Launched by Ippolito in 1999, the
                        initiative advocated embracing and consciously managing the change inherent
                        in time-based, variable, ephemeral, performative and technology-based works
                        of art, and to collaborate with artists to preserve identified artwork
                            <soCalled>behaviors</soCalled>, rather than exclusively focusing on
                        their (possibly ephemeral or temporary) materializations. As a result of
                        this initiative, <soCalled>Variable Media Interviews</soCalled> had become
                        part of the Guggenheim’s acquisition process; <soCalled>Variable Media
                            Guidelines</soCalled> had been added to legal contracts and purchase
                        agreements; archival master formats and preservation deliverables were
                        requested for the collection; and artists were asked to complete
                            <soCalled>Variable Media Questionnaires</soCalled> to anticipate and
                        discuss possible changes over time in their collected works. </p>
                    <p>In 2005, based on the Guggenheim’s new and empowered ability to commit to
                        complex media artworks, Hanhardt reached out to Cheang again: <quote

                        shortly after.</p>
                    <p>The two loan requests in 2005 not only triggered <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title>'s formal accession, but its Guggenheim implementation
                        and first major restoration. Variable Media Fellow Caitlin Jones worked with
                        Cheang and Francis Hwang, then Rhizome’s Director of Technology to restore
                        the work to functionality and with Christopher Borkowski, the Guggenheim’s

                        The degree of the art work’s technical dysfunctionality in 2005 was
                        significant: <quote rend="inline" source="#cheang2012b">...many links at the

                        maintenance, in particular due to its use of 10 unique Java applets, which

                        notions of immediacy and permanent accessibility have become further
                        identifiers of life and art online. We are accustomed to uninterrupted
                        online access which shapes our expectation of on-demand availability of
                        online content, including net artworks such as <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title>. And yet, after its 2005 resurrection, <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title> experienced many dysfunctions over the
                        years, due to changes and updates to both browser software and the
                        underlying operating systems; updates to internet protocols; deprecated
                        functions in Java and deprecated tags in HTML; as well as broken links.
                            <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s oscillation between on- and
                        offline status had become a source of disappointment and frustration among
                        scholars, educators and the art community. Pointedly, the online
                        encyclopedia Media Art Net opens its 2005 description of <title

                    <p>The Guggenheim’s biggest challenges in caring for <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title> over the years include the work’s permanent display and
                        need for monitoring and maintenance; the spontaneity of failures and
                        consequential urgency of intervention; staff changeover in the Curatorial
                        and IT Departments; and importantly, the general economy of attention in
                        museum culture. At the Guggenheim (and many other institutions),
                        examinations and treatments of artworks are typically conducted--and
                        budgeted for — in the frame of acquisitions, exhibitions, loans or defined
                        research projects. Allocating resources to unexpected interventions can be
                        highly challenging in light of competing priorities and the lack of
                        budget.</p>
                    <p>In 2012, Cheang wrote to the Guggenheim stating that <title rend="italic"

                        immediately and work with Jack Szwergold, then the Guggenheim’s Web

                        2016, the Conservation Department launched the initiative <title

                        <ptr target="#dover2016"/>
                        <ptr target="#dover2016a"/>, at the core of which stands an ongoing research
                        collaboration with New York University’s Department of Computer Science.
                        Since 2014, computer science students and faculty have been conducting
                        source code analysis on Guggenheim collection works, enabling the museum to
                        better comprehend and document the intended artwork behaviors,
                        functionalities, software and hardware dependencies as well as associated
                        preservation risks.</p>
                    <p>As one of the <title rend="italic">CCBA</title> case studies, <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title> was the subject of source code analysis
                        and documentation over two semesters by computer science students Emma
                        Dickson and Jillian Zhong. Based on their thorough examination of every
                        element of the work, a complete account of errors and malfunctions was
                        created in 2016.</p>
                    <p>Among <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s functional compromises, its
                        non-displaying Java applets were considered most disruptive to the
                        artist-intended experience of the work (Figures <ref target="#figure17"

                    <p>An additional grave compromise to the work was the inoperability of <title

                            >Brandon</title>'s five interfaces. Due to a broken script that
                        generates hyperlinks in <title rend="italic">mixup</title>, users could no
                        longer navigate to <title rend="italic">mooplay’s</title> pseudo chat.
                        Broken links were not just limited to internal dysfunctions; some external
                        URLs have changed as well. As an example, the link to the Institute for Arts
                        and Civic Dialogue on <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s credit page
                        today leads to an advertisement of the domain vendor, and <title

                            rend="italic">TAopening</title>, were not functioning, in this case due
                        to missing or outdated plug-ins called by the HTML
                            <gi>embed</gi> tag. For example, when accessed in Firefox,
                        these sound files resulted in the display of a grey warning window <q>a
                            plugin is needed to display this content</q> (Figure <ref

                    <p>The work’s aesthetic compromises primarily pertained to changes in font
                        types, sizes and colors. In <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>, styling
                        was not done with CSS (<ref target="#section3.2">see 3.2</ref>), but HTML
                        font tags, which are no longer consistently supported by all browsers and
                        will be fully deprecated in the near future. As a result, instead of
                        following the specified parameters, contemporary browsers resort to their
                        default settings. For example, the font types specified for large parts of
                            <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> are the old apple font <title
                            rend="quotes">Chicago</title>, and alternatively <title rend="quotes"
                            >Times</title>. However, since today’s browsers ignore these HTML tags,
                        their display of <hi rend="italic">Brandon</hi> defaults to Times New Roman.
                        The same applies to <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s font sizes.
                        Unable to read the old HTML tags, contemporary browsers apply their own
                        default font size of 12pt; as a result, <title rend="italic"
                        >Brandon</title>'s fonts display too small. The source code analysis also
                        unearthed <gi>blink</gi> tags that were used to make individual
                        words and phrases in <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> blink. After the
                        full deprecation of the <gi>blink</gi> tag, the words were still
                        displayed, but no longer blinking.</p>
                    <p>To holistically address <title rend="italic">Brandon’s</title> identified
                        errors, the Guggenheim Conservation Department decided to launch a major,
                        cross-disciplinary restoration project. In the Spring semester of 2016,
                        computer science students Emma Dickson and Jillian Zhong were tasked to
                        build a prototype to test the migration of a number of <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title>'s Java applets to JavaScript. These prototypes were
                        presented to the artist on April 1, 2016 for approval, and Cheang welcomed
                        and supported the proposed restoration strategy (<ref target="#figure25"
                            >Figure 25</ref>). After a period of fundraising, the restoration
                        project was formally launched in December 2016 and completed in April 2017,
                        in time for <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s inclusion in Rhizome’s

                    <p>The artwork <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> was written when the web was
                        nascent. In 1997, the first year the US Census Bureau began collecting data,
                        only 18% of households using a computer had internet access. That number
                        doubled to 42% by 2000 <ptr target="#newburger2001" loc="2"/> and tripled by
                        2013 to 73% of households <ptr target="#rainii2014"/>. At the time of <hi
                            rend="italic">Brandon’s</hi> creation, the Internet itself was
                        exploding: while there were only 1.1 million pages on the Internet in 1997,
                        this number more than doubled in 1998 <ptr target="#internetlivestats2017"
                        />. With the advent of Google in 1998, it became more accessible and useful.
                        Yet, people had to dial in via landline phone connections, and mobile
                        devices with Internet access were not yet available.</p>
                    <p>The web technologies used to develop <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>
                        were standard and widely used at the time the work was composed. <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title> is based on a combination of programming
                        in Java and Perl along with other web technologies to create a work that
                        exploits textual narrative and images. The selection of technologies was not
                        radical in nature; it was rather an innovation at that time to use web
                        technologies to build a work of art. Other contemporary programmer-artists
                        were building programming tools to create algorithmic art: for example, John
                        Maeda created <title rend="italic">Design By Numbers</title> in 1999, a
                        computer program intended for artists <ptr target="#maeda1999"/>. </p>

                    <p>There are approximately 65,000 lines of code in the HTML, programs and script
                        files which were written by <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s
                        developers (<ref target="#figure26">Figure 26</ref>). These files were coded
                        manually; they were not developed by automating the process programmatically
                        as is often done today using PHP, Python or other modern scripting
                        languages. The programmers working on <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>
                        used a variety of client-side web technologies including HTML to annotate or
                            <soCalled>markup</soCalled> webpages for format and content along with
                        JavaScript to make the pages more responsive to the user; Java to build
                        web-ready displays, animations and other visual features; and digital
                        images, among others. Perl and PHP3 were implemented on the server-side to
                        support <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s interactive functionality and
                        data manipulations. A short explanation of each employed web technology
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is widely used in <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title>, allows developers to annotate textual
                        content in a way that distinguishes between content and structural elements
                        by using <soCalled>tags</soCalled>. For example, a paragraph is surrounded
                        by <code>&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;</code> tags. The text that appears in the
                        top border of a browser window of a web page is surrounded by
                            <code>&lt;title&gt; ... &lt;/title&gt;</code> tags to denote its
                        placement. </p>
                    <p>Notably, content formatting in <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> was done
                        within the HTML, without CSS. CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets” and is
                        a current technology that allows web developers to systematically assign
                        text formatting (e.g., bold, italics or font colors) as well as page
                        placement (e.g., centering text and other layout aspects) within individual
                        pages or across large websites. Although CSS was first registered in March
                        1998, it was not yet commonly used when <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>
                        was developed and implemented. This reflects a possible conservative
                        approach on the part of <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s programmers.
                        JavaScript was written in this work within the HTML files (rather than
                        captured in external scripts as current best-practices would promote).
                        Framesets, which combine multiple HTML documents in a single browser window,
                        were used throughout the work. </p>
                    <p><title rend="italic">Brandon</title> uses ten unique Java applets, which were
                        written using JDK 1.0.2 <ptr target="#tauscher1998"/>. The computer
                        scientists on this research team obtained working source code for the JAVA
                        applets by decompiling the programs to render them in a human-readable Java
                        form.</p>
                    <p>On the server side, Perl is a back-end programming language which was used in
                            <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> for a variety of tasks such as
                        capturing phrases or dialogue from texts and manipulating files; some of the
                        Perl scripts are called by Java applets. Although Perl is still in use for
                        legacy applications at the time of this writing, PHP and Python are among
                        the more commonly used scripting languages in current web environments for
                        these purposes. PHP is also a server-side scripting language. The PHP3 files
                        here are written using an early implementation of PHP and are called on to
                        manage a variety of tasks, such as connecting to the MySQL database, which
                        is used to capture data related to the virtual court sessions in the work.
                        Although the amounts of data collected in this database are quite small and
                        could more easily have been stored in text files without the overhead of
                        running a server-side database, the developers possibly anticipated a
                        significantly larger dataset or simply preferred coding with a database
                        rather than from text files. <figure xml:id="figure26">

                    <p><title rend="italic">Brandon</title> is comprised of approximately 4,500
                        files in a complex structure of 413 directories and subdirectories
                            <note>Author Deena Engel calculated the statistics and generated the pie
                            charts for sections 3.2-3.4 by writing a series of custom python scripts
                            that traverse Brandon’s file directories to conduct the analysis and
                            render the charts. This analysis reflects the 2005 edition of Brandon in
                            the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum collection.</note>. There are over 30
                        distinct file types (<ref target="#figure27">Figure 27</ref>). HTML web page
                        files comprise 13% of the total number of files. Images comprise nearly
                        two-thirds of the files at 63%: 41% of the files are JPG images and another
                        22% of the files are GIF image files; there are also 13 BMP image files. In
                        turn, 110 or 13% of the GIF image files are animated GIFs while the rest of
                        the GIF images are still images. The CLASS and JAVA files for the Java
                        applets comprise another 6% of the total number of files. PHP scripts and
                        early versions of PHP files such as <soCalled>PHP3</soCalled> and
                            <soCalled>PHTML</soCalled> files along with server-side programming
                        scripts such as Perl and Perl/CGI scripts comprise 2% of the files. The
                        remaining files do not appear to the viewer. Text files containing drafts,
                        notes and prose that reveal the artist's work as it developed comprise
                        approximately 2% of the files. Additional files hidden from view include
                        questionnaire log files (11%), database scripts (SQL files) and operating
                        system level shell scripts among others. <figure xml:id="figure27">

                    <p>These files are organized through a complex directory tree (<ref
                            target="#figure28">Figure 28</ref>) to support both the technical
                        requirements and the content requirements for artistic goals. For example,
                        technical requirements include the need to place Perl/CGI scripts into
                        folders called “cgi-bin” which were typically configured on the web server
                        to better support security. Content requirements and support for artistic
                        development would suggest that narratives, images and other content
                        materials be logically grouped together depending on the narrative chapter
                        of the work in order to make the materials easier to find and manipulate,
                        both for the artist and for the programmers. This also helped the
                        programmers to simplify relative file paths within the code. <figure

                        Interfaces</head>
                    <p>The artist collaborated with programmers and designers in each of the five
                        interfaces of the work (<title rend="italic">bigdoll</title>, <title
                            rend="italic">roadtrip</title>, <title rend="italic">mooplay</title>,

                            >theatrum anatomicum</title>). Each of the five interfaces uses a
                        specific selection of technologies based on the intended functionality and
                        programmers’ preferences. A further study of the technical anatomy of each
                        narrative chapter follows. </p>
                    <p>The <title rend="italic">bigdoll</title> interface consists of an HTML file
                        to build the web page which contains JavaScript and uses an assortment of 50
                        GIF images. All of the image files are named <title rend="quotes"
                            >image</title>, plus a number from 1-50 at a size of 144 pixels wide x
                        108 pixels high each. The web page opens as an invisible grid of 5x5 white
                        blocks (using an additional GIF image of a white rectangle in the same size
                        as the other image files). Randomly selected images from the selection of 50
                        images appear as the user mouses over each block while JavaScript is used to
                        process the user’s mouse-overs and mouse-clicks. When the user has
                        successfully hidden the left- and right-most columns and
                            <soCalled>uncovered</soCalled> the assigned image blocks in the center
                        three columns, JavaScript calls a function to open <title rend="italic"
                            >roadtrip</title>, the next chapter in the narrative.</p>
                    <p><title rend="italic">Roadtrip</title> uses an HTML file containing 14
                        original JavaScript functions along with 35 still GIF images and 2 animated
                        GIF images. The <title rend="italic">roadtrip</title> interface makes use of
                        the JavaScript function <title rend="quotes">scroll</title> for manipulating
                        the browser window, which creates the impression of traveling along a road.
                        The background image that appears to move is a solid black rectangle with a
                        single vertical yellow bar (<ref target="#figure29">Figure 29</ref>) that is
                        tiled to look like the dashed lines of a typical American highway. The other
                        images are placed in the browser window through the use of an HTML table of
                        30 rows (where each row has one, two or three columns) so that the relative
                        positions of the images do not change with respect to one another as the
                        window automatically scrolls. The scrolling is reversed (to go forward or
                        back) when the top or the bottom of the table reaches the top or bottom of
                        the browser window respectively. Some of the images open a <soCalled>pop-up
                            window</soCalled> when they are clicked; some are not interactive; and
                        others open to the other chapters. <figure xml:id="figure29">

                    <p><title rend="italic">Mooplay</title> is one of the two most complex
                        interfaces of the work from a technical standpoint (along with <title
                            rend="italic">theatrum anatomicum</title>). It includes HTML and HTML
                        pages with JavaScript along with GIF and JPG images as the other interfaces
                        do. However, <title rend="italic">mooplay</title> also includes Perl/CGI
                        scripts and Java applets to support a chatserver and to manipulate the
                        narrative texts in their randomized, <soCalled>mixed-up</soCalled> forms.
                        Approximately one-third of the files in this section are text files which
                        are not technically significant but hold value for the work in the logs and
                        commentary that have been captured.</p>
                    <p>The <title rend="italic">panopticon</title> is built using HTML files with
                        GIF and JPG images. There are four Java applets which are used to manage the
                        images and a text scroll. The HTML in this section uses complex framesets;
                        note that nearly half of the over 200 files used for this chapter are HTML
                        files as a result.</p>
                    <p>GIF and JPG image files make up 80% of the files in <title rend="italic"
                            >theatrum anatomicum</title>. There are also a handful of BMP
                        (bit-mapped image files) and four WAV (sound) files. From a programming
                        standpoint, this section uses Perl scripts as well as Java applets. The Java
                        programs and the HTML files each make up about 5% of the files. There are 13
                        tables of data in the MySQL database and several earlier versions of the
                        data are also stored with the files for this chapter<note>To obtain the data
                            for this study, a <soCalled>mysqldump</soCalled> was run.</note>. The

                    </head>
                    <p>The objective of <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s major 2016/2017
                        restoration was to reinstate <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s intended
                        online experience and interactivity as a living artwork, while preserving
                        all functional behaviors and aesthetic properties of the work as defined by
                        the original source code. A more in-depth account of the restoration can be
                        found on the Guggenheim Blogs <ptr target="#phillips2017"/>.</p>
                    <p>The selected method to realize this goal was a combination of code migration,
                        hyperlink replacement, database replacement, and HTML tag and frameset
                        migration. In keeping with Conservation ethics and standards, all changes
                        were documented through version control, treatment reporting and code
                        annotation. The latter includes headers with project information (<ref
                            target="#figure30">Figure 30</ref>) as well as detailed explanations
                        preceding each code intervention (Figure <ref target="#figure31">31</ref>,
                            <ref target="#figure32">32</ref>). No original code was deleted, only
                        commented out and added to. In respect of <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title>'s original code, interventive programming solutions
                        were kept as minimal as possible and in style with the original programming.
                        Popular alternatives to code intervention, such as embedding the work in an
                        emulated legacy server environment and web browser software, were dismissed
                        as a treatment option for <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s case. The
                            <soCalled>historic</soCalled> appearance of the artwork in a fixed
                        legacy browser (e.g., Netscape) would have created an illusion of
                        authenticity that collides with the twenty-year evolution of <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s identity. <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title> has no conceptual dependencies on particular
                        technologies and was always intended to be experienced by directly accessing
                        the work through an ever-evolving variety of personal computers,
                        environments and browser versions around the world. Discontinuing <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s 20-year history of permanent change and
                        freezing the work at an arbitrary moment of its complex history would have
                        deprived <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> of its inherent variability
                        and liveliness.<note>All code interventions were overseen by the authors

                        feasible, since <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s data have been static
                        since 1999 without further additions.</p>
                    <p>To restore <title rend="italic">mooplay</title>, the character names in

                        programmed dialogue through code migration from Perl/CGI into JavaScript
                            (<ref target="#figure34">Figure 34</ref>). The inaccessible RealMedia
                        sound file in <title rend="italic">TAopening</title> was replaced with an
                        MP3 transcode, which is now downloadable again. In keeping with <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title>'s use of HTML for styling, CSS styling was
                        avoided as much as possible. Thus, instead of using separate CSS pages for
                        the correction of deprecated font tags (<ref target="#figure35">Figure
                            35</ref>), CSS styling was hard-coded into the HTML using internal
                        styles (<ref target="#figure36">Figure 36</ref>). Correcting the font size
                        tags also required a translation to a contemporary CSS font-size system
                        (using pt) from a legacy system that used a relational scale from 1-7 (<ref
                            target="#figure37">Figure 37</ref>). The deprecated
                            <gi>blink</gi> tags (<ref target="#figure38">Figure
                        38</ref>) were reactivated by a new JavaScript function that identifies text
                        between two <gi>blink</gi> tags and animates it to blink (<ref
                            target="#figure39">Figure 39</ref>).</p>
                    <p>As a measure of preventive conservation, legacy HTML tags were also addressed
                        in cases, where deprecation was not yet complete, but anticipated. Amongst
                        others, this applied to the popular HTML tag <gi>frameset</gi>,
                        which is widely used in <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> to integrate
                        several scrollable HTML pages into one window. To prevent these pages from
                        near-future corruption, the framesets were replaced with borderless tables
                        for simple page layouts, along with additional iFrames for more complex
                        designs. <figure xml:id="figure34">

                <p>If the above describes the artwork’s conceptual and technical identity, its place
                    within digital art history and the process of its restoration, then what of its
                    digital aesthetics and its discursive fields? This article will finish with some
                    preliminary thoughts that bring to the fore aspects of the work’s original
                    context within digital cultures of the late twentieth century while also raising
                    questions — which will be answered not in this article but by the new audiences
                    who will now come to the piece — about how it might be experienced within a very
                    different digital context today.</p>

                    <head>4.1 Digital Culture in the 1990s</head>
                    <p>Sherry Turkle’s 1995 publication <title rend="italic">Life on the Screen:
                            Identity in the Age of the Internet</title> documents contexts central
                        to the work’s formation, and helps situate it retrospectively within 1990s
                        digital cultures. This publication reflects, and reflects on, early life on
                        the internet and offers a sense of the possibilities (as well as some of the
                        potential problems) that emerged in the 1990s for the construction of the
                        self online. Turkle is particularly interested in the therapeutic and
                        liberatory potential of the expression of the self through multiple
                        identities that the internet seemed to offer by way of its anonymity. In the
                        third section of the book she dwells particularly on the MUD environments
                        (Multi User Domains) that enabled online communities to set up collective
                        online worlds such as the LambdaMOO (an online MUD community that created an
                        early ‘second-life’ type environment), in which participants constructed
                        their own characters and interacted with others. As Turkle’s analysis shows,
                        there was no sense that these characters were supposed or presumed to be
                        mimetic representations of their creators: participants often had more than
                        one character, either sequentially or synchronically, and their characters
                        were often clearly fictitious, being speaking animals or otherwise
                        humanly-impossible figures. In her chapter on <title rend="quotes">Tinysex
                            and Gender Trouble</title>, Turkle represents cyberfeminist
                        perspectives, among others, and outlines several case studies that
                        demonstrate the possibilities for expression and development of the self
                        that stem from gender swapping in the participant’s MUD character or
                        characters (see, for example, <ptr target="#turkle1995" loc="220"/>). This
                        digital utopianism is a key theme for Cheang’s work, and will be discussed
                        further in the next section.</p>
                    <p>Turkle also returns repeatedly in the book to the case of the virtual rape
                        that occurred in 1992 in LambdaMoo. This is a case in which a character
                        called Mr. Bungle allegedly used a piece of code, referred to as a
                            <soCalled>voodoo doll</soCalled>, that enabled him to take over others’
                        characters to control them and their actions. The violations perpetrated
                        caused outrage within the community and a revisiting of the governance
                        structures of that online world. The case was written about by Julian
                        Dibbell in <title rend="quotes">A Rape in Cyberspace</title>, published in
                            <title rend="italic">The Village Voice</title>
                        <ptr target="#dibbell1993"/>. Dibbell’s piece (and his reflection on the
                        accountability of words and deeds) was influential for Turkle <ptr
                            target="#turkle1995" loc="253"/>, and in turn for Cheang’s work. Cheang
                        was in correspondence with Dibbell, and his work influenced the <title
                            rend="italic">mooplay</title> section of <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title> substantially, particularly in its central concern with
                        sexual violence. Transcripts from the Mr. Bungle case are also quoted in
                            <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>, and the very concept of the
                        virtual court might be seen to be inspired by the events around the Mr.
                        Bungle case that Dibbell outlines.</p>
                    <p>The concept of the Panopticon, which forms one of <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title>'s interfaces (and which Cheang researched extensively,
                        as the work’s credit notes show), is also the subject for a section of
                        Turkle’s book. In <title rend="italic">Discipline and Punish</title>, Michel
                        Foucault used the image of Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon prison to express his
                        sense that all structures of social hierarchy have developed to institute
                        the type of power Bentham envisages in the Panopticon: one in which
                        subjects’ exposure to constant potential surveillance leads to a
                        self-censoring, self-regulating enforcement from within <ptr
                            target="#foucault1975"/>. The Panopticon used surveillance as a tool of
                        mind control. For Cheang, the Panopticon represents those medical and legal
                        discourses that have surveiled, diagnosed, taxonomized, proscribed and
                        regulated formations of gender and sexuality. For Turkle, however, it is the
                        internet itself that offers a whole new dimension to the reach of the social
                        Panopticon: <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#turkle1995">In our day, increasingly
                                centralized databases provide a material basis for a vastly extended
                                Panopticon that could include the Internet</quote>
                            <ptr target="#turkle1995" loc="248"/>
                        </cit>. It should perhaps come as no surprise that the web was perceived as
                        an engine of both liberation and suppression. Early writings on the web
                        often present polarized utopic and dystopic visions, so it is perhaps
                        fitting that in this important piece of early web art, that ambivalence
                        around its medium is carried implicitly in the Panopticon image.</p>

                    <p>The above contexts and discourses are all central to Cheang’s art work and in
                        many ways <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> acts as a creative engagement
                        with, and interrogation of, issues in digital cultures that were key points
                        of reflection at its time of production. However, the work interweaves these
                        with multiple other discursive contexts to give a richly multi-layered
                        texture and a much broader historical reach. Within a strong theoretical
                        framework (Lacan’s theories of gender and sexuality are, for example,
                        invoked in the artwork in addition to those of Foucault), the work creates a
                        collage of discursive textures. The virtual trial of Mr. Bungle in the
                        LambdaMOO online community, for example, is juxtaposed with the recent trial
                        in the wake of Brandon Teena’s death. References to online MUD communities
                        and the discourses of science fiction and fantasy are interwoven with
                        references to historical documents from medical and legal discourses that
                        form the disturbingly real backbone of the work. The popular memes of the
                        road trip provide a backdrop to the piece that is both fantasy and reality,
                        the stuff of fiction and everyday life.</p>
                    <p>While creative genres envelop the piece, it is striking how much of what is
                        presented in <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> is historical fact. Of
                        course the work is based around the life and death of Brandon Teena, but
                        what is perhaps more difficult to see at first glance is how many of the
                        other characters in the piece are figures from history. The work is a
                        substantial history of LGBTQ+ identities, often connected with issues of
                        race, at the same time as it is a creative piece. Alan Turing features in
                        the <title rend="italic">panopticon</title> episode as one of the
                        better-known parts of this narrative, but all the other characters in the
                            <title rend="italic">panopticon</title> (with the exception of two that
                        were added in 1999 in conjunction with the Sydney Mardi Gras) were also,
                        over the course of the team’s research, discovered to be real historical
                        figures. Historical research discovered, for example, that <soCalled>Roni’s
                            Scribbles</soCalled> refers to a transgender prison inmate whose blog
                        with that title documented issues of transgender prison life.<note>A
                            substantial analysis of the historical figures featured in the piece was
                            conducted by Emma Dickson, one of the students working on the project,
                            supervised by author Marion Thain.</note> This work, then, is a creative
                        engagement with historical facts. It is a blended work of fact and
                        fiction.</p>
                    <p>Embedding the documentary within envelopes of science fiction, fantasy, and
                        other creative discourses enables documentary histories to be brought into
                        creative worlds. Brandon Teena is taken on a road trip that includes space
                        travel, and Cheang not only takes the central character into places
                        geographically distant from home, but also offers a journey into a
                        cross-historically congregated LGBTQ+ community. In this way, the piece
                        takes on something of the idea of the online community that was created by
                        the early MUD groups: a second life in the digital environment in which
                        alternative communities, not available in the local geographical
                        environment, could be sought. Of course – as Turkle’s work on the MUD
                        communities shows — the digital environment was also celebrated at this time
                        as a space in which one could, at least ostensibly, take on whatever
                        identity (sometimes human, sometimes not) one chose, and switch between
                        multiple identities. Yet we now inhabit a world dominated by social media
                        platforms in which the notion of authenticity often rests on the creation of
                        a single, stable, identity, which must be performed under a
                            <soCalled>real</soCalled>, stable, name and reflect
                            <soCalled>real</soCalled> experiences. Multiple accounts, multiple
                        identities, and pseudonyms are often discouraged (a desire for
                            <soCalled>transparency</soCalled> might be a motivation; the
                        requirements of the profiling that funds the sites might also push in this
                        direction). It will be interesting to see what new questions Cheang’s work
                        will raise for an audience at home within this very different context.</p>

                    <p>Arguably what has changed even more than these digital cultural contexts, is
                        our experience of digital interfaces – and <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title> is a particularly interesting work in terms of what is
                        required of us as viewers (or perhaps more appropriately navigators) when we
                        come to its digital interface. The interactivity demanded by this piece is
                        not of the nature of the full body participation that is usually the focus
                        for scholarship around the nature of interactive digital art (see, for
                        example, Roberto Simanowski’s chapter on <title rend="quotes">Interactive
                            Installations</title>; <ptr target="#simanowski2011" loc="120–157"/>).
                        The user is not asked to engage phenomenologically with this work, but
                        rather through a cursor. Yet it is interesting how much persistent
                        interactivity of that kind is needed to navigate the work. As already noted,
                        actively moving the cursor over the interface is necessary to bring up
                            <title rend="italic">bigdoll</title>, and even more so in order to find
                        that illusive point of entry to the main <title rend="italic"
                            >roadtrip</title> interface. Once in <title rend="italic"
                            >roadtrip</title>, further activity is required, or at least rewarded,
                        from the viewer. If one continuously moves the cursor over the road, images
                        appear that you would otherwise not see. These are of motels, road signs,
                        and other icons of the American highway. More importantly, however, the user
                        needs to click on the already visible images by the side of the road in
                        order to be taken through to particular episodes of the trip, and once
                        inside each episode it is striking that most of the content demands some
                        sort of interaction – even if that interaction is just a matter of scrolling
                        or expanding windows to reveal the full text. It is less a sense of bodily
                        involvement that is important here, but of becoming an active agent, and
                        being aware of our agency. Yet this autonomy is limited within the work,
                        which is insistent that any desire to control our exploration is
                        deliberately curtailed and playfully frustrated in various ways. Most
                        obviously, as one tries to navigate the work, the <title rend="italic"
                            >roadtrip</title> interface moves continuously outside of our control,
                        constantly propelling the viewer along the road, meaning we can click into
                        episodes along the way but we can’t stop, slow down, or go back to something
                        we missed – we simply have to wait for it to come around again. It is also a
                        nice touch that, at certain points, moving the cursor over one section
                        brings up an icon that always appears on the opposite side of the road –
                        thus constantly frustrating the viewer’s desire to interact with it through
                        the cursor. This kind of playfulness builds up expectations of interactivity
                        in order to tease the viewer with them: within its microcosm the work seems
                        to be asking us to experience self-consciously the tension between our
                        autonomy and the limits of our autonomy. This keeps our attention as viewers
                        or navigators of the art, and it makes us interestingly aware of being
                        agents, but also subjects within a digital world that is outside our
                        control.</p>
                    <p>This interactive aesthetic is demonstrated particularly through the
                        importance of our experience of the “random” as a core component of the
                        artwork <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>. Cheang generates the
                        experience of randomness within the work at times as an aesthetic illusion
                        and at times through genuine uses of randomized interaction with the work’s
                        media repository. For example, our very access to the work through the
                            <title rend="italic">bigdoll</title> interface requires us to click on a
                        particular section of that interface that is not marked as any different
                        from any of the other squares within that field. Our interactive exploration
                        suddenly, and as a result of our random exploration, opens up the inner
                        world of the work: <title rend="italic">roadtrip</title>. While discovered
                        only through random interaction, however, the point of access never changes
                        – it is merely unmarked. The work generates such experiences of randomness
                        in many different ways at many different points. The navigation around the
                            <title rend="italic">panopticon</title>, for example, appears random
                        because the links from one cell to another do not take one in any obviously
                        sequential or numerical order, yet the navigation in fact will always take
                        you through the same apparently random loops.<note> This was part of the
                            findings of an study of the narrative structure of the <title
                                rend="italic">panopticon</title> undertaken by Emma Dickson,
                            supervised by author Marion Thain.</note> Moments at which the work
                        genuinely exploits the potential of interaction with its stored media to
                        generate random possibilities include, for example, the chat in <title
                            rend="italic">mooplay</title>. Here the responses to user interaction
                        are taken randomly from the texts stored within the work <ptr
                            target="#kholeif2013" loc="25:01"/>. The pop-up windows offering
                            <soCalled>theory pills</soCalled> (colourful tablet images with legends
                        such as <q>take one</q>) that appear from time to time outside of the
                        artwork’s main window are also generated randomly, offering a humorous
                        commentary on the artwork’s own (serious) engagement with discourses of both
                        gender theory and medicine.</p>
                    <p>The aesthetics of the piece seem as engaging now as ever, even if the effect
                        is somewhat different. What must at the time of its conception have been a
                        much more futuristic interface now has something of the look of a piece of
                        contemporary retro techno chic. The playful processes required of the viewer
                        to engage with the piece (the extensive random exploration of the interface
                        through the cursor, and the discovery of <soCalled>hidden</soCalled> links)
                        might be less confounding, in some ways, to the users of web 2.0 than to
                        those engaging with the digital interface in those relatively early days,
                        but the act of exploration required of the viewer is still challenging.
                        Indeed, online interfaces have become a lot more intuitive to use over the
                        past couple of decades, resulting, arguably, in less patience with the type
                        of navigation the artwork requires (indeed, there have already been reports
                        of viewers thinking the piece is not functioning because they haven’t
                        persevered with the random interaction necessary to get beyond the initial
                        launch screen). How might the changed context of interface design change the
                        nature of the audience’s experience of the work? And how might the
                        contemporary context alter our experience of the connections it makes
                        between content and form? As younger audiences come to the piece it will
                        resonate afresh, and differently, for twenty-first-century digital
                        natives.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>While this essay places the artwork <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>,
                    briefly, in various digital contexts, its restoration to public view will enable
                    a fuller consideration through the multiple lenses of media studies and a
                    broader reconsideration of its importance in relation to a host of other
                    contexts — especially, perhaps, to histories of gender, sexuality, and race, but
                    also to other issues of identity, community, and digitality.<note>Many pieces
                        (in periodicals ranging from <title rend="italic">The Guardian</title> to
                        the <title rend="italic">Wall Street Journal</title>) considered the work’s
                        role in relation to discourses of gender, sexuality and race soon after it
                        first appeared, and there are signs that scholars and commentators are
                        returning to the artwork. For example, the artist and activist group Toxic
                        Lesbian held a public navigation event of <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title> on Feb. 12, 2016 at the Matadero Contemporary Art
                        Center in Madrid; on April 13, 2017, Rhizome included <title rend="italic"
                            >Brandon</title> in its Net Art Anthology <ptr target="#rhizome2017"/>;
                        from Sept, 15-23, 2017, <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> was presented
                        during the International Queer Film Festival in Lisbon; and the Museum of
                        Contemporary Art Chicago will include <title rend="italic">Brandon</title>
                        in its upcoming exhibition <title rend="quotes">I Was Raised on the
                            Internet</title> (opening June 2018). At the point of this writing, the
                        authors are also aware of current unpublished academic research into <title
                            rend="italic">Brandon</title>.</note> While our commentary is limited to
                    a consideration of digital contexts, our collaboration aims to contribute to an
                    evolving methodology of digital scholarship: one in which universities work
                    together with major partners in the culture industry, and in which project teams
                    come together from across the disciplines. Here we build on the strengths of
                    emerging collaborative practices such as those seen in the application of
                    computational techniques to identify paper molds for Rembrandt’s drawings <ptr
                        target="#johnson2015"/>; hosting hackathons to encourage data explorations
                    to support the study of art history such as the 2016 Museum of Modern Art <title
                        rend="italic">Datathon</title>
                    <ptr target="#moma2016"/>; as well as applying art historical approaches to
                    digital-born art, such as using principles in technical art history to study
                    works of software-based art <ptr target="#wharton2014"/>. In all cases, the
                    cross-disciplinarity of the team requires experts to forge new approaches in
                    this field.</p>
                <p>We have deliberately preserved some of the differences in prose style between our
                    different disciplinary voices in order to better reflect what it might mean to
                    bring together such diverse fields within a multi-author team. We celebrate the
                    play of differences around a single object rather than to trying to present a
                    more homogeneous veneer. The same is true for content as well as style:
                    ultimately our aim is not to construct a new, unified, thesis about Cheang’s
                    work, but rather to bring together around a single focus some of the very
                    different kinds of scholarly concerns that can usefully interact around a
                    digital artwork. In giving Cheang’s work this kind of attention we are also, of
                    course, asserting its significance within a history of digital culture. It is a
                    tribute to it to say that an artwork created within a medium that has changed
                    more rapidly than any other since its creation still feels, in various ways,
                    relevant. It is not surprising then that the work was included in Rhizome’s
                        <title rend="quotes">Net Art Anthology</title>: <cit>

                    Guggenheim with NYU, the work can continue to hold its place as a formative
                    moment in this history.</p>

                <p>The study and restoration of <title rend="italic">Brandon</title> would not have
                    been possible without the generous supporters of the Guggenheim’s CCBA
