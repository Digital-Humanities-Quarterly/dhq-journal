         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>Claims of the supposed disappearance of materiality in digital culture often entail a
               nostalgic reimagining of the supposedly embodied, personal or creative aspects of
               earlier writing technologies, including handwriting. Although handwriting was never a
               fully embodied writing technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often
               characterize it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not
               only in critical literature but also in contemporary graphical media such as video
               games.</p>
            <p>Two recent Nintendo DS games, <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> (2009) and
                  <title rend="italic">The World Ends with You</title> (2007), represent two
               alternative modalities of such nostalgia for handwriting. <title rend="italic"
                  >Scribblenauts</title> claims to fully restore the creative properties of
               handwriting, but inevitably fails to do so. By contrast, <title rend="italic"
                  >TWEWY</title> claims to offer not handwriting itself but a digital- and
               DS-specific equivalent. Therefore, it opens up possibilities for critical reflection
               on the past meaning of handwriting and on the future of the values that handwriting
               has come to symbolize. </p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>In this essay I discuss two recent Nintendo DS games, <title rend="italic"
                  >Scribblenauts</title> (2009) and <title rend="italic">The World Ends with
                  You</title> (2007), as examples of nostalgic fantasies of handwriting. Nostalgia
               for handwriting, and more generally for the materiality of older media in general, is
               a common trope in contemporary discussions of medial change. However, such
               discussions often understand older media as being more fully material than is in fact
               the case. When this assumption is not challenged, it leads to attempts to recapture
               the materiality of older media using the tools of new media — attempts which
               inevitably fail, as my discussion of <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> will
               show. On the other hand, in my discussion of <title rend="italic">The World Ends with
                  You</title>, we will see that nostalgia for the materiality of older media can
               also be mobilized productively: such nostalgia can prompt a critical examination of
               the question of why materiality is desired in the first place.</p>
            <p>Materiality has emerged as a key issue in many recent discussions of digital media
               and its relation to older media.<note>See <ptr target="#brown2010"/> for a helpful
                  survey of uses of the term <term>materiality</term> in digital studies.</note>
               While materiality is a notoriously slippery concept, for the present purposes I will
               define it, adapting Johanna Drucker, as the physical, embodied substrate of a sign —
               as those aspects of a sign which are excessive to its signifying value. For Drucker,
               any sign involves <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#drucker1997">two major intertwined strands: that of
                     a relational, insubstantial, and nontranscendent difference and that of a
                     phenomenological, apprehendable, immanent substance</quote>
                  <ptr target="#drucker1997" loc="43"/>
               </cit>. For example, any given instance of a printed letter Q can be understood
               either from the viewpoint of its semantic value or from that of its material aspects,
               such as its typographic properties, the type of ink used to print it, and the
               material substrate on which it is printed. These latter features are surplus to the
               signifying value of the letter — a Q is still understood as the <q>same</q> letter
               when any or all of the above-named features are altered, within certain limits — but
               they connect the letter to the cultural context from which it emerges.</p>
            <p>The introduction of digital technology inaugurates a crisis for traditional models of
               materiality. In pre-digital media, the connection between material and signifying
               aspects of a sign is unbreakable; any printed, painted, or handwritten sign is
               literally inseparable from its physical support and its material properties. Digital
               technology is often understood, however, as introducing a gap between these
               properties of the sign, such as by separating what Matthew Kirschenbaum calls
                  <term>formal materiality</term> (briefly, what a sign looks like) from forensic
               materiality (what it actually consists of) <ptr loc="9–10" target="#kirschenbaum2008"
               />. Digital technologies like virtual reality and video games are therefore often
               criticized as disembodying the sign or as unmooring it from its materiality. Casey
               Alt, for example, notes that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#alt2002">Virtual Reality has signified for most
                     critics a superficial doubling of surface reality that privileges visuality in
                     such a way as to more strongly foster an eye-mind link that has little, if
                     anything, to do with the particular materialities of human embodiment</quote>
                  <ptr target="#alt2002" loc="387"/>
               </cit>, although he goes on to significantly complicate this claim.</p>
            <p>At stake in such polemics over materiality is the question of what happens to the
                  <emph>embodied self</emph> when changes occur in the technological tools whereby
               that self communicates itself to the world. Older media technologies — photographic
               film and movable type, for example — may be understood (at least naïvely) as being
               embodied in the same way that human beings are, as having something <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#alt2002">to do with the particular materialities of human
                  embodiment.</quote> By virtue of their embodied nature, analog and mechanical
               technologies seem to osmotically absorb the idiosyncratic properties of the embodied
               self that uses them. The supplantation of such technologies by digital technologies
               may thus be understood as a supplantation of the embodied self. The link between
               embodiment and selfhood is especially strong in the case of the mechanical writing
               technology I will discuss here, <term>viz.</term> handwriting, and the fate
               of handwriting may be seen as an index of the fate of selfhood in the digital
               era.</p>

            <head>Fantasies of Handwriting</head>
            <p>Handwriting, by definition, is evidence of the presence of the writer's body at the
               place and time of writing.<note>As argued in <ptr target="#derrida1982"/>, this
                  presence is always already past; a written sign testifies that its writer was
                  there but is there no longer. The nostalgic discourse of handwriting tends to
                  ignore this fact.</note> Moreover, handwriting necessarily involves a certain
                  <emph>excessive</emph> component not reducible to its signifying value. The shape,
               line weight, and other graphic properties of a given handwritten letter are
               necessarily present, but are not required in order to differentiate the letter from
               other letters; that is, all these properties could change, at least within a certain
               limited range, and the letter would be recognizable as the <q>same</q> letter. The
               excessive aspects of handwriting are an index of the physical and gestural activity
               of the hand that produced the letter. Because handwriting reveals both the fact of
               the writer's prior bodily presence and the idiosyncratic qualities of the writer's
               gestural movements, it is often understood in a more general sense as graphically
               embodying the writer's personality or self. For example, the nineteenth-century
               pseudoscience of graphology held that a person's character could be read from the
               graphic properties of his or her handwriting. Indeed, because this theory presupposes
               that people <emph>have</emph> a unique and unchangeable personality, it appealed to
               nineteenth-century Americans who were faced with the loss of other traditional
               grounds for subjectivity <ptr target="#thornton1996" loc="109 and passim"/>.
               Similarly, the Belgian comics scholar Philippe Marion uses psychoanalytic theory to
               argue that lettering is a privileged sign of the unique enunciative entity
               responsible for a comics text <ptr target="#marion1993"/>. Such theories of
               handwriting hold that in writing by hand, one creates an inscription which functions
               simultaneously as a trace of one's bodily presence and as a physical object that
               exists independently of oneself. According to these theories, in writing by hand, one
               literally <emph>writes oneself into the world</emph>.</p>
            <p>This, however, represents not a factual account of handwriting but what I would call
               a <term>fantasy of handwriting</term>, because the assignment of positive
               connotations of personality and subjectivity to handwriting is a modern invention
               which becomes imaginable only after the confrontation of handwriting with alternative
               writing systems. When handwriting was the only writing technology available to
               individuals, it was often an index of conformity, not individuality. In
               eighteenth-century England and America, handwriting was one of several arts devoted
               to <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#thornton1996">the faithful representation of one's
                     place in society</quote>
                  <ptr target="#thornton1996" loc="35"/>
               </cit>. In Victorian America, handwriting was a means of revealing character, but in
               the sense of moral uprightness, not idiosyncratic uniqueness. Sloppy handwriting
               might have connoted dishonesty and lack of character rather than positive
               unconventionality <ptr loc="52" target="#thornton1996"/>. Handwriting historically
               often served to mechanize the body rather than liberating its kinesthetic potential;
               for example, the purpose of the Palmerian practice of handwriting pedagogy was to
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#thornton1996">[turn] the handwriter himself into a
                  machine</quote> capable of competing with assembly-line technology <ptr
                  target="#thornton1996" loc="177"/>; (see also <ptr loc="21–61 passim"
                  target="#thornton1996"/>).</p>
            <p>The modern understanding of handwriting as expressive of the writer's unique
               character is therefore largely attributable to the encounter of handwriting with —
               and replacement of handwriting by — print and type. Handwriting takes on connotations
               of uniqueness, personality and embodiment precisely because of its contrast with
               newer technologies that appear to lack these connotations. For example: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#neef2006">The introduction of the typewriter, for
                     instance, shifted the emphasis to the standardization of script, but it may
                     even have increased the notion of authenticity associated with
                     handwriting</quote>
                  <ptr target="#neef2006" loc="8"/>
               </cit>. The Arts and Crafts calligraphy revival, which emphasized <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#johnston1939">the characteristics which distinguish
                     one person's hand from another's </quote>
                  <dhq:citRef>qtd. in <ptr target="#johnston1939" loc="180–181"/>
                  </dhq:citRef>
               </cit> and sought <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#thornton1996">to affirm the value of human
                     individuality</quote>
                  <ptr target="#thornton1996" loc="181"/>
               </cit>, explicitly critiqued the mechanization of handwriting by printed copybooks.
               At stake in fantasies of handwriting, then, is a certain traditional concept of the
               self as uniquely embodied, as irreducibly bound to its material instantiation. The
               fantasy of handwriting develops as an attempt to defend this concept of the self
               against technologies that seem to replace the material, bodily self with a mechanical
               or digital surrogate.</p>
            <p>However, if fantasies of handwriting do no more than lament the loss of the fully
               embodied self, they risk becoming purely nostalgic in the restorative sense.<note>For
                  an explanation of the distinction between restorative and reflective nostalgia,
                  see paragraph 41 below.</note> In order to be productive, fantasies of handwriting
               need to acknowledge that handwriting, and the self it connotes — a self characterized
               by individuality, subjectivity and embodiment — is <emph>always already a lost
                  object</emph>. Its embodied and individualizing aspects come to prominence only
               when threatened by mechanical technology. In the absence of such threats, these
               aspects of handwriting often fell below the threshold of attention. Analogously, the
               typewriter might initially have seemed like an ominous symbol of the mechanization
               and disembodiment of writing, but when compared to the word processor, the typewriter
               may become nostalgically reenvisioned as an embodied mechanism. (As Arthur Conan
               Doyle observed, because each typewriter has a unique pattern of deterioration,
               typewritten text can be as idiosyncratic as handwriting (qtd. in <ptr
                  target="#gitelman1999" loc="215"/>).</p>
            <p>Fantasies of handwriting are created only in retrospect, as a product of the same
               process of technological change that renders handwriting obsolete. Therefore, these
               fantasies are based on a revisionary, imagined version of handwriting, which is not
               necessarily functionally identical to <q>originary</q> handwriting (i.e. handwriting
               as it existed before typewriting or word processing). As Svetlana Boym argues, <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#boym2002">
                     <emph>The object of nostalgia is further away than it appears.</emph> Nostalgia
                     is never literal, but lateral. It looks sideways. It is dangerous to take it at
                     face value. Nostalgic reconstruction is based on mimicry; the past is remade in
                     the image of a present or a desired future, collective designs are made to
                     resemble personal aspirations or vice versa.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#boym2002" loc="354"/>
               </cit> If the introduction of digital media results in nostalgia for earlier writing
               technologies, then this nostalgia refers to objects that never truly existed and are
               constructed only retroactively. The values for which handwriting is cherished were
               not necessarily present or noticeable before handwriting had anything to be compared
               to. Therefore, nostalgia for handwriting is deeply ambivalent: it wishes to return to
               an original condition of handwriting, but knows such a return is already impossible
               as soon as the need for it is felt.<note>I'm grateful to Michael Mayne for his kind
                  assistance with the theory of nostalgia.</note> Moreover, because fantasies of
               handwriting arise only after handwriting becomes practically obsolete, they are
               typically promulgated using the same technologies that they critique.<note>According
                  to <ptr target="#mcgill1997"/>, a similarly paradoxical situation resulted in the
                  19th century when printed writing manuals began to supplant the authority of the
                  individual penmanship teacher.</note> In order to be honest rather than purely
               ludditical or atavistic — in order to be reflective rather than restorative, in
               Boym's terminology — fantasies of handwriting need to acknowledge the profound gap
               between originary and reenvisioned handwriting.</p>
            <p>For example, Sven Birkerts, a notable opponent of digital technology, observed in
               1996 that word processing destroys the commitment to truth that characterized
               handwriting and typewriting. Because correcting errors on a word processor is a
               trivial task, the writer no longer needs to think carefully before writing <ptr
                  target="#birkerts2006" loc="157"/>. This claim is a classic piece of revisionary
               nostalgia. It advocates a simple return to the past, ignoring the fact that such a
               return is no longer possible, and not least because the past is only constructed in
               light of the present. Until Birkerts used a writing technology that enabled him to
               correct errors effortlessly, he presumably didn't realize that difficulty in
               correcting errors was beneficial. In a text written ten years later, Birkerts admits
               that he has been forced to accept the use of digital technology. Though he still
               writes his first drafts in longhand, he now e-mails them to his editor, and his house
               is full of technological gadgets, including a PlayStation <ptr target="#birkerts2006"
                  loc="231–232"/>. As a reluctant convert to digital technology, he feels <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#birkerts2006">like a man living in exile [...]
                     operating provisionally, skeptically, not letting himself form deeper ties
                     because he believes he will one day be returning home</quote>
                  <ptr target="#birkerts2006" loc="234"/>
               </cit>. Yet Birkerts admits that this belief is not a sincere one, that he knows he
               can't return from the Babylonian captivity of computers to the Zion of manual
               writing. Birkerts's revised argument is an example of a reflective fantasy of
               handwriting, which acknowledges that to remember handwriting is also to retroactively
               construct it. Here the fantasy of handwriting becomes not merely a lament for the
               loss of the handwritten self, but a meditation on the conditions of possibility of
               that self.</p>

            <head>Handwriting in Video Games</head>
            <p>Contemporary video games represent an important site of both restorative and
               reflective fantasies of handwriting. It seems counterintuitive that a digital
               technology could operate as a means of remediating and recollecting a manual one. Yet
               as alluded to above, fantasies of handwriting arise only due to the replacement of
               handwriting by more efficient technologies. It's therefore perhaps inevitable that
               these fantasies should be communicated by means of those technologies.</p>
            <p>Handwriting, typing and mental writing had a surprising degree of importance at the
               origins of video gaming, and their widespread replacement by graphics produces a
               sense of nostalgia for these modes of interaction. Nick Montfort reminds us that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#montfort2004">early interaction with computers
                     happened largely on paper: on paper tape, on punchcards, and on print terminals
                     and teletypewriters, with their scroll-like supplies of continuous paper for
                     printing output and input both</quote>
                  <ptr loc="n.p." target="#montfort2004"/>
               </cit>. For example, Will Crowther wrote <title rend="italic">Adventure</title>
               (1975), the first text adventure game, on an ASR-33 Teletype, an interface that
               preserved the embodied properties of the typewriter, and he may have corrected his
               code in pen or pencil <ptr loc="n.p." target="#montfort2004"/>.<note>For a more
                  detailed explanation of this claim, see <ptr target="#kashtan2011"/>.</note> The
               game was created in tandem with a hand-drawn map of part of Kentucky's Mammoth Cave,
               which was based on computational line plots of data gathered by Crowther and other
               cavers with compasses and measuring tapes <ptr target="#jerz2007" loc="¶59"/>. At the
               origin of <title rend="italic">Adventure</title>, and thus of a certain tradition of
               narrative video gaming, are various processes of embodied writing. Playing text
               adventures equally involves real or metaphorical writing. The text adventure game
               involves the exploration of a simulated world which is not visually depicted, so to
               navigate that space effectively, the player must develop a functional understanding
               of its geography and the contents of each of its locations. One way to do this is to
               imagine what the gameworld looks like. This process is comparable to writing or
               drawing because it involves the creation of a visual artifact (imaginary in one case,
               real in the other) which didn't exist before and which is to some extent unique to
                  oneself.<note>A full explanation of this claim is beyond the scope of this paper.
                  I hope to explain it in more detail elsewhere.</note> Another way to understand
               the gameworld visually was to map it on paper. Accordingly, hand-drawn and
               hand-annotated paper maps were an invaluable accessory to early Adventure players
                  <ptr loc="n.p." target="#montfort2004"/>.</p>
            <p>Even after graphics became the norm in video games, scriptural processes continued to
               characterize their creation and reception in various ways. Ken and Roberta Williams's
                  <title rend="italic">Mystery House</title>, the earliest graphical adventure game,
               featured vector graphics rendered with a light pen, some of which were
               representations of handwriting <ptr loc="131–132" target="#kirschenbaum2008"/>.
               Mapping the gameworld on paper was still often necessary even when the gameworld was
               visually rendered. For example, in <title rend="italic">Wizardry</title> (1981), the
               dungeons were designed so as to be mappable on graph paper and the manual emphasized
               the importance of mapping <ptr target="#barton2008" loc="71"/>. Players of such games
               also used paper in order to keep track of other relevant information not tracked
               automatically by the game. Players of games like <title rend="italic"
                  >Wizardry</title> and <title rend="italic">Ultima</title> (1980) were heavily
               reliant on paper <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#myers2003">notes, records and ledgers of their

                  <ptr loc="17" target="#myers2003"/>
               </cit>. In this respect these games mimicked the non-electronic genre from which they
               were descended: the <title rend="quotes">paper-and-pencil</title> RPG <ptr loc="16"
                  target="#myers2003"/>, whose very name comes from the fact that it employs
               handwriting as a system of record-keeping.</p>
            <p>Over the course of video game history, the embodied and scriptural modes of
               interaction characteristic of early video gaming were shunted aside by other modes of
               interaction which claimed to offer greater transparency or immersivity.<note>On
                  transparency, see <ptr target="#bolter2003"/>. For a detailed account of immersion
                  in video games, see <ptr target="#mcmahan2003"/>.</note>
               <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#myers2003">After <title rend="italic">ADVENT</title>
                     [i.e. <title rend="italic">Adventure</title>], the adventure genre moved
                     through several superficially distinct forms: the original text adventures;
                     graphic adventures (e.g., <title rend="italic">Myst</title>); and third-person
                     graphic adventures (e.g., <title rend="italic">King's Quest</title>). The
                     differences among these were the result of differences among game signifiers;
                     each employed the same basic signification process.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#myers2003" loc="15"/>
               </cit> These latter genres were functionally identical to the text adventure in terms
               of gameplay, but their more transparent graphical interfaces decreased the player's
               ability to inscribe himself or herself into the gameworld. The increasing visual
               richness of the gameworld deprives the player of the need or desire to imagine it. A
               game like <title rend="italic">Myst</title>, for example, offers the player little if
               any opportunity to inscribe anything into the gameworld because that world is already
               prerendered in immense detail. (This is ironic, since the premise of <title
                  rend="italic">Myst</title> is that one can transport oneself into other worlds by
                  <emph>writing</emph> about them, and the infradiegetic texts in the game are
               handwritten.) Figuratively, as graphics become more transparent, the condition of
               possibility of inscription on the player's part — the existence of a blank space on
               which to write — is lost. An analogous development was the introduction of
               automapping in the late 1980s, which eliminated the need to graphically depict the
               gameworld on paper.</p>
            <p>Mainstream accounts of video game history tend to ignore the loss of the
               inscriptional and material aspects of video gaming, or to treat this loss as the
               natural consequence of the medium's evolution toward greater transparency. For
               example, Julian Dibbell dismissively contrasts <title rend="italic"
               >Adventure</title>'s <quote rend="inline" source="#dibbell2001">laconic text
                  descriptions navigated by means of simple two-word commands</quote> with <title

                  <ptr target="#dibbell2001"/>
               </cit>. Dibbell characterizes <title rend="italic">Adventure</title>, with its sparse
               textual descriptions and its unnatural interface, as the starting point of a
               teleological progression that culminates in the radiant visuality and naturalistic
               interface of <title rend="italic">Myst</title> (and now in stereoscopic 3D graphics
               and controllerless interfaces like Microsoft's Kinect). In presenting transparency as
               the teleological goal of video gaming, such accounts seek to draw attention away from
               the possibilities of embodied inscription that are foreclosed by transparency,
               following what Terry Harpold calls the discourse of the upgrade path: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#harpold2009">Because technical innovation in popular
                     computing is driven more by the allure of expanding markets than by something
                     so quaint as a sense of responsibility to historical continuity, commercial
                     discourses of the upgrade path will inevitably promise consumers new and more
                     satisfying interactions, and encourage them to see the older ones as outmoded
                     or no longer relevant.</quote>

               </cit> Yet the disappearance of handwriting also inspires nostalgia for and fantasies
               of handwriting. Within the video game industry, this began to occur as early as 1983
               when Infocom, the preeminent developer of text adventure games, released ads that
               claimed: <quote rend="block"

               </quote> This claim follows the logic of transparency <ptr target="#bolter2003"
                  loc="21–24"/> in that it characterizes text as <emph>more</emph> visually rich and
               immersive than graphics, since the power of imaginative visualization is not subject
               to the limits of current graphical technology. Accordingly, other ads from this
               campaign criticize the quality of contemporaneous computer graphics.</p>
            <p>Yet the ad also implies that text has advantages over graphics regardless of
               graphics' present state of technological evolution: it begins by claiming <q>there's never been a computer made by man that could
                  handle the images we produce. And there never will be.</q> Whatever their
               quality, graphics are limited by technological constraints, whereas mental images are
               limited only by the player's imaginative capacity and existing repertory of visual
               experience. (Perhaps deliberately, the Infocom ad fails to acknowledge that these are
               hardly insignificant limits, or that players might differ in their ability or
               inclination to visualize.) Moreover, imaginative visualization of the gameworld is an
               embodied process situated in the player's brain: the ad campaign describes the brain
               as <q>the world's most powerful graphics
                  technology.</q> Visualization varies according to the preferences of each
               individual player, and is thus as personal as handwriting, whereas graphics look the
               same to everyone. In stressing the value of text over graphics, Infocom nostalgically
               advocated the personalized aspects of older technology against the allegedly superior
               transparency of newer technology.</p>
            <p>This sort of nostalgia was more restorative than reflective, as it merely argued that
               the old technology was better than the new one. Such restorative nostalgia is not
               uncommon in the video game industry: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#whalen2008">As game technology has improved and as

                  <ptr loc="7" target="#whalen2008"/>
               </cit>. Video game nostalgia becomes reflective rather than restorative when game
               creators acknowledge that earlier video games are retroactively altered in the
               process of remembering them. Reflective nostalgia can even be aided by the use of the
               same new gaming technologies that made the old ones obsolete; the superior
               affordances of new video gaming technologies can be used to open up ways of
               rethinking and reimagining older gaming genres and technologies. For example, the
               Nintendo DS <title rend="italic">Retro Game Challenge</title> (Namco Bandai Games,
               2007/2009) offers a collection of eight video games that parody or pay homage various
               NES games; it takes advantage of the superior storage of DS cartridges. What's
               essential, however, is that the nostalgic game not merely repeat the object of
               nostalgia; it must also acknowledge the fact that the object of nostalgia is
               unrecoverable in its originary form. Similar claims can be made about video games
               that incorporate nostalgia for and fantasies of handwriting. In order to be
               productive, such games have to take into account the profound gap between handwriting
               and the digital technologies used to remediate it, rather than seeking to fully
               restore handwriting to its original state.</p>
            <p>I will demonstrate this by means of case studies of two games for the Nintendo DS
               handheld system — a system which has unusual material features that, I will argue,
               make it particularly well adapted to the presentation of fantasies of handwriting.
               Thus, by examining DS games that take advantage of these features, we can learn much
               about how fantasies of handwriting are transformed by digital technology.</p>
            <p>The DS is unique in that it features two screens. The top screen is a conventional
               LCD screen, but the bottom screen is overlaid with a resistive touchscreen which
               accepts input from a stylus or other pointing device. A resistive touchscreen
               consists of two sheets of electrically resistive material with a gap between them.
               When the stylus makes contact with the surface of the screen, the two sheets are
               compressed together, creating an electrical impulse, and the X and Y coordinates of
               the location of the impulse are registered <ptr target="#wikipedia2010a"/>.</p>

            <p>Not all DS games require the use of the stylus at all — for example, <title

                  Quest V</title> (2009) use the stylus only for optional minigames. In some DS
               games — e.g. <title rend="italic">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</title> (2009)
               or <title rend="italic">Dragon Quest IX</title> (2010) — the stylus is used merely as
               a pointing device, and the player uses it only to perform nondiegetic operator acts
               or move acts <ptr target="#galloway2006" loc="12, 22"/>. In other games, however,
               using the stylus represents an expressive act, i.e. an action that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#galloway2006">exert[s] an expressive desire outward
                     from the player character to objects in the world that are deemed

                  <ptr target="#galloway2006" loc="24"/>
               </cit>. In DS games, the action expressed by using the stylus is often the act of
               using a tool, and the stylus often <emph>represents</emph> this tool, in the same
               sense in which a theatrical prop sword <q>represents</q> a real sword. This is a
               crucial difference between the DS stylus and other video game control mechanisms. In
               general, players always perform expressive acts by means of some form of material
               engagement with the game's control mechanism: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#galloway2006">while there is an imaginative form of

                  <ptr target="#galloway2006" loc="25"/>
               </cit>. However, with traditional control mechanisms the <q>physical form</q> and the
                  <q>imaginative form</q> usually have little in common. The player pushes a button
               to make the avatar jump, fire a gun, swing a sword, or do various other acts that are
               dissimilar to the act of pushing a button. By contrast, with the DS stylus, the
                  <q>physical form</q> of an expressive act often resembles its <q>imaginative
                  form,</q> because the player uses the stylus — an elongated, hand-held tool — to
               simulate an act that is performed using just such a tool. For example, in <title
                  rend="italic">Trauma Center: Under the Knife</title> (2005), the player uses the
               stylus as a scalpel, simulating the act of making an incision by <q>cutting</q> along
               a line drawn on a patient's body. In <title rend="italic">Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown
                  Wars</title> (2009), the player hotwires a car by using the stylus to unscrew the
               ignition switch. The player draws a circle on the screen, simulating the act of
               turning a screwdriver.</p>
            <p>Other contemporary gaming systems — the Nintendo Wii, the Sony Move, the Microsoft
               Kinect — make similar use of analog control mechanisms in order to erase the gap
               between the physical and the imaginative form of the expressive act. For example, in
                  <title rend="italic">Kinect Sports</title> (2010), the player plays table tennis
               using his or her hand as a paddle, or throws a javelin by making the appropriate arm
               motion. However, the DS differs from these three platforms in that it requires
               physical contact with a two-dimensional control surface. Using the Wii, Kinect or
               Move entails making gestures in the air, whether with a control device or without.
               Using the DS entails making inscriptions on a surface. This makes the DS uniquely
               appropriate for the simulation of physical acts that involve engagement between a
               hand-held tool and a flat surface — and the principal example of such an act is
                  <emph>writing</emph>. The DS is thus particularly well suited to the simulation of
               handwriting and the promulgation of fantasies of handwriting, and the two games I
               will analyze in depth both employ the DS for this purpose. Again, these games can be
               differentiated from games on other platforms that employ interfaces that mimic
               handwriting. Perhaps the most notable example of such a game is <title rend="italic"
                  >Ōkami</title> (Clover Studio, 2006), a PlayStation 2 game, later ported to the
               Wii, in which the player can transform the three-dimensionally rendered gameworld in
               various ways by writing on it with a <title rend="quotes">Celestial Brush.</title>
               <title rend="italic">Ōkami</title>, however, is controlled with an analog thumbstick
               (or later the Wiimote) rather than a true handwriting interface, and thus the player
               of Ōkami simulates handwriting by performing an act which only loosely resembles the
               actual act of handwriting. The difference between the Celestial Brush and a real ink
               brush is obvious — much more obvious than the difference between the DS stylus and an
               actual pen or pencil.</p>
            <p>Using the DS stylus <emph>feels</emph> like handwriting. This perception is
               reinforced by the material qualities of the system itself, which is about the size
               and shape of a small paperback volume. Some games (e.g. <title rend="italic">Hotel
                  Dusk: Room 215</title> [2007]) even ask the player to hold the DS sideways, so
               that the player feels he or she is holding a small datebook or planner in one hand,
               and writing in it with the other. It's because of the close perceptual similarity
               between DS writing and handwriting that the DS represents such a crucial test case
               for fantasies of handwriting. Does the DS merely create a dishonest simulacrum of
               handwriting, or can the DS open up a space for critical reflection on what
               handwriting means? My two case studies will address this question.</p>

            </head>
            <p>One of the most heavily hyped DS games of 2009, <title rend="italic"
                  >Scribblenauts</title> revolves around a premise which is brilliant in its
               simplicity. When the player writes the name of any object, within certain limits,
               that object is created. In other words, if the player writes anything from
                  <q>scissors</q> to <q>sewing machine</q> to <q>Cthulhu</q> (using either an
               onscreen keypad or a handwriting interface), that object appears in the gameworld.
               The player can then move it around with the stylus, and it can interact with other
               objects and with the player character. This simple premise creates the possibility of
               an arbitrarily large number of object interactions and puzzle solutions. <title
                  rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>'s lexicon includes tens of thousands of words,
               so any common object the player can think of is quite likely to be included, creating
               the impression that the player's freedom of action is limited less by the game's
               lexicon than by his or her imagination and vocabulary.</p>

            <p>
               <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> presents this gaming mechanic as a
               remediation of handwriting. To <q>scribble</q> is to <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#oed1989">write in an irregular, slovenly, or
                     illegible hand through haste or carelessness; also, to produce (marks, a
                     drawing, etc.) or portray (an object) by rapid and irregular strokes like those
                     of hurried writing</quote>
                  <ptr target="#oed1989"/>
               </cit>. Although <q>scribbling</q> may pertain to content as well as penmanship, the
               word has strong associations with handwriting. A scribble<emph>naut</emph>, then, is
               one who writes quickly and playfully, by hand, as a means of exploration — or, by
               analogy with <q>astronaut,</q> one who explores the realm of scribbles. On the game's
               cover, we see the avatar, Maxwell, writing with a pencil. The logo looks handwritten
               (the two B's look significantly different) and the slogan is set in the Comic Sans
               font, which mimics the stereotypical handwriting of comic book letterers. In the
               game, the visual motif of wide-ruled notebook paper, which appears on the handwriting
               interface screen, alludes to elementary school handwriting exercises. <title
                  rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> thus connects handwriting with childhood, and
               thus promises to return the player to an idyllic former state when handwriting
               represented a new way of expressing oneself both visually and linguistically. The DS
               itself is often denigrated as a system for children, perhaps due to this very
               association of handwriting with childhood as well as to its large library of
               educational software. <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> seems to accept this
               characterization and to turn it into something positive, as indicated by one artistic
               response to the game <ptr target="#munroe2009"/>: <figure xml:id="figure03">
                  <head>
                     <title>Scribblenauts</title>, from Randall Munroe's webcomic <title

            </p>
            <p>Rather than disputing the male stick figure's claim that <title rend="italic"
                  >Scribblenauts</title> is a <soCalled>DS kid's game</soCalled>
               or his equation of <q>DS</q> with <q>kids,</q> the female stick figure accuses him of
               pretentiousness. The point is that <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> is a
                  <soCalled>kid's game</soCalled> in a positive sense. It
               partakes of the optimism of childhood and reminds the player of the novelty and
               empowerment involved in first learning to write. (This is, of course, restorative
               nostalgia, as it ignores that the study of handwriting is usually stigmatized in
               American culture as tedious busywork, and may only be remembered fondly in
               hindsight).</p>
            <p>
               <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> offers the player something more than
               handwriting itself provides, since it turns handwriting into a means of generating
               magical effects. However, the suggestion is that the differences between actual
               handwriting and the <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> interface are
               differences of degree rather than kind. If <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>
               gives the player the magical power to summon objects into existence (or the same
               level of existence enjoyed by the other preexisting objects in the gameworld), then
               this is precisely what handwriting does, according to fantasies of handwriting. In
               such fantasies, handwriting means writing oneself <emph>into the world</emph>. The
               handwritten word or the hand-drawn line is a material object as well as a sign — as
               is whimsically demonstrated in the silent cartoon <title rend="quotes"
                  >Comicalamities</title> (1928), where Otto Messmer draws Felix the Cat in pen, and
               Felix then starts to behave independently and interact with his creator. By writing
               with pen and paper, one creates permanent material traces which are as real as the
               pen and paper. Thus, in <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>, when the player
               writes <q>shovel,</q> a simulated shovel comes into existence and, within the
               diegetic world, has at least as much solidity and permanence as the written word
                  <q>shovel</q> would in the real world. The game suggests that this simulated
               object does not merely replace, but is instead <emph>identical</emph> to, its
               handwritten name. (By toggling an onscreen icon, the player can tap any object to see
               its name. When this is done with a player-created object, the game displays the name
               that was used to create that object, even if it has other possible names.) In <title
                  rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>, to write by hand is literally to create
               objects, and this is presented not as a drastic alteration of the meaning of
               handwriting but as an unleashing of a magical potential that was always already
               present in handwriting. Of course there is a difficulty here, in that the words the
               player actually writes in <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> are far less
               permanent than actual handwriting. When the player writes “shovel,” each letter of
               the word vanishes from the screen once written (the game's handwriting interface
               allows the player to write only one letter at a time), so the handwritten word never
               even exists as a complete entity. However, the creators of <title rend="italic"
                  >Scribblenauts</title> seem to want the player to ignore this difference between
               the game's handwriting and originary handwriting.</p>
            <p>
               <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> further enacts the fantasy of handwriting
               by promising that, through using handwriting to create objects, the player can
               practice the values of personality and creativity that handwriting represents, by
               traversing the game however s/he chooses. The game's slogan, <q>Write Anything. Solve Everything,</q> testifies to this promise of
               unlimited interactional freedom. On the game's title screen, the player can literally
               fulfill the first half of this slogan by writing objects without the risk of dying.
               Of course, the title screen is not actually a game in the strict sense, because games
               employ <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#tanenbaum2009">rules and constraints in order to
                     define and bound the play experience</quote>
                  <ptr target="#tanenbaum2009" loc="3"/>
               </cit>. A successful gameplay experience involves a delicate balance between player
               agency and authorial control, in which the player expresses agency within the
               contours of an authorial framework.<note>When I read the original version of this
                  paper, Professor Maureen Turim asked why the desire for self-expression through
                  handwriting has to be satisfied by games. Games are not a uniquely privileged
                  vehicle for the expression of subjectivity — as are lyric poetry, diary writing or
                  blogging — but some degree of self-expression (or something similar) is necessary
                  to a satisfying gaming experience.</note> This is analogous to how handwriting, as
               fantasized, involves personal improvisation on predefined letterforms. However, the
               gamic (i.e. goal-oriented) portion of <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>
               provides an unusually loose authorial framework, and thus claims to offer the player
               broad opportunities to express the same sort of creative agency that handwriting
               represents. In each of <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>’s 220 levels, the
               player's goal is to obtain a McGuffin object called a <q>Starite,</q> either by
               traversing a series of obstacles to reach the Starite, or by fulfilling a predefined
               condition in order to make the Starite appear. The player can use any object or
               combination of objects in order to solve each level. Because of the vastness of the
               game's lexicon, each level (supposedly) has many possible solutions none of which is
               uniquely correct. Therefore, the achievement of solving a level testifies to the
               player's ability to think creatively, as opposed to merely reconstructing the
               solution the developer had in mind. The game even rewards the player for solving each
               puzzle three times without reusing any words. In playing <title rend="italic"
                  >Scribblenauts</title>, then, the player not only writes objects into existence,
               but does so in a creative, idiosyncratic way, so that the objects the player writes
               are also testaments to the player's faculty for creative thinking and
               improvisation.</p>
            <p>In short, <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> enacts the fantasy of
               handwriting in a highly literal way. The game's massive critical and commercial
               success, despite several widely acknowledged flaws, suggests that this strategy of
               cultivating nostalgia for handwriting appeals to DS consumers.<note>
                  <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> was the best-selling third-party DS
                  game of 2009 in North America, and fifth best overall, and received numerous
                  industry awards <ptr target="#wikipedia2010b"/>. It achieved this level of success
                  despite being hampered by control probems, such as poor camera control and an
                  unrealistic physics model. A sequel, <title rend="italic">Super
                     Scribblenauts</title>, was released the following year.</note> However, the
               trouble with the fantasy of handwriting is that it is a fantasy — an account of what
               we <emph>want</emph> handwriting to be, not of what handwriting actually is. The
               fantasy of handwriting expresses a <emph>desire</emph> to engage in a certain type of
               material interaction, yet this desire is predicated on a lack: we only want
               handwriting because we don't and can't have it. When games or other texts try to
               satisfy the desire for the fantasized version of handwriting, all they can accomplish
               is to show the unsatisfiability of that desire.</p>
            <p>This, at least, is what happens in <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>. This
               game can only fulfill its promise to satisfy the desire for handwriting if it
               actually enables the player to use handwriting as an interface. However, in actual
               game play, the player is discouraged from using the handwriting interface because of
               its inefficiency. <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> offers two different
               interfaces: a handwriting interface in which the player writes one letter at a time,
               and an onscreen keypad. Thus: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#tringali2009">The original design of <title
                        rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> called for writing letters, with the
                     stylus to serve as the main method of word input — we loved the visceral
                     feeling of writing and watching an object appear.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#tringali2009"/>
               </cit> Accordingly, the game's developers, 5th Cell, used the keyboard interface only
               as <q>backup</q> while designing custom handwriting recognition software. However: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#tringali2009">Eventually we realized that no
                     handwriting recognition software could operate faster than a keyboard. We still

            </p>
            <p>Greater speed is the primary affordance of the keyboard interface in <title
                  rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> over the handwriting interface, and indeed, of
               typing over handwriting more generally. Despite the best efforts of pedagogues like
               Austin Norman Palmer, handwriting can't compete with the mechanical efficiency of
               typing. Indeed, this is one major <emph>reason</emph> for the contemporary
               privileging of handwriting. For Arts and Crafts calligraphy revivalists, handwriting
               was valuable because it represented conscious, thoughtful craftsmanship, in contrast
               to the soulless efficiency of the machine <ptr target="#thornton1996" loc="179–181"
               />. This valuation of handwriting as a sign of individual creative labor is closely
               allied to <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>’s ideological project. Yet as a
               fast-paced action game, <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> cannot afford the
               loss of gameplay speed that handwriting entails, and it gives the player no incentive
               to use the handwriting interface rather than the keyboard.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, even if the player uses the handwriting interface, this doesn't entail a
               complete revival of handwriting, because handwriting recognition technology involves
               stripping out the unique and personal aspects of the player's handwriting. According
               to two experts in the field, handwriting recognition is defined as <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#plamondon2000">the task of transforming a language
                     represented in its spatial form of signifying marks into its symbolic

                  <ptr loc="64" target="#plamondon2000"/>
               </cit>. It operates by recording the temporal and spatial parameters of handwritten
               traces, preprocessing them to eliminate noise, and then comparing them to a set of
               predefined letterforms stored in memory. Its purpose is to extract the semantic value
               of a handwritten message, precisely by abstracting out the excessive and
               idiosyncratic qualities that make handwriting an object of nostalgia: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#plamondon2000">[H]andwriting recognition and
                     interpretation are processes whose objectives are to filter out the variations
                     so as to determine the message</quote>

               </cit>. <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>, then, can only preserve the
               idiosyncrasy of the player's handwriting in a figurative sense, if at all, and not in
               a literal sense.</p>
            <p>Finally, writing on the DS touchscreen is an extreme abstraction of writing on paper,
               because the DS's touchscreen records only the two-dimensional shape of a stroke and
               the order and direction in which strokes were made. It ignores, for example, the
               pressure with which the stroke is made, a property which other touchscreen
               technologies try to preserve. (Wacom graphics tablets, for example, come with a
               pressure-sensitive stylus).<note>Some DS models actually do have the capacity for
                  pressure sensitivity, but this capacity has never been exploited in any
                  commercially released game, allegedly because of concerns that not all DS models
                  would be equally pressure-sensitive. It is also rumored that pressure sensitivity
                  was removed from the DSi, the most recent version of the DS console, because of
                  concerns about damage to the screen.</note> Moreover, the touchscreen itself,
               unlike paper, is a purely two-dimensional surface; it has only one side and no
               thickness. Nor does the touchscreen perserve the visible traces of what's written on
               it. When a line is drawn on a touchscreen, it's recorded as stroke data which may be
               permanently stored in memory, yet the line itself soon disappears. The DS may
                  <emph>feel</emph> more like paper than other video game technologies, yet it is
               irreducibly <emph>unlike</emph> paper in terms of how it responds to input. In
               general, the DS does a much more effective job of remediating handwriting than the
               PS2 or the Wii did (in the case of <title rend="italic">Ōkami</title>). Even so, the
               DS's version of handwriting is quite far from the real thing.</p>
            <p>It would obviously be premature to conclude from this that touchscreen technology is
               incapable of replicating the <q>personal</q> or <q>embodied</q> properties of
               handwriting — if this is true, it's only true insofar as those properties are only
               ever incompletely present in handwriting to begin with. We can, however, conclude
               that the DS's handwriting recognition technology is <emph>not intended</emph> to
               preserve the player's subjective traces. The DS's handwriting interface is a
               component, not of a dedicated artistic tool like a Wacom tablet, but of a gaming
               interface. It therefore has to enable <emph>both</emph> player agency, which includes
               creativity, and <emph>efficient</emph> interaction — which often operate at cross
               purposes, as demonstrated when 5th Cell ceased development on the <title
                  rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> handwriting interface. When 5th Cell used the
               DS to present an uncritical version of the fantasy of handwriting, they failed to do
               so with complete success, because they ignored the gap between DS handwriting and
               originary handwriting.</p>
            <p>
               <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>, then, cannot fully satisfy the desire for
               handwriting in a literal sense, nor does it fully succeed in doing so in a figurative
               sense by enabling players to exercise the creative agency that handwriting
               represents. The game often provides insufficient opportunities to exercise creative
               agency. Many of its levels ask the player to repeatedly perform the same tasks, like
               killing enemies, flying, swimming or digging through dirt, and only a few words in
               the lexicon are capable of accomplishing these tasks efficiently. The need to
               repeatedly perform these tasks forces the player to overrely on certain words, which
               limits the player's ability to exercise genuine creativity.<note>This problem was
                  partially fixed in the game's sequel, <title rend="italic">Super
                     Scribblenauts</title> (2010), in which 5th Cell made a genuine effort to
                  provide more creative puzzles. However, <title rend="italic">Super
                     Scribblenauts</title> also infringes on the player's creativity in some ways.
                  For example, some of its puzzles only need to be solved once; i.e. the player is
                  not rewarded for finding three different solutions to these puzzles. One reviewer
                  of <title rend="italic">Super Scribblenauts</title> complained that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#mcshea2010">even though the core mechanics have
                        been refined, the puzzle-themed levels are significantly worse. The carefree
                        freedom from the original has been stripped away, and in the process, the
                        magic has fizzled out</quote>
                     <ptr target="#mcshea2010" loc="¶1"/>
                  </cit>. Moreover, in <title rend="italic">Super Scribblenauts</title> 5th Cell
                  apparently made no attempt to improve the handwriting interface.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This isn't to say that <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> can't trigger
               reflective nostalgia for handwriting on the part of the player — that it can't make
               the player critically evaluate the difference between originary handwriting and the
               version of handwriting it offers. Indeed, <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>
               is likely to produce this effect unintentionally, by forcing the player to observe
               the incomplete success of its remediation of handwriting. However, it appears that
               producing critical reflection on handwriting was not 5th Cell's primary intent in
               creating this game; instead, they sought merely to use the DS interface to satisfy
               the desire for handwriting. By contrast, <title rend="italic">The World Ends with
                  You</title> makes a more sincere effort to encourage critical reflection on
               handwriting, because it makes no claim to fully satisfy the desire for handwriting.
               In examining this game, therefore, we can get a better idea of what a critical,
               digital version of the fantasy of handwriting might look like. </p>

            <p>Developed by SquareEnix and Jupiter, <title rend="italic">The World Ends with
                  You</title> (TWEWY) was released in Japan in 2007 under the title <title
                  rend="italic">
                  <foreign xml:lang="ja">Subarashiki kono sekai</foreign>
               </title> (<title rend="quotes">It's a Wonderful World</title>), and was released in
               America and Europe the following year.<note>
                  <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title>, unlike <title rend="italic"
                     >Scribblenauts</title>, was produced in the Japanese cultural context.
                  Therefore, a full comparison between the two games would have to take into account
                  the differences between Japanese and American views of handwriting, as well as the
                  differences between the Japanese writing system and the Latin alphabet (in
                  Japanese, the distinction between alphanumeric and pictorial signs is not as sharp
                  as in English). A discussion of these issues is outside the scope of the present
                  essay. I will here concentrate on <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> as received
                  by American players.</note> Although it resembles a traditional SquareEnix
               role-playing game (RPG) in many ways,<note>See <ptr target="#barton2008"
                     loc="208–228"/>, for a history of this genre and an explanation of its
                  characteristic features.</note>
               <title rend="italic">The World Ends with You</title> is notable for its highly
               innovative combat system, which requires players to control both the DS's screens at
               the same time. In combat, the player's avatar, Neku, appears on the touch screen.
               Over the course of the game, Neku collects objects called “pins”, most of which give
               Neku magical abilities — called <q>psychs</q> — when equipped in combat. Each psych
               is triggered by performing a specified action with the stylus (except for some which
               are triggered by blowing into the DS's microphone). These actions include touching an
               enemy, slashing an enemy (i.e. drawing a line across it), drawing a circle on the
               screen, picking up and dragging onscreen objects, and rubbing the screen repeatedly.
               Neku’s partner appears on the top screen, and the player uses either the D-pad or the
               action buttons to choose the direction in which the partner attacks. Since the
               buttons on the left-hand side of the DS have the same functions as the buttons on the
               right-hand side, the player uses the non-dominant hand to push buttons while using
               the dominant hand to control the touch screen. (Obviously, controlling two screens at
               once takes some getting used to, but in practice the bottom screen usually requires
               most of the player's attention.)<figure xml:id="figure04">
                  <head>Screenshots from <title rend="quotes">The World Ends with You</title>. The

                     right.</head>

               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>Controlling Neku involves the same physical motions as writing or drawing. To control
               Neku, the player draws straight lines, circles and dots, or drags heavy objects over
               enemies, as if using a pencil eraser. The game seems to ask the player to press
               buttons and write or draw by hand at the same time, thus engaging simultaneously in
               manual and digital means of writing. In short, then, playing <title rend="italic"
                  >TWEWY</title>
               <emph>feels like</emph> handwriting. Yet, for all the reasons cited above, it's not
               handwriting; there is a profound gap between <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title>
               handwriting and originary handwriting. <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> only
               detects whether the player has correctly executed the stylus action corresponding to
               the pins Neku is wearing, and ignores the idiosyncratic aspects of the player's
               handwriting. This becomes obvious, for example, when Neku wears two pins that require
               similar stylus actions, such as <q>touch</q> and <q>tap rapidly.</q> The game has
               trouble distinguishing between these actions because both are represented by the same
               patterns of stroke data.</p>
            <p>Where <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> crucially differs from <title rend="italic"
                  >Scribblenauts</title> is that it acknowledges this gap between DS writing and
               originary handwriting. It doesn't present the touchscreen as an uncritical
               restoration of handwriting. It makes few explicit references to handwriting, except
               that it uses the euphemism <q>erased</q> for <q>killed.</q> Its touchscreen commands
               are not called penstrokes but <q>stylus actions.</q> The similarity between
               handwriting and playing <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> is not foregrounded.
                  <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title>, then, is not constrained by the ideological
               project of producing a replica of fantasized handwriting. Its success or failure as a
               game is not measured by the similarity or dissimilarity of its writing system to the
               fantasized version of handwriting. Instead of trying to literally recreate
               handwriting, SquareEnix was able to simply seek to create a system that offers the
               characteristic pleasure of handwriting: the expression of creative agency through
               embodied interaction. Combat in <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> is not
               handwriting, but it's fun for the same reasons that handwriting is fun. It engages
               the hand (both hands, in fact) and the rest of the body, whereas combat in other
               SquareEnix titles is often a boring process of repetitive button-mashing. It allows
               one to immediately view the results of one's actions, although these results come in
               the form of damage to enemies rather than permanent inscriptions. Moreover, <title
                  rend="italic">TWEWY</title> offers the player genuine freedom of play style, since
               many different pins are available and the player can therefore choose the pins that
               suit his/her personal play style. Unlike <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title>,
                  <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> doesn't claim that this freedom is unlimited or
               that the player can <q>draw anything.</q> Rather than trying to uncritically satisfy
               the desire for handwriting — a project which is impossible because this desire is
               based on a constitutive lack — <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> uses digital
               processes to evoke the memory of handwriting. It is therefore able to open up a space
               for critical reflection on what handwriting meant and on how our memory of
               handwriting might inform our engagement with the post-digital world. This is in
               keeping with Boym's definition of reflective as opposed to restorative nostalgia: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#boym2002">Restorative nostalgia puts emphasis on
                        <emph>nostos</emph> and proposes to rebuild the lost home and patch up the
                     memory gaps. Reflective nostalgia dwells in <emph>algia</emph>, in longing and
                     loss, the imperfect process of remembrance</quote>
                  <ptr loc="41" target="#boym2002"/>
               </cit>. Rather than simply trying to revive handwriting (and inevitably failing),
                  <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> invites the player to notice the gaps between
               its interface and handwriting, and to reflect on what these gaps might mean.</p>
            <p>
               <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> further encourages such reflection by means of its
               story, which, as with most SquareEnix games, is heavily foregrounded. The <title
                  rend="italic">TWEWY</title> player uses the handwriting interface not only for its
               own sake, but also as means of progressing through a story in which the values
               associated with handwriting — creativity and individuality — play crucial roles. (By
               contrast, <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> effectively has no story; the
               game never explains who Maxwell is, why he is able to write objects into existence,
               or what his motivation is for collecting Starites.)<note>Some games studies scholars
                  characterize story as merely a cosmetic adjunct to the gamic experience; for
                  example, Markku Eskelinen holds that <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#eskelinen2001">stories are just uninteresting
                        ornaments or gift-wrappings to games, and laying any emphasis on studying
                        these kinds of marketing tools is just a waste of time and energy</quote>
                     <ptr target="#eskelinen2001" loc="§8"/>
                  </cit>. Following Tanenbaum and Tanenbaum, however, I suggest that one of the
                  characteristic pleasures of games, especially those in the JRPG genre, is that of
                  engaging participatorily with authored content <ptr target="#tanenbaum2009"
                     loc="9"/>. Story offers the player a motive for playing the game and a reward
                  for doing so successfully.</note>
               <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title>’s story argues that creativity and idiosyncrasy
               are of vital importance, but are not simply there for the taking; these values must
               be obtained and defended through active effort. Moreover, these values are not
               absolute. Taken to an extreme, the desire to assert and express the embodied self
               leads merely to narcissism, to a neglect of the socially situated nature of the self.
               In order to make productive use of the qualities that handwriting stands for, the
               writer must realize that handwriting is useless in a vacuum; it only works because of
               a constitutive gap between the self and the other. Handwriting requires a reader.</p>
            <p>The game's setting — Shibuya, the fashion capital of Japan — is portrayed as a space
               where many subcultures interact, each characterized by particular fashion and
               lifestyle choices. Shibuya is a space where Neku and his allies are free to define
               their own styles, to express their personalities visibly. Accordingly, creativity is
               the guiding principle of the game's protagonists. Neku's role model is a graphic
               designer named CAT, precisely because of CAT's philosophy of exuberant individuality
               and freedom (CAT's motto is <q>Do what you want, how
                  you want, when you want it</q>). Neku's first partner, Shiki, is an aspiring
               fashion designer.</p>
            <p>Conversely, the goal of the game's villains is to eliminate creativity and
               individuality, which they see as security risks. Mr. Kitaniji, one of the game’s
               principal villains, calls Shibuya <q>a cacophony of
                  countless selfish wants</q> and claims, <q>As
                  that noise swells, it turns into crime, warfare... All the world’s ills can be
                  traced to individuality!</q> For example, in one episode the villains open a
               new noodle restaurant and pay a popular blogger, the Prince, to recommend it to his
               readers. The Prince's fans obediently flock to Shadow Ramen, not because they like
               the food but because their arbiter of taste tells them to. As collateral damage,
               Shadow Ramen threatens the existing local ramen restaurant, whose owner, Ken Doi, is
               guided by his own honest creative compulsions. His motto is <q>I just serve up the kind of ramen I’d want to eat.</q> Faced with
               the threat of bankruptcy, however, Ken Doi abandons this philosophy and starts
               looking for the <q>next big thing</q> in ramen.
               Thanks to Neku and his partner's intervention, however, the Prince becomes ashamed of
               lying to his readers and of recommending food he dislikes. He retracts his positive
               review of Shadow Ramen, saving Ken Doi's restaurant. A small battle in the war for
               creativity has been won. Thus, at the same time that the game stresses the value of
               creativity and individuality, it stresses that these values are constantly threatened
               by conformity. Creativity exists in a constant dialectic with conformism — indeed,
               perhaps it can't exist otherwise, since these concepts are defined by their mutual
               opposition — and the preservation of creativity is therefore never an uncomplicated
               task. </p>
            <p>This is fortunate, because handwriting is a means of intersubjective communication as
               well as creative expression. Rather than uncritically praising creativity as <title
                  rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> does, <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title>
               suggests that when individuality is taken too far, it leads to solipsism. Creativity
               and individuality function only within a larger value hierarchy which includes
               respect for others. Neku's problem is that he focuses exclusively on self-expression,
               and therefore has little concern for other people; hence the game's pessimistic
               title. Over the course of the game he learns to collaborate productively with his
               partners — something which the player is forced to also learn by mastering the game's
               battle system, which requires simultaneous control of Neku and his partner — and in
               the ending the title is replaced by the phrase <q>The
                  World Begins with You.</q>
               <title rend="italic">TWEWY</title> presents creativity not as an absolute value, but
               as a function of the democratic interaction of multiple conflicting subjectivities.
               The game demonstrates this perfectly with its mechanic of branding. The game includes
               13 brands of clothing and pins, and each area in the game has a list of popular and
               unpopular brands. Pins receive a power boost if they belong to a most popular brand,
               and a penalty if they belong to an unpopular one. Thus, the player has an incentive
               to be a slave to fashion. However, if the player fights several battles in an area
               while wearing pins and clothing of a certain brand, then that brand will become more
               popular and its corresponding pins will become more powerful. Thus the player also
               has an incentive to be a trendsetter and is not discouraged from dressing the
               characters according to his or her wishes; however, the player is also encouraged to
               work at sharing his or her stylistic preferences with others. Much like handwriting,
               fashion is of little use unless someone else can understand it.</p>
            <p>Both these modes of expressing creativity are based on a constitutive gap between the
               creative self and another self toward whom that creativity is expressed. The DS's
               remediation of handwriting is necessarily incomplete, failing to permit the player to
               perfectly express his or her self (because, for example, the DS's handwriting
               interface works by stripping out the idiosyncratic qualities of the player's
               handwriting). But this is only a literal example of the way in which handwriting
               itself is also necessarily incomplete. As Derrida remarks, handwriting works not
               because of the presence but because of the constitutive <emph>absence</emph> of the
               self; handwriting serves little purpose when the writer is actually present.
               Signatures, for example, only work because they're iterable: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#derrida1982">The condition of possibility for these
                     effects [of signature] is simultaneously, once again, the condition of their
                     impossibility, of the impossibility of their rigorous purity. In order to
                     function, that is, in order to be legible, a signature must have a repeatable,
                     iterable, imitable form; it must be able to detach itself from the present and
                     singular intention of its production.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#derrida1982" loc="328"/>
               </cit> If DS handwriting <q>detaches itself</q>
               from the embodied self that produces it, then it merely functions in the same way
               that paper handwriting always has.</p>
            <p>In encouraging the player to confront the incompleteness of handwriting, then, <title
                  rend="italic">The World Ends with You</title> opens up a space for critical
               reflection on handwriting and on the concept of the self that handwriting
               presupposes. It invites the player to ask whether handwriting ever really worked the
               way it was supposed to, or whether the embodied self of handwriting ever existed to
               begin with. <title rend="italic">The World Ends with You</title> therefore goes
               beyond <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> by using the unique properties of
               the DS to present a reflective, critical version of the fantasy of handwriting.</p>

            <head>Discussion</head>
            <p>Nostalgia for older media is a common theme in contemporary critical and popular
               discourses, and the insights gained by observing the DS's remediation of handwriting
               can prompt more general reflections on the motivations behind such nostalgia. In what
               Bill Brown calls the <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#brown2010">dematerialization hypothesis</quote>
                  <ptr loc="51" target="#brown2010"/>
               </cit>, digital media are often seen as severing the physical connections that
               formerly existed between human bodies and technological tools. As an example of this
               hypothesis, Brown quotes Colin Renfrew: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#brown2010">Because <q>the electronic impulse is replacing whatever remained of the material
                        element in the images to which we became accustomed,</q> the <q>engagement with the material world where the
                        material object was the repository of meaning is being threatened</q>
                  </quote>
                  <ptr target="#brown2010" loc="51"/>
               </cit>. What the dematerialization hypothesis often assumes, however, is that there
                  <emph>was</emph> a previously existing condition of <q>engagement with the material world,</q> and that when this
               condition existed, its beneficial effects were understood and cherished. As seen in
               the above discussion of Birkerts, these assumptions are questionable. Even if a given
               medium (e.g., photography or handwriting) ever was fully <q>material,</q> it may not
               have been understood as such until it was challenged by a less <q>material</q>
               medium. Therefore, nostalgic appeals to the superior materiality of older media may
               be unconsciously based on a revisionary understanding of these media. Nostalgia, in
               such cases, merely expresses a desire to return to a lost home, forgetting that this
               home never existed to begin with. <title rend="italic">Scribblenauts</title> is a
               clear example of this pattern.</p>
            <p>Nostalgia for media such as handwriting becomes productive and generative, however,
               when it serves as an occasion for critical reflection on the meaning of the old
               media. Instead of simply claiming to restore us to a lost condition of full
               materiality, this mode of nostalgia asks us to consider: Did we care about this
               condition of materiality when we had it? If so, why — what sort of values did we
               attach to it? Now that we've lost this condition of materiality, why do we desire it
               — what sort of lack does this desire respond to? And would we truly benefit if this
               desire were satisfied? <title rend="italic">The World Ends with You</title>
               effectively mobilizes nostalgia to prompt this sort of questioning. At its best,
               then, the fantasy of handwriting doesn't simply claim to uncritically restore to us
               the lost power of handwriting; instead, it makes us ask ourselves <emph>why</emph> we
               want to write ourselves into the world.</p>
