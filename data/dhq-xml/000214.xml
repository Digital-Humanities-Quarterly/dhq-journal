            <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
            <p>Academic writing has generally been understood as operating primarily within the
               linguistic modality, with writing remediating the <q>voice</q> of an educator or
               lecturer. Comics, by contrast, are more explicitly multimodal and derive much of
               their meaning from visual, spatial and linguistic modalities. Because of their
               multimodality, educational comics challenge the conception of an authoritative
               author’s <q>voice,</q> as is typically found in traditional educational and academic
               writing.</p>
            <p>To examine how authorship and authority function in multimodal educational texts,
               this paper examines several books in the popular <q>For Beginners</q> and
                  <q>Introducing</q> series of <q>graphic guides,</q> which use images, text, and
               comics to summarise the work of major philosophers – in this case Derrida and
               Foucault. The books chosen for this study are all collaborative efforts between
               writers, illustrators, and designers. In each book, the collaborations function
               differently, engendering different divisions of authorial labor and forging different
               constructions of multimodal relationships between image, text, and design. </p>
            <p>In order to more fully interrogate the ways that these educational comics combine
               multimodal modes of meaning, this paper itself takes the form of a comic, mimicking
               at times the books that it is examining. In this way, it serves as a self-reflexive
               critique of the idea that authorial voice is central to academic writing, and as an
               example of the challenges and opportunities presented by composing multimodal
               scholarship which eschews this conception of linguistic authorship. </p>

            <!-- start slipsum code -->


            <p>Within the humanities, a lot of discourse traditionally has taken the form of writing
               that discusses other pieces of writing, even when the object of study is something
               that can’t be easily expressed in prose writing, like a comic book or a computer
               program. One of the many things scholars in the digital humanities have attempted to
               do is to expand the discipline’s acceptable research outputs to include things like
               pieces of code, web applications and other forms of digital discourse which can work
               in ways that prose cannot.</p>
            <p>Although this paper only marginally engages with conversations around digital
               technologies, it is similarly concerned with pushing at the boundaries of what
               published research can be, and how it can work. To discuss the subjects of the paper,
               two pairs of comic books about Foucault and Derrida, I adopted the form and register
               of those subjects. This is a comic that analyses other comics, using the tools and
               techniques of comics. </p>
            <p>On a broader level, though, it’s about how all discourse uses multiple modalities.
               There are arguments in this paper which are composed mostly through visual and
               spatial modalities, but I would argue that all printed texts do this, even (or
               especially) when we have come to accept their multimodal forms as essentially
               invisible, as we tend to do with most academic writing. </p>
            <p>One of my goals with this paper was to denaturalise the visual and spatial forms that
               research papers usually take. I wrote the text by hand, and composed the pages as
               integrated units which cannot easily be pulled apart or rearranged without losing
               some of their meanings. <q>Writing</q> in this way was a challenge. It took more time
               and physical effort to write and edit each sentence using a pen and paper than it
               would have using a word processor. I am used to editing my writing by <q>talking</q>
               through it – reading it out loud in my head to check for flow and coherency — but
               this paper’s visual qualities and modular construction required a different approach.
               Each page had to work on its own, while having a reasonably clear function within the
               larger paper.</p>
            <p>The process of composing this paper was iterative and multimodal. I wrote a
               10,000-word thesis chapter on the books about Foucault and Derrida, and discussed
               them as part of a seminar presentation before starting on the comic version of the
               paper, so I was familiar with different ways of presenting the material. The comics
               form allowed me to show visual <q>quotes</q> from the comics that I could engage with
               directly, which cut down the number of words I had to use dramatically. I was able to
               ask questions verbally and answer them visually, or vice versa.</p>
            <p>Composing and editing the paper was largely done by sketching up drafts of pages, and
               gradually revising the writing, drawings, and layout of each page, often
               simultaneously. To integrate pages from the books with my sketches, I would scan both
               into my computer and quickly assemble them onto a page in Microsoft Paint, an
               infamously straightforward drawing program which suited my purposes. Each page was
               then printed out and slid underneath a piece of tracing paper to allow me to draw a
               new version based on the mock-up. My final inked-in pieces of tracing paper were then
               scanned back into the computer and the images of the books were pasted onto them with
               Paint. I also took the opportunity to do small fixes and clean-ups using the
               software. This system was very iterative and more time-consuming than I would have
               liked, as it involved a lot of scanning and going back and forth between computer and
               paper. </p>
            <p>Using the style of the books that I was examining helped to reveal aspects of those
               books that I would not have otherwise noticed, and gave me a different perspective on
               other aspects of the material as well. For example, while drawing caricatures of the
               people I was quoting, I was confronted with questions about the shapes and ages of
               their bodies, things that I would not have considered if I didn’t have to draw them.
               I had to ask whether it mattered if I depicted my sources as they looked when their
               words were first published, or as they looked when my paper was published. It was
               only when I noticed that I was drawing a lot of facial hair and receding hairlines
               that I realised how few women appear in this paper.</p>
            <p>The other major benefit of using the comics form was that it allowed me to argue more
               directly for the validity of comics as a form of scholarship, and to ask readers to
               reflect on the <q>invisible</q> multimodal properties of academic publishing. This
               was, in a sense, putting my money where my mouth was.</p>
            <p>Digital, networked technologies are enabling scholarship in the humanities to take on
               increasingly complex multimodal forms, but educational comics make it clear that
               multimodal scholarship itself is not a new phenomenon. Looking at earlier forms like
               this can help us to reconsider the histories and traditions of academic writing in
               the humanities, and suggest ways of approaching the creation of multimodal texts
               outside the context of networked computer ecologies.</p>

               for initiating and guiding this collection of comics as scholarship.</p>
            <p>The field of cartoonist-scholars is small, but growing. I am encouraged by the recent
               and ongoing work being done by Muna Al-Jawad, Marek Bennett, Jared Rosello, Nick
               Sousanis and other cartoonists who are using comics to reflect on the processes of
               learning and thinking.</p>

            <p>The comics of Scott McCloud, Lynda Barry and Kevin Huizenga are showcases of
