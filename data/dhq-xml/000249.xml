                <p>At the meeting of the Digital Classics Association in April of 2013, I described
                    my work-in-progress on a digital tutorial for Ancient Greek. My goal is to
                    create a self-guided computer tutorial that people can use to learn Ancient
                    Greek on their own in the the same way that those studying a modern language can
                    use programs such as <ref target="http://www.rosettastone.com/">Rosetta
                        Stone</ref>, <ref target="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</ref>, <ref

                        target="http://mangolanguages.com/">Mango Languages</ref>, etc. This article
                    briefly details the work that has been completed since 2013, describes some of
                    the ways that the tutorial has been successful, and explores challenges that
                    remain to be addressed for the tutorial. </p>

                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p>At the meeting of the Digital Classics Association in April of 2013, I described
                    my work-in-progress on a digital tutorial for ancient Greek. This tutorial is
                    built around a late nineteenth-century textbook — John Williams White's <title
                        rend="italic">First Greek Book</title> — and it provides a complete
                    introductory curriculum for Ancient Greek. It is available online for free to
                    any interested user at <ref target="http://daedalus.umkc.edu/FirstGreekBook"
                        >http://daedalus.umkc.edu/FirstGreekBook</ref>. I also use the tutorial in
                    conjunction with the Blackboard Learning Management System for my Ancient Greek
                    courses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. </p>
                <p>At the time that I first presented this work, the tutorial was 50%-60% complete,
                    and the first cohort of UMKC students was completing a three-semester sequence
                    of Ancient Greek with the tutorial as their primary textbook. This article
                    describes the current state of the tutorial, explores some of the ways that the
                    tutorial has been successful, and discusses challenges that remain to be
                    addressed for the tutorial. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>THE CURRENT STATE OF THE TUTORIAL</head>
                <p>In its current form, the tutorial consists of eighty static HTML pages that
                    contain drill and practice exercises for the vocabulary, grammar, and
                    translation activities in each chapter. Users track their progress through the
                    tutorial by earning virtual <soCalled>drachmas</soCalled> for completing the
                    drill and practice exercises. These drachmas fade over time, helping users track
                    when they should review the material that they have previously studied.<note> A
                        full description of the tutorial can be found in <ptr
                            target="#rydberg-cox2013"/>.</note></p>
                <p>Because the tutorial is freely available online, it has reached a much broader
                    audience than I ever would have obtained with a traditional textbook. In 2014,
                    15,178 unique individuals used just over 58,000 pages in the tutorial. In 2015,
                    the audience grew to 25,810 users who viewed just over 77,000 pages. My recent
                    study of the usage patterns in the tutorial from 2014 identified four types of
                    users for the tutorial: a large number of casual browsers who view the first
                    pages of the tutorial and decide not to use it further, a substantial portion of
                    users who begin the tutorial and trail off someplace around chapter 15, a small
                    group who completes about half of the tutorial, and an even smaller collection
                    of users who complete the entire program.<note> See <ptr
                            target="#rydberg-cox2016"/>.</note>
                </p>
                <p>The tutorial is licensed under the Creative Commons
                    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License that allows
                    anyone to download and repurpose any of the material in the tutorial. All of the
                    vocabulary and grammatical paradigms are available for download as tab-delimited
                    Unicode text files so that students and colleagues can incorporate the material
                    into their own learning management systems or use the material as the basis for
                    new digital pedagogical tools.</p>
                <p>The creation of the tutorial has also allowed me to generate a more sustainable
                    model for ancient language instruction that helps interested students pursue the
                    study of Ancient Greek. Prior to the introduction of the tutorial, I taught our
                    three-semester introductory Greek course sequentially. This meant that students
                    could only start taking Greek once every three semesters and those who wanted to
                    continue had no opportunity to step away from their studies for a semester. The
                    digital tutorial allows us to offer all three Greek courses in parallel online
                    every semester so that students can begin at any time during their academic
                    career and take a semester off if necessary. This structure has raised our
                    overall student headcount in Greek courses and allowed us to provide a more
                    flexible way to meet the needs of students in our program who want to study
                    Greek. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>LOOKING FORWARD</head>
                <p>As the tutorial enters its third year, user feedback, student comments, and usage
                    patterns suggest several areas that will be productive for continued work in the
                    future: creating more robust introductory material that introduces students to
                    the fundamentals of Greek and English grammar, building exercises that help
                    illustrate the connections between ancient Greek and contemporary English, and —
                    most importantly — adding audio recordings for the vocabulary and translation
                    exercises.</p>
                <p>Because the Greek tutorial is based on a textbook that was originally published
                    in the late nineteenth century, the source material begins with the assumption
                    that students have had some exposure to Latin and have a basic understanding of
                    case grammar. When I reimagined White’s textbook as a digital tutorial, I added
                    some additional material to more fully explain case grammar, but no formal
                    exercises beyond those already in the book. Students with limited formal
                    training in English grammar sometimes struggle connecting Greek forms like the
                    dative case with ideas such as the English indirect object. Several recent print
                    books have addressed this need to explain ancient grammatical structures in the
                    context of contemporary English grammar for students of both Classical and
                    Biblical Greek, but there are few supplementary grammatical materials openly
                    available online.<note> See <ptr target="#mondi2013"/> and <ptr
                            target="#mounce2013"/>.</note> I would like to create an open-access
                    series of exercises for my students to take either before they begin the
                    tutorial or as supplementary material in case they find themselves struggling
                    once they begin the work.</p>
                <p>In addition to the need to connect ancient and contemporary grammatical
                    structures, students and other tutorial users have also expressed an interest in
                    material that will help them gain a broader understanding of the connections
                    between Ancient Greek and contemporary English vocabulary. There are several
                    excellent textbooks that accomplish this in print, particularly for medical
                        terminology.<note> See <ptr target="#green2014"/>; <ptr
                            target="#mckeown2016"/>; and <ptr target="#dunmore2004"/>.</note> Most
                    Greek textbooks including White’s mention the relationship between Greek and
                    English vocabulary, but these etymological notes are generally presented as a
                    separate element or in footnotes. I would like to create exercises in the
                    tutorial that integrate English vocabulary more closely with Ancient Greek
                    vocabulary. </p>
                <p>Finally, the tutorial needs to include audio material. Since students and
                    tutorial users are working on their own, they repeatedly express frustration
                    with the lack of guidance for the pronunciation of words and phrases that they
                    would get from an instructor in a face-to-face classroom. I point these students
                    to existing resources such as the pronunciation guide and audio recordings
                    associated with Donald Mastronarde’s <title rend="italic">Introduction to Attic
                        Greek</title>, the excellent audio CD associated with the Joint Association
                    of Classics Teacher’s <title rend="italic">Reading Greek</title> series, and the
                    recordings hosted by the Society for the Oral Reading of Greek and Latin.<note>
                        See <ptr target="#jact2007"/>; <ptr target="#jact2008"/>; and <ptr
                            target="#mastronarde2013"/>. See also the recordings provided by the
                        Society for the Oral Reading of Greek and Latin at <ref
                            target="http://www.rhapsodes.fll.vt.edu"
                            >http://www.rhapsodes.fll.vt.edu</ref></note> Ideally, the tutorial
                    itself would contain audio resources with readings of every vocabulary word and
                    sentence that is available for translation. Usage data suggests that this work,
                    at least in an initial stage, would be most profitably focused on comprehensive
                    coverage of the first fifteen chapters with recordings for the later chapters
                    coming later. </p>
                <p>These audio recordings are my current top priority for future work on the
                    tutorial. My hope is that I can work with students at UMKC to create an <title
                        rend="quotes">Ancient Languages Workshop</title> on the model of the
                    Manuscripts, Inscriptions, and Documents Club at the College of the Holy Cross
                    that allows undergraduate students to engage in research for the Homer Multitext
                        project<note> See <ref
                            target="http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/surs/2014/08/01/homer-multitext-project/"
                            >http://wp.chs.harvard.edu/surs/2014/08/01/homer-multitext-project/</ref></note>
                    or the Linothorax Project undergraduate research at the University of Wisconsin
                    at Green Bay that is attempting to reconstruct a type of ancient Greek armor.<note>
                        <ref target="https://www.uwgb.edu/aldreteg/Linothorax.html"
                            >https://www.uwgb.edu/aldreteg/Linothorax.html</ref></note>
                </p>
                <p>In this model, work would be distributed among cohorts of undergraduates who
                    could record the vocabulary and translation exercises, format the recordings for
                    long-term preservation in the sound archive at UMKC, and encode the audio links
                    into the tutorial. Augmenting the existing tutorial with a comprehensive set of
                    audio recordings of every sentence and vocabulary word would result in a sound
                    library containing approximately 1,000 individually spoken words and some 1,600
                    spoken sentences of Ancient Greek. This audio library would bring the tutorial
                    closer to parity with resources such as Duolingo, Babbel, Mango Languages, etc.
                    that are available for independent learners of modern languages. It would
                    hopefully also take advantage of the accessibility provided by open-access
                    publication to further expand the number of people who are able to independently
                    study Greek with this tutorial. </p>
