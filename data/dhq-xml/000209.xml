      <body>
         <p>As I began to work on my book, <title rend="italic">Misogynoir: Black Queer and Trans
               Women Redefining Representations as Health Praxis,</title> I prioritized
            transparency. I used <ref target="http://moyabailey.com/2014/10/21/im-back/">my own
               blog</ref> and the <ref
               target="http://www.northeastern.edu/nulab/writing-about-writing-and-research-a-dh-feminist-account-of-working-on-my-first-academic-book-project/"
               >Digital Humanities blog</ref> at Northeastern University to provide readers with
            insights into the academic publishing process and my efforts to shape this process into
            a more just experience for my research collaborators <ptr target="#imback2014"/>. My
            research highlights the networks contemporary Black trans women create through the
            production of digital media and in this article I make the emotional and uncompensated
            labor of this community visible. I provide an added level of insight into my research
            process as a way to mirror the access I was granted by these collaborators. I use
            Digital Humanist Mark Sample’s concept of <emph>collaborative construction</emph> to
            demonstrate my own efforts to enact a transformative feminist process of writing and
            researching in the Digital Humanities (DH) while highlighting the ways in which the
            communities I follow are doing the same in their spheres of influence. </p>
         <p>The networks built through digital media production are significant attempts to redress
            the lack of care that Black trans women receive from the health care community and
            society. I argue that these processes of digital media production produce more than just
            redefined representations but also connections that can be understood as a form of
            health care praxis themselves. To reach these conclusions I have charted a new
            methodology that incorporates theoretical perspectives from Black queer theory, digital
            humanities, and feminist theory and transforms my relationship to the people producing
            these digital representations.</p>
         <p>Media and cultural studies scholars have long understood the epistemological and
            pedagogical significance of popular media <ptr target="#hall1993"/>; <ptr
               target="#jones2003"/>; <ptr target="#jenks1995"/>; <ptr target="#sperling2011"/>;
               <ptr target="#macdonald1995"/>. Similarly, marginalized groups have often used media
            production to challenge dominant scripts within mainstream outlets, and the rise of
            digital platforms makes this task even easier. Black trans women’s use of Twitter, an
            existing digital media platform, creates new and alternate representations as a practice
            of health promotion, self-care, and wellness that challenge the ways they are depicted
            in popular culture. I focus on a digital project by Black trans women that involves the
            collaborative creation of images, links, and other digital media that trouble
            problematic representations through a curation process that also works to enrich the
            lives of those participating. I look at trans advocate Janet Mock’s twitter hashtag
            #girlslikeus and discuss the many issues of trans women’s collective survival signaled
            via the tweets marked by the tag. </p>
         <p>I focus on Mock’s use of the hashtag because I sought and achieved her permission to
            work on the project. I parse my process for achieving informed consent and how it
            differs from the paternalism of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) process. I
            acknowledge the negotiated terms under which this project is discussed to signal my own
            queer feminist praxis in conducting this research. I build towards an understanding of
            what I call <emph>digital alchemy</emph> as health praxis designed to create better
            representations for those most marginalized in the Western biomedical industrial complex
            through the implementation of networks of care beyond its boundaries.</p>
         <p>Alchemy is the <soCalled>science</soCalled> of turning regular metals into gold. When I
            discuss <emph>digital alchemy</emph> I am thinking of the ways that women of color,
            Black women in particular, transform everyday digital media into valuable social justice
            media magic that recodes failed dominant scripts. Digital alchemy shifts our collective
            attention from biomedical interventions to the redefinition of representations that
            provide another way of viewing Black queer and trans women. I argue that this process of
            redefining representation challenges the normative standards of bodily representation
            and health presented in popular and medical culture. </p>
         <div>
            <head>Connection through #girlslikeus </head>
            <p>Black trans women negotiate unique threats to life and health as those multiply
               marginalized by gender, race, sexuality, and the disproportionate amounts of violence
               their communities face. On December 5, 2014, Deshawnda Sanchez, a Los Angeles area
               Black trans woman, was killed while trying to escape her murderer. Her death was one
               of 225 murders of trans women in 2014. The LGBTQ magazine <title rend="italic">The
                  Advocate</title> reported that in 2015, one trans woman has been murdered every
               week and the majority of these deaths are of women of color <ptr target="#miami2015"
               />. These statistics do not reflect the frequent harassment, abuse, and harm that
               trans women of color survive. The deadly violence that Black trans women negotiate is
               often perpetrated by intimate partners, many of whom when asked claim they were
                  <soCalled>duped</soCalled> or <soCalled>tricked</soCalled> by their partners, and
               then justifiably enraged to the point of murder <ptr target="#gay2015"/>. The popular
               media trope of trans identity as a form of deception is iconized in the 1992 film <hi
                  rend="italic">The Crying Game</hi>, a film that shows a man vomit when he realizes
               that Dil, the Black woman he loves, is trans. Laverne Cox, a Black trans woman
               portraying a trans woman on the Netflix original series <title rend="italic">Orange
                  is the New Black,</title> notwithstanding, the generally portrayal of trans women
               and trans women of color in popular culture is one of hypersexual tricksters who
               deserve to be victimized for deceiving cis men <ptr target="#mattkane2012"/>. It is
               again in the area of representation, in visual assessment, that trans women of color
               are judged and then responsible for the resulting violence it elicits from the people
               closest to them <ptr target="#lee2014"/>; <ptr target="#lee2008"/>; <ptr
                  target="#steinberg2005"/>.</p>
            <p>These acts of violence also coincide with increasing visibility and advocacy by trans
               women of color, particularly through digital media outlets and in online media. In
               2012, Mock was moved to become a more outspoken trans activist because of the rise in
               the number of murders and suicides of queer and trans youth. She has used her
               platform as a former web editor for <title rend="italic">Marie Claire</title> as well
               as digital tools like videos and hashtags to reach out to other trans women in
               society. In explaining the origin of her hashtag #girlslikeus, Mock describes her
               support of Jenna Talackova, a contestant disqualified for the Miss Universe Pageant
               for in the words of the pageant officiates, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                  source="#missuniverse2014">not being a natural born female</quote>
               <ptr target="#missuniverse2014"/></cit>. Mock’s desire to help Talackova achieve her dream
               lead to the creation of the hashtag. On her personal blog Mock wrote, <quote
                  rend="block"
                  source="https://twitter.com/search/%23girlslikeus http://t.co/pNzOmhow https://twitter.com/janetmock/statuses/184606253136347136 #whyistarted2014"
                  >So I shared Jenna’s petition on Twitter, and said: Please sign &amp; share this
                  women's rights petition in support of transgender beauty queen Jenna Talackova
                  &amp; <ref target="https://twitter.com/search/%23girlslikeus">#girlslikeus</ref>:
                     <ref target="http://t.co/pNzOmhow">ow.ly/9TYc6</ref>
                  <ref target="https://twitter.com/janetmock/statuses/184606253136347136">27 Mar
                     12</ref> And that was the online birth of #girlslikeus. I didn’t think it over,
                  it wasn’t a major push, but #girlslikeus felt right. Remarkably a few more women —
                  some well-known, others not — shared the petition and began sharing their stories
                  of being deemed un-real, being called out, working it, fighting for what’s right,
                  wanting to transition, dreaming to do this, accomplishing that... #girlslikeus
                  soon grew beyond me... my dream came true: #girlslikeus was used on its own
                  without my @janetmock handle in it. It had a life of its own <ptr
                     target="#whyistarted2014"/>. </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Other trans women have embraced the tag, including Laverne Cox; they use it to
               discuss everything from the desire to transition and the violence of being outed in
               unsafe situations as well as the banality of everyday living and dreams of job
               success. </p>
            <p>Computational Scientist Alan Mislove created a database that collects a random ten
               percent of all tweets tweeted since Twitter began. As scholars in sociology and DH
               have noted, a ten percent sample of such a large database can provide statically
               significant information about the representative population <ptr
                  target="#mislove2011"/>; <ptr target="#gerlitz2013"/>; <ptr
                  target="#twitterusage2015"/>; <ptr target="#bruns2013"/>. I examined all
               publically accessible tweets using #girlslikeus between Mock’s first uses in March
               2012 until October 2014. With the help of computer science graduate student Devin
               Gaffney, we created a script that gathered all instances of the hashtag within this
               database. With over 11,000 tweets stored that used the hashtag I could begin to
               assess significance. I used Voyant, a web-based textual analysis tool that can
               generate word visualizations and measure the frequency and occurrence of words in a
               corpus, to mine the texts of the collected tweets. The most popular hashtags used
               with the hashtag #girlslikeus were other words of identity affirmation, including
               #trans and #transgender, #twoc (trans women of color). </p>
            <figure xml:id="figure01">
               <head>Voyant Screen capture of the instance of the hashtags #trans, #transgender, and
                  #twoc.</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>These hashtags fluctuated in use over this two year period, with #transgender having
               fallen below its initial prevalence and #twoc significantly increasing.</p>
            <p>Words related to representation were very popular, ultimately marking the content of
               nearly every tenth tweet. Variations of the words <emph>picture</emph>,
                  <emph>selfie,</emph> as well as types of media and news outlets drove this
               significance, often pointing to pictures and links that affirmed trans women in ways
               that counter their portrayal in mainstream media. News outlets might provide a mug
               shot, or a picture of a trans woman offered by a family member that illustrates her
               appearance at an earlier point of transition. By being able to control their own
               images, trans women are able to subvert societal impulses to lock them into
               representation that recalls their assigned sex at birth. These acts of digital
               alchemy affirm the twitter user and the network built via the hashtag.</p>
            <p>For example, Janet Mock in May of 2013 attended the celebration of Laverne Cox’s Time
               magazine cover, captioning their photo together, <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#laverne2015">Celebrating Laverne Cox’s time cover tonight in NYC.
                  Sisterhood in action! #girlslikeus <ptr target="#laverne2015"/>.</quote></p>

               <head>Janet Mock Tweet</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Though celebrating a friend’s appearance on the cover of Time magazine is not
               something that we can necessarily relate to, celebrating friends and their success
               through posting a picture on Twitter is very common. I won’t provide visual referents
               of the types of images that these daily life photos subvert, but think about the
               trauma and violence that befalls Dil in <title rend="italic">The Crying Game</title>
               or the way trans women are often made to account for their genitalia in popular
               culture by journalists in order to be invited guests <ptr target="#laverne2015"/>.
               Tweets like this one, which show the daily and collective joys that trans women
               experience, challenge the proliferation of media representations that focus solely on
               their anatomy and victimization. Despite this tendency to over represent trans women
               in a salacious way, mainstream media continues to under report and misgender
               transwomen in the news <ptr target="#michaelson2012"/>.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Transforming Methodology Through Collaborative Consent</head>
            <p>Given the frequent attacks on trans women, particularly trans women of color, I
               wanted to be sure that my scholarly inquiries about the hashtag were welcome and did
               not bring undue negative attention to the community. I reached out to Mock via
               Twitter to see if she was interested in my researching the tag. I told her I was
               interested in how it has been used and what sorts of actions have developed through
               its use. She said she would be excited for me to work on the project. I also asked
               her what sort of information would be most useful to her to know about the hashtag.
               She was specifically interested in the most popular retweets and users along with
               gathering a sense of where the hashtag has shown up in mainstream media. </p>
            <p>Though Mock welcomed my research on the hashtag, I wanted to give her the opportunity
               to say no to the project. My own interest was not enough justification for pursuing
               this type of potentially risky research that could expose an already vulnerable
               community to more vitriol and negative visibility. Trans women of color are not
               understood as one of the vulnerable communities identified by the Institutional
               Review Board that assesses the potential harms of academic research on those
               researched. The IRB recognizes prisoners, people with diminished capacity, women,
               particularly in their capacity as potential child bearers, and minors themselves as
               populations that could be unduly harmed by human subjects research. Trans women of
               color are represented within these populations yet are not recognized as their own
               contingent in need of more nuanced ethical study. I don’t wish to see trans women of
               color represented in this list of vulnerable populations; however, I do think that
               the IRB's mandate to cause no undue harm to research participants requires
               researchers to think more carefully about emergent communities where people’s very
               humanity is being questioned in society writ large.</p>
            <p>The intentions of the IRB are quite noble and necessary. IRBs are charged with
               ensuring that human subjects research conducted at institutions that receive federal
               resources is ethical and does not cause harm to participant <ptr target="#kim2012"/>.
               In response to human rights abuses of marginalized groups within the US, the IRB was
               established to ensure that human subjects research did not cause undo harm to those
               participating in studies <ptr target="#williams1984"/>; <ptr target="#bradley2007"/>.
               This function of the IRB tends to result in a paternalistic orientation towards
               research subjects, predicated on benevolence and the idea that <cit><quote rend="inline"
                  source="#miller2007">many prospective subjects are vulnerable to a range of
                  decisional defects or impairments that render them unable to protect their own
                  interests, and thus we are right not to rely exclusively on informed
                  consent</quote>
               <ptr target="#miller2007"/></cit>. The IRB evaluates the proposed research to ensure that
               investigators have thought through the potential impacts of the research on the
               people being researched, assuming that there are potential risks that the average
               research subject might not be able to detect if it weren’t brought to their
               attention. This paternalism may be a valid position for the researcher to take given
               the type of research to be conducted but in the digital landscape, a more nuanced and
               fluid understanding of the way power flows between researcher and researched is
               needed. </p>
            <p>Social media users are not the traditionally infantilized research subjects that the
               IRB assumes. As people who are actively engaged in the ongoing generation of their
               digital content, social media users require a level of forethought that extends
               beyond the purview of the IRB. While IRB review might be able to forestall some of
               the harms that are involved in academic research, issues of consent beyond an initial
               yes to participate in a research project or plans to address issues that may not be
               anticipated by the IRB are obfuscated. </p>
            <p>Previous studies have attempted to address IRB paternalism and its impact on research
               subjects in several ways. In the social sciences, there have been efforts to shift
               research from a top down orientation to one that is side to side or bottom up <ptr
                  target="#sabatier1986"/>; <ptr target="#erickson2006"/>; <ptr
                  target="#plesner2011"/>. These methodologies attempt to undo the power imbalance
               by shifting people’s relationships to power. Participation observation or becoming an
               observing participant are other ways that this conversation is framed, relying on the
               researchers shifting location into the research as the mechanism which disrupts the
               traditional flow of power <ptr target="#maguire1987"/>; <ptr target="#mccall1969"/>;
                  <ptr target="#weasel2011"/>. My experience in trying to shift my relationship to
               power involved collaboration even before developing my research methodology.</p>
            <p> By speaking with Mock, before even designing my research plan, I ensured that the
               findings are useful to her as the creator of the hashtag. In addition to speaking
               with Mock directly, I spoke with my online community of friends and activists to
               create an advisory panel. I reached out to Black women and queer thought leaders
               within the arenas of Twitter and Tumblr, which included a diverse group of activist,
               artists, and academics, who have created some of the most popular hashtags related to
               social justice issues. Twitter and Tumblr users like Sydette Harry and Jamie Nesbitt
               Golden have been central to the creation and popularity of many social justice
               related hashtags. Many of them have direct experience with journalists and scholars
               using their social media posts without their consent. These incidents range from
               annoying to outright dangerous. Many amongst this group of twelve have had their work
               stolen by journalists, interpreted by scholars all without attempting to contact
               them. They have experienced rape and death threats for simply voicing their opinions
               online. Given these histories, I did not want to repeat a pattern of beginning work
               without asking for permission first nor giving them the opportunity to ask their own
               research questions. </p>
            <p>I plan to ask within the networks using #girlslikeus what users think about the
               project and what questions they want answered about how it moves through cyberspace
               and the world. Even though tweets are understood as public, I err on the side of
               privacy and anonymity for Twitter users of the hashtag. I will not use the handles of
               users without first attempting to contact them. By allowing Twitter users to shape
               the project and their participation at multiple points, I create a more flexible
               process, one that is dynamic and shifting. But the collaboration doesn’t end
               there.</p>
            <p>My experience with issues of ongoing consent suggests that the way we do digital
               humanities needs to shift. Digital Humanists interested in conducting research that
               is ethical and feminist must go beyond the simple politics of citation, as citation
               itself may be the thing that creates the harm to the community. As noted in The
               #TwitterEthics Manifesto, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#twitterethics2014">both
                  academics and journalists should ask each individual user on Twitter for consent.
                  They should explain the context and the usage of their tweets</quote>
               <ptr target="#twitterethics2014"/></cit>. This allows a Twitter user to prepare for a
               potential onslaught or simply say no. Consent is a form of collaboration, a
               collaborative process which means that a <emph>no</emph> may come later in the course
               of the collaboration. Similarly, the process of doing this research necessitates an
               ongoing commitment to understanding dynamics that emerge through engagement in the
               medium. To that end, the advisory panel proved to be more dynamic than even I could
               have anticipated.</p>

            <head>Collaborative Construction: What transforms in the doing</head>
            <p>I sent the potential members of my advisory committee an email asking if they’d like
               to participate. Those who agreed were invited to join a listserv where I post
               questions and solicit help as needed. While this group was initially created to
               ensure that my work was ethical and useful, it has already been repurposed for needs
               I could not anticipate. One member of the group is an internationally renowned
               journalist. She queried the collaborators, asking for their thoughts on a story she
               was writing about the ways that the media has represented Black people, particularly
               Black women in coverage of the Ebola outbreak. Many in the group responded to her
               request, providing important quotes that shaped her article in really helpful ways.
               When I envisioned the group, I imagined what I could do for them and what they could
               do for me. Even in creating a collaborative space it didn’t occur to me that there
               might be things that we could collectively do for another member of the circle. I
               knew what I wanted from the group and assumed that I could anticipate the group’s
               needs from me. However, this emergent need and purpose for the group was possible
               through the creation of the network itself. Even before I could use the network in
               the way I envisioned, my collaborators were able to leverage it to meet their own
               needs. </p>
            <p>Stressing a non-hierarchal circular collaboration is what helped make this possible.
               I had transformed the traditional top down approach of my research but I had only
               imagined a relationship that was side by side, a horizontal relationship with me on
               one side and my collaborators on the other. This moment allowed for the realization
               that we had co-created a three dimensional space with multiple directions of flow.
               What I appreciate about the language of <emph>collaborators</emph> as opposed to
                  <emph>research subjects</emph> is that it provides the potential for multiple
               levels of relationship between those participating in the research; the structure is
               dynamic.</p>
            <p> Those of us who participated in interviews for the journal article were not
               compensated, and there were a few minor errors in the article that I believe in
               another context would have been hurtful. However, the initial transparent ask, the
               openness to feedback, the knowledge that we were all participating in a process that
               extends beyond the published article and even my book, created a level of trust that
               allowed for forgiveness and correction among peers. Many of these collaborators have
               experienced the unsolicited appropriation of their words by people they did not know.
               By developing a new community, albeit a short lived one, the power differentials
               among the members are mitigated. While I still maintain epistemic privilege as the
               gatherer and convener of this circle, I am interested in using that privilege for the
               collective good <ptr target="#on1993"/>.</p>
            <p>Because academic books make very little money, I endeavored to find meaningful ways
               to compensate this group for their work and time. This includes using university
               research money to help convene gatherings for existing digital networks that may have
               trouble connecting in another capacity. Creating a fund from honoraria received in
               relationship to the work, in addition to coauthoring articles with interested
               collaborators. are a few of the ways I am exploring transforming my relationship to
               my collaborators. I’ve been able to leverage my position within academic communities
               to write grants that include budget opportunities for these collaborators and more.
               As the project continues I am creating more opportunities that challenge the ways
               that researchers have traditionally compensated and shared in the benefits that come
               from doing research. </p>
            <p>One of the important aspects of DH work is the emphasis on collaboration. Scholars in
               the humanities are still primarily rewarded for single author texts. Tenure and
               promotion committees regard books and articles that have one author more favorably
               than mutli-authored texts. One of the ways that DH is creating a different
               methodological practice is by supporting connection through collaboration across
               multiple aspects of digital projects. Digital Humanist Mark Sample discusses this
               idea in relationship to student work through his concept <emph>collaborative
                  construction</emph>. He writes, <quote rend="block" source="#sample2012"
                  >[B]y collaborative construction, I mean a collective effort to build something
                  new, in which each student’s contribution works in dialogue with every other
                  student’s contribution. A key point of collaborative construction is that the
                  students are not merely making something for themselves or for their professor.
                  They are making it for each other, and, in the best scenarios, for the outside
                  world <ptr target="#sample2012"/>.</quote></p>
            <p>I adapt this idea of collaborative construction such that it has import outside the
               realm of the classroom; it is critical to the way that I shape my research project.
               Consequently, a transformation of the goals of my academic work was necessary, as
               well as my relationship to the usually distinct categories of research subject,
               researcher, and audience.</p>
            <p>My work has multiple audiences. There are scholars in fields like women’s, gender,
               and sexuality studies, ethnic studies, and digital humanities who might be interested
               understanding the networks contemporary Black trans women create through the
               production of digital media. However I am interested in creating a book that also and
               perhaps most importantly, is useful to the communities on which my examples draw.
               More than just the world outside the academy, I want to create a resource for the
               communities with whom I am collaborating on the research. This practice involves a
               more intentional form of collaboration than I have attempted before. </p>
            <p>I am creating a new way of practicing the relationships I am developing through my
               the advisory panel, transforming a researcher/researched relationship into one of
               collaboration, thereby shifting out of the position of researcher into a more equal
               role. This process also includes developing new models of expressing the value of
               everyone’s contributions. For me, the process is the product, meaning that the
               process itself is productive, creative, and transformative of the conditions we are
               seeking to understand through the research <ptr target="#twitterethics2014"/>. We are
               building collaboratively in ways that build community and shift existing dynamics. We
               are actively shaping the project of collaborating through our collective
               participation so that an end product, while potentially very useful, is not the only
               thing created by this collaborative investigation.</p>
            <p>The example of trans women of color’s digital activism demonstrate the power of
               digital media to redefine representations of marginalized groups and their ability to
               impact a white supremacist, heterosexist, and trans misogynist media culture without
               that being their primary goal. The practices of reclaiming the screens of our
               computers and phones with content is not simply one of creating new representations
               but is a practice of self-preservation and health promotion through the networks of
               digital media. While often celebrated for the rehabilitated images, this media is not
               often interrogated as processes that support the development of community and
               individual health strategies. Trans women of color aren’t simply naming the violence
               they experience but are building networks of support and recognition for their work
               that helps them have safer environments in which to live.</p>
            <p>I understand trans women of color’s production of media as an act of
               self-preservation and one of health praxis that is not centered on appeals to a
               majority audience. The creation of media by minoritarian subjects about themselves
               and for themselves can be a liberatory act. These acts of image redefinition actually
               engender different outcomes for marginalized groups and the processes by which they
               are created build networks of resilience that far outlives the relevant content.
               Black women and queer and trans folks reconstruct representations through
                  <emph>digital alchemy</emph>.</p>
            <p>#Girlslikeus rejects the assimilationist invisibility of another potential hashtag
               like #imagirltoo, in favor of a declaration that makes trans women the undeniable
               center of their own project, where they are their own referents, not cis women.
               #Girlslikeus signals a conversation that is for, by, and about trans women and not
               their proximity to another group of relative power. #Girlslikeus exemplifies the
               magic of digital alchemy through this practice of shifting from margin to center
               utilizing established mediums to create literally transformative realities. </p>
            <p>The added benefit of creating this community online is that it is visible to those
               outside the identity and does the work of humanizing inadvertently and without
               draining energy from the more important work of supporting each other. Digital media
               is creating and supporting a network of connection among communities that have
               traditionally had trouble finding each other let alone reaching a larger audience. By
               doing the work of community building online, groups are leveraging both visibility
               and education at once. Trans women of color are telling their own stories but in the
               process are forcing more recognition for their identities in mainstream publics.</p>

            <p>I offer these questions as a starting place for conducting digital research within a
               feminist ethical frame. I am reminded of Octavia Butler’s aphorism <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#melzer2002">all you touch you change; all you change,
                  changes you</quote>
               <ptr target="#melzer2002"/>. With this tenant in mind, I think that the important
               take away here is that the very process of conduct research creates shifts in the
               landscape. These shifts have incredible potential to be both helpful and harmful,
               depending on how you frame your project and interactions with your collaborators.</p>
            <p>The Research Justice collective at the AMC frames their work with the question <q>is this <emph>just</emph> research or just
                  research?</q> I want my research to be <emph>just</emph> and I had to set my
               parameters for what that means. I realized that I can’t answer these questions by
               myself. I am close but not embedded in these digital networks I study. I’ve tried to
               shape the process of my investigation in a way that honors the principles set out in
               the Allied Media Project mission. My project is collaborative and builds connection;
               it’s creative in that I’m generating something useful in the media; and it’s
               transformative in that my collaborators and I will be changed by the process of doing
               the research. </p>
