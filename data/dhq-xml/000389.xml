            <p>Reading has always been a contentious and political practice, but this is heightened
               in the contemporary moment both because of the way the environments in which we read
               are changing so radically. For Katherine Hayles reading is <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2010">a powerful technology for reconfiguring
                     activity patterns in the brain</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hayles2010" loc="193"/>
               </cit>, a view representative of attempts to connect the new neuroscience of reading
               with age old practices of literary endeavour. For Sven Birkerts, however, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#birkerts2010">the Internet and the novel are
                     opposites</quote>
                  <ptr target="#birkerts2010"/>
               </cit>, a view that suggests that a hierarchy of reading that locks digital readers
               out of higher order thinking and literary experience. Meanwhile, Anne Mangen finds
               that electronic reading environments <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mangen2016">negatively aﬀect emotional aspects of
                     reading</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mangen2016"/>
               </cit>. But these approaches tend to understand reading as something static that
               occurs in one space or another. However, in practice our reading is increasingly
               distributed. Reading can occur in multiple formats, across multiple platforms for the
               one text or reading experience. A novel begun in print can be read online in a
               born-digital format and concluded in a scanned digital format, for example. These
               journeys across platform require deeper investigation.</p>
            <p>If we think of the printed book as an interface between two orders of thinking, we
               need to consider how the experience of reading a digitized version of a formerly
               printed and bound book alters literary reception and student experience. How does the
               experience of reading across different technological platforms change the reader’s
               relationship to the content? As more and more electronic reading platforms take on
               the physical attributes of material reading experiences either by retaining material
               traces or by emulating them, we might question what experience How do the material
               traces left on digitised works impact the reading process for reading in literary
               studies? The lively discourse surrounding Google Books and the human breaches of the
               material into the immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of formats and
               interfaces, raises valuable questions about the future of the book, reading in the
               twenty-first century, and the long and formidable shadow that centuries of material
               text production casts over Google Books’ electronic utopia. This paper uses both book
               history and new media interface theory to consider the multitude of diverse
               experiences that is literary reading across different platforms in and out of the
               classroom and to consider whether distracted reading can be better understood as
               distributed reading. It considers critical infrastructure studies as a useful
               framework through which to think about reading in the digital age.</p>

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Reading has always been a diverse practice, encompassing many different approaches,
               activities, perspectives and styles, but we do not currently have a nuanced language
               for those different kinds of reading practices. Reading is frequently seen as
               something that is learned in early childhood, reducing it to a binary: one can or
               cannot read <ptr target="#douglas2016"/>. There is little granularity in our approach
               to this fundamental but under theorised foundational skill and experience. Within the
               field of the digital humanities (DH), however we might define it, the attention to
               reading has had a different focus. Here, the emphasis on the tension between close
               and distant reading, or their similarities and differences, has served to highlight
               reading, both in general terms as well as in its specificities, as a foundational and
               significant methodology for the humanities. This has been beneficial to the broader
               humanities sector. Understanding the tension between close and distant reading and
               the assumptions that underlie it, can assist in developing a more nuanced
               understanding of what we mean by reading, which will benefit diverse domains of
               pedagogy, personal reading, and literary analysis, amongst others. The frames in
               which we read are diversifying due to constantly evolving online spaces and the
               affordances they invent and proliferate. This article considers the role of reading
               in the modern humanities landscape and proposes the notion of distributed reading as
               a useful concept for understanding changing reading practices in the digital era.
               Using scholarship from both book history and new media studies, this paper uses the
               concept of interface, following Johanna Drucker, to consider the multitude of diverse
               experiences that is literary reading across different platforms in and out of the
               classroom. The paper argues that the notion of critical infrastructure studies can
               help us better understand the broader material, structural and container issues of
               literary production, circulation and immersion that is reading in the contemporary
               moment. I ask whether distracted reading – which has a pejorative connotation, of
               poor reading, shallow reading – can be better understood as distributed reading, a
               reading across frames, surfaces, platforms, modes and materials. I pursue this
               question by looking at two related case studies: mass digitization project texts and
               the characteristics of online reading platforms found in those archives. Through
               these case studies, I consider the experience of distributed reading in practice.
               Reading is changing in large part because the frames within which reading occurs are
               changing; they are becoming more complex. This requires new ways of understanding
               reading in the digital age. The notion of distributed reading acknowledges that
               reading and the immersive experiences that go with reading occur across spectrums of
               attention, frames, technologies, purposes as well as time and space. The concept of
               distributed reading seeks to account for reading as an evolving practice. The frames
               across which our reading is distributed co-construct our relation to the text and the
               meaning we derive from it in ways as yet under theorised. Reading is not a static
               event but is parcelled out across different kinds of spaces. Reading can occur in
               multiple formats, across multiple platforms for the one text. For example, a novel
               begun in print can be read online in a born-digital format and concluded in a scanned
               digital format. These journeys across platform, frame and format require deeper
               investigation and further complicating what it is we mean by reading in the age of
               the digital.</p>

            <head>Reading in/and the Digital Humanities</head>
            <p>The field of digital humanities has had much input from literary studies and other
               text-based humanities disciplines and scholarship. The place of reading in this has
               yet to be fully considered. In part, this is because of the debate between close
               reading and distant reading that occupies so much space in our field. There are, too,
               tensions caused by the likes of Sven Birkerts for whom the material book is almost a
               moral imperative and Naomi Baron whose concept of <soCalled>words onscreen</soCalled>
               is one of almost, if not quite, diminishment. By looking at the way reading appears
               in and out of digital humanities scholarship we can build a better understanding of
               the usefulness of the notion of distributed-ness to contemporary reading practices. I
               specifically use the awkward construction of distributed-ness here, instead of the
               word distribution which might be more grammatically correct, to separate distributed
               as a word that casts reading practices across platforms from the notion of the
               distribution of books which refers to the physical movement of books (and other media
               and non-media content) in shipments around the world.</p>
            <p>Reading has always been a contentious and political practice, from the moral panic of
               the rise of the novel in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the apparent high
               culture, low culture divide <ptr target="#furedi2015"/> but this has heightened in
               recent times because of the way the environments in which we read are changing so
               radically (albeit within a continuum of change in inscription practices dating back
               millennia) and because of the political environment in which communication occurs.
               Naomi Baron asks whether <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#baron2013">our growing dependence on reading on
                     screen contribute[s] to a redefinition of what it means to read?</quote>
                  <ptr target="#baron2013" loc="193"/>
               </cit>. The stakes are perceived as high. Sven Birkerts is frequently trotted out for
               his conservative and alarmist views on the future of reading. For Birkerts, digital
               reading signifies the loss not only of the special format of the book, which has
               important historic resonances, but of the significant mental capacities that, for
               him, are built around and dependent upon that material object <ptr
                  target="#birkerts2006"/>. In fact, he goes as far as to identify immersive, long
               form literary reading with the very notion of the human <ptr target="#birkerts2010"/>
               so that the materiality of the traditional text is almost a moral imperative. Others
               see this approach as clouded nostalgia for a form for which evolution is part of a
               natural order bringing both affordances and costs <ptr target="#hayles2013"/>. While
               still attentive to evidence from the cognitive sciences pointing to the changing
               brain in the age of digital immersion – a line evoked by Wolf, Baron, Carr and
               Bauerlein though to different ends – Hayles, among others, is seeking a more nuanced
               understanding of reading in the digital age and the sector is calling for deeper
               understanding of the new affordances of reading online. </p>
            <p>Anne Mangen signals concern for particular types of reading in the distributed
               digital age. For Mangen, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mangen2016">the dispersion of literary reading to an
                     increasing number of portable digital reading devices may prompt, or indeed
                     necessitate, increased interdisciplinary empirical research on literary
                     reading</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mangen2016" loc="242"/>
               </cit> but that it will require approaches beyond the traditional disciplines to do
               so. Mangen finds that electronic reading environments, and in particular the iPad,
               may have a negative effect on the generation of empathy in narrative settings <ptr
                  target="#mangen2016" loc="249"/>. She argues that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mangen2016">the future of literary reading in a time
                     of increasing digitization is too multifaceted, complex, multilayered to be
                     studied entirely within disciplinary boundaries, and the consequences of
                     continuing to do so should not be underestimated</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mangen2016" loc="258"/>
               </cit>. But others find cognitive science might not be the best approach to
               understanding the workings of literary reading [for example: <ptr
                  target="#elfenbein2006"/>]. And, all the while, new reports about the health of
               the printed book and the industries around it gain headline after headline because we
               are, as a culture, really taken with the notion of reading, regardless of how and how
               much we personally practice it <ptr target="#mitchell2016"/>. So, while reading is
               all around us as a technical, commercial, consumer, or pedagogical issue, it is, at
               the same time, invisible, assumed, under the radar. <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#scholes2002">We do not see reading,</quote> as Robert Scholes reminds us
               in his much-quoted statement about what happens in the literary studies classroom
                  <ptr target="#scholes2002" loc="166"/>. Reading is an act that occurs in an inner
               landscape that cannot be observed directly. We can only see some of the things that
               go on around it. Into this debate comes the contribution from the digital humanities
               of the methodology (and value) of <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#moretti2005">distant reading</quote>
                  <ptr target="#moretti2005"/>
               </cit> or <cit>

                  <ptr target="#jockers2013"/>
               </cit>. Further alarming the likes of Birkerts, this practice is perceived to be a
               form of abstract reading, to efface the individual text in a corpus, and to outsource
               the act of reading to a machine or algorithm. </p>
            <p>Digitalisation of textuality has also altered the way we understand the act of
               reading. Reading of all kinds are now distributed acts across platforms, frames,
               media, devices, but, as always, also across purposes and contexts. Some new platforms
               for reading are more intimate; the mobile phone screen frequently goes everywhere
               with its owner. Some are more social in the way they position the reader’s body or
               behaviour or both <ptr target="#barnett2015"/>. Some platforms are both more social
               and more intimate simultaneously. But in addition to the impact of emerging physical
               devices for reading, the interfaces that support textual immersion in the digital age
               require more consideration.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the biggest debate in text-based DH at the moment is that between close and
               distant reading. Certainly, the tension between close and distant reading is at the
               centre of debates about the humanities and digital humanities, their functions,
               histories and futures. The digital humanities, as a field, has inherited problems
               about the articulation of the notion of reading from the humanities, problems that
               are old and enduring. DH adds to the complexity by contributing notions such as
                  <q>machine reading</q> that further complicate our understanding of what reading
               is, ascribing to the computer, application or algorithm a skill or task we cannot see
               entirely and yet we revere across different modes or practices. Digital Humanists

               </cit>, a view representative of attempts to connect the new neuroscience of reading
               with age-old practices of literary endeavour. Franco Moretti’s distant reading comes
               to us in a wave of rethinking reading in light of both theory and pedagogy, of the
               death and future of the book. While for Lesjak theory and reading are oppositional (<cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#lesjak2013">theory is on its way out; reading is

               </cit>), Alan Liu’s call to bring cultural critique to the digital humanities is an
               opportunity to find a useful balance between the two approaches and refuse to see
               them as separate <ptr target="#liu2012"/>. New methods or approaches to reading, such

               that we need to work to make reading more visible, to understand reading as in a more
               modulated or granulated way, and alert us to the fact that there is still more work
               to do. Reading occupies a special place in the humanities’ imaginary. Close reading
               is seen as the signature skill of the Humanities, the <cit>

               of the Humanities <ptr target="#jockers2013" loc="6"/>. Attempts to promote data
               intensive approaches to humanities research are not necessarily oppositional to
               traditional forms of reading in the humanities. In fact, for Stephen Ramsay <cit>

               </cit>. In his article <title rend="quotes">From Reading to Social Computing</title>
               Alan Liu comes to the conclusion that: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#liu2013">Ultimately, it may be that experiencing and

            <p>This view, that access to the immersive literary experience through digital frames
               may work to support development of our understanding of what reading means, is
               desperately required. At the same time, the debate or tension between close and
               distant reading is diffusing to some extent with the increasingly articulated view
               that close reading and distant reading are not mutually exclusive <ptr
                  target="#liu2012"/>
               <ptr target="#bode2017"/>. Indeed, the new methodologies do not supplant or even
               supplement reading but rather unpack the elements involved in the methodology of
               reading in both primary and secondary contexts (which is true for both literary
               objects and their criticism). Katherine Bode argues that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#bode2017">close reading and distant reading are not
                     opposites</quote>
                  <ptr target="#bode2017" loc="79"/>
               </cit>. For Bode, the perceived clash between distant and close reading is the result
               of a particular kind of distant reading suggested by Moretti and Jockers who neglect
               the important field of textual scholarship <ptr target="#bode2017"/>, and, I would
               add, book history. Marjorie Perloff suggests something similar when she calls for
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#perloff2004">differential reading</quote>: modes of
               reading that incorporate not only close and distant reading but also the practice of
               reading subjectively and objectively <ptr target="#perloff2004"/>. Tanya Clement
               picks up on Perloff’s calls for reading methodologies or approaches that incorporate <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#clement2013">differential reading …
                     practices</quote>
                  <ptr target="#clement2013" loc="para 1"/>
               </cit>, arguing that by incorporating these different but complementary approaches we
               can make greater advances in literary interpretation because of their dissimilarity
               and their complementarity. The apparent tension between close and distant reading is
               ameliorated through a practice that privileges a differential approach. However, in
               addition to these important interventions into kinds of reading that may or may not
               be afforded by digitalisation – the move to digital surrogate artefacts – we need to
               pay attention to the impact of the infrastructures of reading. The concept of
               distribution needs to be accounted for, not in the old sense of the infrastructure
               between publisher and reader throughout bookshops or other modes of bookselling, but
               distribution in the sense of acts of reading that occur across devices, platforms or
               material modes. We do not yet have the language or theoretical frameworks to account
               for these changes. </p>
            <p>The notion of distribution as an effect of particular relevance in the digital age
               does not have as much purchase or controversy as the debate over close versus distant
               reading. Laura Mandell uses, or perhaps coins, the term <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#mandell2015">distributed reading</quote> in her 2012 work <title
                  rend="italic">Breaking the Book</title>
               <ptr target="#mandell2015" loc="103"/> but the term appears in that format only in a
               chapter title. Mandell’s book focuses on the time of the rise of <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#mandell2015">mass print</quote> in order to understand how print
               functions differently in the digital age <ptr target="#mandell2015" loc="58"/>. For
               Mandell’s purposes, distributed reading refers both to mass distribution of print at
               an historical moment and to a player in distributing thinking which she understands
               as embodied, as distributed across tools and interfaces. Mandell asks: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#mandell2015">What happens to the discipline of
                     English when both the texts that we investigate and the filters we use allow us
                     to range widely over what is really, this time, the whole field of literature,
                     including ephemera and the allegedly non-literary? We are looking forward to an
                     era of reading that is evenly distributed.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mandell2015" loc="145"/>
               </cit></p>
            <p>For Mandell, then, the distribution relates to the filters, definitions and
               field-building occurring in literary studies as well as to access. There is an
               optimism here, that a focus on distributed reading means that we account more for
               meaning generated out of engagements with other components of the literary, and even
               with non-literary entanglements. Meaning is recognised as emanating from more than
               the words on the page. This is not a controversial suggestion but has implications
               for the digitization of literature when we consider, for example, the difference
               between a Project Gutenberg copy of an out-of-copyright novel (typed into the archive
               by volunteers) and a Google Books/Hathi Trust version of the same novel, scanned in
               by Google or library staff. More on this below. Taking a different tack but still
               focussing on the many entanglements of the material/digital divide, Johanna Drucker
               uses the term <quote rend="inline" source="#drucker2013">distributed
                  materiality</quote> to think through the locatedness of the text <ptr
                  target="#drucker2013"/>. <cit>
                  <quote rend="block"><emph>Distributed materiality</emph> focuses on the complex of
                     interdependencies on which any digital artifact depends for its basic
                     existence. In a distributed approach, any digital <soCalled>entity</soCalled>
                     is dependent on servers, networks, software, hosting environments and the
                     relations among them just as surely as a biological entity depends upon
                     atmospheric and climatic conditions.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="para 21"/>
               </cit> This, as I argue below, can be read as a call for an infrastructure studies
               approach to the study of reading and literary experiences. For Drucker, it is more
               useful to think not about the reception of a text so much as the performance of it.
               The text not as object but as event <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="10"/>. This is a
               useful aid to thinking about the many breaches of the overtly material into the
               overtly digital, which will be considered in the case studies below. Certainly, the
               consideration of digital literary artefacts has had significant pay-off for our
               thinking around the material object. <cit>
                  <quote rend="block">The encounter of texts and digital media has reinforced
                     theoretical realizations that printed materials are not static, self-identical

                     intervention in a textual field that is charged with potentiality.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#drucker2009" loc="9"/>
               </cit> This idea that no texts are static, material or digital, and that reading is a
               performance is true of all reading; but these are notions especially complicated by
               digitization which presents a case that is neither exactly electronic nor print but
               is, rather, a hybrid object. Elsewhere, Drucker signals her growing interest in the
               impact of interfaces on interpretation arguing that we often <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#drucker2013">take interface for a thing, static,
                     stable, and fixed. Or we take it as a representation of computational

                  <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="213"/>
               </cit>. We look through interfaces – they are often invisible or at least
               self-effacing. Following Drucker, then, we can see interfaces and processes, like
               readings and interpretations, as performances. They are contingent spaces where
               elements come together in diverse ways to create interpretive environments that
               support readings.</p>
            <p>In this view, the <cit>

                  <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="213"/>
               </cit>. In which case, according to Drucker, it becomes essential to take on the task
               of understanding how interfaces <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline">organize our relation to complex systems (rather than how

                     how an interface works as a boundary space (though it masquerades as a reified
                     image or menu of options)</quote>
                  <ptr target="#drucker2013" loc="213"/>
               </cit>. Interface has a distributed component to it that needs unpacking. Drucker
               emphasises that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#drucker2014">a <emph>book is conceived as a

               </cit>. For Drucker, then, distribution emerges as a key quality for the
               representation of knowledge in digital environments. These approaches to
               understanding how reading is changing in the increasingly digital textual environment
               demonstrates how these shifts have the capacity to teach us something new about
               reading itself. That is, the shift to the digital teaches us something about all
               kinds of reading: digital, material, online, offline, handwritten, typed. This set of
               conditions provides an important opportunity to pursue and develop that more nuanced
               notion of reading that the scholarly community is calling for <ptr
                  target="#deegan2017"/>
               <ptr target="#manarin2012"/>. The common component amongst these perspectives is
               infrastructure, if we take a broader understanding of what infrastructure for text,
               literature and the humanities might be.</p>
            <p>Two case studies of distributed reading as a quality of infrastructure will
               illuminate these shifts in reading and enable us to think about how distributed-ness
               plays into the new conditions for reading. First, the mass digitization archive
               (Google Books, Hathi Trust, Internet Archive) presents a challenge for thinking about
               acts of reading through an interface. Second, I will look at the various frames that
               inhabit those archives and consider their implications for reading.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Reading in the mass digitization archive</head>
            <p>Reading in, though, with or against archives (personal, institutional, corporate,
               private, public etc) has a long history. Libraries, archives and other collections
               have markers, policies and gatekeepers in both their material and digital contexts.
               The rhetoric that Google uses in promoting its digitization work infuses the project
               with utopian tones, as being primarily about access to the vast archive of human
               knowledge, to preserve and disseminate that knowledge, or as much as is digitizable,
               and provide open access to that record beyond the material library with their
               stubbornly persistent geographical locations. In contrast to this, critics argue that
               the mass digitization project demotes the role of authors in the provision of
               literary culture and knowledge and so prevents them from gaining a living by their
               work <ptr target="#hoffmann2016"/>. It is argued, too, that this underwrites the
               decline of the book as a physical material object, and that it imposes a significant
               cost upon libraries in accommodating the project and upon the books themselves in the
               process of being digitized. And to what purpose or benefit, critics argue, given the
               high rates of error and incomprehensibility in the archive and given the changing
               (deteriorating) relationship between the partner libraries and Google throughout the
               project <ptr target="#hoffmann2016"/>. The discourse is thick with contradictions:
               knowledge is free and common but also retained and commercialised, books are
               preserved (saved?) through their disassembly (dismemberment?).</p>
            <p> The digital archive, frequently built through the rhetoric of accessibility, brings
               with it a whole new set of gatekeeping strategies to negotiate. The Google Books
               project has received a great deal of media attention mostly centred on the legal
               struggles to establish an understanding of fair use and copyright in a changing
               textual environment <ptr target="#barnett2016"/>. Projects such as <title
                  rend="quotes">The Art of Google Books</title> have registered and circulated the
               oddities found in mass digitization archives <ptr target="#wilson"/>. Meanwhile,
               Andrew Norman Wilson has drawn attention to the labour issues in mass digitization
               projects <ptr target="#wilson2016"/>
               <ptr target="#barnett2016"/>. Increasingly, scholars are turning to the history of
               digitization practices to develop an understanding of what digitization means for the
               human record and the way we interact with and draw meaning from it (<ptr
                  target="#sartori2016"/>; <ptr target="#gooding2013"/>; <ptr target="#bode2017"/>;
                  <ptr target="#barnett2016"/>). Conway’s analysis of errors in the Hathi Trust
               archive is a useful intervention, concluding that <title rend="quotes">to preserve
                  the products of large-scale digitization is a decision to preserve
                  imperfection</title>
               <ptr target="#conway2013" loc="27"/>. This provides us with information about the
               usability of the archive but what we really need are qualitative accounts so that we
               can consider what not only these imperfections within the archive might mean but also
               the larger questions about the systems, interfaces and frames within which
               digitization and mass digitization projects operate and what they mean for readers of
               all kinds. The archives of mass digitization projects like Google Books, the Hathi
               Trust, the Internet Archive and so on highlight important questions about what is
               lost and what is gained when we commit to digital that which was (is still somewhere)
               material. They highlight the significance of the material as the object becomes
               (imperfect) digitization. By providing the digital image of scans alongside the text
               of their content, mass digitization projects re-emphasise the material components of
               the text. </p>
            <p>This rising significance of the material in an era of digitization is felt elsewhere
               too. Andrew Stauffer’s <title rend="quotes">Book Traces</title> project at the
               University of Virginia, a project that collects and records unique items in library
               books (mostly marginalia but also bookmarks, notepaper, leaves, strands of hair and
               so on) underscores the significance of the individual copy of a text in a market of
               hundreds or thousands <ptr target="#stauffer2015"/>. As projects such as Stauffer’s
               and Wilson’s demonstrate, errors and idiosyncrasies in the digitization archive
               generate a cognitive dissonance that reveals something about the inner workings of
               the relationship between the human and the printed text. When we encounter breaches
               of the material inside the immaterial archive (such as marginalia, ephemera,
               institutional stamps, scan errors) in Google Books scans, the
                  <soCalled>thingness</soCalled> of the object in front of us is undermined. Its
               hybrid nature is revealed. It melds the material and the digital together in one
               space.</p>
            <p>That materiality and how we can understand its changing nature in the digital age is
               of increasing concern in the literature. We have come a long way since Mark Poster

               </cit>. He argued that the material object’s inevitable individuality (regardless of
               mass production) was not available to the digital object. But Hayles’ work combining
               electronic literary studies with the field of new materialism and the media
               archaeology of Jussi Parikka and so on have debunked this limited view. Rather than
               the illusion of reading online as a dematerialised experience, human traces in the
               archive as they appear in the Google Books archive are profound reminders of the
               hybridity of the scan. They impact how we read and respond to the texts, as any
               material characteristic does. They also shape our interpretations, by providing
               companion readers or markings of authority or disagreement, complementing or in some
               cases rendering the printed text unreadable. In doing so they highlight both the
               supposed immateriality of the electronic document and its former materiality,
               signalling its own metamorphoses and causing a level of cognitive dissonance in the
               reading moment. These material traces are permanent, in so far as any digital object
               is permanent. They are anachronistic, causing the reader to do cognitive work to
               accommodate the slippage between material and immaterial, between then and now. They
               are disruptive to our relationship with the immaterial text. They reveal other
               readers inside the text with you as not just through markings on the page – a
               co-presence that is as true for the material book as for the digital scan – but also
               of the human infrastructure in the production. </p>
            <p>But where errors of materiality in the Google and Hathi Trust book archives are
               accidental and erroneous, the intentional inclusion of material imagery in digital
               reading experiences serves to help the reader navigate the text in familiar ways and
               forms the subject for my second case study here. The material trace on the text is of
               benefit to the reading process as more and more electronic reading platforms take on
               the physical attributes of material reading experiences <ptr target="#barnett2015"/>.
               The lively discourse surrounding Google Books and the human breaches of the material
               into the immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of formats, raises valuable
               questions about the future of the book, reading in the twenty-first century and the
               long and formidable shadow that centuries of material text production casts over
               Google Books’ electronic utopia. This interface establishes itself as a hybrid of
               digital and material. In addition to scan errors, the markers of the material text
               (perhaps aged or stained paper, markings by readers, institutional or gifting stamps,
               and so on) is now preserved in a digital image. The work is made available through an
               interface, a set of features that frame the text within the archive space. This
               heightens the sense of dislocation created by the merging of two formats. This
               framing is the subject of the second case study I consider here in service of a
               better understanding of the concept of distributedness in reading.</p>

            <head>Framing reading</head>
            <p>Where early attempts at creating ebooks lifted the content from its original material
               conditions of the book, the page and its bindings and rendered it in a text window
               with no reference to the iconography of the original material context, it was not
               long before imagery of the material elements of the books returned to the zone of
               e-reading with skeuomorphs representing the visual and auditory cues of reading <ptr
                  target="#barnett2015"/>. As more electronic reading platforms take on the physical
               attributes or affordances of material reading experiences, these quasi-materialities
               influence the reading experience, and they frame it, taking on the role of the
               interface. They serve as interfaces through which reading is filtered according to
               familiar iconography of the printed book experience. </p>
            <p>Drucker’s notion of frames helps us to think about the influence of interface in the
               distributed experience of reading. Some of these elements or characteristics have
               analogue equivalents but others are unique to the digital realm. Regardless, these
               elements activate a higher level of awareness of the distribution. Drucker argues
               that the cognitive skills of human beings work to create sense and meaning by <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#drucker2011">stitching fragments of what are

                     our task of correlation. We are constantly in the frame jumping state that
                     disorients the reader, trying to create relations across varied types of
                     material – images, videos, maps, graphs, texts, and the many structuring
                     elements of layout and format that organize the graphic environment.</quote>

               </cit> For all the benefits of distributed reading, then, reading across frames and
               materialities, the experience of frame jumping also comes at the cognitive cost of
               load. </p>
            <p>As an example of frames in the archive, consider the context-rich and thoughtfully
               laid out interface of the Hathi Trust. The <q>structuring elements of the layout</q>
               form an important agent in the distribution of the reading. See for example <ref
                  target="#figure01">Figures 1 and 2</ref>, which demonstrate many of these elements
               in action. Here the book is marked with the institutional book plate of the
               University of Michigan, complete with the name of the donor whose gift made possible
               the purchase of the book. This imbues the work with different kinds of authority
               (institutional, academic, professional, librarianship). In the bottom right hand
               corner, we can see the residue of fingers of scanners caught on the page during the
               scanning process. Quality control processes have attempted to minimize the disruption
               to the text but cannot erase it completely and in this way the human being scanning
               the book becomes a permanent reader inside the text with the reader/user. The age of
               the book and its worn state is evident through rips and tears, bindings coming loose
               and displaying the inner workings of the material book. But these elements are
               flattened under the glass of the scanner (real or metaphorical) – the gesture is to
               the textured but at the same time flattening effect of the scanning renders it
               untouchable. We have to do a lot of cognitive work in frame jumping to process this. </p>

                  <ptr target="#mak2011"/>
               </cit>. As well as the traditional frames of the print book – page, border, gutter
               and so on – the archive’s reading interface presents a range of tools that frame, at
               different levels, the reading space and the text. The reader has choices – one page
               at a time (where the logic of the scroll operates in moving from one page to the
               next) or the double page spread (where the skeuomorphic visual element of the turning
               of the page is introduced and other visual cues of material books such as gutters,
               margins, and so on can be rendered) <ptr target="#hayles1999"/>. Some of these frames
               are navigational – they help the reader to move throughout the text object and the

                  <quote rend="inline" source="#drucker2008">navigation is never natural; it is

               of reading, one can curate, browse, share (in a wide range of formats), play. <ref
                  target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref> shows additional interface elements. The
               authorizing marks seen here in the form of an institutional bookplate confer a level
               of authority on the text. In this case not only can we see which institutional
               repository or university library it comes from but we can also see which donation
               fund the book was purchased with. </p>
            <p>Even at the level of the page much distraction occurs. Bonnie Mak uses the history of
               the textual interface to demonstrate the way human thinking and interpreting develops
               alongside the material components of what she calls <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mak2011">the signifying strategies of the
                     page</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mak2011" loc="7"/>
               </cit> – a frame of reference that impacts every aspect of textuality (tablet, scroll
               and now printed and bound pages and even into the webpage). She argues <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#mak2011">From a young age we are trained to believe
                     that the boundaries of the interface are always identical to the edges of the
                     material platform of the page – namely, that the cognitive space and the
                     physical dimension of the page are necessarily coterminous. But the page has
                     not always been circumscribed in this way</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mak2011" loc="3–4"/>
               </cit> For Mak these signifying strategies follow, though in complicated ways, from
               the printed text to the electronic text. But again, the hybridity of the digitized
               page and the structures it exists within mean these examples require further
               unpacking. Mak goes on to argue that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mak2011">the materiality of the page influences its
                     own reception across technology, language, geography and time</quote>

               </cit>. The materiality of the page continues to inform literary and immersive
               reading.</p>
            <p>And in addition to these visual elements in the co-production of the digitized text,
               the role of other elements in the chain from scan to book require unpacking. For
               example, an infrastructure approach to digital reading requires accounting for the
               role of such groups as the Distributed Proofreaders who volunteer their time to
               correct errors in the OCR record of items in the Internet Archive and other
               crowdsourced activities. These more formalized activities are complemented in every
               archive by labour with various levels of acknowledgement, sometimes crowdsourced such
               as the proofreaders who spend time correcting the Trove newspaper digitizations.
               Little is known about the Google Books archive’s OCR correction processes. These are
               further distributions in the network that require accounting for. </p>
            <p>The emerging field of critical digital infrastructure studies or critical humanities
               infrastructure studies (<ptr target="#liu2016"/>; <ptr target="#smithies2017"/>; <ptr
                  target="#drucker2016"/>) provides a growing framework for thinking through
               questions about the foundations on which the knowledge production processes
               underpinning humanities and cultural research, knowledge and communication rest.
               Critical infrastructure studies may offer a way of thinking about how all the things
               we produce in the arts, humanities and culture can be understood as a system of
               communication. We can interrogate the functions and co-minglings of these elements at
               both macro and micro levels. The field provides a more structured way of thinking
               about a number of Humanities infrastructure objects such as the Google Books project,
               the Hathi Trust, the Internet Archive, Trove and so on as part of a bigger set of
               infrastructural conditions globally. The structures in which we hold, display,
               preserve and provide access to our cultural objects and information has an influence
               on that culture and its reception and interpretation. The frames we impose on them,
               the navigational devices that ensure usability and interoperability but which are
               nevertheless interpretive devices, require more understanding. The Galleries,
               Libraries, Archives and Museums sector contributes much to this knowledge <ptr
                  target="#marstine2008"/>. However, with a few exceptions <ptr
                  target="#burrows2016"/>, digital collections management processes tend not to
               emphasize this in the production of their tools and structures. Deb Verhoeven argues
               that <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#verhoeven2016">cultural infrastructure is not a
                     passive conduit, it catalyzes for better or worse. It is a technology that

                  <ptr target="#verhoeven2016"/>
               </cit>. Critical infrastructure studies afford a way of talking about these, often
               invisible, elements of digital design. Alan Liu reminds us that it is essential to
               consider the usually invisible support structures such as labour, administration,
               hardware and graphical user interfaces that underpin the provision of digital
               cultural material for access and research, because these structures thoroughly
               influence the means by which we access cultural objects and data internationally <ptr

               cultural objects assessed through them, deserve more attention that we currently give
               them.</p>
            <p>A critical humanities infrastructure approach opens up to critique the systems,

               </cit> and seeks to understand the operational and cultural logics of humanities
               infrastructure projects. We are looking at a future in which cultural objects are
               preserved, accessed, shared and understood (interpreted) within the hardware and
               software frames that process them and make them available. To return to the work of

            <p>The concept of critical infrastructure studies provides a useful way of thinking
               about mass digitization projects, such as Google Books, the Hathi Trust, the Internet
               Archive, the digitization strategies of individual libraries, as part of a bigger set
               of infrastructural conditions and as part of a history and future of reading, the
               conditions of which impact the experience of reading, interpretation, literary
               culture and, ultimately, the very institution of literature. This is crucial in order
               to understand the nature of reading in a digitised and distributed environment. But
               it is also crucial because the way we understand textuality in digitised spaces has a
               direct impact on the way we frame the study of literature for tertiary students and
               the practice of immersive literary experience across all educational and personal
               reading. A focus and more nuanced understanding of interfaces and infrastructures of
               reading enable students to understand the impact of their reading decisions on the
               way they relate to the texts they read for pleasure, study or work. Similarly, the
               results of the Academic Book of the Future project show that we do not yet know
               enough about reader behaviour in online environments to understand the full potential
               or the cost of enhanced ebooks for scholarly communication or digital environments
               for more traditional outputs <ptr target="#deegan2017"/>. The work we do as scholars
               and teachers, and inevitably, the way we provide learning environments for students

               Just as book history has provided a way of thinking (or a diversity of ways of
               thinking) about what the book is as a concept and event, joining together a multitude
               of individual objects known as books under the umbrella of book history, so too does
               a critical infrastructure studies approach pull together thinking, methods,
               frameworks from a variety of disciplines to think at the concept level about the

               reading, and the thinking that goes along with it, occurs over devices, platforms,
               features, networks, contexts, and that these can usefully be understood as forming an
               infrastructure of reading. This emphasizes the crowding of our reading experience
               with unacknowledged inanimate others. If we think of the printed book as an interface
               between two orders of thinking, as I argue the work of Drucker and others implies, we
               need to consider how the experience of reading a digitized version of a formerly
               printed and bound book alters literary reception, student experience and the
               practices of scholarship. The lively discourse surrounding Google Books and the human
               breaches of the material into the immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of
               formats and interfaces, raises valuable questions about not only the future of the
               book as the container for literary and textual output, but, more consequentially, for
               reading in the twenty-first century, and the long and formidable shadow that
               centuries of material text production casts over Google Books’ electronic utopia.</p>
            <p>Reading across platforms, then, complicates immersion even as it increases access.
               Since the material is so significant to reception, as we know it is, then surely
               different material experiences of the one literary engagement (text) affects the
               reading of the book. This has implications not only for reception and interpretation
               of texts but also at the more general level of information literacy. Anne Mangen’s
               work, for example, seeks to point out what some of these effects may be <ptr
                  target="#mangen2016"/>. A residual challenge may be to develop a typology of
               reading and reading-inflected cognition that accounts for the distributed nature of
               electronic reading environments. Reading is an under-theorised and under-attended
               component of interactions we have with text in online and off-line spaces, in
               material and digital forms. In addition to this general lack of understanding, the
               digital environments for reading offer unique challenges and affordances that we best
               account for in order to be able to mitigate or accentuate.</p>
            <p>An important project ahead for the humanities, then, is to consider the impact of
               digitising on reading, not as a separate concern for librarians and collections
               professionals or technicians, not under the banner of accessibility or
               interoperability, but as a factor at the centre of what reading means, at the level
               of critique. While it is not at all radical to suggest that we account for the
               material conditions under which the literary texts we read, analyse, and teach were
               produced <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2012"/> it is perhaps the complicated making of
               the set of networks and conditions in which the digitized/digitalized novel exists
               that has led to its relative lack of attention. Reading studies has much to learn
               from DH and from comparative textual media studies and infrastructure studies
               approaches and, significantly, vice versa. Central to this has to be a better
               understanding of the story of digitization as it shapes up to be the most significant
               project for humanities scholarship into the future. Digitization needs to be
               understood as a cultural practice. In this article, I have attempted to make the case
               for this and to demonstrate the unique place of reading in this interdisciplinary
               mix. Digital Humanities needs to consider reading beyond close or distant.
               Distributed reading is a way of unpacking the complex relationship between the
               material and the digital and some half way space that injects the iconography of
               materiality into the digital literary experience. Despite all the attention reading
               has received in recent years, we still struggle to talk usefully and in a granulated
               way about what reading is and what it is in different modes, environments, or
               moments. The plethora of digital devices, platforms and interfaces only further
               complicates this, and raises the stakes for reading. But at the same time, it opens
               up new ways of thinking about reading and new avenues for interdisciplinary
               investigation. Ultimately, this renders many elements of reading, if not reading
               itself, more visible which can only benefit the field.</p>
