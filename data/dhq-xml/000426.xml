                        <p>After completing a Ph.D. in English and Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Adam James Bradley
                            joined the Visualization for Information Analysis Lab (Vialab) at Ontario Tech University as a research scientist.
                            Adam's work is concerned with the problems of subjectivity, ambiguity, and interpretation that are omnipresent in
                            digital tool design and text analysis. In some way all of Adam's work from visual text analytics, to interactive
                            pen and paper applications, to visual search platforms are all trying to address the same question: How can we use
                            technology to augment human actions in a way that allows us to be creative and imaginative, while still leveraging
                            the power and speed of the machine.

                    interactive digital object that automatically inserts modular elements in a
                    digital space. Leveraging the findings of previous studies, our framework

                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p>Printed books still remain persistent in the workflow of scholars even though
                    there is a plethora of digital options available that afford great power and
                    flexibility to the user. Word processors and other applications have been
                    completely integrated into peopleâ€™s daily lives and have started to replace pen
                    and paper as a modality for interacting with the written word; when it comes to
                    books, the affordances offered by digital platforms such as search and copy are
                    considered paradigm shifting additions to the act of reading. But, even though
                    these tools exist, scholars still write on paper and still have books on their
                    bookshelves. There is a tension that exists between these new digital formats
                    and our history. We often create digital tools to mimic the affordances of
                    books, but while they improve steadily, the weight, smell, and sounds of a book
                    are still unique to bound paper and ink. It is important to note that it is
                    still not known how these affordances affect cognition, and for literary
                    scholarship, interpretation. Mehta et al. studied fourteen literary critics and
                    found that each had idiosyncratic methods of marking up a literary document, but
                    most importantly, all of them engaged in some form of annotation when working
                    with poetic texts <ptr target="#mehta2017"/>. Our own domain expert, a modernist
                    literary critic, confirmed the findings of that study and presented the idea to
                    us for a system that allows scholars to quickly digitize a document for
                    augmentation but retain the look and feel of the original. </p>
                <figure xml:id="figure01">

                        sparklines inserted.</head>

                </figure>
                <p>Beyond the affordances of physical texts, many older texts used for research
                    often do not have reliable digital versions, and many corpora are still
                    digitized as images such as Early English Books Online <ptr target="#EEBO2003"
                    />. The solution we offer is a combination of techniques that bring together the
                    paper and ink history of our past, with the digital affordances of our present.
                    To demonstrate, we present a web-based interface, geared toward researchers,
                    that allows for the quick digitization and augmentation of paper documents. By
                    using any web-based device with a camera or uploading an existing image,
                    Textension allows the user to create interactive digital objects from analog
                    texts that retain the look and feel of the originals. </p>
                <p>To start this project, we asked ourselves the question: How can we allow users
                    the ability to interact with both analog and digital text at the same time? Not
                    knowing exactly what we lose when we digitize a text in terms of interpretation
                    or cognition is a much larger problem, and we wanted to address how to interact
                    with these texts without completely discarding the originals. While there are
                    great efforts to digitize the worldâ€™s books, such as the Google books projects
                        <ptr target="#google2017"/>, large-scale OCR projects are difficult to
                    implement. With the growth of digitized text repositories that leverage these
                    technologies, two problems are still outstanding: digitally supporting books
                    that have not yet been digitized, and enabling better use of books that have
                    been digitized as images and are not currently interactive. The flexibility and
                    freedom of digital writing and reading are leading to increasing pressure to
                    digitize texts. However, most of these solutions are costly, time-consuming, and
                    never seem to reach the document of current interest. There is a need for a
                    quick, direct and simple way to gain these freedoms with the document you
                    currently have in hand â€” whether it is a hand-written letter, an old book, or
                    the newspaper. What we have laid out here is a method for achieving this goal,
                    while still having and keeping the original text close at hand.</p>
                <p>In this paper, we present a framework that extends the power of the digital to
                    physical books in near real-time. Our contribution is bringing together ideas
                    studied in digital document spaces and existing word-scale visualizations to
                    demonstrate how these known quantities can be leveraged to bridge analog and
                    digital reading and writing. Our framework is informed by previous results
                    describing document spaces and the different ways they are used with analog
                    documents. We outline each of the document spaces and describe how they can be
                    used in tool design, and we implement a prototype to demonstrate the robustness
                    of this framework (see <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>).</p>
                <p>Through Textension we offer quick access, applicable to the analog text at hand,
                    to an integrated digital/analog environment, only requiring common equipment
                    such as the camera in a phone and a preferred web-enabled device. Simply
                    photograph or upload an existing picture of a document, display it in Textension
                    on a web-browser and start interacting. By making paper documents interactive on
                    mobile devices Textension allows for a smooth transition between our history and
                    our present by allowing users a quick way to digitize documents while working
                    on-site in places like libraries. Our system produces in-line visualizations and
                    interactive elements directly on the newly built digital document, allowing for
                    work to continue while having an augmented digital document at the ready.</p>

                <p>While we present a prototype in this paper, we see our main contribution as a
                    discussion and amalgamation of what is possible when bringing together analog
                    and digital affordances as it relates to text. We see Textension as a way to
                    leverage past studies and computational approaches to natural language to
                    quickly create digital documents from analog texts using readily accessible
                    mobile technology. </p>

                    <p>Bridging the affordances of paper documents and digital technologies is not a
                        new pursuit. Many projects have attempted to cross the boundaries between
                        these two modalities to leverage what is best in both.</p>
                    <p>Early work on Fluid Documents <ptr target="#chang1998"/>
                        <ptr target="#zellweger2000"/> has provided inspiration for working with
                        both analog and digital documents. Bondarenko and Janssen provide an
                        overview of what we can learn from paper to improve digital documents <ptr
                            target="#bodarenko2005"/>, specifically important to this framework is
                        their distinction between the affordances of paper versus digital texts in
                        terms of task management. Supporting active reading using hybrid interfaces
                        has been addressed by Hong et al. <ptr target="#hong2012"/>, and Shilit et
                        al. report methods for supporting active reading with freeform digital ink
                        annotations <ptr target="#schilit1998"/>, we leveraged these findings as we
                        designed and built our prototype. More recently, Metatation was presented as
                        a pen-based project that supports close reading annotation work on physical
                        paper with a digital interface <ptr target="#mehta2017"/> and concluded that
                        pen-based annotations were necessary for the workflow of literary critics.
                        The difference between active and close reading is small but important.
                        Active reading is often discussed as a way to engage in cognitive offloading
                        i.e. note taking, while close reading is a task that is specific to literary
                        criticism where critics use analysis techniques to decipher meanings within
                        a text. We developed the Textension framework to be robust enough to allow
                        for both activities.</p>
                    <p>Pen-based systems that cross between physical and digital interfaces have
                        also been explored by Weibel et al. <ptr target="#weibel2012"/>, and with
                        the introduction of gestures in RichReview <ptr target="#yoon2014"/>.
                        Gesture-based interactions have also been addressed in Papiercraft, a system
                        which enables gesture-based commands on interactive paper <ptr
                            target="#liao2008"/>, Pacer, a method for interacting with live images

                    <p>Paper-augmented digital documents merge physical annotations on paper with a
                        digital representation <ptr target="#giumbretiere2003"/>. Paper and digital
                        media have also been used together to support co-located group meetings <ptr
                            target="#haller2010"/>. Work has also been done on applying paper
                        affordances to digital workspaces such as page flipping and annotations in
                        e-readers <ptr target="#hinckley2012"/>. The Paper Windows project <ptr
                            target="#holman2005"/> projected digital environments onto physical
                        paper allowing for the affordances of both. The TextTearing tool <ptr
                            target="#yoon2013"/> was the inspiration for how we create space in
                        digital documents from analog texts. In our framework, this is done
                        automatically from a picture of an analog text taken in situ with a
                        smartphone or tablet and not simply from an electronic version of the
                        document.</p>

                    <p>Our tool uses several computer vision techniques to aid in the OCR from the
                        camera of a mobile device. The following papers all describe techniques that
                        helped us to consider the problems and solutions of in-the-wild document
                        digitization. Digitizing historical documents is a difficult prospect and
                        the binarization and filtering techniques presented in da Silvaâ€™s work <ptr
                            target="#dasilva2006"/> provided guidance on working with older texts as
                        would be often found in a humanities setting. Also, Gupta discusses OCR
                        binarization and preprocessing specifically for historical documents <ptr
                            target="#gupta2007"/>. Much work has been done on document capture using
                        digital cameras including background removal <ptr target="#dasilva2013"/>,
                        document image analysis <ptr target="#doermann2003"/>, and marginal noise
                        removal <ptr target="#fan2001"/>. Liang et al. provided a useful survey of
                        camera-based analysis of text and documents <ptr target="#liang2005"/>.
                        Commercial applications such as the WordLens (now part of Google Translate)
                        also integrate text processing and analysis <ptr target="#wordlens2010"/>.
                        WordLens provides real-time translation of text detected through the mobile
                        camera, creating an augmented reality environment. We build on this concept
                        by matching the vision technology with information visualization and natural
                        language processing tools to enhance document images with rich and
                        task-specific augmentations.</p>
                    <p>Post-processing for text documents tends to be idiosyncratic to the documents
                        themselves. For example, a document with a completely white background may
                        not need to be gamma corrected. We built into our tool the ability to
                        control multiple processing parameters. Influence for this decision came
                        from work such as perspective correction <ptr target="#jagannathan2005"/>,
                        quality assessment and improvement <ptr target="#lins2007"/>, and image
                        segmentation <ptr target="#lu2006"/>. There has also been research on tools
                        for these kinds of post-processing tasks. Specifically, Photodoc is a
                        program to aid in document processing acquired by digital cameras <ptr

                    <p>Text vis is an enormous subsection of information visualization. Rather than
                        a survey of available text visualizations, we have included a list of
                        references that directly affected our work and design decisions. Early text
                        visualizations such as ThemeRiver and TextArc demonstrate novel ways of
                        visualizing text <ptr target="#havre2002"/>
                        <ptr target="#palev2002"/>. Sparklines over tag clouds have been previously
                        presented by Lee et al. <ptr target="#lee2010"/>. Projects such as SeeSoft
                            <ptr target="#eick1992"/>, a text-based tool for visualizing segments of
                        programming code, gave us an insight into how portions of a document could
                        be visualized separately to indicate different workspaces. And TileBars <ptr
                            target="#hearst1995"/> showed ways of visualizing document structure at
                        the sentence level. There has been quite a lot of work visualizing document
                        collections, but for our purposes, two of the most relevant projects were
                        Compus <ptr target="#fekete2000"/> and ThemeRiver <ptr target="#havre2002"
                        />. Compus used XML documents to visualize structure in historical
                        manuscripts and ThemeRiver depicted thematic changes over time in document
                        collections. For larger surveys of related work, we suggest the text
                        visualization survey by Kucher and Kerren <ptr target="#kucher2015"/> and a
                        specific treatment of text analysis in the Digital Humanities by JÃ¤nicke et

                    <p>Perhaps the pioneering work in word-scale visualization was Tufteâ€™s proposal
                        of Sparklines <ptr target="#tufte2004"/>, which are small line charts which
                        reveal trends and work well in small multiples. The different types of
                        possible word-scale visualizations have been explored by Brandes et al. <ptr
                            target="#brandes2013"/>, where they discuss the ideas of Gestalt
                        psychology as it applies to word level visualization. Goffin has explored
                        implementations and effects of word-scale visualizations in depth <ptr
                            target="#goffin2014"/>

                        <ptr target="#goffin2017"/>. These include explorations of the history,
                        design, placement within a text, the interactive possibilities of word-scale
                        visualizations, and their impact on reading behavior. Sparkclouds use
                        word-scale visualizations to show trends as a text visualization <ptr
                            target="#lee2010"/> and Nacenta et al. introduced Fat Fonts, a method

                        itself <ptr target="#nacenta2012"/>. There has also been work on producing

                        <ptr target="#mehta2017"/> have identified five spaces that are interacted
                        with on a digital document: word space, line space, margin space, occlusion
                        space, and canvas space. Mehta discussed word space, line space, and margin
                        space as places of interaction for analog annotation <ptr
                            target="#mehta2017"/> after studying literary critics working on poetry
                        with pen and paper. Goffin et al. use word space and line space as
                        alternatives for the placement of word-scale visualizations <ptr
                            target="#goffin2014"/>. Occlusion space or the space above the document
                        has long been an accepted interaction modality, the most famous incarnation
                        being the everyday tooltip. Goffin et al. use this space to provide enlarged
                        maps on text documents <ptr target="#goffin2014"/>. Canvas space was
                        discussed by Cheema et al. in a paper outlining how to extend documents
                        using external resources such as drag and drop images <ptr
                            target="#cheema2016"/>. While each of these spaces represents a unique
                        portion of a digital document where interactive elements can be placed,
                        Textension is a modular system that allows for these elements to be created
                        interchangeably in all document spaces. Our goal is to demonstrate a
                        framework where analog documents can be turned into interactive objects in a
                        short span of time by using the document spaces appropriately.</p>

                    <p>From the previous work, we have identified five different types of spaces in
                        digital documents that can be augmented: <list type="unordered">
                            <item><hi rend="bold">Word Space</hi>: Space inside the bounding boxes
                                of words, lines, and paragraphs.</item>

                                of the text on the page that makes up white space between the
                                lines.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="bold">Margin Space</hi>: Space that is outside of the
                                text bounding box but within the boundaries of the document
                                itself.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="bold">Occlusion Space</hi>: Any overlay on the document
                                whether permanent or impermanent that covers up the existing text or
                                space.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="bold">Canvas Space</hi>: Space that is created outside
                                of the borders of the original text and can be infinitely
                                expanded.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to note when discussing document spaces as part of a larger
                        framework that they can be used alone or in concert with each other and that
                        sometimes the lines blur between them. For example, the <hi rend="bold"
                            >occlusion space</hi> bounding box of a paragraph includes the <hi
                            rend="bold">line spaces</hi> from that paragraph and the <hi rend="bold"
                            >word spaces</hi> above each word. Despite this stacking, it would be
                        possible, for example, to design annotations which are complementary at each
                        level.</p>

                <head>DEFINING DOCUMENT SPACES</head>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Word Space</hi> is any portion of a document that has the printed
                    word on it. The OCR engine we used, Tesseract, can identify and create bounding
                    boxes around both printed and hand-written words, lines, and paragraphs.
                    Depending on the specific implementation, word space could be considered any or
                    all of these. In an analog book the actual printed type is an element that can
                    be interacted with cognitively, but as we move into digital representations of
                    that text it allows us to alter and query the text in interesting ways. The
                    possibilities here are great, with one of the motivations being simply on-demand
                    OCR. But when the text is digitized it opens up possibilities for text analysis,
                    computational linguistics, and machine learning based on language. Marshall et
                    al. reference both highlighting and annotation as a way that this space is
                    interacted with on paper documents <ptr target="#marshall1997"/>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Line space</hi> is any space that exists between existing printed
                    lines but remains inside the bounding box of the entire block of printed text on
                    the page. Digitizing documents using our framework allows for on-demand opening
                    and closing of these spaces. The manipulation of line space can create room for
                    additional elements, such as ink annotations, inserted figures, and data
                    visualizations that relate to the text. We synthesize the background of the
                    document to avoid jarring the reader, and once this is done effectively any
                    amount of space can be added to the document. Previous studies have found that
                    this space is most often used for annotation, specifically in-line notes and for
                    connectors such as arrows between words.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Margin space</hi> is any area outside of the bounding box of the
                    text but still within the bounds of the original document. This is the space
                    commonly used for free-form note-taking. For example, when studying, editing, or
                    conducting a close reading of a document <ptr target="#mehta2017"/>. In addition
                    to free-form note-taking, this space can be used for inserting new elements
                    related to the text automatically, such as grammar trees, maps, or simply any
                    placement of third-party or generated images.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Occlusion space</hi> is a layer that covers the document.
                    Additions in the occlusion space can obscure the text, so semi-transparent and
                    impermanent elements are appropriate to maintain document legibility. In an
                    analog setting, the occlusion space is often used with physical additions such
                    as sticky notes. This space can be accessed in multiple ways, but the underlying
                    function of the space tends to be information that is needed in the moment, but
                    not on a continual basis. We demonstrate how to interact with this space by
                    using tool tips that show the definitions of words on demand. Most of the
                    techniques we demonstrate in this paper could be taken from one of the other
                    spaces and placed into occlusion space, the question of permanence or
                    impermanence will be a decision that rests with the designer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Canvas space</hi> is a concept that we could loosely attribute to
                    the desk that a printed book is placed on or the space outside a page of text
                    taped on a whiteboard. When we move to a digital representation of the book, the
                    canvas space could be infinitely expandable allowing for the insertion of larger
                    interactive elements. We have chosen to demonstrate how linguistic analysis
                    could lead to automatic insertion of images, figures, and tables within the
                    canvas space. It is important to note that external images could also be
                    inserted in this space as Cheema et al. propose in AnnotateVis <ptr

                    <head>Framework Architecture</head>
                    <p>For this project, we imagined a tool that scholars of the humanities could
                        use to do their required work on printed manuscripts, edited collections,
                        and books, while still having access to digital affordances. Imagine the
                        scenario where a literary scholar is in a rare book archive and cannot write
                        directly on the document, or a scenario where a humanist is interested in
                        the linguistic statistics of a text, but lacks the training to execute the
                        digitization and processing of a text using code. The latter is one of the
                        main problems that is ever present within the emerging field of digital
                        humanities, the roadblock of technical knowledge needed to produce tools. We
                        set out to build an extensible framework that would allow a humanities
                        scholar with limited technical knowledge the ability to process, augment,
                        and export digital versions of analog texts. To achieve this, we bring
                        together multiple technologies including OCR, machine translation, and
                        information visualization. By enumerating the set of spaces that can be used
                        for these techniques and demonstrating their possibilities with examples, we
                        hope to inspire users to add their own document augmentations to our
                        existing framework.</p>

                    <p>The Textension framework starts with a document image, processes the image to
                        discern both the content as well as the use of space on the page, adds space
                        to the page as needed, and creates augmentations, both static and
                        interactive, to insert into the newly digital object. The resulting
                        processed image is presented to the user for further exploration,
                        annotation, and interaction. The framework architecture is illustrated in

                        which offers a selection of document augmentations and interactive tools,

                        <p>When a user comes to the opening screen of Textension they are presented
                            with two input options. They can either use the camera that is built
                            into their device (webcam, phone camera, front facing tablet camera) and
                            take a snapshot of the document they wish to process, or they can upload
                            an image file that has been previously prepared. Document images can be
                            single or multiple pages and are uploaded with a drag and drop
                            interface. The next stage of document processing begins immediately
                            after the upload completes. The system uses image processing from the
                            Python Image Library and image manipulation from OpenCV. We have found
                            that a combination of binarization, grey-scaling, and image sharpening
                            have had a noticeable effect on the results of the OCR, which is the
                            next stage of processing.</p>

                        <p>We used the open source Tesseract OCR engine in the Textension prototype.
                            Smith provides an overview and a history of the development of the
                            engine <ptr target="#smith2007"/>
                            <ptr target="#smith2013"/>, and Patel et al. provide a case study
                            approach for its use <ptr target="#patel2012"/>. Tesseract can be
                            trained with many different languages and also with handwriting, making
                            it a robust choice for an implementation such as this.</p>
                        <p>While great effort is being taken by many companies to digitize the
                            worldâ€™s books, this process is expensive, hardware dependent, and
                            time-consuming. The Tesseract OCR engine provides high-quality open
                            source OCR in a local setting for printed and hand-written text. Often
                            when working between analog and digital platforms scholars are forced to
                            type passages out, for example, to extract a quote from a book for
                            insertion into a manuscript. This is due to the fact that many digital
                            book readers do not give you access to text that can be copy and pasted
                            for copyright reasons, or in some cases, only images of paper documents
                            are provided. Our domain expert has been using Textension to quickly
                            digitize small portions of text for inclusion into working documents.
                            This application of Textension allows for easy transfer of quotable
                            information from analog books to digital platforms using only the OCR
                            functionality. In addition, the OCR engine provides the content in a
                            machine-readable form for later linguistic processing, linking, and
                            other augmentations. Tesseract also provides bounding boxes for each
                            word, which we use to identify document spaces.</p>

                        <head>Background Synthesis</head>
                        <p>In order to augment documents with helpful annotations, or to provide
                            space for users to make pen-based annotations, document spaces often
                            need to be enlarged. This is not possible when working with an analog
                            document. However, in the digital version, we can manipulate the image
                            to provide the needed space. For example, to place a translation of text
                            between lines, the inter-line spacing first needs to be increased.
                            Document backgrounds can be complicated, with changing lighting
                            conditions almost guaranteed using mobile phone and tablet cameras. To
                            retain the original look of the document image, we created a method for
                            inserting space by synthesizing sections of the document background
                            which seamlessly integrate with the original. These regions can be
                            optionally clearly noted, for example by using a different color. This
                            may be preferable in situations where differentiating the original
                            document from manipulations is important, for example in archival and
                            preservation work. Background pre-processing is a computationally
                            intensive process, so an option for low or high-resolution processing is
                            included. Low-resolution processing is suitable for quick interactive
                            applications, where high-resolution processing is more suitable for
                            printing and saving the results of an analysis session.</p>

                        <p>To improve image capture quality, which can affect background synthesis,
                            we provide the user with a frame to set their image in. While it is
                            possible to adjust skew correction and automatically crop text from
                            images, we found from our internal testing that forcing the user to
                            frame the image themselves resulted in much better OCR and therefore a
                            much better experience. There is precedence for this type of interaction
                            in commercial settings such as remote cheque deposits for online
                            banking, where a user is forced to frame and focus the cheque before the
                            system will accept the image. Once we have the image we use the bounding
                            boxes provided by the OCR engine to rebuild the document in image
                            fragments within the web platform. Each space and word is modeled
                            separately to allow us to manipulate those elements within the
                            browser.</p>
                        <p>The important image regions for the space insertion algorithm are
                            illustrated in <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>. To expand the
                            space between the lines (expand <hi rend="bold">line space</hi>) in
                            high-resolution mode we first use Hough line detection to identify
                            x-values where vertical lines exist on the page <ptr target="#duda1972"
                            />. The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique to find
                            instances of objects within a certain class of shapes (vertical lines in
                            our application) by a voting procedure. This allows us to maintain the
                            edges of pages and also to recreate lighting conditions near the bound
                            edges as we expand space within the document.</p>
                        <p>The algorithm then copies a slice of the image from between each
                            individual line from one edge of the page to the other. The height of
                            the slice (the <code>pixel cut height</code> ) is set to the height of
                            the unimpeded space between the bounding boxes of the lines of text
                            above and below. For the low-resolution processing, copies of this slice
                            are inserted vertically to create space in the document. Depending on
                            the complexity of the background this process is sometimes adequate.
                            However, in most cases, this results in image streaking, which is usable
                            for testing and exploration, but can be distracting and is not
                            sufficient for photo realistic background additions.</p>
                        <p>As local lighting and color effects are so prevalent in scanned and
                            photographed documents, especially historical documents, we wanted to
                            model the backgrounds from as local a position as possible. The
                            intuition behind our approach is that we can randomly reorder pixels in
                            a local region to reduce streaking while retaining local lighting. From
                            the extracted slice of the document, we select a patch of the original
                            image that has the dimensions of <code>pixel cut height</code> by
                                <code>pixel cut width</code>. To insert a new patch below it we
                            simply randomize the pixels from the current patch and insert it. As we
                            scan across the line we continue this in increments of <code>pixel cut
                                width</code> until the line is complete. The one exception is when
                            the patch location falls within a definable threshold of the x-values of
                            the vertical lines found by the Hough line algorithm at the start of the
                            process. In this case, the pixels in that patch are not randomized but
                            rather copied, to retain the sharpness of the detected edge. This allows
                            us to sample local lighting effects in the background of the image. For
                            adding horizontal space between words a similar process is used. When
                            space is added only between two words on a single line, we also add the
                            same amount of space to all lines by distributing it across all
                            inter-word spaces. This preserves the original justification of the
                            document (see <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>).</p>
                        <p>The <code>pixel cut height</code> and <code>pixel cut width</code>
                            parameters control the locality of the modeling. Reasonable defaults are
                            provided, but they can be varied in the settings screen to obtain the
                            best result.</p>
                        <p>We have also found that artifacts on the page disrupt the color balance
                            within each individual cut and can affect the quality of the background
                            rendering. We offer the option of removing artifacts on the input
                            screen. To remove blemishes on the page, the cropped line is binarized,
                            any pixels that turn black in the binarization process are not used
                            within the color randomization that synthesizes the background color.
                            This leaves the original artifact but does not propagate it during the
                            space insertion process.</p>
                        <p>Background synthesis and artifact removal are pre-processed across all
                            candidate regions of the document to a pre-set threshold of inserted
                            space. The synthesized image data is stored for quick access and
                            insertion during document augmentation and interaction.</p>

                <p>After creating an interactive, expandable document from the captured image,
                    augmentations can be added to provide supportive features as required for the
                    specific task and context. For example, a learner may require word definitions,
                    while a literary scholar may be interested in the contemporary use of the words
                    in the document. Augmentations can take the form of inserted glyphs, images,
                    overlays, and annotations in the document spaces, or they may replace or change
                    the words in the document. Augmentations can be temporary or permanent, as
                    appropriate for their purpose and the document space in which they appear. The
                    insertion and placement of augmentations and the provision of interactivity on
                    the document and its augmentations is provided by the layout engine (see <ref
                        target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>).</p>
                <p>The images after upload are broken into individual word and space objects that
                    are then recompiled in order onto an HTML canvas to reproduce the original image
                    with the added flexibility of moving, inserting, and changing elements.
                    Augmentations are placed on the canvas as a layer on top of the image objects.
                    Textension has been developed to support the creation of new augmentations,
                    which can draw on custom data processing, local datasets, or public APIs and
                    data. Textension was built using flask, a python server back-end; bootstrap, for
                    UI elements; jinja, a template engine for python; and jquery, for data
                    handling.</p>

                <head>DOCUMENT AUGMENTATIONS</head>
                <p>What we present in this section are a series of concrete implementations of
                    document augmentations that demonstrate a subset of the possibilities of the
                    Textension framework. The selected examples highlight the possible breadth
                    available when considering the five document spaces and the possibilities for
                    interaction with those spaces. We explore insertion augmentations, as well as
                    temporary and permanent overlays. The availability of the plain text allows easy
                    integration of natural language processing, and the fact that the digital
                    document is built in pieces allows for easy insertion of space to accommodate
                    for the adding of new features. In this way, we envision Textension as both a
                    sandbox for designing interactive elements for digital documents and a way to
                    use both digital and analog affordances simultaneously when working with texts. </p>

                    <p>To allow for interaction with books off the shelf we wanted to cross over
                        between digital and analog affordances. The ability to write notes directly
                        on the pages of a book is one of the analog affordances that is constantly
                        used, much to the dismay of librarians throughout the world. As seen in
                        studies by Marshall <ptr target="#marshall1997"/> and Mehta <ptr
                            target="#mehta2017"/>, there are workflows that depend on this type of
                        interaction. Due to space constraints on the printed page, these annotations
                        often take the form of writing in the margins of the text or squeezing into
                        the spaces between the printed lines. For the digital version of the text,
                        we wanted to enhance the ability to write on the page in both the <hi
                            rend="bold">line space</hi> and the <hi rend="bold">margin space</hi>.
                        The pre-processed background is used to insert space within the text, to
                        allow for writing notes or inserting elements such as maps.</p>
                    <p>There are two ways to insert space in Textension. The first is to simply tap
                        and hold on a line with the stylus, or click with a mouse and that line will
                        open up allowing space for writing. This works both vertically and
                        horizontally; the trigger for vertical line creation is in the space between
                        lines and for the horizontal space insertion it is in the space between
                        words (see <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>). The size of the space to
                        be added is determined in the parameter settings for the tool. By default,
                        we have set the opening increment at 20 pixels. Inserted space is both
                        editable as a text box by clicking on it, or by toggling the draw mode space
                        can be written in any way the user chooses (see <ref target="#figure06"
                            >Figure 6</ref>). The second method is to open all spaces of a given
                        type (e.g. line spaces) through a menu function. Spaces can also be inserted
                        by other augmentations which require space. For example, inserting space is
                        a precursor to inserting translations between lines. Together, these methods
                        allow for flexible interaction that can be used for editing and
                        annotation.</p>

                    <p>Once space has been opened up we wanted to maintain the ability to type and
                        write on the document. Both functions have a toggle and a color picker that
                        allows for this type of interactivity. You can draw anywhere on the
                        document, but typing has been constrained to text boxes that have been
                        created in the new space of the document (see <ref target="#figure06">Figure

                        Textension provides a feature where users can see an overlay of how
                        uncertain the OCR algorithm was for each word. This augmentation is
                        displayed as an overlay in the <hi rend="bold">word space</hi>. The darker
                        the color the less confident the score. This mapping was designed to draw
                        attention to and <soCalled>obscure</soCalled> those words that the system
                        had difficulty recognizing. With the current trend in machine learning and
                        the relative anxiety that is brought with black box algorithms, showing the
                        inner workings of the OCR engine is a way to both help the user understand
                        how the system is working but also where exactly work may need to be done to
                        make for a better user experience and digital document (see <ref

                    <p>While the OCR confidence overlay can allow users to understand how well their
                        scan has been processed, we added another feature that works in concert with
                        the previous ones to place text within the <hi rend="bold">line space</hi>.
                        The OCR text feature will spread all the lines in the document and insert
                        the OCR text into editable text boxes (see <ref target="#figure07">Figure
                            7</ref>). The user can then correct the OCR directly on the newly built
                        document and export the finished text into a text file. Our own projectâ€™s
                        domain expert is already using this feature to solve the problem of not
                        being able to cut and paste from digital books while writing Humanities
                        essays. He has been taking pictures of quotations from physical copies of
                        the books and exporting the OCR directly into a word processor.</p>

                            space</hi> (see <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>). This method
                        works for all of the languages currently supported by Google and its one
                        limitation is typographical, in that books often split words on the end of
                        lines. Future work will address this limitation.</p>

                        pre-processing, we detect and store place names within the text. When the
                        map feature is toggled Textension highlights the place name in the document,

                        the user is given two time sliders, one for the upper and one for the lower
                        bounds of the time in question and small bar charts are automatically
                        inserted for each word in the document. Each chart is a relative
                        representation of the wordâ€™s uniqueness within the given document, meaning
                        that as the upper and lower bounds time sliders are adjusted, each glyph
                        will adjust relative to the other. This type of interaction could be
                        adjusted to address specific historical questions from literary scholars and
                        could be extended to display anything that has data relating to the text.
                        Possible scenarios for this include showing etymological information, usage
                        information, or using color as a visual variable to display languages of

                        high-resolution images of the current state within the program. The user has
                        the option to export whatever document state that they create. Many features
                        of Textension can be used at the same time so it is possible to create and
                        export multiple variations of a single document.</p>

                <head>CONCLUSION</head>
                <p>The tension that exists between our analog pasts and our digital present can be
                    addressed using our framework. Our prototype, Textension, leverages the power of
                    OCR and digitally manipulates the five document spaces in near real-time. The
                    system we present is an implementation of previous studies brought together in a
                    way that can be extended easily for domain-specific analysis tasks. The
                    web-based platform allows for easy integration with mobile technology and makes
                    it possible to use Textension in a variety of locations and scenarios. We have
                    demonstrated a breadth of possible use cases and have chosen widgets that
                    demonstrate the utility of each of the document spaces.</p>

                    <head>Discussion</head>
                    <p>Textension can be used in situations where quick digitization is necessary
                        and digital versions may not be available, such as within the stacks of a
                        university library. The web-based framework allows for easy document
                        digitization using any web-enabled camera. This could be on a mobile phone
                        or a desktop computer with a webcam. The system also allows for the
                        uploading of previous digitized texts. The drag and drop interface allows
                        for the uploading of PDFâ€™s and digital images providing a robustness of
                        input possibilities. The provided text augmentations support humanities
                        activities such as annotation and close reading. By bringing in linked
                        reference resources such as maps and lexical uniqueness scores, Textension
                        can situate an unknown text in the greater spatial and linguistic context,

                    <head>Future Work</head>
                    <p>While we designed Textension to demonstrate the usefulness and power of
                        bringing together affordances from paper and digital documents, there are
                        still several ways that we can expand the system. The first is by using
                        larger canvases. Textension focuses on space within documents and provides a
                        limited extended canvas space. An infinite canvas workspace, such as the
                        zoomable interface of PAD++ <ptr target="#bederson1994"/>, could allow for
                        insertion of more than one document image in the same workspace, and the
                        addition of larger and more sophisticated interactive visualizations.</p>
                    <p>The second addition that we envision is to apply these techniques in the
                        opposite direction, namely to augment digital books with the same types of
                        interactive elements. We have already seen some of these approaches within
                        existing e-readers like Amazonâ€™s Kindle, but there is a lot of room to
                        experiment with that design space. Another welcome addition would be
                        horizontal space organization to solve problems like line breaks when using
                        the Google Translate API. Because the OCR uses lines as an organizing
                        principle, hyphenated words often disrupt the OCR and the translation
                        algorithm. Reconnecting hyphenated words would require reflowing the
                        document to maintain a justified layout.</p>
                    <p>A final addition that would solve a problem in the digital humanities is to
                        provide a way to easily create new augmentations for Textension so that
                        users with limited programming abilities would be able to add features to
                        the interface. The current implementation makes it easy to add new features
                        with modest programming skills, but we would like to make that more
                        accessible in the future.</p>
