                <p> Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it is, in
                    fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction facilitates knowledge
                    creation in conversation with and between sources, bringing together disparate
                    times and places, authors and forms of source material, frames of reference and
                    layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as central focus to
                    create the conditions for serendipitous discovery. This <soCalled>loose
                        hold</soCalled> on focus results in a knowledgescape with a substantial
                    tacit dimension, with the result that humanists most certainly know more than we
                    can tell. This is not to say that the epistemic process of the humanist is all
                    encompassing, however: administrative work, for example, is viewed as a
                        <soCalled>true</soCalled> distraction, and managed accordingly. </p>
                <p>In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and organise
                    the process of extracting information from the reading of sources (be they text,
                    image, landscape or indeed even the self), the notetaking process of the
                    humanist remains stubbornly multimodal, harnessing embodied, material, and
                    spatial dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge environments humanists
                    create around themselves resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a
                    Prezi stack, a physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard
                    stream of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholar’s
                    understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex, sometimes
                    tenuous, and largely undiscovered.</p>
                <p>This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this understanding
                    of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future paths for using
                    technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction, including: Technology as
                    blurring the line between the personal and the professional, not so much as a
                    labour practice, but as an epistemic one opening the way to the validation of
                        <soCalled>epistemic emotions</soCalled> as a valid research input, but also
                    to the more effective convergence of humanities research with other inputs to
                    the identity formation process of seemingly distracted undergraduates; and
                    research infrastructural implications for libraries (where remote storage and
                    electronic catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by
                    reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded upon a
                    new understanding of what the ideal humanistic work environment might be and how
                    to get <soCalled>below the level</soCalled> of that work.</p>

                <p>The mental images evoked by the description of someone engaged in the act of
                        <q>reading</q> are generally ones of focus, stasis and concentration.
                    Portraits of readers from the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and 19<hi
                        rend="superscript">th</hi> centuries have perhaps contributed to this bias,
                    depicting, as they so often do, a figure (very often female) gazing downward at
                    her book, unaware of the spectatorial gaze, her head perhaps resting
                    unconsciously on her hand. Reading a good book is one of the canonically cited
                    means by which to access the psychological state for which psychologist Mihaly
                    Csíkszentmihályi coined the term <q>flow,</q> but the flow that we see in our
                    mind’s eye is a strangely static one, an invisible beam of pure attention
                    connecting the ideas of the author and the mind of the reader that is so
                    powerful, that the reader’s body is negated by the purity and undeniability of
                    her focus. </p>
                <p>This perhaps clichéed image of the reader may be real, may be anchronistic, or
                    may indeed have always been driven by urges quite outside of the social
                    understanding of reading. What is clear, however, is that they depict a
                    particular mode of reading, one designed for pleasure, focussed on escape and on
                    passive abandon to the author’s intentions. In his 2008 essay, <title
                        rend="quotes">How Scholars Read,</title> John Guillory defines a difference
                    between such reading for pleasure and scholarly reading, which he describes in
                    some detail as quite a different process all together. Though he plays
                    throughout the essay with a number of possible characterisations that partially
                    define the differences between lay and scholarly reading (extensive versus
                    intensive modalities, close or interpretive reading, browsing and scanning,
                    skimming etc.), in the end the essence of the work of the scholar is found in
                    not the inhabitation of one intensive mode of reading, but of precisely the
                    ability to move between multiple very different modes: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#guillory2008">The technique of scanning can be
                            organized, alert to keywords, names, dates, or other features of a text.
                            This technique is a form of attention, even heightened attention,
                            although the scholarly reader might ignore the continuous meaning of a
                            text, deferring comprehension until some textual signal brings the
                            scanning process to a temporary halt and initiates a more intensive
                            reading. … At some point reading must be decelerated for the purpose of
                            a more analytic reading, which aims to correct distortions produced by
                            scanning.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#guillory2008" loc="13"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>This process of accelerating the reading process by scanning, only to decelerate
                    at the call of a textual signal so as to read intensively, is a response to what
                    Guillory elsewhere in the essay refers to as the <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#guillory2008">clock time of scholarly reading.</quote> This
                    imperative, to absorb more text in the course of a project or career than could
                    be reasonably expected of intensive lay reading strategies, drives the scholar’s
                    need to fast-forward some passages, and savour others in slow motion, and to
                    adopt alternating states of intensity, and of scanning, a process that removes
                    details and yet represents not only attention, but a <soCalled>heightened
                        state</soCalled> of attention. It would be tempting to view the alternating
                    currents of scholarly reading as representing a weakness, rather than a
                    strength. If a scholar had infinite time, would she not read everything
                    intensively, absorb every nuance, and be empowered to reflect every possible
                    argument relative to or interpretation stemming from a particular text? We know
                    instinctively that this is neither possible nor ideal, in part because of the
                    nature of the humanistic instrument of scholarship (to be discussed below) and
                    in part because of the work of scholars that point us toward the strengths of
                    this very attentive yet selective method, such as Franco Moretti, who says: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#moretti2000">Distant reading: where distance,
                            let me repeat it, is a condition of knowledge: it allows you to focus on
                            units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices,
                            themes, tropes — or genres and systems. And if, between the very small
                            and the very large, the text itself disappears, well, it is one of those
                            cases when one can justifiably say, Less is more.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#moretti2000"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>Moretti privileges certain kinds of theoretical questions as meeting the
                    requirement of distance, and certainly the example he explores in the article
                    quoted above (nothing less than the problem of world literature) is adequately
                    vast. But every perspective requires some distance, every object of scholarship
                    exists within a frame. Scholarly reading as Guillory describes it is therefore
                    not only an admission of defeat in the face of a deluge of scholarly writing, it
                    is also a framing mechanism for scholarly work in a field that privileges the
                    operational mode of the hunter-gatherer, rather than the agricultural
                    consolidation of activity into a limited space. Humanists accept their sources
                    as they find them, with all of their messy embeddedness and resonances born of
                    their provenance as the creations of human beings and their cultures. The
                    controlled experiments and clean environments of the physics lab do not reflect
                    this experience of reading as a human through the artefacts of human creation.
                    Following this logic, to be attentive in the context of the study of the
                    humanities is to be, paradoxically, distracted, focussing not merely on a
                    central figure, but both the figure and the landscape that surrounds it. </p>
                <p>The dichotomy hereby established between the <soCalled>clean</soCalled>
                    conditions required for the study of physics and the <soCalled>mess</soCalled>
                    of the humanities should not be taken too far, however. The argument that
                    follows should not be read purely as an exercise in valorising terms normally
                    weighted negatively in the face of their more acceptable opposites, nor of
                    proving definitively that the sciences and humanities are essentially different.
                    Discourse, both public and scientific, about research practices suffers too much
                    from such overly simplified, oppositional positioning between different
                    methodologies and disciplines. What I do propose to do, however, is to
                    contribute to the much needed body of reflection about humanities research
                    methods by challenging the valence positioning of some of the key terms that
                    might be applied to them. Central among these oppositional terms is that of
                    distraction versus focus. Humanities scholarship has always held within it the
                    capacity to not only manage, but make productive use of distraction in the way
                    its practitioners find and integrate information. This input process maps to
                    what we might also call reading. Hence it is the distracted reading of the
                    humanities scholars that shapes the way we build our instruments of scholarship,
                    the way we privilege knowledge interactions we deem serendipitous or
                    environments we may ourselves deem chaotic, how we organise information in space
                    and time, what we deem allowable in the frame of constructing scholarship. It
                    also mediates how humanities scholars adopt and use technology. </p>
                <p>The analysis that follows will unpack some of these statements and defend the
                    notion that scholarly reading is not only based on the process of accelerating
                    and decelerating through discrete texts, but through an entire world of signal
                    and noise. Reading, according to this model, does not adhere in the least to the
                    image of immobile reader locked in to the limited space between her face and her
                    book, but is instead a kinetic, embodied, multimodal series of interactions,
                    engaging not only the centre of focus, but the peripheral vision as well. It is
                    a place not of happy accidents, but of prepared minds, where the reading process
                    is not based on an <quote rend="inline" source="#pöppel">abuse of the
                        brain</quote> (as per the quote from Ernest Pöppel that stands at the start
                    of this article) but a harnessing of almost primal human urges to seek, to
                    gather, to organise and to narrativise. </p>
                <p>The conclusions that follow are based upon the results of a modest but revealing
                    ethnographic study, conducted in 2015, and known as <title rend="quotes"
                        >Scholarly Primitives and Reimagining Knowledge Led Exchanges</title>, or
                    SPARKLE <ptr target="#edmond2017"/>. This investigation was inspired by a
                    digital humanist’s frustration: having built a tool addressing an identified
                    need of a humanities community (in this case historians with highly
                    heterogenous, dare we say disorganised, research notes), the project team was
                    somewhat surprised to find that while the result met the specifications of the
                    user community and <soCalled>solved</soCalled> the identified
                        <soCalled>problem,</soCalled> the target community of historians did not
                    love it, and reverted quickly to their messy analogue ways. Why? The answer, as
                    demonstrated by the eight hours of interviews of a range of historians (medieval
                    and modern, archaeologists, as well as literary and art historians) conducted by
                    the ensuing project, was that the mess and chaos was an inherent part of the
                    scholarly methods, it was a source of strength rather than weakness. The signal,
                    in other words, was inextricably bound up with the noise, and it was precisely
                    the capacity to be distracted that these rich environments facilitated that was
                    key to productive reading experiences. </p>
                <p>Noise is, of course, not a phenomenon specific to the humanities. Indeed, an
                    appreciation of noise, in the form of a paradigm-changing
                        <soCalled>novelty</soCalled> or indeed <soCalled>crisis,</soCalled> can be
                    said to be at the heart of fundamental work such as Thomas Kuhn’s <title
                        rend="italic">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</title>. In that case,
                    however, noise is a disruptor indicating a change in signal, rather than a
                    component of the context that suffuses it. Distraction in humanistic reading is
                    therefore the process by which a scholar manages to create knowledge in
                    conversation with and between sources, bringing together, disparate times and
                    places, authors and forms of source material, but also frames of reference and
                    layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as focus to find the
                    moments of serendipity that lie at the core of so many humanists’ methods. </p>

                <head>Designing for Distraction</head>
                <p>The knowledge environments humanists create around themselves to facilitate the
                    pipeline from reading to writing are like mixed media realisations of a Prezi
                    stack, except that the relationships between objects and places reflect a
                    layered set of interconnections, simultaneously reflecting the places where an
                    individual keeps certain sorts of things and the path by which those things came
                    to enter the system. </p>
                <p>The scholar’s desk is often a messy place, a reification of the fragmented,
                    capricious, haphazard system of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and
                    for alignment like with its <soCalled>brothers in meaning.</soCalled> A
                    recurrent subtheme within the SPARKLE project interviews was that of clutter, a
                    nearly universal topic that was not prompted by the interview protocol in any
                    way. <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">[T]he problem with the desk is
                        that often you have to clear a space on it, whereas the sofa is generally
                        kept clear,</quote> said one interviewee, while another made the very
                    insightful comment that: <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">my desk space
                        tends to be extremely cluttered and messy and not conducive to reading, so …
                        tend to take everything off the table and move it or try and minimise what I
                        am looking at.</quote> The primary reason clutter seems to be such a strong
                    recurrent theme is because of the need to balance focus and attention with the
                    parallel requirement to have certain things – notes, primary or secondary source
                    materials of many types, objects, data, computer environments or tools, or
                    comfort objects such as water, coffee or a lap desk - <quote source="#interview"
                        rend="inline">at hand</quote> or <quote rend="inline" source="#interview"
                        >beside me.</quote> One interviewee even described this arrangement for her
                    as <quote source="#interview" rend="inline">almost like a nest.</quote>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">I tend not to write in … my
                        departmental office which I use more as a teaching and meeting space, even
                        though I have bookshelf space here, but I tend to write in a box room at
                        home where the stuff is very close to my desk, um, it’s not very scientific,
                        there are piles and piles of paper, the paper somehow forms a useful
                        order.</quote></p>
                <p>In some cases, this desire for a particular physical arrangement of space is
                    clearly indicative of a similar process of arranging ideas, building a knowledge
                    organisation system to assist information retrieval and prepare for insight. In
                    some cases, the researchers’ understanding of this system is somewhat ad-hoc and
                    intuitive: <quote source="#interview" rend="inline">I don’t really have [a
                        system], I just flick - I have a good idea of the order when I did
                        something.</quote> In most cases, however, the interviewees were very aware
                    of the underlying structure of their personal information landscape: <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">I break down the reading by all the
                        different topics that I’m interested in… so that when I come back to it ...I
                        have that all stored in logical chunks that will turn into chapters.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>Some of this active management of spaces for research work functions so as to
                    optimise certain kinds of concentration and minimise certain kinds of
                    distraction. Focus is key to constructing a valid argument, but it is also an
                    efficiency concern serving the purpose of managing time constraints. Time
                    pressure was keenly felt by all of the interviewees: <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#interview">…there are so many claims on my time, kind of 200%
                        claims on my time, so how can I start to segment out?</quote> This reflects
                    Guillory’s <soCalled>clock time,</soCalled> but there are specific constraints
                    as well. Often these time constraints arise because of externally limited time,
                    such as the limited hours of an archive or museum, for example, which encourage
                    certain kinds of binge photography and condensed note-taking. </p>
                <p>Indeed, the rise of distraction in the seeking out and assimilation of
                    information may have as much to do with dealing with these kinds of restrictions
                    as with the nature of the loosely bounded questions and objects being pursued.
                    What might be thought the most obvious strategy for maximizing time (by focusing
                    narrowly on one project before moving on to the next) is not one that fits
                    comfortably with the humanities researcher’s modes of work. In fact the
                    researchers, in particular those at the more senior level, consistently referred
                    to the fact that they would work on several projects at the same time. While
                    this was sometimes viewed in the pejorative (<quote rend="inline"
                        source="#interview">…when I was at school my Latin teacher called me a
                            <soCalled>flibberty-jibbet</soCalled> which ...I think I still
                        am,</quote>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">I like to flit around to lots of
                        different things and I try to keep my view broad,</quote>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">I have too many projects on the
                        go</quote>), it was clearly also a strategy to manage the implications of
                    potential blockages in insight, access to sources or sustained time for
                    research, ensuring that a mix of activities was available at any given time to
                    provide a good <soCalled>fit</soCalled> for the kind of environment, attention
                    and other cognitive resources an individual had to devote to their research.
                    Regardless of how they viewed their own management of time and space, the
                    interviewees consistently displayed a highly developed expertise in the
                    decomposition of large tasks into chunks <ptr target="#miller1956"/> or
                    microtasks <ptr target="#cheng2015"/>, common recommendations for enhancing
                    productivity, but also emerging areas of interest for software developers trying
                    to produce environments and tools to support busy lives characterised by
                    information overload and distraction. </p>

                <head>Defining the scholarly instrument of the humanities</head>
                <p>The idea of instrumentation is central to the understanding of any epistemic
                    culture. For the scientific communities in which the term is most familiar, such
                    as the high energy physics and microbiology research teams studied by Karin
                    Knorr Cetina in her landmark ethnography of science, <title rend="italic"
                        >Epistemic Cultures</title>
                    <ptr target="#knorrcetina1999"/>, it takes an external form, either as a device
                    or as a documented procedure. These filters for knowledge creation, made
                    tangible, become a significant contributor to the shared lab capital, and a
                    hallmark of the overall advantage or distinctiveness one lab would have over any
                    other in their ability to produce scientifically relevant results. They also
                    provide a point of focus that can be shared by a team of collaborators, a shared
                    set of readings to define the frame of analysis, or a shared set of actions that
                    can be repeated by different individuals at different times with ostensibly
                    similar results. For the historian, the idea of using any kind of shared or
                    sharable devices or procedures in the knowledge creation process does not
                    resonate with actual practice. Instead, the process of building a scholar’s
                    apparatus is as individual (which is not to say subjective) as it is robust. An
                    appropriate mental image or metaphor for this process is not that of the lens or
                    the dissection manual, but of the dry stone wall, where building blocks of
                    irregular shapes and sizes are laid upon each other to create a matrix through
                    which, depending on its density and maturity, light or air may pass. The
                    materials of which this apparatus is made are acquired largely by reading – of
                    primary and secondary sources, of theoretical material, of foundational texts in
                    other disciplines - but, as anyone who has seen or indeed built a dry stone wall
                    will know, the strength of the construction is not just in the individual
                    stones, but in the way they intersect and lie against each other. The object of
                    reading in to the humanistic apparatus is to create spaces not where the fruits
                    of reading can be kept apart from each other, but precisely where they can
                    interact and influence thinking about each other. A number of distinct reading
                    modes are deployed to achieve this aim.</p>
                <p>The first of these creates the footing or foundation, which is almost inevitably
                    comprised of knowledge of the primary sources, the objects of study. Being
                        <soCalled>source-led</soCalled> was a point of pride for many of the
                    interviewees, and the arguments and research questions were seen by and large to
                    emerge from the direct engagement with the primary objects of study: <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">I don’t really arrive at the argument
                        until the evidence takes me there.</quote> The potential for meandering
                    through a landscape of sources is inherent in this approach, but the researchers
                    also stressed the idea that a single contact with a primary source was never
                    enough to fully comprehend it: <quote source="#interview" rend="inline">you
                        don’t just look at something once ever;</quote>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">reading it five or six times
                        over;</quote>
                    <quote source="#interview" rend="inline">…doing lots of reading, but also by
                        reading it multiple times.</quote> In most cases, this rereading is however
                    also a process with a time component to it: <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#interview"> …it’s no good reading anything once … having read
                        something once you may return to it because at a later point you may find
                        it’ll solve a problem for you, or it will have a suggested
                        connection.</quote> As implied in this quotation, the rereading process as
                    it takes place over time, bringing the same text into different juxtapositions
                    and contexts within the scholar’s instrument, is widely viewed not only as
                    essential but transformative: <quote source="#interview" rend="inline">…that
                        involved kind of going back over some of the older stuff that I’d looked at
                        beforehand as well, oh yes very much changed the kind of thing that I was
                        looking for.</quote></p>
                <p>A further omnipresent <soCalled>course</soCalled> in the wall of the humanistic
                    research instrument is secondary research. Each researcher’s relationship with
                    their peers as it played out in part via the published scholarship of others was
                    subtly different, but each expressed some kind of strategy for striking a
                    balance between making one’s scholarship appropriately robust and spending too
                    much time reading the work of others, another more specific manifestation of
                    Guillory’s <soCalled>clock time of scholarship.</soCalled> The challenges
                    described there were also keenly felt by the SPARKLE interviewees: the thing
                    that <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">has changed most dramatically if
                        you look back 30 years is the volume of secondary literature, it’s just
                        exploding and getting faster and faster and we’re still expected to stay on
                        top of so much of it.</quote> In spite of the challenges, however, secondary
                    literature is a key component in the humanistic instrument: without embedding
                    and contextualising within the community of practice, scholarship feels
                    insubstantial, and indeed even risky. Ensuring that this base is covered is not
                    always possible, however: <quote source="#interview" rend="inline">[recognition
                        of the secondary literature is] what I feel that I would need, but I
                        recognise the flaw in the piece but there’s no way that I could commit to
                        that either, so you know I gave them what I had!</quote>
                </p>
                <p>This simple strategy of managing time by accepting one’s limitations within a
                    certain area of enquiry was not the only one, of course: a different approach
                    described was to focus on particular genres of scholarship (books being more
                    important than articles, for example), or to set a certain representative sample
                    and work within those constraints. The ideal situation, as described, was one of
                    following the trails of connections and references until reaching a point of
                    recursion, however. <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">[you know you are
                        done] when you start just going round in circles… one of the things I like
                        about [conferences] is that every time you stand up in front of people
                        there’s always the opportunity for someone to say <q>ah but you haven’t read
                            X</q>, or you haven’t thought about Y, so that is a really important
                        part of the process to really make sure that you’ve covered all your
                        bases.</quote> In this way, reading (and rereading) secondary material is an
                    exercise in itself, but also a part of the all-important dialogue with the
                    primary sources and the researcher’s growing understanding of them. In the
                    process of going <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">round and round in a
                        few circles and … reevaluating what you already think, reevaluating what
                        other people have suggested,</quote> knowledge of the secondary research
                    provides that key layer of the documented thoughts of others. It helps to test
                    the place of pieces of evidence in an argument, and also to form the overall
                    size and shape of a work, and to contribute to what can often be long periods of
                    semi-active or even inactive gestation (quite often when another project has
                    taken over). </p>
                <p>These strategies for managing the <soCalled>clock time of scholarship,</soCalled>
                    also impacted on the level to which the interviewees felt they could or should
                    engage with disciplines beyond their own, or with theoretical material arising
                    from another discourse, each of which has the capacity to form another layer
                    within the humanistic research instrument. For example, one established
                    researcher confessed about an interdisciplinary project: <quote
                        source="#interview" rend="inline">I knew I had to be able to really try and
                        not master, but at least engage sincerely with their literature. In fact
                        given the reading I’ve done since, I’m amazed that I got away with
                        it!</quote> Although they present a further challenge, informing one’s work
                    through interdisciplinary investigation was also seen as one of the most
                    invigorating ways to extend one’s filter for research questions: <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">…the thing I get a real kick out of would
                        be the things that are off to the side… the different ideas, and it is
                        challenging.</quote> Such interactions create new layers in the scholarly
                    stone wall of independent, but integrated sources and influences from which
                    research questions and eventually scholarly output will flow. </p>
                <p>Sources and scholarship were not the only contributors to this apparatus,
                    however. Certain skills, often focussed quite literally on new ways to read,
                    such as palaeography or languages, were key to specific disciplines or
                    approaches: <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">if you’re an early Irish
                        scholar, those people are much more learned than me, it takes them probably
                        a decade and a half before they can even begin - because they need to learn
                        Hiberno-Latin as well as Old Irish - as well as probably Russian, German,
                        French, maybe some Scandinavian languages … the apprenticeship is very
                        long.</quote> The mastery of such fundamentals can be a key differentiator
                    between scholars, and will drive the definition of research questions over the
                    course of a career, as new skills open up access to new source material. They
                    also open up interesting questions about the plasticity of the mind of the
                    humanities researcher, shifting frames not only between different kinds of
                    sources, but code switching as well between distinct semiotic systems.</p>
                <p>Beyond this, however, external factors such as political imperatives or funding
                    priorities can also create layers that highlight attention to certain seams of
                    evidence, or encourage connections to be drawn between things that might
                    otherwise seem disparate. Across society, we can see that the personal and
                    professional spheres are collapsing in a negative way, due to the pervasive
                    influence of technology and its application as a tool for controlling (and
                    extending) labour. But the personal experiences of the scholar form a powerful
                    layer in the epistemic apparatus, and always have. This is what one interviewee
                    called <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">those itches you want to keep

                    research projects is however a largely taboo subject, being viewed as
                    compromising the <soCalled>objectivity</soCalled> of science. Such urges can
                    also be seen differently, however, as what anthropologist Thomas Stodulka
                    characterises as a layer of the epistemic apparatus that is essential to
                    analysis, but often discounted as a distraction from objectivity: the emotional. <cit>

                    the context and framing of the research is most surely derived from the
                    observation of internal phenomena as well as external ones. Even when distanced
                    from their <soCalled>research protagonists</soCalled> by barriers of time, space
                    and culture, historians seek to engage their own experiences to build. They

                    research provides for some of the most enduring fascination and utility of the
                    resulting research: <quote source="#interview" rend="inline">…every historian
                        writes from their own context and how we see history from one generation is
                        going to be completely different … you read … the research done in the 50s
                        and 60s and it comes with a completely different set of assumptions about
                        what’s right and what’s normal and what your basic default assumption about
                        who you are and what history is for, that tells us something about why we
                        tell and retell history. It's also how we explain us to ourselves as well
                        which makes it a really interesting conversation to be part of, ‘cause human

                <p>These many layers of the humanist’s instrument combine to create both a scaffold
                    and a filter for the identification of research questions and the development of
                    responses to them. The SPARKLE interviewees were able to describe the process of
                    creating and using these interconnections through reading and rereading very
                    vividly, often providing extensive narratives detailing the development of key
                    elements of their argument: how influences from other areas of study became
                    integrated with and understanding their own area of focus, or how a similar
                    methodology was applied to a different corpus; how they work through the
                    connections between both the evidence they want to present and wider
                    disciplinary trends; how they traverse within and between the layers of their
                    apparatus, knitting together notes and texts, primary and secondary sources,
                    theoretical and methodological insights, extradisciplinary material, hard won
                    archival gems and chance comments from friends and colleagues, gradually
                    resolving any doubts about the reliability of connections and conclusions. The
                    application of this method is about balancing the context in which a piece of
                    information is being situated, and the precise nature of the evidence itself,
                    moving as well between initial reading, and the creation of prosthetics to
                    prompt and promote future reading (note-taking, filing or organizing, condensing
                    information) and preparing for the next foray to gather material (following
                    footnote trails, testing resonances) all along the expected and the unexpected
                    pathways through the evidence, which may be dense and extensive or consist only
                    of fragments. <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">In most cases the
                        evidence is quite fragmented and you need to compile your evidence across a
                        number of archives, plus literary works, plus narrative sources, chronicles
                        and so on, so you’re building a picture.</quote> This fragmentation, like
                    gaps in the wall, is a challenge to the epistemic authority of the scholar, but
                    it should not be allowed to become a barrier: <quote source="#interview"

                        sometimes more imaginative and brave or misguided than what scientists do in
                        that you’re willing to take a risk and you’re willing to roam a little more

                <p>Like a climber planning a summit attempt, the researcher plans their angle of
                    approach, aware that some parts of the planned route will almost surely be
                    blocked, and that their unique constellation of sources and influences may very
                    well be leading across known territory, but in a new way: <quote rend="inline"

                    or foot hold at a time, until it leads … somewhere. That somewhere, like

                <p>A key result of the application of this form of reading-led instrumentation for
                    the interviewees was that it maximised the capacity to harness serendipity. This
                    is not serendipity in terms of the <soCalled>happy accident</soCalled>, however:
                    it is the serendipity of the prepared mind that can find subtle connections
                    across space and times. <quote rend="inline" source="#inline">The time that you
                        have the serendipitous find may occur a year or two years after the initial
                        browse but because you’ve done that initial browse you have embedded a
                        context for later on when you meet it. I think that certainly in my type of
                        history it’s the endless building of more and more context in different
                        contexts, laterally, chronologically or conceptually, and also mining
                        downwards and piling more and more detailed evidence on top of it. I think
                        that that’s what expertise really is, in our world.</quote></p>
                <p>Experiences of serendipity were reported in the finding of research materials in
                    an archive (<quote rend="inline" source="#interview">coming across an

                        How do I come by that motley crew? My own interests, my reading exposure, my

                    conventional in some ways, in that they are based in the experience of insight
                    coming through the finding of something new. Serendipity does not always work
                    this way, however: very often the experiences of serendipity were of ideas
                    sparking together, of connections arcing across the time from exposure to
                    moments of engagement with certain sources and ideas. Serendipity comes from
                    working through sources and absorbing them for what they are, rather than for
                    what you think you may need from them. Serendipity grows out of what you store
                    in the background of your thinking for later use. <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#interview">Those moments don’t seem to come on call necessarily
                        they just seem to pop up. But the way to get them is just to sort of
                        saturate yourself in the text.</quote> These descriptions of how insight may
                    come unbidden, but not without effort, are reminiscent of Koestler’s theory of
                    how creativity can stem from the collision between matrices of perception, which

                <p>This preparation for serendipity is actually a key part of the historian’s

                        <ptr target="#goodwin1994"/>
                    </cit>. For the historian, the peripheral vision is as important as the central
                    focus: it is here that the real connections may be found, where context is
                    preserved, and where the next projects are being scoped and tested. In many
                    interviews, seeing (or rather not seeing) became a central metaphor for the
                    limits of scholarship. In the archival context, there is an awareness that some
                    objects have been lost or removed from a collection, meaning that <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">there will be stuff that’s not there that
                        you’ll never see and no one else will, or there’s stuff that you won’t know
                        about.</quote> In secondary literature, there are potential blind spots as
                    well: <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">I discovered that there was more
                        said, or there had been more said in other disciplines and I didn’t really
                        see.</quote> It also can express how the scholarly method operates: <quote
                        source="#interview" rend="inline">…when I sort of started seeing, when I
                        started not seeing the parts where it didn’t explain things, where it was
                        adequate but not complete, where there were lapses sort of seeing that I
                        started having a feeling that there was enough here that I could work
                        with.</quote> But the importance of seeing for the harnessing of serendipity
                    – across interactions, across spaces, across time - was one of the most
                    interesting aspects of such utterances: <quote rend="inline" source="#interview"
                        >I have the kind of mind where later I think <q>oh actually those things did
                            fit together</q> and I only saw it later and actually it’s only been in
                        recent years I would see myself, and … I actually think that all the things
                        I do do actually fit together, but I think there was a sort of underlying
                        motivation in my mind that I’m interested in that I didn’t see
                        originally.</quote></p>
                <p>This constitution of professional seeing as one part reading and one part insight
                    results in a knowledgescape with a very broadly informed tacit dimension, which
                    the philosopher Michael Polanyi summarised well in the phrase <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#polanyi2009">we know far more than we can

                    knowledge of the historian is not a lack, but a latency, an immense store of
                    potential knowledge waiting for the right distraction to spark it into kinesis.

                <p>Certainly the SPARKLE interviews indicated that technology and tools were
                    increasingly present in the researcher’s apparatus. Although some of the
                    interviewees would have had experience working on digital projects, none of them
                    would have self-identified as primarily a digital humanist. In spite of that,
                    they each gave a sense of how technology was influencing their work. In
                    particular for those historians who worked in archives, the ability to
                    photograph and save images of archival materials was transformative. <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">You notice a really big difference in
                        somewhere like Kew where you can photograph and somewhere like PRONI [Public
                        Record Office of Northern Ireland] in Belfast where you can’t. It does make
                        a huge difference in terms of the volume of material you can get through …
                        certainly dictates why certain sources are used more than others.</quote>
                    This already ambiguous positioning of increasing access as something that not
                    only supports, but incentivises scholarly attention (potentially to the deficit
                    of other sources and collections that may reveal a different narrative) also
                    comes with a further disadvantage: although the ability to photograph sources
                    may maximise the time one spends physically in an archive (thereby also
                    maximising one’s research travel budget) it doesn’t increase one’s overall
                    available time for reading and analysing the materials captured: <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">…while it’s fantastic that we can now go
                        into archives and take photos of materials, there is a problem that you take
                        all these photographs and try to remember what you have, and trying to
                        remember that taking photographs of stuff is great, but you have to, you
                        also have to use the time, allocate the time to work through the
                        material.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>Discussions of other technological interventions continued this theme of both
                    benefit and compromise. Laptops are ubiquitous, and often used for analysis of
                    sources or note-taking, but they are seldom seen as flexible and extensible
                    enough to be the only place for these activities: notetaking, as we have already
                    seen, is highly multimodal, and even for analysis one researcher was wishing for
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#interview">multiple screens.</quote> Databases
                    were used for capturing structured information, but they had to be created for
                    the purpose, and relevant information often then was exported back out to
                    another format, such as a flat spreadsheet or pdf. Even then, one particularly
                    digital scholar commented about his method: <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#interview">I think this is maybe a key point for Digital Humanities
                        that, certainly for me anyway, the first time I go through a big body of
                        evidence, the hard copy remains crucial and I still find it hard to really
                        do close reading on screen.</quote> On-line searches through bibliographical
                    sources and repositories of scholarship were also common, in particular as a
                    starting point, but never able to support the full scholarly process: <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">…the jumping off point is certainly always
                        digital, and the majority of the resources that I use are digital, but again
                        I think that tends to increase as you get to know the field better, because
                        you have to read the big books and the big books are almost always in book
                        form.</quote> The common conception of humanist scholars as luddites is
                    clearly not upheld by these accounts – instead, it seems that the available
                    tools simply aren’t up to the standards of these consummate microtaskers and
                    their highly refined, multimodal, embodied methods. As more and more disciplines
                    adopt or adapt big data approaches and methods, we can only expect this gulf to
                    become more pronounced, not only because the source material to underpin big
                    data research in the study of history seems unlikely to emerge any time soon
                        <ptr target="#edmond2016"/>, but also because of the relative diminishment
                    of context and complexity in source material big data research invariably

                <head>Epistemic Versus Real Distraction and its Uses</head>
                <p>Distraction may be a key element in the scholarly processes of the humanities,
                    but it is also an element that its practitioners have yet to fully validate as a
                    positive rather than negative force in their knowledge capture and organisation
                    processes. A very good overview of the kinds of statements made by prominent
                    historians on their strategies can be found in Keith Thomas’ excellent diary
                    piece published in the <title rend="italic">London Review of Books</title> <ptr
                        target="#thomas2010"/>. From clippings to the card index to various forms
                    of organisational technology, from the pigeonholed desk to the white envelope,
                    Thomas’ account is as learned and engaging as it is modest. Herein lies the
                    problem with many discussions of the humanistic method, however, namely the fact
                    that the power of the methods developed for keeping the knowledge harvested by
                    distracted reading in a state of readiness for reuse is obscured by the
                    perception of the methods as being haphazard, not meticulous, curious, outdated,
                    capricious. Many of the researchers interviewed for the SPARKLE project
                    displayed a similar lack of appreciation for the power and rigour of their
                    notetaking processes, describing their notes, for example, as <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#interview">messy ways of putting things
                        together.</quote> To truly appreciate these strategies, they must be
                    understood not just for the many things they lack, but for the power with which
                    they triangulate between the elementals of humanistic scholarship, such as
                    sources and peer opinion, and the path and cognitive strengths of the individual
                    scholar. They must also be viewed at the macro level, not just at the level of
                    the individual’s curious habits, but as an almost endless set of variations that
                    nonetheless share common goals and structures. </p>
                <p> Scholarly distraction in reading is a powerful and productive force when guided
                    by serendipity and commitment to the values of humanistic scholarship. This is
                    not to say, however, that the epistemic process of the humanists is all
                    encompassing, and that no distractions are viewed negatively. Administrative
                    work, for example, is viewed as a <soCalled>true</soCalled> distraction, and
                    distractions in the synthesis and writing phases of work are viewed quite
                    differently than the unexpected appearance of an artefact of interest in a
                    scholarly reader’s peripheral vision (as any reader of popular academic social
                    media feeds such as <title rend="italic">Shit Academics Say</title> knows all
                    too well). But blending of the personal and the professional, the mature and the
                    new research projects, the discipline and its neighbors, and indeed the virtual
                    and the analogue all forms a part on an extensive (and, I would say, little
                    understood) system for the pursuit of insight on a relatively unbounded field of
                    enquiry. If we embrace this view of scholarly reading in the humanities as
                    distraction, then a few avenues for future exploration arise: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#börner2011">First, we need new evidence and new
                            frameworks for validating the kinds of distracted reading processes
                            humanists demonstrate. For example, it might be helpful to view the
                            frame of scholarly reading not via outdated images of absorbed readers,
                            but of something broader, like, for example, a macroscope: “Macroscopes
                            provide a ‘vision of the whole,’ helping us ‘synthesize’ the related
                            elements and detect patterns, trends, and outliers while granting access
                            to myriad details. Rather than make things larger or smaller,
                            macroscopes let us observe what is at once too great, slow, or complex
                            for the human eye and mind to notice and comprehend.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#börner2011" loc="60"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p> In addition, validating the place of distraction in the epistemic practices of
                    the scholar can help us to understand the pedagogical place of distraction. Many
                    learners, from undergraduate students to citizen scientists, are by and large
                    more interested in creating a self through their education, than a knowledge
                    base. How can this dimension of their distraction, and the technologies that
                    enable it, be engaged? Can we not do that in the digital humanities better than
                    anywhere else? Early learning emphasises <soCalled>rich environments</soCalled>
                    – can we not do the same? Rather than continuing to promote the focussed reading
                    of the book list, young researchers might instead be facilitated to build their
                    own macroscopes, incorporating (though not without questioning the bias that may
                    be found there) the objects and information they discover at the peripheries of
                    their objects of enquiry. </p>
                <p> Finally, embracing distraction as the noise that <emph>is</emph> the signal can
                    also allow us to rethink humanities research infrastructure and environments.
                    The modern library, with its remote storage and electronic catalogue, is
                    bewailed by scholars as a place that diminishes the possibility for serendipity,
                    essentially by reducing distraction. But virtual environments as well suffer
                    from their impetus to centralise activities that may look haphazard, but which
                    are anything but. How do we meet what Edwards et al. defined as the true test of
                    infrastructure, that is that it get <quote rend="inline" source="#edwards2007"
                        >below the level of the work,</quote> when we have redefined what the work
                    is <ptr target="#edwards2007"/>? In her DH 2016 keynote address, Claire Warwick,
                    asked her audience to imagine new environments for research, ones that might
                    facilitate the humanist and her sources without organising them too strictly.
                    For this vision to become a reality, we will need first to embrace the true
                    nature of the humanists’ distracted journey through the rich environments of
                    knowledge inextricably bound up with the the study of human culture and society.
