      <body>
         <p>A haunting spectre of loss and recovery hovers over Matthew Kirschenbaum’s compelling
            study of the workings of digital media. Timing and circumstances account for this in
            part. The research began with the author’s youthful enthusiasms and finishes in the more
            mature moments of sobering historical events. In framing the work, he begins with a
            description of the staged disappearance of evidence in William Gibson and Dennis
            Ashbaugh’s 1992 experimental project <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title>. The pages of
            that book-object were treated with photosensitive materials that would cause it to fade
            on exposure to light while the Gibson text was encrypted in a once-only readable format.
            But the closing bracket for Kirschenbaum’s project came from witnessing the task of data
            recovery from the black box hard drives of computers damaged in the September 11 events
            at the World Trade Towers. These two tales spin out in different directions, the spiral
            arms of forensic investigation into the social conditions of production and material
            workings of digital devices.</p>
         <p>In <title rend="italic">Mechanisms</title>, Kirschenbaum sets out to expose in detail
            the many elements of the <q>material matrix governing writing and inscription</q> at
            work in electronic textuality, including the cultural networks of reception that are
            part of that matrix. He combines his training in literary and bibliographical studies,
            engagements with critical and cultural readings in media, and a wonderfully
            self-confessed geek-enthusiasm for figuring out exactly how things work. The result is
            improbably readable in its details and compellingly suggestive and significant in its
            overall argument. The book is also an exemplary demonstration of scholarly method for
            the emerging field of digital media studies. I’d make it required reading for any class
            in this field because of its interdisciplinary approach and rich documentation of
            sources. Among scholars and peers, it will advance certain arguments. The lucid
            clarification of important concepts is centered in the distinctions Kirschenbaum
            establishes between forensic and formal materiality. Whatever other insights (and they
            are many), or anecdotal tales, or case study points may be gleaned from this book, this
            initial distinction is a crucial one for continuing discourse on digital work. </p>
         <p>That distinction is made in the introduction and first two chapters. Kirschenbaum begins
            by stating the need for a forensic approach to counter some of the misunderstandings and
            vague mythifications that have been performed by over-emphasis on reading the formal
            appearances of works in digital media. He refers to this under the rubric, <q>medial
               ideology</q>. This is the seductive tendency to read <q>the digital event on the
               screen</q> as if it existed independent of the specific technological mechanisms on
            which it depends (p. 2). Kirschenbaum’s research takes him into an interesting range of
            sources. For instance, to shape his own terminology, he draws on the work of Kenneth
            Thibodeau, Director of Electronic Records Programs at the National Archives and Records
            Administration. Not exactly the usual MLA fare or seminar citation. This dogged archival
            work is essential for the field, and its presence distinguishes this study. Adopting and
            modifying Thibodeau’s <q>tripartite model for defining digital objects</q> Kirschenbaum
            establishes the critical foundation for his own terminology (p. 3). Thibodeau describes
            digital artifacts as available to three levels of description as <emph>physical</emph>,
               <emph>logical</emph>, and <emph>conceptual</emph> objects. Though the distinctions
            among these aspects are an intellectual device as much as a description of three
            different levels of operation or ontological distinction, they provide a useful
            framework for Kirschenbaum. He summarizes the three as follows: <emph>physical </emph>
               (<q>signs inscribed on a medium</q>), <emph>logical</emph> (<q>data as recognized and
               interpreted</q>), <emph>conceptual</emph> (<q>the object we deal with in the real
               world</q>). (I find the latter term a bit awkward, associated as it is in art history
            with notions of dematerialization or ideality, but that is a trivial issue.) As
            Kirschenbaum goes on to say, the strength of the model is that it allows these different
            levels to be distinguished for the sake of <q>accounting for many of the unique
               complexities of new media artifacts.</q> This is precisely the use to which
            Kirschenbaum turns them in going on to make his own terminological (and substantial)
            distinctions, emphasizing that the focus of critical work in the field has been on the
               <emph>conceptual</emph> or phenomenological level, and only sometimes taking the
               <emph>logical</emph> data-structures into account as well. </p>
         <p>The reason for this, though Kirschenbaum is too polite and too politic to say so, is
            that the phenomenal aspect is easy to get hold of – and the <q>reading</q> of a digital
            artifact in terms of its screen expression extends habits of reading that are endemic in
            film studies or cultural studies when the mechanisms of textual production (at physical
            and logical levels, as well as social ones) are simply left out of the reading approach.
            What you see is what you critique. What I find marvelous about Kirschenbaum’s method is
            his reading of the usually <emph>invisible</emph>, the inscriptional text unavailable to
            the unassisted eye. This decision to <q>read</q> digital artifacts through the detailed
            understanding of their production is highly informative. His descriptions of the
               <q>nanoscale interval between the drive’s floating read/write head and the surface of
               the platter</q> or of litho ink conducted to the surface through the channel of a
            condensed water droplet offer a microscopophilic pleasure to a reader like myself to
            whom such details have never been explained. A feeling of satisfaction comes from being
            shown the workings of these mechanisms, akin to the thrill of finding out how the Loop
            of Henley distills body fluids or transfer RNA couples with a polypeptide chain. Why?
            Because it provides assurance that the world actually operates on a physical-material
            level through processes that are governed by predictable rules and behaviors that
            inscribe human communication and understanding (however eccentric) in a recoverable
            record.</p>
         <p>Kirschenbaum refines Thibodeau’s model and offers two terms in a contrast between
            forensic and formal materialities. No text, after all, exists outside of an
            instantiation, and so all reading takes place in the physical, material world.
               <emph>Forensic materiality</emph> is based in <q>the principle of
               individualization</q>. This wonderfully powerful concept, abstract and provocative as
            a critical notion, has a useful concrete history in modern criminal science. There the
            idea that <q>no two things in the physical world are ever exactly alike</q> served as
            the very foundation of discriminatory investigation of traces, remains, debris, and any
            and all other material evidence (p. 10). Kirschenbaum’s fascination with the forensic
            record drives him to the elaborate detailing of the tiny (300 micron) clockwork
            mechanisms of state of the art encryption, but also to the reading of traces and remains
            on floppy disks, old drives, and files in machine language. <emph>Formal
               materiality</emph> he defines as the <q>imposition of multiple-relational
               computational states on a data set or digital object.</q> Supplementing this
            description with the example of an image file, he shows the way the multi-layered
            aspects of its data can be made accessible through different readings (machine and
            human) and displays that are in part produced by <q>shifts from one set of software
               logics to another</q> (p. 13). Formal materiality is display and appearance, as well
            as structure and perceptible expression. </p>
         <p>Kirschenbaum demonstrates the power of this distinction by using it to form the case
            studies in his book. His readings of artifacts make clear that a set of physical
            conditions interacts with a set of protocols in the creation of any digital expression.
            Such distinctions are as fundamental to digital operations as Emil Benveniste’s
            distinction between the planes of discourse and reference are to the analysis of
            literary or linguistic works. They allow us to make necessary critical moves that
            separate one aspect of the articulation of digital media from another, showing these are
            different in design and structure as well as in function and behavior. Such a
            distinction is absolutely essential if digital media studies are to advance beyond that
            condition of medial ideology and its (too) easy analysis of apparent effects. </p>
         <p>He is reading the forensic features of his three case study objects as works of writing
            and machine inscription. So he approaches their analysis through a focus on when, where,
            and how each stage in the lifecycle of their production and reception left a trace in
            the digital media. So the really early, rather primitive, <title rend="italic">Mystery
               House</title> online game disk from 1980, a pre-web artifact of quite-limited but
            exhilarating-at-the-time features, turns into an excuse for a detailed analysis of disk
            sectors and the careful retracing of mysterious elements that show up on particular
            individual disks. The result is a trail of evidence that shows a user’s history and
            patterns of storage and gaming reconstructed in a manner worthy of Sherlock Holmes. In
            fact, one of the great things about Kirschenbaum’s book is that he manages to turn his
            own fascination with the process of discovery into tales of mysteries that get solved.
               <title rend="italic">Afternoon</title>, Michael Joyce’s early 1980s hypertext
            fiction, was a product of and platform for demonstrating the capabilities of Storyspace.
            Tracking its history offers a chance to go to the archives at the Ransom Center at
            University of Texas and find one of the few, rare pieces of paper remaining from the
            design process – one stained with coffee, no less. If this feels a bit (to this reader)
            like excess fetishizing, it is still charming to share the detective’s engagement with
            the implications of such traces within a larger argument about the recovery of textual
            production (bibliographical methods again) in a digital world that has often been held
            as without such remains or a useful way to recover them. The final study, of <title
               rend="italic">Agrippa</title>, serves as a means to explore the social and cultural
            conditions of production and reception of a now cult work and to expose some of the
            mythmaking apparatus of its creation. (Who hacked what when and where and who knew what
            when — all this is information to be tracked and written about through scrutinizing the
            date stamps of emails and electronic trails.) </p>
         <p>The combination of technical knowledge, scholarly conscientiousness, and imaginative
            critical insight in this book and the sheer readability produced by the author’s
            enthusiasm for his material and method make this a highly informative work. But the
            importance of the book is in its demonstration of method as well as in the substance of
            its argument. The task of recovery in the humanities, the serious preservation of
            cultural record, belongs to the world of digital objects as textual objects of cultural
            inscription. Memory is a collective project of trace and reading, a forensics of
            cultural imagination and production as well as of texts examined in phenomenal form or
            isolation. </p>
         <p>What are the implications of this book and approach? Surely we don’t imagine that from
            this point on every critic or scholar of digital media artifacts will scrutinize the
            hard drives and machine code of the works they study? Knowing that this level of
            production is a component of the work makes the point, but as technologies shift and
            change, knowing how these workings produce the work will continue to be an important
            aspect of the intellectual productions themselves. If organic memory chips or living
            organisms get integrated into circuitry, can we simply read the logical and conceptual
            levels of a piece without attention to this physical fact? Of course not. But
            Kirschenbaum’s point — that the reading of computational media as
               <emph>immaterial</emph> has been largely the result of a lack of engagement with the
            actual workings of its operations — is now made, and serves as a reference within the
            discourse of digital media. </p>
         <p>My only quibble with this has nothing to do with the author or his arguments, but with
            the state of the field of digital productions. Paying close attention to the incunabular
            work of Michael Joyce is all very well from a historical perspective. Likewise the close
            reading of the primitive, almost pre-historical <title rend="italic">Mystery
               House</title> and the elaboration of fan frenzy in hacker communities in the <title
               rend="italic">Agrippa</title> tale are justified by the novelty of these curiosities.
            But do any of these works have literary qualities that merit our critical engagement? If
            these weren’t digital texts would we read them as literature? For all my respect for
            these folks, I doubt it. Have any works appeared in digital media whose interest goes
            beyond novelty value? Not yet. A similar problem exists in the field of artists’ books,
            where production values tend to interfere with literary ones because of the energy
            required to actually make the things. Paradoxically, the generative tension between
            transparency and resistance to media that form the right conditions for a higher level
            of aesthetic production may arise only when the geek-culture necessity for technical
            engagement disappears. Then these peculiar code products will appear as what they are,
            early and self-conscious works whose reflection on production is part of their textual
            condition. In that regard they served their author admirably, and he them, but for the
            future close readings will require richer texts or we will be trapped in a cycle where
            only the techne and not the poetics express our imagination in the aesthetic realm of
            digital artifacts. </p>
