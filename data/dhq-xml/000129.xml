            <p>Almost since the inception of the industry, the player community has been
               instrumental in preserving video games and other variable media art. Drawing on a
               combination of primary and secondary sources of information, including the Preserving
               Virtual Worlds project (an academic investigation into viable models of preservation
               for videogames and 3D virtual worlds based on a series of archiving case studies) and
               the results of a game documentation survey conducted by Donahue, we examine how
               players are taking responsibility for collecting, managing, curating, and creating
               long-term access to computer games. Because our interest lies with the contact zone
               between players and information professionals, we also describe and analyze how we
               and other scholar-archivists are collaborating with or relying on the user community
               to preserve virtual worlds, with an eye to how these relationships might eventually
               be codified within a larger preservation framework.<note>Early versions of portions of this paper were delivered by Kari Kraus, Rachel

            <p>In 2006, Margaret Hedstrom and a team of researchers at the University of Michigan
               published the results of an experiment exploring how users evaluate the authenticity
               and usability of computer games and other digital materials that have been preserved
               through multiple methods. The study found that users tended to prefer playing
               emulated and migrated versions of a popular 1980s-era computer game known as Chuckie
               Egg over the original version. Arguing the importance of the user's perspective in
               archival decision-making, the authors begin and end the paper with a call for further
               research into the <q>needs and preferences</q> of the user community <ptr
                  target="#hedstrom2006"/>. The purpose of this article is to develop this line of
               inquiry by drawing on a combination of primary and secondary sources of information,
               including our experiences with the Preserving Virtual Worlds project (an academic
               investigation into viable models of preservation for videogames and 3D virtual worlds

               and the scholarly literature on game studies, archives, and digital preservation.
               Where we depart from Hedstrom and her colleagues is in how we position the user
               within the preservation system. While their assumption is that users are primarily
               consumers of digital information, ours is that they are also avid custodians of it.
               To frame the issue in archival terms, we see players taking responsibility for
               collecting, managing, curating, and creating long-term access to computer games.
               Because our interest lies with the contact zone between players and information
               professionals, we will describe and analyze how we and other scholar-archivists are
               collaborating with or relying on the user community to preserve virtual worlds, with
               an eye to how these relationships might eventually be codified within a larger
               preservation framework.</p>
            <p>Participatory culture provides one obvious context in which to consider the rise of
               the player archivist and preservationist. In recent years much has been made of the
               allegedly stark contrast between amateur and professional culture, and those writing
               about it tend to structure the conversation in markedly polemical terms.  While
               proponents of amateur culture extol the democratization of the means of production,
               opponents denounce the decline of subject expertise, certified credentials,
               and institutional standards.<note> Compare, for example, the diametric perspectives
                  of Clay Shirky, <title rend="italic">Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing
                     Without Organizations</title> (Reprint. New York: Penguin, 2009) and Andrew
                  Keen, <title rend="italic">The Cult of the Amateur: How Today's Internet is
                     Killing Our Culture</title> (New York: Doubleday, 2007).</note>  This paper
               attempts to shift the focus and substance of the debate in two ways:</p>
            <list type="unordered">
               <item>First, by framing amateur and professional culture in terms of content
                     <emph>preservation</emph> as well as the more customary content
                     <emph>creation</emph> (user-<emph>preserved</emph> and <emph>curated</emph>
                  media in addition to user-<emph>generated</emph> media). Drawing on examples from
                  the creative/expressive domains of computer games, interactive fiction, and
                  variable media art, we argue that the production and dissemination of fan-made
                  mods, game cracks, and homebrew ports are frequently not only creative (or
                  piratical) activities, but also preservational ones. While this position differs
                  from that held by most in the recordkeeping professions for whom the integrity,
                  fixity, and accuracy of digital information are the cornerstone of any responsible
                  preservation program, one of our objectives is to situate the transformational
                  model within the context of cultural heritage studies more broadly, where it has
                  been legitimated in a variety of disciplines. It finds expression, for example, in
                  phrases such as <q>permanence through change</q> (museum studies);
                     <q>transformission</q>: transmission + transformation (textual scholarship);
                  and <q>preservation through adaptive reuse</q> (architecture).<note> See <ptr
                        target="#depocas2003"/>; Random Clod [i.e., Randall McLeod], <title

                     22–23. Marc Ruppel has discussed the concept of <q>permanence through
                        change</q> in the context of transmedia narratives. See Ruppel, <title

                        Archival Dilemma</title>. <title rend="italic">Convergence</title> 15

               </item>
               <item>Second, by demonstrating that the relationship between professional and amateur
                  archivists of virtual worlds is one of reciprocity and mutual influence. Even
                  those, like Richard J. Cox, who acknowledge the increasingly important role of
                  citizen archivists in the information age tend to assume an asymmetrical
                  relationship between them and their professional counterparts <ptr
                     target="#cox2009"/>. Cox presupposes a uni-directional transfer of knowledge
                  from professional to amateur, with the former <q>advising,</q>
                  <q>assisting,</q> or <q>educating</q> the latter.<note>See, for example, <ptr
                        target="#cox2009" loc="2–3, 192–200"/> .</note> When it comes to the
                  preservation of computer games and related artifacts, however, both sides are in
                  possession of significant expertise. Moreover, the borders separating them are
                  remarkably porous: the contributors to the Mystery House Taken Over Project, for
                  example (discussed below), might be variously categorized as artists, gamers,
                  developers, scholars, and preservationists. A single individual — or a single
                  community — contains multitudes.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The article is divided into five sections: Part I overviews the primary risks to
               videogame longevity, including hardware and software obsolescence a mere 5–10 years
               after a game’s initial release. Part II summarizes what actions are currently being
               undertaken to preserve videogames by three communities of practice: the videogame
               industry, the player community, and the information professions. In order to assess
               the contributions of the first two communities, Donahue administered two surveys
               designed to reveal where professional and amateur preservation activities intersect
               with and deviate from one another. Part III introduces the user paradigm of
               preservation through adaptation, drawing on the example of <title rend="italic"
                  >Mystery House</title>
               <ptr target="#williams1980"/>, the first text adventure game to include graphics.
               This paradigm, we argue, shapes (and is shaped by) a view of authenticity that values
               continuity through change and that conceptualizes an art object as an entity whose
               ontology is fulfilled through the process of adaptation. By this logic, a game is
               paradoxically more faithful to itself as it is modified and transformed by developers
               and successive generations of players.<note>This view of authenticity is described
                  and historicized in <ptr target="#macneil2007"/> (see also <ptr
                     target="#macneil2005"/>) in <title rend="italic">Cultural Artifacts and the
                     Production of Meaning</title>, ed. Margaret J. M. Ezell and Katherine O'Brien

            <head>Risks to Videogame Longevity</head>
            <p>While paper records remain potentially accessible for decades and even centuries with
               no intervention, videogames are subject to hardware and software obsolescence a mere
               5–10 years after their release. Prior research into the preservation of electronic
               records has largely focused on static files created on personal computers, which
               present far fewer challenges than an interactive piece of software, often designed
               for use on a proprietary system.</p>

                  are subject to the dangers of media decay.<note>A quantitative study of the
                     scarcity of videogames was conducted in the UK in 2008. The study took a sample
                     of videogame consoles, as well as 50 video game cartridges for the Atari 2600,
                     and examined their availability in archives, on internet sale sites, and as
                     illegal ROMs for download and play on emulators. The study determined that
                     pirated ROMs present the most available resource for games, and that all of the
                     archives found to contain the selected games were located in the United States.
                     The recent opening of the UK National Videogame Archive may change this
                     dispersal problem, but the rarity of authentic, original game copies represents
                     a challenge to those who seek to preserve them. Paul Gooding and Melissa

                  <label>3rd party software dependence</label>: Once a game platform becomes
                  obsolete, emulation may be the best method of providing access. Currently,
                  however, most emulators are developed by the game community and are of
                  questionable legality. They are also typically created without the benefit of the
                  original specifications, and are themselves at risk of becoming obsolete.</item>

                  <label>Complex, proprietary code and an associated lack of documentation</label>:
                  Videogames are generally released as compiled binaries with no documentation of
                  the compiling process, or even the programming languages used. Not having access
                  to the source code or language specifications makes migrating or emulating
                  software far more difficult. It’s a magnification of the format identification

                  proving that a digital object is what it claims to be, free from tampering or
                  corruption. Video games enjoy many versions between the first prototype, the
                  official release (on multiple platforms), and cracked or otherwise altered
                  unauthorized editions. Especially for older games, the only extant copy may exist
                  in a fan-run web repository, making the authenticity impossible to
                     establish.<note>In this paper we propose alternate conceptions of
                        <q>authenticity</q> for video games that may align better with their complex

                  <label>Intellectual property rights</label>: The game development industry is
                  highly creative and competitive, leading developers to be very jealous of their
                  intellectual property. Most have instituted extremely draconian shrink-wrap
                  licenses reflecting this. And yet, once a game is no longer actively marketable,
                  they are unlikely to respond to inquiries about licensing for it.<note>For a

                  preservation of games, building contextuality is important to creating
                  understanding for future users. This is truer for video games than many other
                  record types because, as technology advances, game players who have only been
                  exposed to the latest and greatest may be apt to play an older game and say, <q>so
                     what?</q> even though the game might have been revolutionary for its
                     time.<note> As an example, Sierra’s <title rend="italic">Mystery House</title>
                     was not just a first for the company — it was the first text adventure to
                     incorporate graphics. An amazing breakthrough at the time, it seems crude in
                     comparison to today’s realistic 3D environments.</note>

               constructed: one for game developers, and one for game enthusiasts. The surveys were
               distributed through the International Game Developers Association’s white paper,
               presented at the Game Developers Conference, announced on the Grand Text Auto blog,
               and publicized among known developers and gamers including members of New England

            <p>Forty-eight individuals from the videogame industry responded to the survey, but only
               16 answered every question. Of the respondents, 26 were from companies that had 50 or
               more employees, and only 6 of these made it beyond the question, <q>Have you
                  considered establishing an archives/records management program?</q> Nine of the 26
               responded that they did have a formal program, 15 did not have one, and 2 skipped the
               question entirely. Those with formal programs, in both smaller and larger companies,
               grouped their records according to project and/or type of asset (e.g. code or
               graphic). <hi rend="bold">Figure 1</hi> shows the main divisions of records included
               in archives/records management programs. </p>

            <p>Comments to this question showed a range of disorganized preservation activity. Some
               companies indicated using a wiki to manage and preserve their records, many referred
               to a version control system or code repository, and a few mentioned nightly backup
               tapes without elaborating on the content of those backups. The most promising
               comments were from respondents who claimed they used configuration management (CM)
               processes and policies for all of their major game builds, though not for individual
               developer materials.</p>
            <p>According to Jessica Keyes, CM <quote rend="inline" source="#keyes2004">identifies
                  which processes need to be documented</quote> and tracks any changes <ptr
                  target="#keyes2004" loc="3"/>. Wikipedia expands on this, noting that it <q>identifies the functional and physical
                  attributes of software at various points in time and performs systematic control
                  of changes to the identified attributes for the purpose of maintaining software
                  integrity and traceability throughout the software development life cycle.</q>

               Unfortunately, in the very same question, the same respondents admitted that many, if
               not most, developers have no CM training.</p>
            <p>Using a code repository or asset management system is certainly an important part of
               a good CM plan. And yet, although they were mentioned in an earlier question, only
               50% of respondents said they utilized them when asked specifically.</p>
            <p>Although 2 respondents said that they did use records schedules, most free-text
               responses regarding how permanence is determined displayed a fairly casual attitude
               towards preservation. There were many references to item types that were necessary or
               reusable being kept, while everything else was tossed, and to materials only being
               kept for successful games. Some companies retained related documentation, while
               others did not. Storage environments (<hi rend="bold">Figure 3</hi>) ranged from
               enshrining physical records in an off-limits closet to a hard drive stored under a
               developer’s desk. The word <q>whim</q> in reference to an individual deciding the
               fate of records was used more than once.</p>
            <p>In summary, there seems to be a tendency within the game industry to make
               preservation decisions at the level of the individual developer, with no official
               guidance. When Donahue asked the question of a Garage Games developer at Foundations
               of Digital Games, he responded, <q>[laugh] We don't.
                  Other than the source code of a game that ships, we don't care. I just had someone
                  looking for annotated versions of our tools and we don't have them.</q> To be
               fair, this is explicable. Game developers tend to work with a fixed deadline: the
               majority of their income is made in the holiday season, so they need to get releases
               out early in the 4th quarter. They also operate on a finite budget, which tends to
               mean fewer programmers working more hours–leading to everyone working at too
               breakneck a pace to give a thought to what happens to any of the interim
               products.</p>
            <p>The survey also asked respondents to indicate what kinds of digital and analogue
               objects they were preserving (<hi rend="bold">Figure 2</hi>). Of the materials listed
               in the questionnaire, all categories were saved by at least one company, except for
                  <q>Game magazines/clippings files.</q> The most popular categories were source
               code and compiled binaries, as well as game assets and artwork, with 85% of
               respondents reporting they preserved each of these item types. Following closely
               behind at 77% each were design documents and tools developed to support game
               creation.</p>

            <p>Of the 12 respondents who answered the preservation tactics question, 7 reported
               simply saving the files in their original format, 1 migrated to an unspecified
               preservation format, and 3 transformed files on demand if the game was needed for
               another reason (such as a re-release) in the future. One respondent went so far as to
               say that once a game’s platform is gone, the software is, too. Emulation was
               referenced only as a test platform during development. Responses to the description
               questions revealed that metadata tends to be captured as unstructured text rather
               than using a schema or authority list, if it is done at all. </p>

            <p>Additional comments support the interpretation that the survey responses reveal a
               lack of industry interest in preservation. Many game companies simply are not
               concerned with their games beyond the development lifecycle. If the results of this
               survey reflect the practices of the industry at large, we are in serious danger of
               losing large chunks of our cultural heritage. The concept of <q>benign neglect</q>
               can be applied safely to paper records and even some analog audiovisual media — but
               apply it to digital objects and they will almost certainly end up in the dustbin as
               soon as they go out of active use. </p>

            <p>Luckily for future historians, gamers, and students, the player community is very
               active in preserving the software and artifacts of the games they love. If enthusiasm
               can be inferred from response rate, the contrast between the community and industry
               surveys demonstrates very different levels of interest. Recall that 16 people (or
               33%) of those answering completed the industry survey, a decent rate of response,
               according to some. The community, on the other hand, completed the survey 87% of the
               time, generating 54 full responses, with numerous people emailing that they wished
               they’d had a chance to take the survey before it closed.</p>
            <p>Illustrating the diversity of the community, respondents were split between exclusive
               collectors of officially released material, and those who collected unreleased as
               well. Systems that interested them ranged from the Vectrex (1982–84, a home system
               with built-in display, that used vector graphics rather than the more common raster
               graphics) and Pong (1972 and after, a single-game console originally popularized in
               bars) to the PS3 and Wii. Thirty percent collected ephemera, and about half used
               emulators to play games for systems that interested them. The free text comments on
               the emulation experience were rich, and, with emulation being a primary access method
               for obsolete systems, deserve further exploration and analysis in a later study.</p>
            <p>The enthusiasts were also asked which websites they regularly visited and/or
               contributed to, with 77% partaking in both activities. These websites represent a
               very valuable preservation contribution by the game community. Sites like
               GameFAQs.com, MobyGames, and Home of the Underdogs (before its unfortunate demise)
               provide metadata and context information at a level many cataloguers would envy. This
               data is essentially peer reviewed, as there are scores of well-informed visitors
               constantly viewing and updating it. Some sites have a formal moderation system for
               quality control.</p>
            <p>Nineteen of the respondents had engaged in preservation activities beyond website
               participation. The most common activities were contributing to an emulator, imaging
               disks, and restoring/refurbishing hardware (Figure 4). More unusual activities were
               designing a preservation architecture,<note>

               </note> writing preservation guidelines for developers, and curating game related
               exhibits. Additionally, three of the respondents put their collections to good use,
               by releasing previously unreleased games to the public. Whether this was as a ROM or
               on physical media is unclear,<note>A ROM is a digital file that clones all the
                  contents of a given read-only storage medium, such as a game cartridge, right down
                  to the slack space at the end of a file.</note> but both have been known to
               happen. Mike Tyson’s Intergalactic Punch Out for the NES was released as a ROM,<note>

               <p>The archival literature has, relatively speaking, a dearth of
                  preservation-centered articles for interactive objects. InterPARES (International
                  Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems) is a series of
                  projects investigating problems related to the <q>authenticity, reliability, and accuracy of electronic records throughout their
                     life cycle.</q>

                  While InterPARES2 dealt with <q>Experiential,
                     Interactive and Dynamic Records,</q> its focus was on files generated by
                  artists, musicians, and scientists, rather than software. Regardless, a repository
                  looking to preserve videogames would do well to follow the <q>Preserver
                     Guidelines</q> laid out in the Project Book<note> InterPARES 2 Project,
                     directed by Luciana Duranti: <ref

               <p>In particular, the oft repeated mantra (in the realm of e-records) of getting
                  involved early in the lifecycle process is important to game preservation. The
                  dangers of obsolescence make it extremely useful to have the source code for games
                  of enduring value. Due to the nature of development and the rapidly changing
                  market, raw source code is more likely to be available before a game is officially
                  released – before it has been compiled into the executable programs we run on our
                  systems at home. Taking a disk image from an official release – making a
                  hardware-independent copy – only provides the binary files, and these are
                  difficult to migrate to other formats should it become necessary. The trouble with
                  binary files is that they obscure the underlying code and are difficult to
                  impossible to decompile. If, however, we have access to the source code, it would
                  allow an enterprising programmer to change small amounts of the code to create a
                  source port to a different operating system. This is somewhat comparable to the
                  value of having negatives vs. photographs; you can do a lot more with the
                  negatives, and the same is true for source code. </p>
               <p>An example of the utility of source code is seen in the source ports available at
                     DoomWorld<note>DoomWorld is a community-run portal for all things related to
                     all versions of the DOOM video game, developed and released by id software.
                     This includes history, downloads, help files, forums, news, feature articles,
                     and a myriad of topical sites hosted by the portal for other DOOM enthusiasts.
                        <ref target="http://www.doomworld.com/">http://www.doomworld.com/</ref>
                  </note>, which were made possible by the release of the Doom Engine to the public
                  domain by id Software, as well as by the efforts of Doom enthusiasts who helped
                  port the game to other operating systems. Because just the engine was released,
                  players had to have a copy of the accompanying files in order to play the game,
                  helping to preserve id’s intellectual property rights. The game engine essentially
                  acts as a driver or interpreter for the graphics, sound, and other individual
                  objects that make up a complete game.</p>
               <p>This discussion of objects other than binary files brings us to another important
                  guideline laid out by InterPARES 2: identify all digital components. One of the
                  challenges of preserving a videogame is that referring to it in the singular is
                  deceptive. A videogame is actually made up of as many as hundreds of different
                  objects, some of which may be hidden depending on the settings of the operating
                  system one is using to access it. Making sure that every file is identified and
                  every file-type known is an essential part of keeping an accurate record of the
                  program. This is another area where having the source code is helpful. Identifying
                  a file as a binary or executable is essentially useless; all information related
                  to the structure and programming of the file is obscured. </p>
               <p>Similar to InterPARES is the Variable Media Network’s questionnaire for new media
                     artists.<note> Alain Depocas, et al, <title rend="italic">Permanence Through

                        >http://variablemedia.net/e/preserving/html/var_pub_index.html</ref>;
                     Variable Media Questionnaire, a Forging the Future Project, co-designed by John
                     Bell and Jon Ippolito http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net/</note> The
                  questionnaire allows a curator to learn from the creator exactly what aspects of
                  his or her work must be presented to allow for an accurate representation to be
                  made in the future. It also helps to clarify any rights issues, and provides the
                  rationale for recording the specific technologies used. Creating a similar
                  questionnaire for videogame creators would give archivists and historians the
                  ability to track the evolution of design platforms in addition to clarifying
                  technical metadata and intellectual property concerns.</p>
               <p>Beyond these two projects, some of the most useful things to come out of the
                  archival world are standards for metadata and the Open Archival Information System
                  (OAIS) reference model, which have obvious applications and import for any digital archive.<note>

            <head>Preservation through Adaptation</head>
            <p>Having taken a preliminary look at how three different communities of practice
               approach the problem of video game preservation, we will now consider preservation
               strategies that involve reprogramming, reimplementation, re-creation, and adaptation.
               Our contention is that one of the preservation models that governs certain categories
               of virtual worlds, such as non-commercial IF, operates under the sign of modification
               rather than reproduction.<note> More precisely, adaptation exists alongside
                  reproduction as a preservation strategy; the two often work in tandem.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Consider, for example, the case of <title rend="italic">Mystery House</title>, the
               first graphical work of interactive fiction ever created. Released into the public
               domain in 1987, <title rend="italic">Mystery House</title> was later reimplemented in
               the Inform programming language by the Mystery House Taken Over Occupation Force,
               comprised of Nick Montfort, Dan Shiovitz, and Emily Short <ptr target="#montfort2004"
               />. While the reimplemented game hews closely to the original Apple II version, even
               going so far as to deliberately reproduce a programming error, it nonetheless also
               departs from its antecedent in interesting ways–sometimes intentionally (the original
               requirement to issue commands in upper-case text is pronounced <title rend="quotes"
                  >too dreary to bother reproducing,</title> for example),<note> To view the source
                  code, download the Mystery House Taken Over Occupation Kit at <ref

                     >http://www.turbulence.org/mhto_kit.tgz</ref>
               </note> sometimes inadvertently and unavoidably (consistent with migration as a
               preservation strategy more broadly). Moreover, the game’s commented code demonstrates
               how MHTO oscillates between a preservation project and a remix project: while the
               comments record a wealth of information about the original game, they also reflect a
               commitment to getting a younger generation of game enthusiasts interested in early IF
               by modding and remixing it. As a result, documentary and explanatory comments coexist
               with generative ones. Players learn about how the early graphics were coded, for
               instance, even as they are encouraged to substitute their own images for the crude
               line drawings that Ken and Roberta Williams originally included. Suggestions to
               remove a line or <q>rip out</q> a game behavior are interspersed throughout the
               source code, and a number of programming decisions have been made with player
               customization in mind.</p>
            <p>It is clear that the MHTO Occupation Force, which commissioned ten contemporary
               digital artists to mod the game using a specially designed kit for the purpose, sees
               its reimplementation as an intermediary node in the genealogy of <title rend="italic"
                  >Mystery House</title>, one that honors its predecessor and anticipates its
               successors; that is poised between <emph>what was</emph> and what <emph>will
                  be</emph>. Nick Montfort’s contribution, <title rend="quotes">

               </note> pays homage to 1980s-era hackers who would make commercial games available
               for download on Bulletin Board Systems after breaking their copy protection
               mechanisms. Montfort overlays the original <term>MH</term> graphics with fragments of
               Apple II crack screens, or the piratical equivalent of graffiti tags, that include
               the aliases of the crackers and shout-outs to fellow pirates. By ingesting such
               materials into the game itself, he inverts the customary relationship between text
               and context, transforming the game into an exhibition space for a particular class of
               vintage artifacts that help make first- and second-generation computer adventure
               games intelligible. </p>
            <p>In its conceptualization and design, the MHTO project reflects a view of authenticity
               that Heather MacNeil, archives scholar, ascribes to Heidegger when she argues that
               cultural objects are <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#macneil2007">in a continuous
                  state of becoming</quote>
               <ptr target="#macneil2007" loc="33"/></cit>. According to this perspective, it is not stasis
               or fixity that serves as a guarantor of authenticity, particularly in the digital
               realm, but rather change and transformation; authenticity is <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#macneil2007">an anticipation, a process, and a continuous
                  struggle</quote> to become <ptr target="#macneil2007" loc="29"/>. Paul Eggert
               neatly encapsulates the ineluctable truth that lies behind this model: <cit><quote
                  rend="inline" source="#eggert2009">works do not stand still</quote>
               <ptr target="#eggert2009" loc="13"/></cit>. As MacNeil notes, while this particular
               formulation of authenticity is controversial in the field of archives and
               preservation where practitioners are dedicated to stabilizing cultural records, it
               has been fully naturalized over the last 15–20 years in the field of textual
               scholarship, a branch of literary studies concerned with the transmission of texts
               over time and which can be productively viewed as a sister discipline to archival
               science <ptr target="#macneil2007" loc="33–38"/>
               <ptr target="#macneil2005" loc="270"/>. If we plot these two differing views of
               authenticity along what Paul Eggert calls the <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#eggert2009">production-consumption spectrum of the life of the
                  work,</quote> then it becomes evident that the principle of fixity, which
               privileges authorial agency, falls on the production end of the spectrum <ptr
                  target="#eggert2009" loc="18"/>; and the principle of transformation, which
               privileges user agency, falls on the consumption end.<note> While we are accustomed
                  to classifying the output of cultural consumption as secondary source material
                  (for example, marginalia or critical commentary in the case of novel reading;
                  machinima or recams in the case of game play), it can also take a form that more
                  closely resembles primary source material: should the various expansions and ports
                  of Will Crowther’s Colossal Cave <title rend="italic">Adventure</title> be
                  interpreted as context for the original game or as legitimate repetitions of it,
                  albeit with modifications? The question is intended to challenge the dichotomy
                  that <emph>seems</emph> to inhere in Eggert’s model: namely, that production and
                  consumption are two entirely distinct activities. The theory of co-creation
                  integral to a Heideggerean view of authenticity suggests that eventually the two
                  ends of the spectrum become mirror images of each other.</note> In one case, the
               authenticating function is invested in the author. In the other, it is the user.</p>
            <p>It would be a mistake, however, to seize on the apparent oppositions. Where the two
               approaches converge is in their shared commitment to the continuity of the
               intellectual object; where they diverge is primarily a function of how much variance
               each is willing to tolerate in the different manifestations and expressions of the
               work. Moreover, the two value systems and the preservation strategies through which
               they are realized often work together rather than at cross-purposes. The player
               community not only reprograms and modifies classic games, it also develops emulators
               for them, allowing users to experience the games in an environment that mimics an
               obsolete platform or operating system and in a form that clones the structure and
               contents of the original software data files. For this reason the community may be
               said to be Janus-faced, looking forward to new incarnations of influential or obscure
               titles while at the same time looking backward to canonical versions and official
               releases. The availability of <title rend="italic">Mystery House</title> as
               reverse-engineered source code written in a modern programming language <title
                  rend="italic">and</title> as a disk image of the original executable program (a
               byte-exact copy that can be run in an Apple II emulator) testifies to this basic
               duality — a duality that need not imply incompatibility.</p>

            <head>Patterns of Interaction Across Communities</head>
            <p>These inter-preservational approaches happen not only synchronically within a single
               community, but also diachronically across communities. The patterns of interaction
               often resemble those found in architectural preservation, where there is a clear
               reciprocity between residents of buildings, on the one hand, and preservationists, on
               the other. Writing about the functions and roles that each of these stakeholder
               groups assumes, Paul Eggert summarizes the resulting dynamic that unfolds in time:
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#eggert2009">only adaptive reuse [by generations of
                  inhabitants] will have put very old buildings in a position to be proposed for
                  professional conservation and curation in the present</quote>
               <ptr target="#eggert2009" loc="22–23"/>. In the case of digital game preservation, an
               analogous relationship exists between user modification and institutional appraisal:
               players augment and extend the cultural relevance of computer games by modifying them
               for successive generations of users. These adaptations in turn increase the
               likelihood that professional archivists will eventually judge the games worthy of
               digital preservation.</p>
            <p>A good example is <title rend="italic">Colossal Cave Adventure</title>, created by
               Will Crowther c. 1975, which has the distinction of being the first documented
               computer text-adventure game. Inspired by Kentucky’s Mammoth Cave system, the game
               inaugurated many of the conventions and player behaviors now associated with the
               genre, such as solving puzzles, collecting treasure, and interacting with the
               simulated fantasy world via short text commands <ptr target="#jerz2007"

            <p>Most of the game modifications referenced thus far are the product of what Alan Liu
               would call <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#liu2006">smart constraints</quote>
               <ptr target="#liu2006"/></cit>: they are aesthetic, stylistic, and ludic in nature,
               encompassing changes to levels, characters, textures, descriptions, objects, and
               storylines. Generally speaking, they are creative hacks designed within the
               parameters of a given genre that are intended to enhance game play. By contrast, dumb
               constraints involve various concessions to technology; they are the unavoidable
               consequence of living in a material world where limited computer memory, storage, and
               bandwidth compromise — or at least modulate — artistic vision. While the distinction
               between smart and dumb constraints is by no means absolute, its utility lies in being
               able to generalize at a sufficiently high level about two variables affecting game
               mods.</p>
            <p>Although primarily focused on the role of smart constraints in the development of
                  <title rend="italic">Adventure</title>, Dennis Jerz also pays attention to dumb
               constraints in his groundbreaking article on the game. He quotes M. Kraley, a former

               swift strokes the long-standing tension between code size and program performance – a
               tension that would have been particularly pronounced in an era when computer memory
               was measured in kilobytes rather than gigabytes. By the time Crowther was modeling
               the <quote rend="inline" source="#levy1984">twisty little passages</quote> of the
               Kentucky cave system in his text-based world, the principle of parsimony was already
               axiomatic. Steven Levy locates its origins in the mainframe computer culture of the
               1950s and 60s, when <quote rend="inline" source="#levy1984">program

               limited physical memory and punchcard media, whose minimal storage capacity created a
               strong incentive for programmers to make their code as efficient as possible, thereby
               reducing the size of the program deck <ptr target="#levy1984" loc="26"/>. What began
               as a consequence of mundane technological circumstance quickly evolved into a

               worse than find a bloated program to compress into fewer lines of code. <quote

               Like code bums, speedruns represent a trend toward increasing efficiency,
               rationalization, and speed. They may not, however, involve the same degree of
               capitulation to dumb constraints, notwithstanding the clever exploitation of glitches

            <p>The migration of parsimony from the code level to the game level is discernible in
               other ways as well. The concept implies not only efficiency, but also economy of
               expression, with a <q>less is more</q> ethos. It is this dimension of parsimony that
               game mods based on dumb constraints often reflect. One sees it, for example, in the
               readiness of an earlier generation of software pirates to sacrifice seemingly
               significant game properties in the interest of low-bandwidth <q>warez</q>
               distribution. The resulting game rips, which drained the digital objects of high-end
               features such as audio or video,<note> Indhu Rajagopal and Nis Bojin, <title

                  For further context, we quote Rajagopal and Bojin’s discussion of so-called
                     <q>game rips</q> in full: <q>Pirated programs known as <q>rips,</q> i.e., programs that have had
                     superfluous items extracted from it, designed largely for the
                     bandwidth–impaired . . . are available for file sharers and warez Web sites.
                     For instance, where a full digital ISO image of a game may be as much as 700 MB
                     in size, a rip of that game can be far less, once the music and videos from the
                     game have either been removed or large textures in the game have been
                     downsampled, i.e., reduced in quality from the original. This can result in a
                     700 MB file becoming a 70 MB game, which is much more accessible to those who
                     wish to offer it with their own server space and for downloads on a
                     low–bandwidth connection. A similar technique is applied to applications,
                     movies whose underlying premise is of the <q>lossy</q> MP3 format, which has
                     acted as a cornerstone file type, elevating audio piracy to its current state
                     of popularity . . . Game rip releasers often even go the distance, allowing
                     users to customize their game if they have the bandwidth. A stripped down
                     version of the game will often be released with its removed components also
                     made available for download, if desired. Thus, one could download a copy of a
                     sports game, the music for the game, the movies for the game and in–game
                     commentary, all separately. This practice is predominant among
                     newsgroups.</q> See also Solveig Singleton, <title rend="quotes">Copy

               <ptr target="#levy1984" loc="40"/></cit>, as well as its corollaries, the freedom to tinker

               this: the relationship between the sustainability of a creative object and the

               any conversation about significant properties, it assumes pride of place in the
               context of software hacking. This is not to dispense with other criteria – one need
               only invoke the notorious failure of the Atari VCS port of <title rend="italic"
                  >Pac-Man</title> in 1982 to realize that once a cultural artifact achieves iconic
               status, it becomes much harder to assess trade-offs between paying homage to the
               original and yielding to the technical exigencies of reimplementation on a different
               platform. But the siren call of adaptive reproduction frequently outweighs all other
               considerations. Indeed, a recurring theme <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#montfortetal2009">that runs throughout the history of the Atari VCS
                  platform,</quote> according to Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost in <title
                  rend="italic">Racing the Beam</title>, is <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#montfortetal2009">the transformative port,</quote> especially of arcade
               games <ptr target="#montfortetal2009" loc="23"/>. In this context, what counts as
                  <q>significant</q> is whatever the target platform can accommodate. Those
               properties that resist being shoehorned into the new system end up as collateral
               damage. In the case of the <title rend="italic">Pac-Man</title> port, this included
               such venerable features as the paku-paku sound effects and the distinctive visual
               attributes of the ghosts, bonus fruits, and food pellets <ptr
                  target="#montfortetal2009" loc="77–79"/>. The logic of adaptive reproduction,
               however, means that many properties that are casualties of an initial port can be
               re-integrated into subsequent ports. As Montfort and Bogost note, <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#montfortetal2009">later VCS <title rend="italic"
                     >Pac-Man</title> hacks and rebuilds</quote> re-introduced <cit><quote rend="inline"

                  graphics, and colored fruit.</quote>
               <ptr target="#montfortetal2009" loc="77"/></cit>. Thus a relatively crude rendition of the
               game paved the way for more faithful renditions down the road. This ongoing process
               demonstrates how systems of semiotic relevance can be recalibrated over time in
               response to changing techno-cultural circumstances.<note>Of course the logic of
                  adaptive reproduction can also result in tricked-out, augmented, or enhanced
                  audio-visual capabilities in a given game franchise that take full advantage of
                  upgrades in sound and video card technology and increased processing power over
                  time. For a discussion of the role of <q>techno-historic</q> constraints on game

            <p>Although a work of variable media art rather than a video game, the history of

               the difference that dumb constraints play an even more decisive role in the fate of
                  <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title>. The crux of the challenge for hackers in
               1992 was how to take a complex, auto-destructive, and cross-media work of art stored
               on a 3.5” floppy; copy it; and reformat it for online distribution prior to the era
               of the graphical web browser and at a time when ASCII was still the predominant
               currency of the internet. The crude hack they devised allowed <title rend="italic"
                  >Agrippa</title> to survive as a text-only fragment on the network for sixteen
               years, creating the pre-conditions for its eventual emulation by Matthew
               Kirschenbaum, Doug Reside, and Alan Liu in late 2008.<note>See <ptr

               <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title> was co-authored by the writer William Gibson and
               the artist Dennis Ashbaugh, and published by Kevin Begos, Jr. in 1992. Described in
               contemporary press releases as a <quote rend="inline" source="#gibson1992"
                  >multi-unit artwork,</quote> it is difficult to classify, both physically and
               generically <ptr target="#gibson1992" loc="introduction"/>. It was originally sold in
               two versions: the deluxe version came wrapped in a shroud, its cover artificially
               aged and its pages scorched – <q>time-burned,</q> like the photo album described in
               Gibson’s poem, which functions as the central node of the work. Inside are etchings
               by Ashbaugh and double columns of DNA that ostensibly encode the genome of a fruitfly
                  <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="xi"/>. Nestled in the center of the book is a
               3 ½ inch floppy disk that contains a poem by Gibson, a meditation on time, memory,
               and decay. Its governing metaphor is that of the <emph>mechanism</emph>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">a trope,</quote> notes Matthew
               Kirschenbaum, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">that manifests itself
                  as a photograph album, a Kodak camera, a pistol, and a traffic light, as well as

               among other things, is about our misplaced faith in the permanence and objectivity of
               media. Like human memories, media distort, invent, and erase the very objects they’re
               designed to preserve: handwriting fades and becomes illegible, photographs break the
               fourth wall by constantly reminding us of the world that lies just outside the
               picture frame, and inert technological artifacts put up no resistance when new ones
               come along to replace or destroy them. Paradoxically, the speaker of the poem takes
               recourse in his own recollections to supplement the incomplete records of the past,
               records that were originally intended to compensate for the limitations of memory. By
               such a process, he tries to recapture, for instance, the smells of the saw-mill once
               owned by his father, whose <quote rend="inline" source="#gibson1992">tumbled boards
                  and offcuts</quote> are pictured in an old photograph <ptr target="#gibson1992"/>.
               Drawing on a synaesthetic imagination, he uses the visual stimulus to prompt an
               olfactory memory. This complex interplay between mechanism and memory structures the
               poem as a whole and shapes its manifold meanings.</p>
            <p>
               <title rend="italic">Agrippa’s</title> core themes are expressed through form as well
               as content: some of Ashbaugh’s etchings are overlaid with images printed in uncured
               toner, which are inevitably smudged and distort those beneath and facing them when
               the pages are turned <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="xi"/>. More stunningly, as
               has been often described, Gibson’s electronic poem is encrypted to scroll
               automatically down the screen once before being irrevocably lost, its text
               disappearing after a single reading. <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title> is
               therefore subjected, like all material objects, to the forces of decay, but here
               those forces are manufactured rather than natural, causing the work to disintegrate
               at an accelerated rate. Ashbaugh, in particular, took considerable delight in
               anticipating how this volatility would confound librarians, archivists, and
               conservators: as Gavin Edwards explains, to register the book's copyright, Ashbaugh
                  <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#edwards1992">would need to send two copies to the
                  Library of Congress. To classify it, they . . . [would] have to read it, and to
                  read it, they . . . [would have to] destroy it.</quote>
               <ptr target="#edwards1992"/></cit>. Significantly, however, it was not the librarians who
               found a workaround to the problem, but the pirates. On December 9, 1992, a group of
               New York University students, including one using the pseudonym of <q>Rosehammer</q>
               and another that of <q>Templar</q>, secretly video-recorded a live public performance
               of <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title> at The Americas Society, an art gallery and
               experimental performance space in New York City. After transcribing the poem, they
               uploaded it as a plain ASCII text to MindVox, a notorious NYC Bulletin Board, <q>the Hells Angels of Cyberspace,</q>
               according to Wikipedia, where it was readily available for download and quickly
               proliferated across the web. </p>
            <p>
               <title rend="quotes">The Hack,</title> as the incident has come to be called, is told
               with the hard-boiled suspense of a detective story by Matthew Kirschenbaum, who
               uncovered the details while working on his award-winning book <title rend="italic"
                  >Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</title>. For Kirschenbaum, the
               creation of the surreptitious recording marked a fork in the road for the NYU
               students: <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaumetal2008">What,</quote> he
               asks, <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaumetal2008">were Rosehammer and

                  source="#kirschenbaumetal2008">In 1992, of course, uploading the actual footage to
                  the Internet would have been impossible to contemplate from the standpoint of
                  storage and bandwidth (let alone with available means of playback). Therefore,
                  just the text of Gibson’s poem was manually transcribed and posted to the MindVox
                  BBS as a plain-text ASCII file, which allowed it to propagate rapidly across
                  bulletin boards, listservs, newsgroups, and FTP sites. Today, however, the footage
                  would have undoubtedly been posted direct to YouTube, Google Video . . . or some
                  other streaming media site, eliminating the need for scribal mediation. It is
                  worth remarking, then, that the brilliant act of low-tech, manual, and analog
                  transcription through which Rosehammer and Templar accomplished their <q>hack</q>
                  of <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title> (analog video copied by hand as text)
                  ineluctably dates <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title> as the product of a certain

            <p>In the final analysis, network throughput served as the arbiter of significant
               properties, forcing the hackers to attempt to distill <title rend="italic"
                  >Agrippa</title> down to its essence: a static 305-line
                  <q>semi-autobiographical</q> poem. If this austere version seems wholly incapable
               of functioning as a proper surrogate for the original, then it’s worth underscoring
               the role it played in bringing about the revival of <title rend="italic"
                  >Agrippa</title> through high-fidelity emulation of the software program.
               Reflecting on the web-based <title rend="quotes">Agrippa Files</title> archive where
               the disk image of the program now lives, Kirschenbaum explains its significance:
                  <quote rend="block" source="#kirschenbaumetal2008">These materials . . . offer a
                  kind of closure to anyone who, like me, has ever stumbled across the text of

                  it get there? Those mechanisms are now known and documented. So we take
                  satisfaction in the release of these new <title rend="quotes">Agrippa
                     files</title> (as it were) to scholars and fans alike, and we marvel that after
                  sixteen years in the digital wild a frail trellis of electromagnetic code once

            </p>
            <p>The example of <title rend="italic">Agrippa</title> reminds us that preservation
               sometimes courts moderate (and even extreme) loss as a hedge against total extinctive
               loss. It also indirectly shows us the importance of distributing the burden of
               preservation among the past, present, and future, with posterity enlisted as a
               preservation partner. However weak the information signal we send down the conductor
               of history, it may one day be amplified by a later age. </p>

               <p>There is a need for memory institutions interested in establishing video game
                  repositories to support policy positions and offer services that are better
                  aligned with the preservation and use practices of the game community, not only
                  because of the potential for integrating the members of this community into the
                  larger preservation network, but also because their attitudes and values may well
                  influence those of professional archivists in years to come. With their deep
                  curatorial investment in games, players have adopted a versatile set of approaches
                  for collecting, managing, and providing long-term access to these cultural
                  artifacts. While bitstream preservation and emulation are an essential part of the
                  overall picture to which gamers have made enormous contributions, so too are
                  re-releases, remakes, demakes, ports, mods, and ROM hacks.<note>
                     <q>Remake</q> and <q>demake</q> are game design terms coined by Ian Bogost. As
                     defined by Bogost, remakes <q>are recreations of earlier works, irrespective of the hardware platform of
                        original creation or recreation.</q> Conversely, demakes are <q>retro-inspired reimaginings of modern games, as if they had been created on
                        earlier hardware. Demakes are not necessarily created to run on older
                        machines, but their design and behavior are constrained by the real or
                        perceived constraints of vintage systems.</q> See Bogost’s spring 2010
                     syllabus for <title rend="quotes">Atari Hacks, Remakes and Demakes: Special

                  As a result, game archives in the wild often reflect notions of authenticity that
                  are different from those of memory institutions.<note>
                     <q>Archives in the wild</q> is a phrase coined by Jeremy John, et al. in the
                     British Library’s <title rend="italic">Digital Lives / Personal Digital

                  </note> While the dominant orientation of archivists is toward the stabilizing of
                  cultural records, gamers can tolerate, and indeed embrace, greater variability in
                  the objects with which they interact.<note>A notable exception to this argument,
                     however, is the Software Preservation Society, founded in 2001 by videogame

                     issued several diatribes against hacked, cracked, pirated, and otherwise

                  </note> The Mario Brothers franchise, for example, has persevered largely because
                  of the consumer appetite for new and altered game levels, powerups, graphics,
                  characters, and items. The <q>softer</q> view of authenticity that underlies these
                  strategies operates at what Seamus Ross would call a <cit><quote rend="inline"

               <p>What policy initiatives and preservation services might be adopted in response to
                  the needs, practices, and perspectives of players and player-archivists? We
                  propose the following:</p>
               <div>
                  <head>Digital Preservation Services: Comparative Methods and Stemmatics</head>
                  <p>In addition to providing authenticated capture, ingest, hashing, and storage
                     services for archival copies of games, digital repositories might also offer
                     appropriate services for access copies of games in the wild. Because these
                     copies are often modified rather than fixed representations and in line with
                     the <q>softer</q> canons of authenticity previously mentioned, repositories
                     could provide users and player-archivists with the means to analyze, document,
                     and measure their inter-relationships using similarity metrics and other
                     approaches.</p>
                  <p>Applying the techniques of digital stemmatics, archivists could help users
                     visualize and interpret these patterns in sophisticated ways. Developed in the
                     19th Century, stemmatics codified a set of methods for analyzing the filiation
                     of literary manuscripts. Significantly, the tree structures representing these
                     relationships have parallel importance in evolutionary biology and historical
                     linguistics, where they are used to group genomes or languages into families;
                     show how they relate to one another in genealogical terms; and reconstruct lost
                     archetypes <ptr target="#kraus2009"/>. Speculating on the role of digital
                     stemmatics (or phylogenetics, as the comparative method is called in biology)
                     in the context of personal digital archives, Jeremy John of the British Library
                     has postulated that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#john2010">future
                        researchers will be able to create phylogenetic networks or trees from
                        extant personal digital archives, and to determine the likely composition of
                        ancestral personal archives and the ancestral state of the personal digital
                        objects themselves</quote>
                     <ptr target="#john2010" loc="134"/></cit>. </p>
                  <p>Stemmatic methods have already been applied to board games: Joseph Needham, a
                     pioneering historian of East Asian science, technology, and culture, published
                     a family tree of board games connecting divination, liubo, and chess through a
                     long line of ancestry and descent <ptr target="#needham1962" loc="331"/>; and
                     biologist Alex Kraaijeveld has applied phylogenetics to variants of chess to
                     help determine its place of origin <ptr target="#kraaijeveld2000" loc="39–50"
                     />. The methodology therefore shows great promise for the study of video and
                     computer games in the wild, where variability rather than fixity of
                     representation is often the norm.</p>
                  <p>Two other tools cited recently by Jeremy John are also relevant in this

                  <head>Digital Preservation Services: Calculating Trust in Fan-Run Game
                     Repositories</head>
                  <p>Because game archives in the wild cannot usually be authenticated according to
                     standard integrity checks, an alternative method for evaluating the
                     authenticity of their holdings might involve the application of trust-based
                     information. Jennifer Golbeck, for example, has demonstrated how the trust
                     relationships expressed in web-based social networks can be calculated and used
                     to develop end-user services, such as film recommendations and email filtering
                        <ptr target="#golbeck2005"/>. Applying Golbeck’s insights, archivists could
                     leverage the trust values in online game communities as the basis for judgments
                     about the authority or utility of relevant user-run repositories, such as
                     abandonware sites and game catalogs. Under this scenario, authenticity is a
                     function of community trust in the content being provided. One consequence of
                     this approach is that authenticity and mutability need not be considered
                     mutually exclusive terms; on the contrary, fan-run game repositories that make
                     provisions for transformational use of game assets — such as altering the
                     appearance of avatars or inventory items — might in many instances increase
                     trust ratings.</p>

                  extant PLANETS initiative.<note>Keep Project (Keeping Emulation Environments

                  </note> One component of the system is Dioscuri, an emulator that is modular in
                  design: <q>modularity</q> in this context means that a range of standard hardware
                  components have each been individually emulated, creating a collection of
                  mini-emulators that in theory can be combined and extended in myriad ways to mimic
                  almost any imaginable computer architecture. Joguin’s signature contribution,
                  however, is a virtual computer small and simple enough to be continuously ported
                  to new platforms. One virtue of Olonys, as the system is called, is that it in
                  effect liberates emulators such as Dioscuri from hardware-specific environments,
                  allowing them to execute on any computer. It thus addresses one of the great
                  paradoxes of preservation through emulation: the need to create meta-emulators to
                  run already existing emulators, whose host systems will themselves expire in
                     time.<note>For more on Dioscuri and Olonys within the context of the KEEP

               <p>In its broad strokes, the trajectory of Joguin’s career – from video game
                  enthusiast to programmer hobbyist to dedicated digital preservationist – is
                  recapitulated in the trajectories of countless numbers of players, who over the
                  last two decades or more have been modeling community-driven practices and
                  solutions to collecting, documenting, accessing, and rendering video games,
                  arguably the most culturally resonant digital artifacts of our time. As we have
                  seen, there is no shortage of preservation challenges with which to contend: bit
                  rot, the scourge of technological obsolescence; the parasitic reliance of software
                  programs on code libraries supplied by the operating system and other software
                  packages; and the growing number of digital collections sitting on <quote

                     <term>limit case</term> of what we can do with digital preservation. If we can
                  figure out how to keep a classic first-person shooter alive, we’ll have a better
                  idea of how to preserve computational simulations of genetic evolution, climate
                  change, or the galactic behavior of star systems. Just as importantly, we’ll also
                  have the technical and social knowledge to maintain the billions of quotidian
                  electronic records — emails, memos, still images, sound files, videos, e-books,
                  instant messages — that constitute the collective memory of our civilization. </p>
               <p>To speak of the contribution of gamers exclusively in the future tense, however,

               <p>It is no accident that this tribute to the heroic efforts of the player community
                  comes at the conclusion of a chapter entitled <title rend="quotes">Ending the
                     Digital Dark Ages.</title> For Brand, video games serve as a skeleton key for
                  unlocking the complexities of digital preservation, empowering us to prevent an
                  epochal <q>digital black hole.</q> The import of his message is clear: for love of
                  space invaders and bonus fruits, of rescuing the girl and fighting and defeating
                  the boss; for love of treasure, power-ups, and sprites; for love of all these
                  things, players have been inspired to save our video game inheritance. But in the
                  process of salvaging these fragile 8-bit worlds, they have also helped save some
                  of the real world. Like the technology trees found in popular strategy games,
                  where the acquisition of one technology is dependent on that of another, the
                  solution to any of the superthreats conjured by McGonigal, from pandemics to fuel
                  shortages to mass exile, is predicated on methods for reliably transmitting
                  legacies of knowledge from one generation to the next. When those legacies are
                  encoded as bitstreams, it is video game players who have been in the vanguard of
                  figuring out how to do it, bolstering McGonigal’s assertion that gamers are a
