         <p>Ross was born in Fredericksburg, VA on March 31, 1960. He graduated from the Tilton
            School in Tilton, New Hampshire in 1978 and from the College of William and Mary in 1982
            with a major in Classics and Philosophy. He earned a PhD in 1990 in Classical Studies at
            the University of Texas at Austin. In 1988 he participated in the summer program at the
            American Academy in Rome, and in 1985 was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship for a year of
            study at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece.</p>
         <p>From 1991 to the time of his death, Ross was on the faculty at the University of
            Kentucky in the Department of Modern and Classical Languages, Literature, and Cultures
            where he taught courses on women in the ancient world, Greek art, Aristophanes, and the
            Greek historians, as well as Greek and Latin language courses.</p>
         <p>A pioneer in using computer technology to advance scholarship in the humanities, Ross is
            perhaps best known as the founding editor of the <ref target="http://www.stoa.org/">Stoa
               Consortium for Electronic Publication in the Humanities</ref>. The Stoa, established
            in 1997, set the standard for Open Access publication of digital humanities work in the
            classics, serving as an umbrella project for many diverse projects that provide
            functionality, and have requirements, not supported by traditional (print) publishers.
            In addition to providing Open Access publication for the work of other scholars, Ross
            strived to make his own work (and the raw materials behind that work) available freely
            to others. He was the co-creator of <title rend="italic">Diotima: Materials for the
               Study of Women and Gender in the Ancient World</title> and of the <title
               rend="italic">Neo-Latin Colloquia collection</title>, both of which are published on
            The Stoa.</p>
         <p>According to his principled belief in Open Access, Ross was always a stern critic of
            models of scholarship that were needlessly exclusionary in their presentation or
            implementation. He firmly believed in the potential afforded by technology to bring the
            highest levels of scholarship to the widest possible audience, and in the obligation of
            learned societies to make their work freely available to all interested readers.</p>
         <p>Ross’s influence is most noticeable in his long-standing belief in the power of
            collaborative work. With humor, generosity, and a keen editor’s discretion, he worked
            throughout his career to build working relationships among an international circle of
            collaborators, for his own projects, as well as for others. As a founding editor of the
            Suda On Line, a web accessible database for work on Byzantine Greek lexicography, Ross
            helped to build a framework that allowed a large number of people to work together on a
            single edition. SOL was founded in 1998 at a time when such large-scale collaborative
            editing was rare, if not unheard of. The influence of the SOL is still being felt as the
            next generation of collaborative editing tools are being developed. Ross had long-term
            associations with Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies, the Perseus Project, and more
            recently with the Digital Classicist. Those who knew him will remember him for his
            generosity and willingness to offer advice, and for his ability to see connections and
            build bridges between projects and people.</p>
         <p>Most recently, Ross was instrumental in forging the collaboration that resulted in the
            high resolution digital imaging of the Venetus A, a 10th century manuscript of the
               <title rend="italic">Iliad</title> located at the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice, and
            was a co-Principal Investigator of project EDUCE, which aims to use non-invasive,
            volumetric scanning technologies for virtually <q>unwrapping</q> and visualizing ancient
            papyrus scrolls. Since July, 2005 Ross has been the director of the Collaboratory for
            Research in Computing for Humanities, a research unit at the University of Kentucky
            which provides technical assistance to faculty who wish to undertake humanities
            computing projects, and to encourage and support interdisciplinary partnerships between
            faculty at UKY and researchers around the world.</p>
         <p>His many interests included sailing in the Northern Neck of Virginia, hunting, cooking,
            woodworking, and photography.</p>
         <p>Ross was the proud father of three sons, Lincoln (16), Adrian (13), and Russell (9). In
            addition, Ross is survived by his wife, Cathy Edwards Scaife, his parents, William and
            Sylvia Scaife, and three siblings, Bill Scaife, Susan Duerksen, and John Scaife, as well
            as their spouses and children.</p>
