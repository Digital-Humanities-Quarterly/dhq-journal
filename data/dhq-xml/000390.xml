            <p>The advent of handheld digital devices has proved to be revolutionary for the
               teaching of art history. They make it possible to supplement, even replace, the
               traditional format of lecturing and communal viewing of a single screen. On their
               personal screens, students can enter a searchable world of thousands of virtual
               images: what the radical art theorist and novelist André Malraux, more than half a
               century ago, called <soCalled>the imaginary museum.</soCalled> For several years, I
               have been experimenting with my art history classes, showing my students how to use
               their laptops, tablets and phones to become active viewers and collaborators.</p>
            <p>Multiple virtual images transform the content, as well as the environment, of
               learning art history. Rather than being restricted to the illustrations in a
               textbook, students can use their devices to engage with online image sources such as
               museum websites, image databanks, and auction houses. Portable digital technology can
               turn the art history classroom into a collaborative and dynamic experience
               inconceivable a short time ago. Malraux himself, who believed in the power of art to
               transcend time and space, might be amazed at what is now not only possible, but
               commonplace.</p>

         <head>Introduction</head>
         <p>Let me begin with a photograph taken in November 2014. A group of high school students
            in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam are looking at their phones instead of at Rembrandt’s
               <title rend="italic">Nightwatch</title> looming above them. <figure xml:id="figure01">

                  with permission of the photographer.</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.jpg"/>
               <figDesc/>
            </figure>
            <quote source="#canonical" rend="inline">A metaphor of the times,</quote> was a common
            lament, as almost a thousand people copied and shared the image within a day. The
            photographer, Gijsbert van der Wal, later commented, <quote rend="inline"
               source="#undocumented">It went viral, with people often adding rather dispirited
               captions: today’s youth is more interested in Whatsapp than they are in
               Rembrandt.</quote></p>
         <p>The public later learned that the students were using their phones to research an
            assignment on the painting <ptr target="#molloy2016"/>. It is generally assumed that the
            act of looking down at a phone instead of one’s surroundings shows inattention, a
            surrender to distraction, a hopeless nullification of social and intellectual
            engagement. But in fact, using a smartphone tablet, or laptop can be a way of connecting
            privately, but actively, with the larger world of ideas and images.</p>
         <p>I would like to discuss some ways I make use of that private connection for teaching
            undergraduate art history, using personal digital devices in the classroom. My goal is
            twofold: to change the culture of the classroom space; and to expand the traditional
            materials of teaching art history from a limited group of images to the vast,
            ever-changing body of images on the Internet. Digital technology allows students to hold
            much of the known history of art in their hands: a contemporary version of what André
            Malraux once called the imaginary museum.</p>
         <div>
            <head>Malraux and the <soCalled>imaginary museum</soCalled></head>
            <p>André Malraux (1901-1976) used his French government position as Minister of Cultural
               Affairs to create an ambitious art-historical project, a multi-volume illustrated
               collection of world art: <title rend="italic">La musée imaginaire</title>
               (translated, into English, as <q>museum without walls</q>). Malraux’s original idea
               was to create a museum of scale color reproductions, to distribute for display
               throughout the French provinces. Since this proved unworkable, he ended up with the
               idea of a book <ptr target="#grasskamp2016" loc="145"/>. The vision of
               photographically reproduced objects, removed from their chronological and cultural
               context and made available to the general public, has obvious parallels with today’s
               world of digital images. </p>
            <p>There are several well-known photographs of Malraux posing with his pictures, taken
               during a single session in 1953. In one image, he is on the floor, in rapt
               contemplation of a photograph of an artwork from among the many scattered around him.
                  <figure xml:id="figure02">
                  <head>Writer Andre Malraux poses in his house in Boulogne near Paris, working at

               </figure> I have chosen this image because he enacts an experience common to today’s
               users of digital technology: utter involvement, giving oneself over to a pictorial
               display, and to seemingly infinite choice.</p>
            <p>Malraux’s synchronic approach to the world’s art was the force behind other, similar
               twentieth-century projects.<note> In the early 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
                  century there was a general European fascination with <soCalled>world
                     art</soCalled> which led to the publications of several world art series along
                  with Malraux’s <ptr target="#grasskamp2016" loc="88–120"/>.</note> Aby Warburg’s
               Bilderatlas Mnemosyne (1927-29) assembled images, from disparate sources, displayed
               without captions on panels <ptr target="#johnson2012"/>. This taxonomy of universal
               culture expressed as a visual repository extended beyond art history; for example,
               the peace activist Paul Otlet created the Munduneum project of 1934, a world library
               system that anticipated the field of information science <ptr target="#vanacker2011"
               />. The notion of linear order, as well as that of classification by time and place,
               could be undone by the leveling power of photographic reproduction on a large scale.
               As Stefka Hristova and others have pointed out, digital technology simply increases
               this capability, revealing the historiographic prescience of Warburg’s cultural
               analytics <ptr target="#hristova2016"/>.<note> Although Walter Benjamin’s famous
                  essay <title rend="italic">The Work of Art in an Age of Mechanical
                     Reproduction</title> mourns the loss of the object’s <soCalled>aura</soCalled>
                  or original context and meaning, these projects were enabled by photographic
                  reproduction. See <ptr target="#grasskamp2016" loc="149–50"/>, on the link between
                  Warburg and Malraux; and <ptr target="#grasskamp2016" loc="42–45"/> on their
                  connection with Benjamin. Writing in the 1980s, before the explosion of digital
                  imagery with which we now live, Werner Hofmann proposed that the late 20<hi
                     rend="superscript">th</hi>-century ubiquity of images was far greater than
                  anything Benjamin might have imagined <ptr target="#hofmann1988"/>.</note></p>
            <p>The Wunderkammern or Cabinets of Curiosities amassed by European connoisseurs during
               the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the forerunners of museums. Along with
               objects and artworks of all kinds, they included reproductive prints, which
               functioned as collectible works of art in their own right <ptr target="#impey2001"/>.
               Their catalogues and archives were, in a sense, the first true virtual museums. In
               the eighteenth century a fashion developed for <soCalled>paper museums</soCalled> and
                  <soCalled>portable galleries,</soCalled> small-format bound books using printed
               reproductions of artworks <ptr target="#bickendorf2010"/>. These, like
               twentieth-century photographic reproductions, were surrogates for physical museum
               visits. </p>
            <p>In adopting Malraux’s phrase, I mean to evoke the virtual or latent
                  <soCalled>museum</soCalled> that exists in cyberspace, based on both physical
               spaces and the <soCalled>paper museums</soCalled> or <soCalled>portable
                  galleries</soCalled> of the past; the democratization of images; and the
               disruption of time and space which are the traditional organizing factors for the
               teaching of art history. I also want to call attention to the pun on <q>imaginary</q>
               – meaning images as opposed to actual physical objects. I can think of no better
               homage to the past than the borrowing of Malraux’s concept for portable devices, with
               the enormous amount of pictorial data, and hence power, they contain.</p>

            <head>Museums and their digital identities: enabling the imaginary in the real.</head>
            <p>Just as Malraux’s book brought a virtual museum into being, today’s museums use
               digital technology, after centuries of development as cultural edifices, to enhance
               the experience of their audiences. In describing museums’ adoption of digital
               technology (some with hesitation, others wholeheartedly) Hubertus Kohle points out
               that standards of appropriateness for the consumption of art are constantly changing.
               Printed books were once perceived as a threat to manuscripts. In academic lectures,
               looking at slides of artworks was once considered <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#kohl2015">a betrayal of art… the digital file as the
                     most universal medium ought to stand at the head of the value chain</quote>
                  <ptr target="#kohle2015" loc="317, 319"/>
               </cit>. At this point, digital technology not only controls documentation, archiving,
               sales, and auctions, but is a tool of cultural transformation, creating a <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#kohle2015">“change in the role of the museum
                     curator, namely from the status of unassailable preceptor to the position of
                     moderator, engaging with increasingly emancipated users</quote>
                  <ptr target="#kohle2015" loc="320"/>
               </cit>. </p>
            <p>Museum websites, like the Metropolitan Museum’s Timeline of Art History, which
               includes thematic essays, are not only repositories but complex, interactive
               educational sites, often used by educators to supplement or replace traditional
               textbooks. Many museums have also opened their collections as searchable databases
               and created tours on mobile phones. The ongoing Smithsonian Learning Labs explore
               ways to help K-12 students gain access to previous inaccessible objects and engage
               with them in and out of the classroom <ptr target="#milligan2017"/>. SF MOMA’s app,
               Sendme SFMOMA, allows the public to make informal requests for types of images, using
               keywords, or even an emoji. MOMA then sends the user a text of an image from its vast
               collection. As the museum’s creative technologist writes: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mollica2017">When you say <q>Send me a landscape</q>
                     you won’t get 791 landscapes, you'll get a landscape chosen just for you. You
                     may one day be able to visit your landscape in SFMOMA’s galleries, or you may
                     be the only person to see it for years to come</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mollica2017"/>
               </cit>.<note> New job titles such as <q>Creative Technologist</q> reflect the
                  transformation of museums through their adoption of digital platforms for audience
                  outreach and engagement as well as archival and curatorial practices. <ref

                     >https://www.museumsandtheweb.com/jobs-available-and-wanted/</ref></note> While
               the decision of which image to send is still top-down and out of the users’ control,
               users are still vouchsafed hidden treasures for private use.</p>
            <p>Museums are also creating ways for museumgoers to become, in Kohle’s words,
                  <soCalled>emancipated</soCalled> from being passive receivers to curators
               themselves. On the Rijksmuseum website, users can open accounts to create their own
               personal galleries (<foreign xml:lang="nl">rijksstudios</foreign>) of works from the
               collection, using a multitude of search terms including colors, subjects, and general
               themes as well as chronology and medium. Images and whole <foreign xml:lang="nl"
                  >rikjsstudios</foreign> can be searched and shared among users, similar to the
               model of Pinterest and Flickr.<note> Wim Pijbes, the Rijksmuseum’s forward-thinking
                  director, describes some of these strategies in an engaging TedX talk <ptr

            <head>Combining the physical and the virtual: teaching art history</head>
            <p>The trend of emancipating museum audiences is analogous to the changing experience of
               the classroom. Teachers of art history have always faced an existential challenge, as
               Stephen Murray puts it, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#murray2011">talking about what is not there — the
                     absent work of art, represented by a surrogate image projected onto a

                  <ptr target="#murray2011"/>
               </cit>. Our currency has always been a limited version of Malraux’s imaginary museum;
               it is inescapably based on the capability of the current image technology, whether
               photography, slides, or computer-generated images <ptr target="#nelson2000"/>.</p>
            <p>The digital revolution within art history has progressed more quickly with research
               than with teaching. Less than a decade ago, many art historians were still ambivalent
               about the uses of digital technology even for their research, let alone for teaching
                  <ptr target="#zorich2012"/>. A few years later, most art historians reported

               teaching lagged behind research. Stephen Murray had already exhorted art history

               <ptr target="#harris2016"/>. They point out the lack of institutional support for,
               and information about, digital pedagogy, which the online resource AHTR (Art History

            <p>The transformation of classroom culture – as opposed to the transformation of image
               access – has generated more controversy. Some professors venture to predict that

               dismantle, rather than enhance, higher education in the near future. <cit>

            <p>Along with this general anxiety about the changing culture of teaching and learning,
               there continues to be ambivalence in the educational community regarding students’
               use of personal technology in classrooms. Over the past several years, there has been
               a spate of articles and online forums concerning the use, or banning, of smartphones
               in classrooms, especially at the middle and high school levels <ptr
                  target="#barnwell2016"/>.</p>
            <p>College instructors face a similar dilemma. A study from MIT, for example, shows that
               students, especially in large lecture halls, became distracted by their mobile
               devices and did less well academically <ptr target="#strausheim2016"/>. One teacher
               has cogently summarized the issue: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#barnwell2016">So, is the best learning environment
                     one that’s free from digital distractions for struggling learners — a refuge

                     realities of a hyper-connected world in which the vast majority of students
                     carry access to almost-infinite information in their pockets? Or is there a

               </cit> There is a growing consensus that if students are required to pay attention to
               a lecture, and they have their phones, then of course they will turn to their phones. </p>
            <p>Much of the discussion about smartphones in the classroom is predicated on the
               pedagogical model of a lecture class. Many educators feel that the lecture format,
               where students listen to an instructor and take notes, images or no images, too
               easily turns them into passive receivers of information. <cit>

            <head>The imaginary museum in the classroom</head>
            <p>In February 2009, I began experimenting with students’ access to images and how they
               might interact with them. I started allowing students to use their laptops in the
               classroom, employing their personal screens to supplement what was on the communal
               screen with comparisons, or extra material. For example, I would have them do
               targeted image searches of specific artworks as additional comparisons. </p>
            <p>(At the time I was working in relative isolation; almost everyone at my institution
               banned digital devices in class, if they used digital technology at all; and among my
               few peers in teaching with digital technology, I was the only art historian. Most of
               my colleagues in art history outside my institution were extremely wary, if not
               hostile, about allowing students to use, or even bring, their devices in the
               classroom. Compounding this problem was the absence of a centralized forum for
               sharing digital teaching strategies, as I described earlier. I presented some of my
               practices for the first time in 2014.<note>

            <p>I began expanding the canon of classroom images more dramatically in the spring of
               2010, after a visit to the Brera Gallery in Milan. While walking through a
               proliferation of largely Milanese artists, many unknown to me, whose work was of
               varying quality, I observed formulas, the constants and the variables: what patrons
               expected of artists; how the artists then solved problems of composition, form,
               dramatic and emotional interest, and introduced innovations to stand out from their
               competitors. </p>
            <p>It occurred to me that this overview was a way to teach art history. While this kind
               of synoptic understanding can be gained cumulatively over time, by looking at
               objects, books, museum catalogues and so on, the <emph>simultaneous</emph> view of so
               many different objects is an important factor in understanding them in a new way.
               Like many other teachers of art history, I had long been frustrated with the teaching
               model in which students are invited to view a limited set of objects. Relying solely
               on this canon risks the possibility that students will think each object they see is
               a kind of limiting case, unique and inimitable.<note> This model has developed
                  entirely out of the limits of visual technology before the digital revolution. It
                  has also depended on an outdated copyright model which has done a great deal to
                  strangle expansion of the canon in print and hence, in teaching. Revisions to this
                  system of image <soCalled>ownership</soCalled> are ongoing. Museums and libraries

                  common. As Harris and Zucker put it, <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#harris2015">For the first time in history we can

               right in the classroom? Ideally, with this exposure to a great volume of artworks,
               students could get a sense of larger trends in art and a more nuanced understanding
               of artistic practice in a given place and time. What I conceived as a kind of aerial
               view has since been described as the concept of <q>distant reading,</q> applied not

            <p>In one of my earliest experiments, as part of a class on Baroque and Rococo art, I
               started by introducing a canonical image, Antoine Watteau’s <title rend="italic"
                  >Embarkation to Cythera</title>. I asked students to search for Watteau on
               Artstor. <figure xml:id="figure03">
                  <head>Screenshot of an Artstor search for <title rend="quotes">Watteau</title>

                  <figDesc>/</figDesc>
               </figure> They became accustomed to Watteau’s inventive subject matter, blending of
               fantasy and observation, his brushwork, choice of colors, and so on. I asked them
               some questions about their findings: what elements in common could they see? What
               conclusions could they come to? Their understanding of an artist’s approach to his
               material was based on viewing the entire <foreign xml:lang="fr">oeuvre</foreign>.
               Since then, this full-<foreign xml:lang="fr">oeuvre</foreign> approach has become a
               standard part of my teaching, both in class and in online work.</p>
            <p>In another exercise, I have students use simple image searches to find, say, thirty
               different seventeenth-century European landscape paintings. <figure xml:id="figure04">

                  <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.jpg"/>
                  <figDesc/>
               </figure> (In this instance, from 2012, they are using Google Image Search; these
               days I have them use searchable museum databases, or the Smarthistory image
               collections on Flickr). After studying them for a while, usually around fifteen
               minutes, they are asked to consider questions such as: how do these landscapists
               integrate nature and human activity? How much of this landscape is imaginary, and how
               much based on observation? Could they observe any repeated formulas in composition?
               Choices of elements, such as trees, mountains, buildings, bodies of water? Could they
               find elements of classical fantasy? Naturalistic architecture? Staffage? And so on.
               In formulating answers, written or oral, they learn what being a professional
               landscape painter meant in early modern Europe: solving problems of form and
               composition, of depicting individuals, themes or stories, using available formulas
               that were deemed acceptable to buyers and colleagues alike, or trying out into
               something new.</p>
            <p>I experimented with integrating old with new technologies, and communal learning with
               private discovery. In one early example of this integration, from 2012, I displayed
               Van Gogh’s <title rend="italic">Starry Night</title>, always a student favorite,
               after having made some spontaneous notes on a whiteboard about Impressionism and
               Post-Impressionism. <figure xml:id="figure05">

               </figure> Then I put the students in groups, to share laptops, and search for
                  <q>eighteenth-century landscapes,</q> so they could grasp the previous tradition
               of landscapes. </p>
            <p>While I still provide a core group of objects every week, to create a very basic
               context of images for a given topic, period, or place, I emphasize repeatedly that
               this is a very small sampling. When supervising, or rather enabling these searches, I
               spend the time asking questions, helping them find images, moving all over the
                  classroom.<note> This particular semester I was lucky enough to be assigned a
                  classroom with movable chairs; this would be difficult in a more traditional
                  lecture hall, where the seats are bolted to the floor, imprisoning the students
                  and isolating them from one another. The issue of classroom design, beyond the
                  scope of this essay, has become more urgent due to advances in digital
                  pedagogy.</note> I tend to stand behind them rather than in front of them, viewing
               the same screens they do; I see them practicing, rather than absorbing, art
                  history.<note> I have described a similar solution, when the classroom digital
                  projector malfunctioned before a test, in <title rend="quotes">When the projector
                     fails,</title> a post on the Art History Teaching Resources website <ptr
                     target="#hollander2018"/>. </note></p>
            <p>The groups then report on their findings, learning on their own what I could have
               shown them communally (and sometimes still do). They would report briefly in an oral
               presentation, though this was logistically difficult in a large class. With the
               adoption of visual commentary tool Voicethread in 2011, I was able to solve this
               problem while adding a further digital component. <note> The Voicethread app permits
                  commentary in several formats – text, audio and video – on a variety of media.
                  Participants can also upload their own media, which gives students the chance to
                  curate actively as well as responding with commentary to an assigned image. <title

                  implications for pedagogy are broad. See, for example, Janice Robertson’s

               Voicethread, which we could share online, and if I choose, on the communal screen.
               Voicethread searches could also be quite simple. For example, I begin by asking
               groups of students to choose one example each of works created in all the materials
               and media used in the Renaissance, include full data on the objects, and describe the
               use of the material. <figure xml:id="figure06">

            <p>The outcomes of my ongoing experiments are difficult to isolate and quantify. This is
               because I have been combining the use of personal digital devices and broad image
               searches with other practices. These include having students post weekly Voicethreads
               to comment on readings and videos; creating <soCalled>open-book</soCalled> exams
               using problem-solving and analysis to test research skills rather than memorization;
               having students choose a few objects from auction websites to illustrate thematic
               questions.</p>
            <p>On the whole, my classroom has become a more varied and lively environment in the
               nine years since I first began enhancing my teaching with interactive digital
               technology. My students are more relaxed; their interest has increased; their
               analytical skills have improved. (While there are always times when their attention
               will wander, they usually are too busy using their devices for classroom work to text
               or check news for very long.) In particular, their grasp of style is especially good;
               when doing <soCalled>unknown</soCalled> identifications on quizzes, their performance
               is very high. Their visual memories are apparently stimulated after several weeks of
               developing their digitally created banks of images. Their grades have gone up, on
               average from a B- average to B/B+. I look forward to refining and expanding these
               practices, especially in the expansive and collaborative state of art history
               pedagogy today.</p>
            <p>Recently I had the rare privilege of teaching a class entirely at the Metropolitan
               Museum. We met once a week for three hours. We would begin by reviewing the day’s
               assignment, downloaded from the course website on their smartphones. They would then
               explore the different areas of the museum, while answering a series of thematic
               questions and choosing objects they encountered as examples. (For the unit on the
               Baroque, for example: How was art affected by global trade and new scientific
               knowledge about time and space? How did <soCalled>passions</soCalled> theory, the
               Counter-Reformation, and the new study of classical archaeology affect the production
               of art? What methods and devices did artists use to express political power and
               reinforce religious faith?)</p>
            <p> They consulted the museum’s Timeline of Art History, the collection database. Later
               in the day, they gathered in a central space and worked on an in-class Voicethread
               discussion, based on the objects they had already encountered. <figure

               amused by the photograph and its reception.) Near the end of the class, I turned them
               loose in the museum’s public Nolen Library, where they could do research for their
               final projects. <figure xml:id="figure08">

               </figure>(Figure 8) They used books and periodicals as well as online sources. They
               loved this final unit of the course and were quite comfortable moving between
               traditional and newer technologies. In this photograph, they can be seen using
               smartphones, books, and a notepad.</p>
            <p>I offer this example of my students in the museum to suggest that the private
               encounter with a huge proliferation of images, enabled by digital technology, need
               not dilute the experience of encountering objects, nor does it entirely replace
               earlier technologies. Rather, it encourages a form of simultaneous cognition,
               expanding the parochial definition of attention just as it enlarges the traditional
               use of a classroom.<note> Multiple screens, for example, do not necessary impair
                  attentiveness. See <ptr target="#segijn2017"/></note> Smartphones (and tablets,
               and so on) can be, in Pamela Fletcher’s phrase, <cit>
                  <quote source="#fletcher2015" rend="inline">machines for thinking with, rather
                     than replacements for thinking</quote>

               </cit>. </p>
            <p>What constitutes distraction as opposed to associative or divided thinking? How would
               we characterize a habit of mind enabled by personal digital devices? Surely the
               question of distraction involves the question, distraction from what? And in favor of
               what? As I began with the image of children under the <title rend="italic"
                  >Nightwatch,</title> studying their screens, I will end with the image of Malraux
               lying on his carpet (<ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>). Malraux, peering at the
               reproduced objects of world art arrayed on his living room floor, is also distracted
               – from his grand piano, from the drink on a tray, from the vase of tulips, objects
               appealing to senses other than sight – but even from the much larger reproduction
               propped in front of the window; and from the window itself. It is this raptness of
               attention to a multiplicity of images, and the contemplation of a chosen image from
               that crowd, that I continue to engage and guide in my students. As I refine and
               adjust my teaching, I continue to offer the possibility of focusing this hunger, this
               potential for enchantment, on art, encouraging work and play in the imaginary
               museum.</p>
