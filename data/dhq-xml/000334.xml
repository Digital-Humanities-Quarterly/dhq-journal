        <body>
            <p>Putting together this special issue, we as editors were driven by the question of how
                the digital humanities now conceptualizes the role of undergraduate students in the
                discipline. As the field continues to develop, it gains a foothold in existing
                curricula and engages in building up its own, discipline-specific courses and
                programs. Our hunch was that, in a field meticulously concerned with defining itself
                and with reconsidering hierarchy and labour, the development of pedagogical
                practices would elicit the same critical scrutiny. The articles and case studies
                collected here certainly evince this assumption, and the ways they do so are as
                numerous as the institutional contexts in which their authors find themselves. </p>
            <p>In his now canonical introduction to <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities
                    Pedagogy: Practices, Principles and Politics</title> (2012), Brett D. Hirsch
                points out that the discipline of DH is especially primed to be a location for
                critical pedagogy. He notes that the symbiotic nature of the teaching-research
                relationship, fostered as it is by <q>collectivity and collaboration in pursuit of
                    knowledge,</q> is crucial to the development of a critical pedagogy. He goes on
                to call for a movement of <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#hirsch2012">pedagogy beyond the brackets, out of marginalization and
                        exclusion to the fore of the digital humanities</quote>
                    <ptr target="#hirsch2012" loc="16; 6"/>
                </cit>. Hirsch is particularly indebted to Paulo Freire, who, in <title rend="italic">Pedagogy of the Oppressed</title> (1968, 2000), posits a model of
                radical pedagogy that challenges the power structures inherent in established
                educational models. Freire urges us to be at all times aware of the power dynamics
                in our pedagogical spaces <ptr target="#freire2000"/>. In the same moment as Hirsch,
                Ann Burdick et al. sketch the pragmatic and methodological foundations of DH
                research in <title rend="italic">digital_humanities</title> (2012), acknowledging in
                addition the potential of DH pedagogy. For these scholars, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">additional outcomes produced by hands-on, experiential, and
                        project-based learning through doing” can allow students to “think
                        critically with digital methods</quote>
                    <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="134"/>
                </cit>. We perceive these texts as some of the foundational moments in DH as a
                discipline, and their publication suggests the close complicity of the
                practicalities of skillsets, project-based learning, and experience–articulated by
                Burdick et al.–and the theoretical concerns of belonging, hierarchy, and
                politics–championed by Hirsch. Since this moment, initiatives like the Digital
                Pedagogy Lab’s flagship journal, <title rend="italic">Hybrid Pedagogy</title>
                <ptr target="#digpedlab2011"/> and the Humanities, Arts, Sciences, and Technology
                Alliance and Collaboratory initiative <ptr target="#hastac"/>, as well as the UCLA
                    <title rend="italic">Student Collaborator’s Bill of Rights</title>
                <ptr target="#scbr2015"/>, have foregrounded the theoretical question of
                undergraduate student belonging by articulating the practicalities of students’
                working conditions and rights to ownership over their work. Scholars like Katherine
                M. Faull and Diane Jakacki continue this trend, looking to the multiple contexts of
                DH pedagogy to support the development of humanistic habits of mind, insisting that
                the involvement of undergraduate students across the classroom, research, and
                employment contexts of DH are necessary for this vision of education <ptr target="#faull2015"/>. </p>
            <p>In keeping with the energy and intent of this movement in digital humanities
                pedagogy, we have sought to bring other thinkers into dialogue with this work. As
                editors and contributors, we recognize that part of a critical engagement with our
                classrooms necessitates interrogating the identity categories central to them, and
                we have looked to similar work being done in parallel fields as a means of
                cross-pollination. Chief among this work is that of Claire Bishop, an art historian
                whose critical assessment of participatory art, and specifically pedagogic
                participatory art, has addressed the way this mode of artistic expression seeks to
                deconstruct and disturb the established identity category of the viewer <ptr target="#bishop2012"/>. At the same time that Bishop recognises in pedagogic
                participatory art the potential to disturb the traditional boundary between the
                artwork and the consumer, she also remains vigilant to the ways in which such
                disturbance can be co-opted for political purposes antithetical to the original
                intention. In both crafting the framework for this special issue, and in thinking
                through our own digital humanities pedagogy, we have returned to Bishop’s work for
                its recognition of pedagogy’s radical potential to disrupt hierarchies through
                challenging established understandings of key identity categories. Similarly, we
                also respond to Bishop’s caution and call for critical awareness regarding how ideas
                of viewer (or student) agency can tend towards the support, rather than the
                challenging, of neo-liberal political ideologies. </p>
            <p>The interrelated question of theory and practice that we have traced here resonates,
                unsurprisingly, with the perpetual hack vs. yack debate of DH. However, what is
                foregrounded by a growing body of scholarship on DH pedagogy and the broader
                contexts we wish to bring it into conversation with is the fact that hack and yack
                inform one another. Of all research practices, pedagogical research is most
                difficult to separate from the tacit knowledges of the classroom. In this issue, the
                    <soCalled>hack</soCalled> of DH undergraduate education provides the writers
                with subject matter and occasion, and their articles are yoked to the robust
                    <soCalled>yack</soCalled> by means of the articles’ and case studies’
                theoretical frameworks. Many of the contributions provide accounts of pedagogical
                practice, accompanied by the assignment guidelines and program description
                documentation that testify to it; in so doing contributors underscore the way in
                which our lecture halls, classrooms, and labs are the locations in which we see our
                theoretical concepts made manifest. </p>
            <p>Across these contributions, we can trace three key ideas that recur, and which we
                understand to be central to this Special Issue’s investigation of DH’s positioning
                of the undergraduate: agency, literacies, and scale. In line with Hirsch, Freire,
                and Bishop, perhaps the most pressing thematic issue to emerge in this collection is
                that of <term>agency</term> in undergraduate student belonging. The contributors to
                this issue have put this concern in various ways–Caitlin Christian-Lamb and Anelise
                Shrout sketch <q>a theoretical model that centers student agency</q>; Janelle
                Jenstad, Kim McLean-Fiander, and Kathryn McPherson maintain that investing students
                with autonomy produces high-quality work; our own contribution proposes a
                scholar-citizen model in order to communicate the nature and responsibilities of
                belonging and participation in scholarly community. Complementing this focus on the
                question of student agency, Andrew Bretz reminds us of how the problem of faculty
                contingency intersects with this discussion. Many of the essays in this issue evince
                current scholarship’s continued indebtedness to Freire and Hirsch. They also
                indicate that the question of student agency is far from settled, and that
                scholarship on undergraduate students in DH will need to map considerations of
                agency onto the circumstances in which they teach. </p>
            <p>Literacies emerge in these essays as key components in a skillset that facilitates
                agency. Nearly all of our contributors respond, whether overtly or implicitly, to
                Marc Prensky’s 2001 description of the <soCalled>digital native,</soCalled> the
                argument that a radical shift in technology has likewise produced a radical schism
                between digital native students and digital immigrant instructors, two groups whose
                divergent fluencies in the digital are close to irreconcilable <ptr target="#prensky2001"/>. Although much scholarly energy has been spent
                complicating and debunking Prensky’s assertions, researchers in DH pedagogy still
                position themselves in relation or opposition to his ideas, indicating that the work
                of theorizing the undergraduate in DH is also one of refining our understandings of
                their relationship to the digital. Similarly, many of the articles in this issue
                turn their attention towards the way that undergraduate participation in DH relates
                to traditional humanistic education. Specifically, literacies emerge as a core
                educational concept in digital and cultural education alike (Kara Kennedy), with
                literacy in Renaissance Drama (Janelle Jenstad et al.; Laura Estill) and e-lit
                (Alexandra Saum-Pascual) provided as particular examples. </p>
            <p>Literacies, however, frequently prove to be contingent upon the circumstances and
                infrastructure of DH pedagogy, and among these factors questions of scale — time
                scale, classroom size, size of student contribution, or institutional
                reach — dominate. As a result of the restricted time frame of the semester-long course
                and the often introductory knowledge that students must gain about discipline or
                method, much of what this issue discusses is necessarily on a smaller scale than the
                promises of major DH research projects. Further, the articles at hand tend to be
                concerned with streams within curricula, scaffolding of single courses, and
                assignments (James O’Sullivan et al., Adriana Álvarez Sánchez et al., Brandon Locke,
                Kara Kennedy, Shannon E. Kelley, Laura Estill). This further restriction may
                indicate that DH programs are still in their infancy insofar as institutional
                purchase — that instructors and program developers are starting small with a view to
                building to minors, majors, and programs — or it may indicate that a smaller scale has
                produced particularly generative environments for DH learning. In addition, many
                contributors think about scale in terms of the coordination of digital spaces and
                communities across aspects of large institutions (Danica Savonick and Lisa
                Tagliaferri; Alexander Christie, Aaron Mauro et al.), or the development of robust
                resources that can be deployed in individual classroom settings (Jenstad et al). In
                terms of infrastructural scale, then, DH pedagogy seems to be at a crossroads: the
                infrastructure that supports the individual classroom appears to be expanding, while
                the challenges of the boutique-sized classroom persist. </p>
            <p>The boutique scale of student work in addition to programming context may evince a
                further impulse in DH undergraduate pedagogy to seek a bite-sized approach to the
                field, a small-scale impulse that contrasts with the big-data promises that have
                come to dominate many flavours of DH. Undergraduate students’ output as described in
                these articles, even when in written scholarly forms, tends to be at the scale of
                the encyclopedia article or the blog post. Indeed, the small scale of undergraduate
                student contribution indicates to us a genre of response to Hirsch, Freire, and
                Bishop: the role of the undergraduate is moving away from one of menial labour on
                large-scale projects and towards producing work that mirrors or overlaps with a form
                of <soCalled>professional scholarship,</soCalled> as many of our contributors put
                it. The small-scale written genre may represent a midpoint in this movement, and as
                Melanie Kill notes, the different entry points into such activity, like those
                available to students collectively authoring knowledge on Wikipedia, are conducive
                to student engagement and participation <ptr target="#kill2012" loc="397–8"/>. The
                boutique-sized output requires research, often entails an original scholarly
                contribution, but it does not demand the same level of robust argumentation as other
                forms and remains true to the small-scale contexts that have proven generative for
                undergraduate pedagogy. </p>
            <p>The questions of agency, literacy, and scale ultimately amount to the models by which
                we theorize the role of undergraduate students. Considering undergraduates as
                apprentice scholars and researchers dominates the contributions to this issue, but
                the scholars represented here are also concerned with how students can have some
                kind of impact outside the academy, whether as a result of a pedagogy that shapes
                them as critically engaged citizens, or one that provides them with skills that make
                them more employable. A focus on undergraduates means that we as instructors and
                scholars are pushed to account for what undergraduates are going to make of their
                encounters with DH outside of the academy. </p>
            <p>As some of our discussion thus far indicates, the lines of reciprocity that cross the
                pieces in this special issue are multiple. However, we also perceive the pieces to
                fall into four thematic clusters around which the issue has been structured: 1)
                program models; 2) disciplinarity and DH pedagogy; 3) tool development; and 4)
                professional concerns. The issue is made up of longer, article-length pieces with
                emphasis on theoretical aspects of DH pedagogy, and the first three clusters also
                feature shorter, complementary case studies that concentrate on the practical
                aspects of pedagogical implementation. </p>
            <p>The first cluster, <title rend="quotes">Program Models,</title> features pieces that
                are concerned primarily with the means of building programs outside of traditional
                academic structures like the major or minor stream; they turn their attention,
                instead, to experiments in and principles of program design. Caitlin Christian-Lamb
                and Anelise Shrout’s article offers a survey of undergraduate DH practice that comes
                out of a workshop held at the 2015 Digital Humanities conference in Sydney,
                Australia. The authors identify key characteristics that they argue should mark
                undergraduate pedagogy and posit an agentic student model which sits between that of
                the digital native and the apprentice or research assistant. Working in a humanities
                lab, Brandon Locke contextualizes digital literacy skills within the framework of
                the liberal arts in his article, asking how methodologies from libraries can support
                the development of critical liberal arts literacies in the digital age in
                collaboration with teachers and program developers. Janelle Jenstad, Kim
                McLean-Fiander, and Kathryn R. McPherson make a similar argumentative move, thinking
                about how collaboration across institutional contexts supports pedagogy. Their
                contribution echoes Shrout and Christian-Lamb with its emphasis on first principles
                of student ownership through Research Based Learning and they provide an account of
                the pioneering practices of the <title rend="italic">Map of Early Modern
                    London</title> (MoEML) project’s Pedagogical Partnership Initiative. This
                cluster ends with two complementary case studies. Shannon Kelley provides an account
                of how she implemented the Pedagogical Partnership of MoEML in her own classroom,
                constructively pointing out the limitations of an apprenticeship model for the
                faculty and students engaged in it at this small scale level. James O’Sullivan et
                al.’s case study also looks to provide an account of the praxis of pedagogical
                models, and in so doing he calls upon Jakacki’s theorization of the digital project
                as pedagogy; he evaluates the use of the model in an interdisciplinary and
                interdepartmental context. The articles and case studies in this section are
                invested in first principles of pedagogy, whether those surveyed from the field or
                those asserted in order to guide program development, and frequently draw upon,
                explore, and nuance underlying assumptions about the nature of research and
                apprentissage for undergraduate students.</p>
            <p>The articles in the second cluster, <title rend="quotes">Disciplinarity and DH
                    Pedagogy,</title> ask how the inclusion of undergraduate students shifts the
                disciplinary boundaries of DH and the humanities fields that overlap with it.
                Contributors focus on the politics of knowledge as the primary mechanism by which DH
                pedagogy shifts disciplinary borders. Aaron Mauro et al. ask how students fit into
                collaborative digital scholarship as a form of socially oriented knowledge creation
                dispersed across labour categories in the contemporary university. Their method fits
                their subject matter: what they have described as the <soCalled>seamful</soCalled>
                aspects of collaboration insist upon the heterogeneity of teams and infrastructural
                contexts in addition to their impact on student involvement in scholarly projects.
                Ultimately, Mauro et al. concentrate their intervention on the development of
                methods of measuring and evaluation as a means of facilitating ethical collaboration
                as a mode of pedagogy. Where Mauro et al. focus on students in multiple and
                heterogenous institutions, our own article asks how ethical considerations may be
                applied in a single academic context. By constructing genealogies for DH pedagogy
                through the histories of feminist DH and participatory art, we posit a
                    <soCalled>scholar-citizen</soCalled> model of DH pedagogy, one which draws from
                existing metaphors of pedagogy and allows an examination of the power dynamics that
                continue to inhere in pedagogical contexts. Feminist pedagogy also informs Kara
                Kennedy, whose article perceives DH pedagogy to entail a feminist imperative in the
                reorientation of the discipline of English to serve the employment needs of its
                students. As Kennedy notes, the need for students to gain digital literacy skills
                impacts most strongly upon the women students of humanities departments, who are the
                majority of English literature students and who often contend with gender biases in
                computing-dominated employment and pedagogical cultures. Although English literature
                has historically been a disciplinary stronghold of DH research, Kennedy maintains
                that DH pedagogy requires further work in order to transform the English literature
                classroom and discipline. In contrast to Kennedy, Alexandra Saum-Pascual responds to
                the domination of English literature contexts of DH by positing that the potential
                of DH pedagogy may be better supported in the disciplinary environments of
                electronic literature and foreign languages, with Spanish-language literature as her
                example. For Saum-Pascual, DH requires a range of cultural literacies that
                complement those required in foreign-language pedagogical contexts — the multiplicity
                of skills and literacies that both contexts demand is their potential to change the
                disciplines of literary studies and DH alike. More explicitly than much of the other
                work presented in this issue, Saum-Pascual’s contribution focuses on the
                relationship of digital humanities to language. In a similar vein, the case study
                that closes this cluster, by Adriana Álvarez Sánchez and Miriam Peña Pimentel,
                offers a summary of programme development in a non-European and non-Anglophone North
                American context to cultivate opportunities for critical digital humanities pedagogy
                among undergraduates in a history department. This case study flags the geopolitics
                of disciplinarity in complement to the theoretical politics of discipline explored
                in other contributions.</p>
            <p>The third cluster, <soCalled>Tool Development,</soCalled> approaches the problems and
                politics of the classroom from the perspective of the infrastructure that supports
                both aspects of DH pedagogy. For Alexander Christie, infrastructure is a primary
                vehicle of disciplinary and institutional forms of power. Christie cautions against
                the tendency for tools to become divorced from the contexts, materialities, and
                labours of their creation, and he grounds his observations in the creation of the
                Pedagogy Toolkit, a tool aggregator that both disseminates tools and provides
                documentation on their development and use for instructors. Danica Savonick and Lisa
                Tagliaferri have a similarly wide reach: responding to the challenges of
                infrastructure across a multi-college network in a single institution, they report
                on their implementation of the social networking tool, the Futures Initiative
                Commons in a Box, developed for student collaboration across the diverse student
                body and geographically dispersed campuses of the City University of New York.
                Savonick and Tagliaferri seek to use Commons in a Box in order to make concrete many
                of the promises and ideals of anti-hierarchical, student-centered education in DH.
                Closing this cluster with a case study, Laura Estill offers a description of
                assignments from a Renaissance Drama course using Wikipedia, examining the
                incorporation of a well-established tool of a digital public sphere into the
                classroom. Tool use and development, for these contributors, is not simply the
                search for solutions to classroom challenges; instead, tools provide a technological
                substrate upon which to examine relationships among students, instructors,
                institutions, and a broader technologically motivated society. </p>
            <p>The Special Issue comes to a close with a final paper on professional concerns,
                turning its focus from students to instructors with Andrew Bretz’s discussion of
                digital tools and itinerant teaching labour. In Bretz’s polemic, the tools that make
                possible so much of our pedagogy have paradoxically presaged a return to the labour
                model of the medieval university. Bretz prompts us to be aware of the economic,
                political, and social implications of our pedagogical turn to the digital and the
                way in which the practices and tools we use can foster faculty and student
                inequalities at the same time as they can construe autonomy, agency, and
                citizenship.</p>
