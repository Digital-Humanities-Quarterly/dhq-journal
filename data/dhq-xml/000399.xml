                <p> This paper presents findings from a set of contextual inquiry sessions completed
                    in 2016 as part of the four year <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarly
                        Workflow</title> project (2012-2016) conducted at the Pennsylvania State
                    University and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Studying humanists’
                    workflows through contextual inquiry enabled us to gain valuable empirical
                    insights into digital scholarship from the perspective of individual scholars.
                    This small-scale observational study (N=8) supplemented findings from our larger
                    scale (N=196) and medium scale (N=23) studies previously completed in the
                    project, allowing us to develop deeper qualitative understanding of how
                    humanists’ research practices change in the encounter with digital technologies.
                    Through close contextual analysis of information-based research activities we
                    illustrate how humanists build rich personal collections of digital sources,
                    which become important information resources in their work. We also examine how
                    adoption of digital tools transforms the established methods of managing primary
                    and secondary sources, bringing hastier digital workflows to traditionally more
                    methodical work. Finally, we show that efficiency cannot be qualified as a
                    neutral or inherent characteristic of digital tools, independent of scholars’
                    practices, since scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts determines what
                    constitutes efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholar’s workflow. We
                    conclude that in humanists’ workflows digital and analog tools and resources do
                    not necessarily replace one another or vie for the dominant position. They
                    rather supplement each other in an interconnected, hybrid workflow that comes to
                    our respondents as an organic manifestation of their work, and as an
                    illustration of the bricolage character of humanists’ digital workflows.</p>

                <p> Discussions of digital scholarship in the humanities have often been based on
                    assumptions about what humanists could do with digital technologies, and how
                    these technologies could influence their research, rather than on contextualized
                    analytical insights about what humanists are actually doing and how their
                    research practices change in the encounter with technology. </p>
                <p> This paper presents the results of the <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarly
                        Workflow</title> project, which implemented an ethnographic approach to
                    facilitate such contextualized understanding of humanists’ research workflows,
                    giving us valuable empirical insights into digital scholarship from the
                    perspective of individual scholars — how they search for, find, collect,
                    analyze, and when necessary digitize archival and other scholarly materials. Our
                    research approach builds on <ptr target="#svensson2010"/>, who called for the
                    examination of digital scholarship from the perspective of individual scholars’
                    daily practices, and <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2014"/> who argued for the
                    analysis of digital humanities in action. Schonfeld (2015) similarly pointed out
                    that <quote rend="inline" source="#schonfeld2015">to understand researcher
                        practices, user experience specialists … should examine the researchers’

                        <ptr target="#schonfeld2015" loc="13"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p> The <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarly Workflow</title> project was
                    conducted at the Pennsylvania State University from 2012 to 2016 and funded by
                    the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The first part of the project (2012-2014)
                    analyzed how scholars across disciplines engage with digital technologies at
                    different phases of the research lifecycle, pointing at gaps in existing tools,
                    services, and infrastructures (see: <ptr target="#antonijević2015"/>; <ptr
                        target="#antonijević2014"/>). While acknowledging the importance of
                    domain-based and subject-specific research practices across the humanities (see:
                        <ptr target="#wineburg2001"/>), our study sought to understand some of the
                    common features of humanists’ digital workflows as compared to those in the
                    sciences, and to identify the distinctive features that software architecture
                    should have in order to support humanists’ research. </p>
                <p> The first phase of our project thus identified preferences and areas of strain
                    in the research workflows — specifically around discovery, organization, and
                    storage of research materials — and revealed distinct disciplinary differences.
                    For instance, humanities scholars preferred using local discovery tools, such as
                    the Penn State library catalog, more often than Sciences faculty. Humanists also
                    noted a lack of digital technology use in data collection and analysis phases of
                    their research process. Further, humanities scholars had the highest percentage
                    of lost and inaccessible research files, and were more likely than other
                    disciplines to curate their research file collections. Finally, phase I showed
                    that integration of digital tools into humanists’ search activities often
                    resulted in a breakdown of their systems for organizing information, previously
                    developed for print based materials <ptr target="#antonijević2014"/>. </p>
                <p> Building on those findings, phase II of our study (2014-2016) focused on
                    observing humanists’ research and use of digital research tools <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">in situ</foreign>, through a series of contextual inquiry
                    sessions. Contextual inquiry showed that digital technologies have transformed
                    scholarly work in the humanities not only as reflected in the discourse of
                    digital humanities, but through daily practices of working scholars and through
                    some perhaps surprising integrations with long standing analog work routines. In
                    this paper we demonstrate, for instance, how impromptu on-site digitization of
                    archival materials with the use of digital cameras change scholars’ research in
                    both rewarding and challenging ways. Through such practices scholars build rich
                    personal collections of digitized primary sources, which become one of the
                    central information resources in their work. Our findings show, however, that
                    digital tools and resources do not necessarily replace analog or compete for the
                    dominant position, but form an interconnected stream, illustrative of the
                    bricolage character of humanists’ digital workflows. </p>
                <p> Our view of humanists as bricoleurs builds on conceptual understanding of
                    bricolage developed over the past fifty years. While the notion of bricolage as
                    a process and bricoleur as an agent derives from Lévi-Strauss’s (1962) analysis
                    of mythical thinking, it assumed broader epistemological meaning already in this
                    original account. Soon after, and thanks to its broad generative capacity,
                    bricolage attained the status of a universal concept applied across knowledge
                    domains as diverse as evolutionary biology <ptr target="#jacob1977"/>,
                    interpersonal relationships <ptr target="#conville1997"/>, <ref

                        Scholar search reveals that the title of this paper is far less original
                        than we hoped it would be, inadvertently following in the footsteps of
                        Pinar’s (2001) <title rend="quotes">The Researcher as Bricoleur: The Teacher
                            as Public Intellectual,</title> and the series that includes student as
                        bricoleur <ptr target="#schnelker2006"/>, teacher as bricoleur <ptr
                            target="#reilly2011"/>, and so forth.</note> The concept of bricolage
                    also became used in the context of scholarly work, specifically related to
                    interdisciplinarity and multiperspectivism in the adoption of research methods,
                    data sources, and theories (see: <ptr target="#denzin2000"/>; <ptr
                        target="#kincheloe2001"/>). </p>
                <p> Our analysis of bricolage in humanists’ scholarly work does not follow this
                    trajectory of explicit methodological and epistemological examination, nor does
                    it consider Derrida’s (1997/1967) approach to bricolage as discourse. Rather, we
                    seek to return to Lévi-Strauss’s inquiry into bricolage as situated practice and
                    its specific ideology of unscripted approach to technology expressed in the
                    comparison between engineers and bricoleurs discussed in more detail in the
                    conclusion of this essay (see also: <ptr target="#johnson2012"/>). Along these
                    lines we argue that humanists observed in our study engage with digital tools in
                    a highly personal, unscripted way, which corresponds to their style of thinking
                    and working, to their intimate epistemology. Our respondents do not experience
                    digital workflow as a technical activity, but as a subjective process of
                    knowledge production in which they freely combine diverse tools and resources
                    suited to their sensibilities and research needs. Such use of digital
                    technologies also emerges from their understanding of efficiency as
                    contextualized in scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts, not as a
                    presumably inherent characteristic of digital tools independent of scholars’
                    practices. Certain methodological and epistemological inferences that we offer
                    in the conclusion of this essay thus seek to inform DH theory via DH praxis, in
                    line with the orientation of our study. </p>
                <p> Such focus on DH praxis was essential in phase II of the <title rend="italic"
                        >Digital Scholarly Workflow</title> project, in which we partnered with the
                    Zotero software (see: <ref target="https://www.zotero.org"
                        >https://www.zotero.org</ref>) development team from George Mason University
                    to enhance Zotero based on our research findings. Two software optimizations
                    were developed and launched, centered on discovery, organization, and archiving
                    in the research workflow. A Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed reader was
                    introduced in Zotero that allowed researchers to receive notifications from
                    their favorite journals and other publishers as new publications appear. A
                    Zotero <title rend="quotes">My Publications</title> workflow was also created,
                    offering researchers the capability to self-archive their work. These items
                    could then be automatically deposited into a Hydra-based institutional
                    repository via a new tool, Arkivo, developed for the project (see: <ref
                        target="https://github.com/zotero/arkivo-sufia"
                        >https://github.com/zotero/arkivo-sufia</ref>). The second phase of the
                        <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarly Workflow</title> project also
                    included usability testing of these optimizations, indicating positive findings
                    towards centering specific research activities within the Zotero interface for
                    greater workflow productivity and cohesiveness (see: <ptr target="#cahoy2018"
                    />). </p>
                <p> We start this essay with a summary of the <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarly
                        Workflow</title> project methodology, and then turn to presenting the
                    results gathered through contextual inquiries. Specifically, we focus on results
                    related to the research activities of finding, organizing, and storing digital
                    research data and materials, which were the focal point of phase II of our
                    project. The initial project phase, which analyzed scholars’ information
                    behavior at all stages of the research lifecycle, showed that the important
                    links and mutual influences among these research activities are not always fully
                    recognized, so, in phase II, we sought to contribute to filling in those
                    analytical gaps. The paper concludes with the vision of scholars as bricoleurs,
                    and with suggestions on how to approach digital scholarship in the humanities
                    based on ethnographic understanding of digital workflows in context. </p>

                <p> Phase I (2012-2014) of the <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarly
                        Workflow</title> project explored the digital research workflows of the Penn
                    State faculty across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, and it
                    included a web survey (N=196) and in-person ethnographic interviews (N=23). The
                    quantitative orientation of the web survey enabled us to compare and contrast
                        <emph>what</emph> scholars are doing in their digital workflows, while the
                    qualitative character of the in-depth interviews facilitated understanding of
                        <emph>why</emph> scholars carry out their workflows in particular ways. </p>
                <p> Building on those results related to the <q>what</q> and <q>why</q> of digital
                    workflows, phase II of the project (2014-2016) focused on humanities scholars
                    and on understanding a twofold <emph>how</emph> – how humanists’ carry out their
                    workflows in practice, and how software solutions can enhance or impede those
                    practices. As mentioned in the previous section, we observed humanists’ use of
                    digital research tools <foreign xml:lang="la">in situ</foreign> through a series
                    of contextual inquiry sessions, with the goal of answering the first
                        <emph>how</emph>, and we then partnered with the Zotero team to address the
                    second <emph>how</emph> by enhancing the Zotero software. Our Zotero enhancement
                    activities are addressed in detail in separate articles (see: <ptr
                        target="#antonijević2016"/>; <ptr target="#cahoy2018"/>), while this paper
                    focuses on the results of the contextual inquiry sessions completed in the Fall
                    of 2016. </p>
                <p> Contextual inquiry is a qualitative method that combines traditional
                    ethnographic techniques into a potent heuristic for gathering data about
                    contextualized and naturally-occurring activities (see: <ptr
                        target="#holtzblatt1993"/>; <ptr target="#bednar2014"/>). Context refers to
                    a set of interconnected conditions in which analyzed activities take place, and
                    which motivate and shape those activities. In this study, contextual inquiry
                    concentrated on the digital workflows of eight humanities scholars in the course
                    of their daily research. This small-scale observational study thus supplemented
                    findings from our preceding larger and medium-scale studies completed in phase
                    I, allowing us to develop deeper qualitative understanding of how humanists’
                    research practices change in the encounter with digital technologies. Scholars
                    consulted in the contextual inquiries included four male and four female
                    participants, most of whom (6) were tenured professors. More than half of the
                    contextual inquiry sessions (5) were conducted at scholars’ offices and on
                    average lasted 90 minutes.<note> Three sessions took place at the University
                        library.</note>
                </p>
                <p> Two researchers attended each of the sessions and used the same observational
                    guide, which provided for the consistency and easier standardization of research
                    notes and findings. These researchers quietly sat aside observing study
                    participants as they carried out their work, interrupting only if a
                    clarification was needed, and taking detailed notes of the observed workflows.
                    We did not assign any tasks to the participants, but asked them instead to
                    engage in the information-based research activities they planned for the day,
                    and to guide us through those activities by thinking aloud about why they are
                    doing what they are doing. The respondents’ verbal accounts were audio-recorded
                    and later professionally transcribed. Both the session transcripts and the
                    researchers’ notes were coded for activities, patterns, themes, and respondents’
                    experiences in interacting with digital tools. All information that could have
                    been identified with individual study participants remained confidential. The
                    quotations used in this text are thus presented through pseudonyms, and some of
                    the quotations have been slightly edited for privacy, clarity, and length. In
                    the following, we first discuss how our respondents search for research data and
                    materials, and we then turn to reviewing their activities related to storing and
                    organizing those materials. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Searching for research data and materials</head>
                <p> When searching for research data and materials, humanities scholars consult a
                    web of resources, both electronic and paper-based. This study focuses on
                    electronic resources for two reasons. First, the study explored
                        <emph>digital</emph> workflows, that is, the integration of digital tools
                    and resources into humanists’ practice. Second, contextual inquiry allowed
                    direct observation of scholars’ use of online resources, while the information
                    on their use of libraries, archives, and other physical collections could have
                    been inferred only indirectly, through the respondents’ accounts. </p>
                <p> Contextual inquiry showed that humanists predominantly use online resources to
                    search for secondary sources, such as journal articles and books. In
                    discovery search, they frequently use commercial search engines like Google and
                    Google Scholar, while library portals and academic databases mostly serve for
                    known item search and access. Contextual inquiry thus confirmed the findings of
                    phase I of our project and other relevant studies (see: <ptr
                        target="#antonijević2015"/>; <ptr target="#antonijević2014"/>; <ptr
                        target="#nicholas2011"/>; <ptr target="#asher2013"/>). Humanists also
                    explore more specialized online resources, such as movie databases and newspaper
                    online archives, as well as their personal collections of digital and/or
                    digitized materials. Among our respondents, the search for primary sources
                    largely takes place offline, in archival and other physical collections, and to
                        <soCalled>digitize material</soCalled> typically means to take a digital
                    photo of an archival document and to store it as a JPEG file for further use.
                    Such on-site digitized primary materials grow over time into humanists’ rich
                    personal collections, becoming a vital information resource these scholars
                    regularly access in their research. </p>
                <p> For instance, in one of the contextual inquiry sessions, Audrey, a professor of
                    history, searched for literature on an event that took place in 1916, and for
                    which she had only partial information. Audrey’s search starts with her personal
                    collection of notes written in Word and stored on the internal hard drive. She
                    uses a Word search function that queries the folder for a supposed event name,
                    but this search yields no result. Audrey then switches to her browser and the
                    online search. She logs on to the Penn State library and enters a search
                    phrase composed of three descriptors into the discovery search interface,
                    LionSearch. This attempt does not yield any results either. <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#private">Okay, no problem, I’m going to go to some of my favorite
                        databases,</quote> Audrey says optimistically, and, using the same search
                    phrase, she continues her search in the <title rend="italic">Historical
                        Abstracts</title> database.
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#private">All right, I need another field. It
                        happened in Rome,</quote> she comments still optimistically, and expands her
                    search with one more field, which reads <q>Rome.</q> Still nothing. <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">Seriously?!,</quote> Audrey exclaims with
                    annoyance. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">All right, let me just do
                            <q>war council,</q> something more specific,</quote> she says with
                    reasserted optimism, and changes her search phrase accordingly. Failure again.
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#private">Really?!,</quote> Audrey laments in
                    shock. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">I would have thought it was more
                        important.</quote> Audrey then reaches to her bookshelf and grabs a book.
                    She reads through a few pages, trying to find any additional information that
                    could help her search. Nothing. But Audrey is not ready to give up yet. </p>
                <p> She returns to her library search and adds <q>November</q> as one more search
                    field, trying to make her query as precise as possible. No results. Still,
                    Audrey does not give up, and, instead of adding one more search term, she
                    decides to change her search phrase. She creates a new search phrase, again
                    composed of three descriptors as the possible event name. <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#private">Nope. All right, strange,</quote> Audrey says quietly,
                    confident that any further search would be pointless. <quote source="#private"
                        rend="inline">You would think someone must have written an article about
                        this. It was the time that the different allies got together and hammered
                        out a strategy …,</quote> she continues murmuring, but discontinues her
                    library search. Instead, Audrey decides to try her luck with Google Search. She
                    enters the search phrase and the Wikipedia entry pops up right away. <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">See, that’s the thing,</quote> Audrey
                    comments. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">One would love to use more
                        scholarly resources, but I just typed [the search phrase] and it’s up there
                        [on Wikipedia]! Sadly, <title rend="italic">Historical Abstracts</title> was
                        not of too much use; the most useful one was still Wikipedia,</quote> this
                    historian concludes. </p>
                <p> Dominance of non-academic search services was also observable in the case of
                    Theodora, an associate professor of architecture, whose search for publications
                    on housing in the Soviet Union started directly with Google Scholar, omitting
                    the library portal. Theodora starts by opening the Google Scholar page in her
                    web browser and entering search keywords, <q>Soviet Housing.</q> Before looking
                    at the search results, Theodora reaches to both the <title rend="italic"
                        >Zotero</title> and <title rend="italic">Papers</title> citation managers
                    and creates a new collection in each of them, which she will use to store the
                    materials found online. Theodora creates the collections manually, since she
                    does not <quote rend="inline" source="#private">trust the program to use its
                        smart features.</quote><note> Papers 3, a reference management software
                        created by Mekentosj, has a variety of automated features including
                            <soCalled>smart</soCalled> collections, which automatically sorts new
                        citations and places them in corresponding collections directed by
                        parameters preset by the user. </note>
                </p>
                <p> Here we see that activities of finding and storing research materials can be so
                    intertwined in scholars’ practices that setting up a storage folder goes in
                    parallel, or even precedes search. Through her workflow and narration in the
                    contextual inquiry, we learn that Theodora uses <title rend="italic"
                        >Zotero</title> for saving bibliographic information about books, and <title
                        rend="italic">Papers</title>, for which she has paid subscription, for
                    saving downloaded articles. Theodora relates that she particularly appreciates
                    the <title rend="italic">Papers</title> activity tab, which she calls <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">the magic finding feature,</quote> which
                    recommends further readings based on the articles she stored, and also enables
                    her to discover tweets and other posts about those articles. Yet, despite
                    highlighting the <soCalled>magic finding feature,</soCalled> Theodora does not
                    use <title rend="italic">Papers</title>’ built-in search tool, but carries out
                    her searches through Google. This also influences the way in which she imports
                    materials to <title rend="italic">Papers</title>. Instead of using the built-in
                    import tool, Theodora downloads files from Google and saves them on her desktop,
                    after which she moves them to <title rend="italic">Papers</title>. This rather
                    untrained use of <title rend="italic">Papers</title> is a confirmation of
                    findings from the first phase of our study, which revealed that only a modest
                    percentage of humanists use citation managers — one third (33%) of those
                    surveyed — and, when they do use them, they employ them on a rather basic level
                    (see: <ptr target="#antonijević2015"/>; <ptr target="#antonijević2014"/>). </p>
                <p> After setting up new collections in both citation managers, Theodora returns to
                    the web browser and starts reading through the results that Google Scholar
                    yielded. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">This one – it’s an edited
                        volume, so I’ll look at that later. It is from 2005 and it’s talking about
                        the Soviet Union, which is a little bit weird, but it looks like it might be
                        OK,</quote> Theodora thinks out loud, as she looks through her search
                    results. She opens the link to the collection in Google Books, and saves it in
                        <title rend="italic">Zotero</title>. <quote rend="inline" source="#private"
                        >I’m going to save it to <title rend="italic">Zotero</title>. Since I just
                        created that [new collection], I’ll automatically dump it in there,</quote>
                    she explains. Theodora further elaborates that it is the same search process she
                    uses for all electronic publications. The first round is a quick run through
                    search materials, where she collects and saves everything that seems interesting
                    and relevant for the project. In the second round, she looks closely at the
                    saved materials and decides which of them to keep. Finally, she organizes kept
                    files into appropriate folders. </p>
                <p> Such a process of collecting and managing electronic information we observed
                    with almost all the humanists who participated in both phases of this project.
                    Faced with a deluge of information available online, humanists commonly collect
                    everything that seems relevant, <soCalled>dumping</soCalled> it into their hard
                    drives, citation managers, or Dropbox folders for further examination. Detecting
                    such a trend, Pampson (2014) posits that scholars <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#pampson2014">unsystematically gather materials, never certain when
                        an object might come in handy,</quote> and observes that over time <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#pampson2014">folders seem to grow in number and size
                        geometrically</quote> generating a ceaseless flow of information <ptr
                        target="#papson2013" loc="387"/>. Our study implies, however, that
                    seemingly unsystematic scholars’ information seeking and storing behavior
                    actually has deeper and more systematic roots. One origin of such information
                    behavior relates to the essence of humanistic inquiry, which does not
                    necessarily constitute a search for evidence, but for multiple and often
                    opposing points of view. Humanists thus search for and collect materials until
                    they reach the point of data saturation, as one of our study participants
                    explained: <dhq:example>
                        <head>Peter, professor of rhetoric</head>
                        <eg>What I try to do in my criticism in historical writing is to be as much
as possible dialogic, to look for competing points of view, and there’s
a point at which they [collected materials] become redundant, and then
you know you’re probably going as far as you need to go in that
direction, so it’s kind of redundancy that begins to tell you [when to
end your search].</eg>
                    </dhq:example> Peter imports to Zotero all publications that look relevant for
                    his research, but acknowledges that it can take months before he moves from this
                    first round to the second round, when he goes back to Zotero and actually reads
                    those materials. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">It’s conceivable, I’d
                        never would come back [to Zotero ] and do much for this, but I
                        might,</quote> Peter specifies. He recognizes that this way of working might
                    be inefficient, but stresses that such inefficiencies constitute a critical part
                    of humanistic research. This point is important for broader understanding of
                    humanists’ digital workflows and their interaction with digital technologies. It
                    illustrates that efficiency is not a neutral or an inherent characteristic of
                    digital tools, resources, or workflows independent of scholars’ practices.
                    Rather, efficiency is construed through scholars’ interaction with digital
                    artifacts, as we discuss throughout the paper. </p>
                <p> Among the respondents in this study, the only exception from the above-described
                    online search practice was Linda, a research associate in comparative and
                    international literature, whose information behavior included a careful
                    selection of online materials already in the first round of encountering them.
                    Like Theodora, Linda starts her search in Google Scholar by entering a search
                    phrase. Going through the list of results that her search yielded, Linda reads
                    the abstracts and, if an abstract seems relevant, she reads the full text
                    online, taking handwritten notes in her notepad. Linda explains that if she ends
                    up taking a lot of handwritten notes while reading articles online, she later
                    takes photos of those notes, emails the photos to herself, saves them as PDFs,
                    and then OCRs them, thus transforming them into searchable digital notes. When
                    she finds a text that fully meets her criteria and needs, she downloads a copy
                    and saves the PDF file to her Box cloud storage. From there, she moves the file
                    to her library in the Mendeley citation manager, but only if she decides to cite
                    that piece. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">I won’t download a PDF until
                        I have significant cause to,</quote> Linda explains. <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#private">I have a pretty deep repository [in Mendeley], and these
                        are all things that I’ve read. Most of it I’ve annotated in some
                        way,</quote> she adds. In that way Linda avoids the deluge of downloaded
                    files that stay unused, and keeps her collections of digital materials focused. </p>
                <p> This example illustrates how conceptions of efficiency are idiosyncratic and can
                    influence digital scholarly workflows in significant ways. For Theodora and
                    Peter, effectiveness implied keeping the diversity of materials available for
                    further analysis and for serendipitous development of their epistemological
                    paths. For Linda, on the contrary, efficiency implied very selective retention
                    and an early analytical reduction of heterogeneity in her knowledge production
                    process. Such differences might be a matter of personal preferences, and we
                    could say, following Malone’s (1983) seminal classification of storing and
                    sorting practices, that Theodora and Peter belong to the category of
                        <emph>pilers</emph>, who accumulate materials in a loosely organized manner,
                    while Linda belongs to the category of <emph>filers</emph>, who store and
                    organize their materials in a highly systematic way. We could also speculate
                    that such differences may result from dissimilar professional experiences. Both
                    Peter and Theodora are senior scholars, while Linda is a junior one, and one
                    might argue that senior scholars feel more comfortable dealing with
                    heterogeneity of analytical views than their junior colleagues. But one might
                    also argue that junior scholars feel more comfortable dealing with digital tools
                    and resources, and that the observed difference in handling electronic materials
                    derives from that disparity. A look at humanists’ offline search practices
                    supports such a possibility. </p>
                <p> While Linda’s search behavior stands as rare among the study participants when
                    it comes to online search, it closely resembles the traditional archival search
                    behavior humanists exhibited prior to the introduction of digital technologies
                    into archival work. Our respondents recollect that, when collecting primary
                    materials in physical archives, they used to carefully read and identify
                    materials most pertinent to their research, systematically storing only a
                    handful of selected documents. The rest of important materials they would
                    summarize on site in written notes, which ranged from short reminders to
                    detailed document digests. Such a practice of managing materials recalls the
                    time when photocopying was one of the main ways of saving archival documents for
                    offsite use. It was neither cheap nor easy to handle piles of paper, so, instead
                    of acting as <emph>pilers</emph> who gather everything, researchers needed to
                    act as <emph>filers</emph>, and to strategically decide which materials were
                    most important to collect. </p>
                <p> Audrey explains, for instance, that she used to take extensive notes in her past
                    archival work, and that those notes have been very useful for her over the
                    years. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">Now that they let you take
                        pictures in the archives, it’s wonderful, but at the same time you don’t
                        take the time to take notes anymore,</quote> this scholar observes. In
                    talking about her past archival work, Audrey also gives the following example:
                        <quote rend="block">A lot of the archives for my field used to be very badly
                        organized, almost like what people told me about being in Poland in 1970 -
                        there was a shop that had opened and there’s a queue and you just queue up
                        and hope that something will be for sale, whether you need it or not. It was
                        very much like that with archives. They gave you something. You would take
                        furious notes and you would also photocopy, but you might only use one or
                        two things. You put it aside and you think, <q>I’m always going to be able
                            to use this.</q></quote>
                </p>
                <p> Audrey explains, however, that all those materials collected in an unintended
                    way are <quote rend="inline" source="#private">in a sense all active,</quote> as
                    they informed her later studies, which she did not know at the time of
                    collecting them. In other words, archival search helped Audrey in finding
                    materials she was looking for, but it also served the function of making her
                    aware of other valuable information. Malone (Op.cit.) identifies these two
                    functions as <emph>finding</emph> and <emph>reminding</emph>, explaining that a
                    distinction between them rests on intentionality. Specifically, he posits that
                    if a person becomes aware of the information she was looking for, then the
                    finding function has been performed. If, while conducting this search, the
                    person becomes aware of something she was not looking for, yet found useful for
                    her work, then the reminding function has been served <ptr target="#malone1983"
                        loc="106"/>. This distinction, along with Audrey’s explanation and
                    experience, resonates with Peter’s previously cited description of his
                        <soCalled>inefficient</soCalled> search process, demonstrating again that
                    humanists’ outwardly inefficient digital workflows often have deeper
                    epistemological roots and constitute the core of humanistic inquiry. </p>
                <p> The above-described archival practice of photocopying selected materials and
                        <quote source="#private" rend="inline">tak[ing] furious notes</quote> of
                    everything else changed significantly when archives started allowing researchers
                    to take digital photos of materials in their collections. This change
                    overwhelmingly transformed scholars into <emph>pilers</emph> of hundreds,
                    sometime even thousands of materials, significantly disrupting their workflows,
                    as we describe and discuss in more detail in the following section. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Storing and organizing research data and materials</head>
                <p> Both phases of our study showed that humanists largely use internal computer
                    hard drives and cloud-based services, such as Dropbox and Box, to store research
                    data and materials, while only a handful use the Penn State institutional
                    repository, ScholarSphere; this finding is consistent with other studies of
                    institutional repositories use (see: <ptr target="#davis2007"/>; <ptr
                        target="#cullen2010"/>. The most common way in which our respondents
                    organize stored research materials is according to the research project. A
                    typical project folder, whether on a local hard-drive or in Dropbox, is an
                    over-reaching compartment that breaks down into two main sub-folders, one for
                    primary and one for secondary sources. Primary sources mainly consist of
                    archival documents captured as JPEG files, and they are commonly titled
                    according to the archive and/or archival box from which they originated.
                    Secondary sources, such as PDF files of journal articles and books, are stored
                    in a different subfolder. These subfolders further branch into sub-subfolders
                    organized around the subject they cover (a specific topic, period of time,
                    person), the source from which they originated (a physical archive, colleagues,
                    other projects), or in line with the project/workflow phase to which they are
                    related (<q>phase I,</q>
                    <q>articles to read,</q>
                    <q>annotated</q>). </p>
                <p> In one of the contextual inquiry sessions we observed, Fred, a historian of
                    science, was organizing and handling materials related to his project on the
                    history of Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) research. The organizational
                    structure of his project materials was the following: <list type="ordered">
                        <item>the overall project folder titled <q>UFO project</q>;</item>
                        <item>a subfolder containing primary sources — thousands of digital photos
                            of archival materials he photographed in various archives. Those
                            materials are further organized into sub-subfolders classified and named
                            after the corresponding archival boxes from which they came, and/or
                            according to a specific research topic they cover;</item>
                        <item>a subfolder containing secondary materials, such as PDF files of
                            articles related to the UFO research. Those materials are classified
                            into sub-subfolders and named according to a decade when they were
                            written — 1950s, 1960s, and so on.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p> In naming classification units such as folders and subfolders, Fred’s practice
                    mostly meets recommended file-naming conventions; he uses short and descriptive
                    titles, includes the project name in the file name, and so on. But the situation
                    changes when it comes to individual JPEG files of archival materials. Those
                    files all retain numeric, automatically generated file names, without
                    indications about the content of the file. Such a practice mainly stems from the
                    quantity of JPEG files Fred is managing. He points out that ever since digital
                    photographing became allowed in the archives, he decided to <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#private">get the scale of the digitization,</quote> so he took
                    nearly 4,000 photos in one archive alone. Renaming thousands of JPEG files would
                    require substantial time and effort, including more careful reading of the
                    archival documents, so that assigned file-names could reflect their content and
                    enable more efficient browsing and retrieval. Fred, however, quickly reads
                    archival materials while on site and photographs everything that seems relevant
                    for his research. Acting as a <emph>piler</emph>, Fred thus amasses thousands of
                    digital JPEG files that are difficult to organize, rename, search, and retrieve. </p>
                <p> Fred first organizes all of the digital materials on his desktop, saving them
                    both on the internal hard drive and in a Dropbox folder. At the end of the day
                    he transfers thus organized materials to an external hard disk. Such a
                    systematic practice of daily backup was rare among the humanities participating
                    in both phases of our study, who generally reported important data loss (see:
                        <ptr target="#antonijević2014"/>; <ptr target="#antonijević2015"/>). Fred
                    stresses that he had suffered a critical system failure and loss of digital
                    materials a few years ago, so he switched to a daily backup routine ever since. </p>
                <p> Another professor of history, Connor, describes an experience similar to Fred’s,
                    which however quickly developed into a notably different workflow in managing
                    digital archival materials. When digital photographing became permissible in
                    archives, Connor used to be a piler like Fred and to take photos of everything
                    that seemed relevant, saving those materials as JPEG files. After a while, he
                    realized that he would return from the archive with an overload of digital
                    photos that required a lot of storage space, were unsearchable, and for which he
                    often could not recall contextual meaning. Connor thus decided to change his
                    archival workflow. Instead of just snapping photos, he now first reads archival
                    materials at the level needed to determine whether they represent those critical
                    materials that should be saved in the digital form. Resembling Linda’s strategy
                    described in the previous section — to save only those secondary sources that
                    she will cite — Connor comparably stores as JPEG files only those materials that
                    he deems as something he will use and cite in his work. All other relevant
                    archival materials he summarizes on site in short notes, usually a paragraph
                    long, and types as Word files. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">This
                        condenses everything really, really small,</quote> Connor says of his work
                    process, commending the ability to recognize key documents that should be
                    stored, and to efficiently summarize all other relevant materials: <quote
                        rend="block">What I have here, for all of that [archival] material, are six
                        pages. It doesn’t exhaust everything. But when I go back to this stuff, I
                        tell myself that former me, back in the fall [when he was doing research in
                        the archive] was smart. I knew what I was doing. I knew exactly what kinds
                        of things were critical and important and what things weren’t.</quote>
                </p>
                <p> The observed differences between Connor and Fred’s archival practices bring us
                    back to the question of what constitutes efficiency in humanists’ digital
                    workflows. Like Connor, Fred also recognizes that JPEG files of archival
                    materials do not allow for easy browsing, retrieval, and annotation, but points
                    out that this inefficiency actually benefits his work. It compels him to
                    describe both the data and his ideas about the data in consolidated and focused
                    summaries that he types as Word documents: <quote rend="block">The only way I’ve
                        annotated them [JPEG files] is in this separate [Word] file here. As I would
                        go through [JPEG files], I would keep a paper where I would take my notes on
                        it with ideas. These are going to be things that I want to come back to,
                        themes that I’m noticing in the digital material. So when I want to start to
                        research, I’ll look at this stuff here to tell myself what is it I’m looking
                        for, what is it I want to do, and that becomes a major theses.
                    [11]</quote></p>
                <p> For Connor, efficiency means promptly identifying key archival documents that
                    should be photographed and stored, thus eliminating the encumbrance of digital
                    deluge. For Fred, in contrast, efficiency means storing thousands of JPEG files
                    and systematically going through them throughout the research process, slowly
                    discerning over time the main findings and research ideas that those materials
                    suggest, while writing notes that facilitate such continuous analytical
                    engagement with the data. </p>
                <p> Using a method similar to Fred’s, Ellen, a historian of American literature,
                    stores hundreds of digitized archival materials and keeps extensive notes that
                    help her navigate through those materials. When working in physical archives,
                    Ellen uses her cell phone to take photos of archival materials, which she then
                    stores in cloud-based services for further use. <quote rend="inline"

                    data deluge. Ellen discloses, for instance, that her work at the Emory archive
                    yielded 189 JPEG files, which she still has not managed to process. <quote

                    that her next step will be to turn those JPEG files into PDFs for each archival
                    object, and to name the PDF files in a useful way that will enable her to browse
                    and retrieve them more efficiently. <quote rend="inline" source="#private"
                        >That’s how I organize my archival stuff, but it takes a lot of steps to get
                        there, so I have a huge backlog of stuff like that from archives that I just
                        haven’t dealt with,</quote> Ellen relates. Here we see yet another method of
                    managing digitized archival materials, by converting JPEG into PDF files.
                    Neither Ellen nor our other respondents use optical character recognition (OCR)
                    to convert their digitized archival materials into machine-readable text, which
                    illustrates their lack of technological savvy, discussed in more detail in our
                    previous work (see: <ptr target="#antonijević2015"/>). </p>
                <p> Ellen’s work sometimes also includes materials available in digital archives,
                    and in such cases, when digital and traditional practices encounter each other,
                    deciding where to store materials and how to organize them is not always a
                    straightforward task. As an example, in a contextual inquiry session we observed
                    Ellen was dealing with an archival document that, according to her established
                    organizational logic, should be stored in the subfolder of primary documents.
                    Yet, Ellen decides to store it differently, in the subfolder for secondary
                    sources. She explains that she does not consider the document <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">an archival source exactly</quote> because
                    she found it in the digital archive. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">I
                        didn’t go work on a collection there [in the physical archive]; I’m just
                        pulling it [from the web], so for me that’s a resource, not an archival
                        document,</quote> Ellen clarifies. This example illustrates an interesting
                    situation in which ontology of research objects cannot be separated from the
                    technological context in which they are produced, in line with Hottois’ (1984)
                    original understanding of technoscience. Authors such as Sinn and Soares (2014)
                    thus observe that humanists prefer original over digitized sources, and think
                    about digital materials as a way of duplicating the originals rather than as a
                    way of replacing them. </p>
                <p> Jordan, a professor of history, seconds the words and workflows of both Ellen
                    and Fred. Jordan takes photos and scans of archival materials from physical
                    collections and stores those digital files on his computer. In organizing
                    research materials, he has a folder for every project, and then subfolders and
                    sub-subfolders for every subject. Jordan discloses that all those valuable and
                    meticulously collected materials live on his computer hard-drive and nowhere
                    else. He backups his materials when he <quote rend="inline" source="#private"
                        >gets into a panic,</quote> which happens approximately every three months.
                    While we observe his work in a contextual inquiry session, Jordan shows us a
                    Word document that he keeps as the main directory of his primary sources. This
                    Word document lists all the materials he had photographed or scanned in various
                    archives, and it helps him locate those materials on the hard drive. <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#private">For instance, I have an item in here from
                        the archive in Germany,</quote> Jordan says, pointing at a folder on his
                    computer. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">And then I explain here what it
                        is that I have,</quote> Jordan clarifies further, indicating a paragraph in
                    his Word document. <quote rend="inline" source="#private">It’s all not terribly
                        systematic, but it’s my system and I know where everything is,</quote> he
                    concludes. Jordan takes extensive notes on the archival materials he is working
                    with, indicating what those materials contain, from which archive they come,
                    with what research themes and/or questions are they connected, and so on. </p>
                <p> Jordan is one of the rare scholars consulted in our study who does not use cloud
                    storage in his work. Our respondents overwhelmingly select general storage
                    systems, such as Dropbox, over specialized tools like citation managers. One of
                    the main reasons is that Dropbox enables them to arrange primary and secondary
                    sources side by side, organizing them in an autonomous and personal way —
                    without imposed classification structures — and to navigate through those
                    materials in a way that is both coherent and personal. For scholars, storing and
                    organizing their research materials is not a technical or an information science
                    activity. It is a deeply personal intellectual pursuit of organizing their
                    thoughts in a way that supports a subjective process of knowledge production,
                    and enables them to construct digital workflows as bricolage, from a diverse
                    range of resources and tools, as we discuss in the concluding section of this
                    paper. </p>

                <head>Discussion</head>
                <p> Both phases of the <title rend="italic">Digital Scholarly Workflow</title> study
                    indicate that digital technologies have become prevalent and transformative in
                    humanists’ research, challenging the view of digital scholarship as vital in the
                    sciences, but not in the humanities. Through an ethnographic approach and an
                    analytical focus on contextualized research practices, our study documented
                    myriad ways in which humanists actively interact with digital technologies. </p>
                <p> Contextual inquiry conducted in the second phase confirmed the predominance of
                    commercial and crowdsourced resources in the discovery search, recognized in
                    phase I of the study, and showed that humanists mainly use online services to
                    find and access secondary sources, while their search for primary sources
                    largely takes place offline, in the archival collections. </p>
                <p> Despite significant digitization efforts over the past few decades, archives and
                    other physical collections remain pivotal for humanists when it comes to finding
                    primary sources. Sinn and Soares (Op.cit.) observe the same trend by looking at
                    citations of digital archival collections compared with other sources. They
                    conclude that although citation of digital sources increases over time, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#sinn2014">the impact of digital archival
                            collections when compared with other source materials is not significant
                            when judging by the frequency of citations</quote>
                        <ptr target="#sinn2014" loc="1798"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p> Yet, while archives remain a vital site of humanists’ research, archival
                    practices significantly transform with the use of digital technologies. As we
                    observed throughout this paper, the main transformation emerges from the use of
                    digital cameras and humanists’ on-site digitization of archival materials. All
                    of our respondents whose research includes archival work reported taking digital
                    photos of primary sources and storing them for further use. Rutner and Schonfeld
                    (2012) identified the same trend among their respondents, arguing that the
                    widespread use of digital cameras in archives <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#rutner2012">is perhaps the single most
                            significant shift in research practices among historians, and one with
                            as-yet largely unrecognized implications for the work of historical
                            research and its support</quote>
                        <ptr target="#rutner2012" loc="11"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p> Through such practices humanists build rich personal collections of digitized
                    primary sources, which become one of the central information resources in their
                    work. Scholars consulted in both phases of our study stressed that such personal
                    digital collections provided them with desired work mobility and an
                    uninterrupted access to research data and materials. In parallel, however, such
                    collections confronted them with the problem of data deluge, for which our
                    respondents rarely had efficient management strategies. </p>
                <p> The problem of data deluge appeared as a consistent challenge with both primary
                    and secondary sources. As discussed in the previous section, humanists often
                    download from the web and save all secondary sources that seem relevant for
                    their work, but it sometimes takes months before they actually return to those
                    materials. By simply dumping downloaded files into hard-drive or cloud storage
                    folders, scholars often forget about those materials and end up investing time
                    in the same search process again. A further consequence is that their already
                    cluttered storage folders become even messier, as they save duplicate copies of
                    files downloaded in the previous search. Some of our respondents thus point out
                    that they had a complete breakdown of organizational system with a shift away
                    from paper copies, and needed to adjust their organizational system to digital
                    sources. An exception are scholars like Linda, who carefully review research
                    materials before deciding to download and store them, as well as scholars like
                    Theodora, who use citation managers that detect duplicate files. </p>
                <p> When it comes to primary sources, humanists traditionally managed archival
                    materials by collecting and storing a number of most important documents, while
                    they summarized other relevant materials in extensive research notes. This
                    established method of managing primary sources has been disrupted with the
                    adoption of digital cameras, as we discussed in previous sections. It appears
                    that, as a result of this change, humanists’ online practices have been
                    transposed to the sphere of physical archives, bringing hastier digital workflow
                    to traditionally more methodical archival work. Humanists now commonly handle
                    archival materials in the same way as they handle online sources — quickly
                    collect everything that seems relevant, store it, and examine later. </p>
                <p> Humanists’ archival work thus develops into <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#rutner2012">collection missions,</quote> as Rutner and Schonfeld
                    illustratively dub it, where scholars spend most of onsite time photographing
                    archival materials <ptr target="#rutner2012" loc="12"/>. As a result, they
                    regularly return from archives with hundreds, in some cases even thousands of
                    digitally captured materials, which confront them with challenges of storing,
                    searching, annotating, and retrieving those materials. Scholars’ personal
                    digital collections thus need to be a more visible point of analytical
                    attention, particularly with regard to securely storing those materials and
                    managing them in ways that enable easy retrieval and better workflow integration
                    across tools and data formats. </p>
                <p> Namely, the humanists in our study commonly use more than one software solution
                    in their research workflow. Trace and Karadkar (2016) noted similar practices
                    among the humanists they studied, and indicated support for a more integrated
                    solution with fewer moving parts and more connected activities. Literature on
                    personal information management has also discussed the fragmentation problem
                    within an individual workflow (<ptr target="#al-omar2013"/>; <ptr
                        target="#bergman2007"/>; <ptr target="#jones2011"/>). This <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#bergman2006">fragmentation of information into
                            different collections forces a person who is working on a single project
                            to store and retrieve items from different locations with no structural
                            connection between them</quote>
                        <ptr target="#bergman2007"/>
                    </cit>. In this study, we saw that all of the respondents search in one tool,
                    then deposit in another (or in multiple cases, more than one place), and this
                    disconnect between search and storage is ripe with possible complications,
                    including loss of information. As mentioned in the Introduction, humanists
                    consulted in our study suffered higher data loss than their colleagues in the
                    sciences. </p>
                <p> The importance of Microsoft Word as a storage and annotation tool emerged among
                    our participants in that regard. Word is used to store (and then cut and paste
                    into documents) citations and summaries of archival materials; Connor, Fred, and
                    Ellen demonstrate this workflow in action. All of these scholars used Word in
                    isolation as a <soCalled>blank slate</soCalled> document where they could create
                    lists or libraries of information that best suit their individual needs. </p>
                <p> With this adoption of Microsoft Word in mind, we wonder if it would be useful to
                    build connections into Word that bring other services to the user in this
                    environment (such as article discovery or more facilitated and anticipatory
                    citation management). A number of projects have similarly focused on bringing
                    increased information services into the Word processing environment (<ptr
                        target="#carr2004"/>; <ptr target="#dickinson2009"/>; <ptr
                        target="#fernicola2009"/>; <ptr target="#green2009"/>; <ptr
                        target="#murray-rust2004"/>; <ptr target="#sefton2009"/>). These
                    initiatives, all conducted between 2000-2010, saw the value of semantic data
                    within Word documents for researchers. An overall goal of most of these projects
                    was simply to combine services and collaboration to provide greater
                    opportunities for researchers. While the projects have not continued, the need
                    persists for better integration of a range of services within the word
                    processing environment, based on empirically observed research practices. </p>
                <p> This understanding of research practices mandates that future DH tools designed
                    for the scholarly workflow must account for humanists' empirically observed
                    needs, which are sometimes slow to change. For instance, we recently worked with
                    researchers at DePaul University to replicate our 2012 <title rend="italic"
                        >Digital Scholarly Workflow</title> study among their faculty. Five years
                    after our original study, the findings were strikingly similar. Humanists
                    continue to struggle with inefficient digital workflows, primarily with tools
                    that have been in use for a decade or more, and which do not successfully
                    support seamless workflows across information sources. </p>
                <p> Understanding similarities and differences in humanists’ interaction with
                    diverse information sources — digital and analog, institutional and
                    crowdsourced, academic and commercial, public and personal — will facilitate the
                    development of digital tools and methods that support uninterrupted search,
                    storing, and management across sources, computer programs, and data formats.
                    Such tools are needed to support a seamless manner in which humanists combine
                    research activities spanning a variety of digital and analog sources and
                        tools.<note> Tools such as Tropy (<ref target="https://tropy.org/"
                            >https://tropy.org/</ref>) are a positive step in that direction, though
                        they have a lot of space for improvement. For instance, it is essential for
                        such tools to have a mobile application allowing scholars to manage
                        photographed archival materials on site, to enable easy upload and
                        synchronization with cloud-based services, to provide detection of duplicate
                        files, and so on.</note> In this study, we saw Audrey who started her search
                    by using the Word search function to query a folder with her notes, switched to
                    online search in the Penn State library portal, then moved from the digital to
                    the analog realm reading through her books, and finally resolved her search
                    effort through the use of Google and Wikipedia. We also observed Linda who takes
                    handwritten notes in her notepad while reading articles online, then takes
                    photos of those notes and emails the photos to herself, saves them as PDFs, and
                    finally OCRs them, thus transforming her handwritten notes into searchable
                    digital notes. </p>
                <p> These examples show that in humanists’ workflows digital and analog tools and
                    resources do not necessarily replace one another or vie for the dominant
                    position. They rather supplement each other in an interconnected, hybrid, and
                    bricolage manner that comes to our respondents as an organic manifestation of
                    their work. To understand this better, it is useful to return to the view of
                    scholars as bricoleurs, which we presented in the Introduction of this essay,
                    and to which we return in the next and concluding section of this essay. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p> The view of scholars as bricoleurs draws on Lévi-Strauss’s (Op.cit.) inquiry
                    into bricolage as situated practice and its specific, unscripted approach to
                    technology illustrated in the comparison between engineers and bricoleurs.
                    Although the figures of bricoleur and engineer are idealized — as is the
                    difference between them — they point to an important difference in engaging with
                    technology and knowledge production. While the engineer uses specialized tools
                    adjusting tasks to the availability of those tools and striving for perfection,
                    the bricoleur takes the opposite route and adjusts non-specialized tools to a
                    variety of tasks, tolerating imperfection. The bricoleur achieves that by
                    combining available tools and resources into an improvised aggregate adjusted to
                    his or her needs. </p>
                <p> Bricolage is thus a creative act of recombining elements — tools, genes,
                    cultural forms, and so on — in individualized and unscripted ways. Drawing on
                    Lévi-Strauss, Jacob (1977) points out that <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#jacob1977">to create is to recombine,</quote> and offers the
                    example of natural selection: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#jacob1977">The action of natural selection has
                            often been compared to that of engineers. This, however, does not seem
                            to be a suitable comparison. First, because in contrast to what occurs
                            in evolution, the engineer works according to a preconceived plan. …
                            Second, because… to make a new product he [the engineer] has at his
                            disposal both material specially prepared to that end and machines
                            designed solely for that task. Finally, because the objects produced by
                            the engineer, at least by the good engineer, approach the level of
                            perfection made possible by the technology of the time. In contrast,
                            evolution is far from perfection. … It works like a tinkerer — a
                            tinkerer who does not know exactly what he is going to produce but uses
                            whatever he finds around him. … The tinkerer gives his materials
                            unexpected functions to produce a new object. From an old bicycle wheel,
                            he makes a roulette; from a broken chair the cabinet of a radio.
                            Similarly evolution makes a wing from a leg or a part of an ear from a
                            piece of jaw.</quote>

                <p> Turkle and Papert (1990) similarly draw on Lévi-Strauss to talk about
                        <soCalled>hard</soCalled> and <soCalled>soft</soCalled> approaches to
                    programming as two ways of engaging with technology and knowledge production.
                    They interpret these two approaches as gendered, and, more relevant for our
                    discussion, as differently scripted. While <soCalled>hard</soCalled> corresponds
                    to highly scripted and canonical approach, <soCalled>soft</soCalled> is
                    eminently creative, non-canonical, and personal. Turkle and Papert see computers
                    as a medium for expression of personal styles. Accordingly, they interpret
                    different styles of engaging with computers as insights into various styles of
                    thought, which they term epistemological pluralism. <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#turkle1990">Hard and soft are more than different approaches to

                            computer forces general questions about intellectual style to reveal an

                <p> To illustrate such revealing of intellectual styles, the authors provide
                    examples of two Harvard students dissatisfied with the way programming is taught
                    and practiced — namely, as a prescribed, highly scripted, and blackboxed
                    activity. One of the students wants instead to code in a more flexible and
                    creative manner and to <cit>

                    </cit>. Her colleague, a pianist, similarly discloses that although she had
                    learned the required — scripted and canonical — approach to programming, she
                    enjoys programming in a more creative way, treating it as musical phrases <ptr

                <p> Humanists consulted in this study similarly engage with digital tools and
                    resources in a non-canonical, highly personal way, which corresponds to their
                    style of thinking and working, to their intimate epistemology. We saw in the
                    previous sections that humanists do not experience their digital workflows as a
                    technical or an information science activity. Instead, it is a subjective
                    process of knowledge production in which they construct digital workflows from a
                    diverse range of tools and resources suited to their preferences, sensibilities,
                    and research needs. As one of us showed in the previous research <ptr
                        target="#antonijević2015"/>, humanists’ uptake of digital tools often
                    emerges spontaneously, based on specific research or teaching needs. Once so
                    adopted, digital technologies continue to interact with scholars’ workflows
                    quietly, usually remaining outside the purview of digital humanities. It is,
                    however, critically important for both DH theory and practice to recognize and
                    engage this variety of voices of non-canonical technology use, which <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#turkle1990">holds the promise of catalyzing
                        change,</quote> as Turkle and Papert point out <ptr target="#turkle1990"
                        loc="163"/>. </p>
                <p> One of such changes includes recognizing contextualized empirical studies of
                    scholars’ engagement with technology as the foundation for the development of
                    digital research tools. Namely, the bricolage way of working observed in this
                    study often comes from necessity, that is, from the lack of adequate tools and
                    resources. When our respondents use cell phone cameras to digitize archival
                    materials on site, this application of an available and simple technological
                    solution is a response to the lack of specialized tools and digitized primary
                    sources. Similarly, respondents’ extensive Word annotations of archival
                    materials alleviate the pain of managing impromptu digitized sources difficult
                    to search, annotate, and retrieve. </p>
                <p> The bricolage way of working thus often stems from the failure to provide
                    digital tools and resources that meaningfully improve scholarly practices and
                    inspire wider uptake. In both phases of the <title rend="italic">Digital
                        Scholarly Workflow</title> project humanists emphasized that their adoption
                    of digital tools primarily depends on the tool’s capacity to meet their research
                    needs. As long as a simple tool like Word or Dropbox successfully supports their
                    work, scholars do not tend to replace it with a novel or more sophisticated
                    tool. <q>Sufficient, not efficient</q> is the guiding motto of their selection
                    and adoption of digital tools and resources. </p>
                <p> As we discussed throughout the paper, efficiency cannot be qualified as a
                    neutral or inherent characteristic of digital tools independent of scholars’
                    practices. It is scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts that determines
                    what constitutes efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholar’s workflow. As
                    Pinch and Bijker (1987) point out, the same technological artifact can be
                    attributed with very different meanings and interpretations depending on the
                    context of use and particular understanding of those artifacts. Law (2003)
                    similarly recognizes that technological imperfections and
                        <soCalled>unruly</soCalled> practices in technology use are not only
                    unavoidable, but also beneficial insomuch that they become integrated into a
                    routine that enables uninterrupted functioning. </p>
                <p> It is through this analytical lens that we can understand
                        <soCalled>inefficient</soCalled> and <soCalled>unruly</soCalled> bricolage
                    practices observed in this study. Like bricoleurs in Lévi-Strauss’s original
                    account, humanists are constructing their digital workflow with an orientation
                    on creativity and interpretation rather than on efficiency. Embracing humanities
                    researchers as bricoleurs will thus enable us to prevent the quest for
                    computational efficiency from overshadowing the quest for humanistic
                    understanding. </p>
