                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>This paper describes a digital teaching application that approaches the study of
                    language and literary works from a social semiotic perspective and represents an
                    innovative pedagogical model for world language and literature classes. The
                    Golden Age Literature Glossary Online, known by the acronym <title rend="italic"
                        >GALGO</title>, consists of an online glossary of select keywords, from
                    canonical texts of Golden Age Spanish literature, whose multiple connotations
                    illuminate important linguistic and social concepts of the 16th and 17th
                    centuries. <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> incorporates British cultural
                    historian Raymond Williams’ methodology in his <title rend="italic">Keywords: A
                        Vocabulary of Culture and Society</title>: namely, identifying problem-laden
                    words or <quote rend="inline" source="#williams1983">keywords,</quote> charting their
                    distinct usages across texts, and reflecting critically on clusters of
                    associated words. <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> seeks to instantiate
                    language as social semiotic by linking the semantic configurations of a literary
                    work simultaneously to the cultural environment, the linguistic system, and the
                    social system. Applying the conceptual design of M.A.K. Halliday’s social
                    semiotic model, <title rend="italic">GALGO</title>’s interpretive apparatus
                    provides the <hi rend="italic">field of discourse</hi> or context of situation
                    for the text in which a specific keyword appears. The <hi rend="italic">field of
                        discourse</hi> presents clusters, word groupings of semiotic affinity that
                    describe the social action that is taking place in the text. <title
                        rend="italic">GALGO</title> also performs an interpretation of the <hi
                        rend="italic">tenor of discourse</hi>, highlighting sociological variables
                    connected to class status, gender role and racial category that refine a
                    keyword’s meaning from the perspective of interpersonal relationships. Finally,
                        <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> adds <hi rend="italic">commentary</hi> on
                    discursive structures, such as patterns of grammar, syntactic nuances, and
                    figurative language, that surround the keyword in the text.</p>
                <p><title rend="italic">GALGO</title>’s strength resides in the synchronic
                    connectivity that the system facilitates when identifying the constellation of
                    meanings for any given keyword. From a technical perspective, the system has the
                    ability to efficiently identify the absolute position of all uses of a keyword
                    across multiple texts, so that large texts can be managed and search times
                    minimized for both users and system administrators. <title rend="italic"
                        >GALGO</title> is constructed in such a way that users can not only access
                    existing analysis within the database, but also can assume, when instructed to
                    do so, the role of the system administrator and contribute their own
                    annotations. A team of faculty and student administrators are currently building
                    the database with research previously collected in Spanish Golden Age literature
                    seminars. Providence College students have utilized the social semiotic
                    methodology underlying <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> for several years now
                    with successful outcomes both in terms of their growth as language majors and
                    critical thinkers.</p>

            <p>The dialogue between the digital and the humanities has not been fluid and continues
                to raise skepticism among a majority of humanists in this third decade since the
                advent of the field of Digital Humanities (DH). A primary concern is the ready
                appropriation of empiricist rather than humanistic methods of inquiry in the
                creation of DH tools. Johanna Drucker is among the most vocal in lamenting that
                computer generated humanities scholarship, by in large, seeks <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#drucker2012">positivistic, strictly quantitative, mechanistic, reductive and
                    literal</quote> scientific ends, and undermines the humanities’ <cit>

                        as knowing, observer dependent, emergent, and process-driven rather than

                    <ptr target="#drucker2012"/>
                </cit>. DH scholars are creating, with powerful platforms that support large corpus
                processing, data mining and modeling, ever more complex and innovative projects that
                nonetheless mute, in Drucker’s view, the core critical principles and affective
                experiences that have traditionally lay at the heart of work in the humanities. </p>
            <p>The subject of this paper, <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> (<title rend="italic"
                    >Golden Age Literature Glossary Online</title>) was developed with a humanistic
                method of inquiry in mind and may resolve the issues raised by Drucker and offer new
                pedagogical insights into computer-assisted reading and analysis of texts. The
                potential benefits of the introduction of instructional platforms such as <title
                    rend="italic">GALGO</title> within the larger field of Digital Humanities, are
                multiple: 1) a wide variety of small scale digital text analysis projects, like
                those suggested on the MLA Commons site, <title rend="quotes">Literary Studies in
                    the Digital Age,</title> can be developed for classroom use and then elaborated
                on if proven to be of value, 2) students, more adept at using digital technology,
                will be able to contribute in significant ways to tool development <ptr

                mentored by faculty <ptr target="#InmanBerens2014" loc="6–7"/>, and 3) the role that
                the cultural canon performs within local and global societies can be more broadly
                and effectively explored, enabling the humanities discipline to undergo a much
                needed change.</p>
            <p>In the domain of digital text analysis, Franco Moretti’s celebrated <q>distant
                    reading</q> model seems to bear out the same epistemological divide discussed
                above. Illuminating and potentially canon busting, the manipulation of massive
                datasets suggests more innovative means by which to evaluate formal and generic
                literary conventions, but involves <cit>

                <head>1. A Social Semiotic Model for Digital Literary Analysis: Accessing the
                    Language of Golden Age Spanish Culture</head>
                <p>With increasing frequency over the last decade, students in our foreign language
                    literature classes remark that they often find it difficult to relate to terms
                    and themes in the canonical works that they are studying since they perceive
                    them as obsolete and irrelevant. Students want to read literature that reflects
                    their concerns and that offers them ways to address those concerns from varied
                    perspectives. The main pedagogical challenge, then, lies in guiding students to
                        <soCalled>see</soCalled> the interconnectedness between early modern and
                    contemporary language usage at the semantic and syntactic levels. </p>
                <p>Our research has demonstrated that the keyword analysis developed by British
                    cultural historian Raymond Williams provides a particularly amenable approach
                    for engaging students in the study of foreign language and literature, honing in
                    as it does on charged social and political terms that span societies and time
                    periods <ptr target="#garcía2014"/>. Williams’ methodology, namely, identifying
                    problem-laden words or <q>keywords,</q> interpreting their meanings in various
                    contexts, and reflecting critically on clusters of associated words, serves to
                    bring to the fore in any text an array of linguistic and historical questions to
                    be researched and discussed. The keyword sociolinguistic framework allows for <cit>

                            to be made at once conscious and critical – subject to change as well as

                    </cit>. For Williams, in the mid-20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> century, they
                    were: culture, society, democracy, class, etc. For students of Golden Age Spain,
                    they tend to be moral and social terms inflected by the period’s dominant
                    philosophical concerns; for example, <foreign xml:lang="es">fuerza</foreign> (1.
                        <hi rend="italic">courage</hi>, 2. <hi rend="italic">brute strength</hi>, 3.
                        <hi rend="italic">the force of truth</hi>) and <foreign xml:lang="es"
                        >gentileza</foreign> (1. <hi rend="italic">cultivated manner and
                        appearance</hi>, 2. <hi rend="italic">moral uprightness</hi>). The polysemy
                    of a word can be so extensive that it may include conflicting meanings as in
                        <foreign xml:lang="es">voluntad</foreign> (1. <hi rend="italic">the rational
                        will, part of the human soul, that seeks the moral good</hi>, 2. <hi
                        rend="italic">free choice</hi>, 3. <hi rend="italic">uncontrolled sexual
                        desire</hi>).</p>
                <p>Undergirding William’s keyword study is a social semiotic theory of language,
                    which understands language as text delivered in a specific context of social
                    interaction and constructed from linguistic codes derived from the culture <ptr
                        target="#halliday1989"/>. From this theoretical perspective, the situational
                    context determines the text, and textual analysis should reflect a movement from
                    the outside inwards: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#halliday1978">We have taken as our starting
                            point the observation that meanings are created by the social system and
                            are exchanged by the members in the form of text…. Persistence and
                            change in the social system are both reflected in text and brought about
                            by means of text… text as the semantic process of social
                            dynamics</quote>

                <p>Yuri Lotman, in his groundbreaking work on a semiotic theory of culture, finds
                    the language of literary texts to be the best vehicle for identifying specific
                    semiotic codes prevalent among different social groups in different historical
                    periods. <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#lotman1990">In the literary text there is an
                            optimal correlation whereby the conflicting structures are disposed not
                            hierarchically but dialogically on the same level. This is why a
                            literary narrative is the most flexible and effective modeling mechanism
                            for describing extremely complex structures and situations in their

                    </cit>. Cultural semiotics justifies the study of the literary canon as a rich
                    source of cultural memory, a portrait of the peculiar idiosyncrasy of an era,
                    and an open examination of social and racial taboos. In the case of Spanish
                    culture, reading Cervantes and his Golden Age contemporaries, bears this out:

                    seeks to instantiate language as social semiotic by linking the semantic
                    configurations of a literary text simultaneously to the cultural environment,
                    the linguistic system, and the social system <ptr target="#halliday1978"
                        loc="142"/>. The computer is an ideal semiotic machine <ptr
                        target="#olsen1993" loc="313"/> to expose these overlapping layers of
                    meaning. Applying the conceptual design of M.A.K. Halliday’s social semiotic
                    model, <title rend="italic">GALGO</title>’s interpretive apparatus provides the
                        <hi rend="italic">field of discourse</hi> or context of situation for the
                    text in which a specific keyword appears. The <hi rend="italic">field of
                        discourse</hi> presents clusters, word groupings of semiotic affinity that
                    describe the social action that is taking place in the text. <title
                        rend="italic">GALGO</title> also performs an interpretation of the <hi
                        rend="italic">tenor of discourse</hi>, highlighting sociological variables
                    connected to class status, gender role and racial category that refine a
                    keyword’s meaning from the perspective of interpersonal relationships. Finally,
                        <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> adds <hi rend="italic">commentary</hi> on
                    discursive structures, such as patterns of grammar, syntactic nuances, and
                    figurative language, that surround the keyword in the text.</p>

                    and whose lexical value(s) often differ from today’s. All keyword definitions
                    undergo a multilayered social semiotic analysis that can be compared and

                <p><title rend="italic">GALGO</title>’s strength resides in the synchronic
                    connectivity that the system facilitates when identifying the constellation of
                    meanings for any given keyword. From a technical perspective, the database
                    development has been a complex process, requiring multiple prototypes of the
                    glossary and many iterations of interface applications. The system must have the
                    ability to identify the absolute position of all uses of a keyword across
                    multiple texts and perform this task in an efficient way, so that large texts
                    can be managed and search times minimized for both users and system
                    administrators. <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> is constructed in such a way
                    that users can not only access existing analysis within the database, but also
                    can assume, when instructed to do so, the role of the system administrator and
                    contribute their own annotations. </p>
                <p>When a user logs on to read a particular literary work, the document is loaded

                    interface. The user interface is straightforward, so that one can quickly locate
                    specific keywords in the work, view definitions, and visualize the web of
                    semantic relationships that surround those keywords. A persistent navigation
                    system lists the keywords in the database to the far right of the literary work
                    and gives the multiple definitions for each word. There are hyperlinks to the

                <p>The process of data entry and keyword annotation has been successfully
                    streamlined for system administrators in this current version of <title
                        rend="italic">GALGO</title>. To create a new text, all the administrator
                    needs to do is fill out a simple web form, providing a title, specific metadata,
                    and uploading a TEI XML encoded text file. Once uploaded, the text document is
                    read into a buffer. The document is stored on the server in its unaltered state,
                    so it can be used later as an inviolable document of record. The search index
                    contains every keyword in the work and its absolute position in that work. Each
                    word also contains an absolute unique identifier, allowing the system to quickly
                    locate that word in every other work. </p>
                <p>Administrators enter a keyword manually, and the application scans the document
                    to find and highlight every instance of the keyword and prepares a list of those
                    keywords in the database. When administrators click on an undefined usage,
                    either in the document, or in the word use list, an editing interface opens. In
                    this interface, a definition from a list of definitions already associated with
                    the keyword can be selected, or a new definition can be entered. Upon
                    submitting, the definition is associated with both the keyword itself and with
                    the particular usage selected. The clustering tool allows administrators to
                    annotate these definitions, explaining why certain word clusters are key to
                    understanding the text, referencing both field and tenor of discourse. A client
                    side selection tool permits the administrators to determine the boundaries of
                    the text by choosing neighboring terms to cluster with the keyword. These words,
                    their position in the text, and the keyword itself together make up the field of
                    discourse. </p>
                <p><title rend="italic">GALGO</title> is comprised of a team of faculty and student
                    administrators who are building the database with research previously collected
                    in Spanish Golden Age literature seminars. Providence College students have
                    utilized the social semiotic methodology underlying <title rend="italic"
                        >GALGO</title> for several years now with successful outcomes both in terms

                    will be expanded to include five additional literary works from the period and
                    five new keywords. The project has received public recognition from Providence

                <p>Given that the sophisticated and powerful digital architecture behind <title
                        rend="italic">GALGO</title> can accommodate any set of works, whether in
                    another language or another discipline, we are in the process of seeking
                    feedback from a broader audience of colleagues and students. Focus groups will
                    be conducted to test the platform’s capabilities and discuss its applicability
                    beyond the field of Spanish literary studies. The nature of <title rend="italic"
                        >GALGO</title>’s new analytical and visualization functions will be impacted
                    by the results of the focus group sessions. Future system development might
                    include advanced language manipulation and search functions. In particular, it
                    might include language specific stemming index algorithms that would make it
                    possible to match natural language terms and clusters across multiple works.
                    There could also be a quantitative facet to the cluster analysis that would
                    determine the keyword’s distributional profile<note> According to the
                        Distributional Hypothesis, the distributional profile (DP) of a word is
                        determined by the strength of association of the word with co-occurring
                        words in the text [<ptr target="#rubenstein1965"/>; <ptr
                            target="#schütze1992"/>; <ptr target="#pantel2005"/>] </note> (DP) with
                    respect to underlying semantic relationships. <title rend="italic"
                    >GALGO</title>’s interface could be enhanced to provide dynamic views that
                    reveal the distribution and intricacy of clustered lexical webs across any

                <p>Students in the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> century are equipped with a set
                    of literacy skills, honed through their extensive interactions on social media,

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>The vitality of literary classics depends on the ability and interest of each new
                    generation of readers to participate actively in a process of continuous
                    semantic (ex)change. In alignment with this objective, <title rend="italic"
                        >GALGO</title> prioritizes two functions that other text analysis
                    applications like Voyant <ptr target="#sinclair2016"/>, NVivo software and Paper
                    Machines do not: curation and contextual meaning. <title rend="italic"
                        >GALGO</title> allows a professor to create a curated exhibit in order to
                    help students see the ebb and flow of particular words throughout a set of
                    works. Voyant, for example, is good at showing the usage cases of a particular
                    word across a work, but there is no way for a student, encountering a complex
                    work for the first time, to make semantic connections without help.
                    Additionally, with <title rend="italic">GALGO</title>, students can annotate a
                    text themselves, and a professor can review their work, creating opportunities
                    for guided self-discovery and in-depth conversation. These other tools do not
                    afford this because they lack the capacity to promote genuine collaboration on
                    research.</p>
                <p>Finally, <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> allows a student to look beyond the
                    word itself and trace contextual meaning, rather than just the word. A term is
                    always connected to several different possible definitions. These other tools
                    only show the uses of a particular word and do not help a student understand
                    that the same word can mean very different things depending on the fields and
                    tenors of discourse. It is unclear how useful it is just to see all the
                    instances of a given word, especially for students with limited knowledge of a
                    particular work, its period or even of the language in which it is written. By
                    showing the range of definitions for the keywords and allowing students to
                    browse by one or more definitions, <title rend="italic">GALGO</title> exposes
                    how the meanings of the keywords both recur and vary across texts.</p>
