                        <p>Yung-Hsing Wu is an Associate Professor of English at the University of
                            Louisiana at Lafayette, where she teaches critical theory and
                            contemporary print cultures. Her interest in the latter has been spurred
                            by the variety and intensity of response to the idea of reading in the
                            late age of print. Her current book project, The Institution of Reading,
                            follows reading to a variety of locations — including Oprah’s <q>Summer
                                of Faulkner</q> campaign, Facebook pages devoted to canonical
                            authors, and the <soCalled>reading</soCalled> of <title rend="italic"
                                >Fahrenheit 451</title> performed by Amazon.com’s Kindle — and

                            culture, they also suggest that contemporary reading yields contexts in
                            which the popular and the traditional mingle, sometimes with friction,
                            sometimes with astonishing seamlessness.</p>

            <dhq:abstract>

                <p>Where will all the books go? A version of that question has occupied commentary
                    about Amazon’s Kindle since news of its release first made its way to public
                    attention in September 2007. Posed out of curiosity, excitement, as well as
                    trepidation, the question includes anxiety about the re-invention of reading
                    embodied by new features and the intricacies of downloading policy. In this
                    essay, I focus on disappearance for the ways in which it indexes concerns about
                    the Kindle’s material impact on reading. Tracking these concerns, I turn to
                    three major moments in the Kindle’s <soCalled>biography</soCalled> in order to
                    emphasize Amazon’s investment in mimicking the transcendence associated with
                    reading and the ways in which this investment is met, and at times exceeded, by
                    readerly desires to possess that transcendence. That the very name <q>Kindle</q>
                    should occasion parallels between e-reading and book burning, that Jeff Bezos
                    should claim unobtrusiveness as the device’s exemplary feature, and that
                    Amazon’s unannounced deletions of Orwell’s <title rend="italic">1984</title>
                    from thousands of Kindle libraries should meet with such ire, makes visible the
                    two ideologies of reading — on the one hand, the invaluable (because ephemeral)
                    force of reading and on the other, reading as a relation of ownership and agency
                    — that stand in both an uneasy and profitable tension for Amazon and its
                    reader-consumers.</p>

                <head>Kindling, Disappearing, Reading</head>
                <p>Within two weeks of the Kindle’s public release in the fall of 2007 a rather
                    telling fantasy had begun to emerge. In this fantasy, one that cohered out of
                    book industry and tech blogs, media features, interviews, and articles on-line
                    and in print, Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com, arrives one weekday
                    afternoon to Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo studios for a surprise guest appearance on
                    her show. To an audience of attentive Oprah devotees, Bezos speaks about the
                    Kindle, describing it as a portable service that, thanks to its ability to
                    connect with Amazon.com, will change the face of reading by making it more
                    accessible, even more enjoyable to even more readers. As Winfrey looks on
                    approvingly, Bezos asserts that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#levy2007">this
                        is the most important thing we’ve ever done. It’s so ambitious to take
                        something as highly evolved as the book and improve on it. And maybe even
                        change the way people read</quote>
                    <ptr target="#levy2007"/></cit>. With a significant glance at the talk show host,
                    Bezos then takes a breath and announces that <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#borenstein2007">for a limited time, Oprah viewers who buy a
                        Kindle from Amazon will get digital copies of all future Book Club books
                        delivered directly to their device for free</quote>
                    <ptr target="#borenstein2007"/></cit>. The Oprah audience — accustomed to corporate
                    promotions as well as pronouncements about the incalculable value of reading —
                    cheers, and the camera pans wide to take in and broadcast their glee at the
                    prospect of reading made so spectacular.</p>
                <p>As phantasmatic as it was premature, this scenario was striking on various
                    counts, not the least of which was its imagination of a marriage made in media
                    heaven, a union of two moguls already iconic in book culture. There was, then, a
                    sense of the inevitable realized when a year later (in October of 2008), Oprah
                    announced on-air and on-line that the Kindle was <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#gonsalves2008">absolutely my new favorite thing in the
                        world</quote>
                    <ptr target="#gonsalves2008"/></cit>. Not unlike those who touted the Kindle on
                    Amazon’s website, Oprah insisted that using the Kindle had changed the way she
                    read and enhanced her love of reading.<note> As Ted Striphas notes at the
                        beginning of <title rend="quotes">The Abuses of Literacy: Amazon Kindle and
                            the Right to Read,</title> this was a <q>love affair</q> Oprah could
                        celebrate with her audience. See <title rend="italic">Communication and
                            Critical/Cultural Studies</title> 7:3 (September 2010).</note> As she
                    implied later in a video testimonial on Amazon’s website, the Kindle was <q>life-changing</q> because it
                    enabled all the more her capacity for reading. The efficacy of her endorsement
                    was especially salient at that moment, for Oprah the reader stood at the
                    crossroads defining much of the talk about Amazon’s first made product. The
                    bibliophilic Oprah who prizes and collects first editions for their rarity,
                    regarding them as material treasures, is, after all, also the Oprah who views
                    reading as a spiritual and democratizing vocation, who has translated that sense
                    into a book club that is as much a multi-media phenomenon as anything else. Yet
                    the speculation following her endorsement suggested that even an alliance with
                    Oprah, the unquestioned <title rend="quotes">Queen of Reading in
                        America,</title> might not win the battle for the Kindle. Indeed by the time
                    Oprah brought the device to the attention of her viewers, the public debate over
                    the Kindle and its impact on contemporary reading practices was already in full
                    swing. To what extent would the Kindle replace the book? What is a Kindle book,
                    and how does one read it? Where would books go in the wake of the Kindle? For
                    Oprah to confer on the Kindle her particular readerly and literary authority was
                    to allay some of these anxieties. For Oprah to tout the Kindle was not only to
                    position the device in the mainstream, but also to foreground that
                    Kindle-reading would simultaneously maintain and depart from the experience of
                    book reading.</p>
                <p>That simultaneity, and Oprah’s embrace of it, functioned to reassure and excite
                    her viewers with an account of reading as fresh as it was familiar. In this
                    essay, I contend that Amazon’s construction of reading is similarly nostalgic
                    and forward-looking, and that understanding this construction marks a crucial
                    step in accounting for the Kindle’s reception. The seamlessness Amazon
                    attributes to Kindle-reading depends, I argue, on a careful ideological
                    suturing. To perform this suturing, Amazon in design and discourse insists that
                    the Kindle’s innovations enhance reading without altering its long familiar
                    nature. In this balancing act the symbolic resonance of print reading tempers
                    the sensibility that the digital will remake reading. My point is not to judge
                    the success of the Kindle, to lament its shortcomings or herald its triumphs,
                    but to argue that its evocation of print, or what Jerome McGann might call a
                    virtual bibliographic coding, <emph>grounds</emph> Amazon’s promotion of its
                    revolutionary nature <ptr target="#mcgann1991"/>. If McGann writes to remind
                    literary critics that print materiality is constitutive of meaning, then I
                    suggest that something similar is true for the Kindle. The print conventions
                    Amazon invokes in the Kindle’s form and functionality recall traditional
                    pleasures of solitary reading; in so doing, they also call attention to the
                    Kindle’s difference — to the interface and features that place it at a remove
                    from print. The Kindle turns to print as the embodied spirit of reading that
                    will now acquire a new legibility.</p>
                <p>Interrogating the Kindle in this way is to focus on <title rend="italic"
                        >Amazon’s</title> negotiation of an ideological terrain of reading. But any
                    understanding of the sea change effected by the Kindle’s remediation of print
                    reading must also take into account the response to the device. This is to
                    extend the line of thinking Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin pursue when they
                    address what impact the remediation characteristic of new digital media has on
                    subjectivity. Their premise that <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter1999">…we
                        see ourselves today in and through our available media</quote> defines the
                    subject in an intimate relation to media, and that relation, they suggest, tips
                    over to a kind of mediated interpellation <ptr target="#bolter1999" loc="232"/>.
                    The subject who watches a film adaptation of a novel <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#bolter1999">bring[s],</quote> they assert, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#bolter1999">a notion of self appropriate to voiced prose</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bolter1999" loc="232"/></cit>; that subject is hailed by both the novel
                    and the film that puts it on the big screen, and her agency emerges out of the
                    work of representation. While Bolter and Grusin take care to delineate the
                    agencies specific to remediated subjectivity — the virtual self, for instance,
                    can, thanks to her immersion, shift her self by shifting her point of view —
                    they do not address how the responses these subjects might have to their
                    remediation can further illuminate its workings. To the extent that their focus
                    lies with deployment, with what a networked self does in <q>being connected,</q> they do not imagine the work
                    of reception. My point in examining the Kindle’s remediation of reading is to
                    interrogate it, on the one hand, as an instance of subject formation in which
                    Amazon has invested rhetoric, time, and money, and, on the other hand, to treat
                    the reception of the device as an index of the tensions that continue to
                    underlie the relations between print and digital spheres. I therefore include
                    the ways in which self-identified readers return Amazon’s address, and suggest
                    that their comments often turn that address on its head. For the responses of
                    Kindle readers — proponents as well as fence-sitters and detractors —
                    constitutes a discourse on disappearance, a troping that reveals just how
                    literally the material impact of reading is registered. This discourse emerges
                    out of a series of moments, and in constructing from them a biography of the
                    device I argue that what Kindle-reading has come to mean is marked in no small
                    way by readers’ <emph>refusal</emph> of Amazon’s vision for reading. When
                    readers turn to <title rend="italic">Fahrenheit 451</title> to describe
                    parallels between Kindle-reading and book burning, when they object to the
                    exclusivity of Stephen King’s Kindle novella, and critique the deletions of
                    Orwell’s <title rend="italic">1984</title> from thousands of Kindle libraries,
                    their prior investments in reading inflect their response to the device.
                    Kindle-reading has therefore generated a possessiveness about reading. </p>

                <p>The first physical product of Amazon’s making, the Kindle was from the start no
                    eye-pleaser. Even over the course of its evolution it neither achieved nor
                    sought the sleekness vaunted by so many technophiles or the friendly aesthetic
                    of Apple products. The first version, an off-white plastic rectangle, was plain
                    in shape, color, and material, and inspired dismay and not a little disdain.
                    Early reviews of this first Kindle made much of this plainness, commenting, and
                    at times complaining, that Amazon’s device could not compare, at least
                    aesthetically, with Apple’s iPod or iPhone: <quote rend="block"
                        source="#thurrott2007">I briefly looked at it and my first reaction is that
                        the gadget is not sexy. I mean, when you look at an iPod or iPhone, you feel
                        the desire to own it, partly because of it’s [sic] looks (don’t deny!). The
                        things I didn’t like are the plastic look and the odd shape with sharp
                        corners…If you own a iPod Video or an iPhone, you know how cool the round
                        corners [are] with a steel casing <ptr target="#thurrott2007"/>.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>Compared to Amazon’s account of the Kindle’s <soCalled>ergonomic design,</soCalled> one that emphasized how the device is <soCalled>as easy to hold and use as a book,</soCalled> Paul
                    Thurrott’s assessment foregrounds the relationship between affect and aesthetic.
                    The Kindle is strictly pragmatic, its multiple features designed in the service
                    of reading rather than, say, in anticipation of pleasure. Its privileging of
                    function creates, as Thurrott put it, little desire, while the iPod, pleasing to
                    the eye, generates <quote rend="inline" source="#thurrott2010">the desire to own
                        it.</quote> This split between form and function turns on the yoking of
                    desire with aesthetics, generating much of the commentary that there was no
                    pleasure to be had from the Kindle’s look. This is the point Thurrott goes on to
                    make in his more sustained review: <quote rend="block" source="#thurrott2010"
                        >The Amazon Kindle is a small, white, slate-type computing device with a
                        6-inch screen and a small QWERTY keyboard with Chiclet-like keys. In many
                        ways, the Kindle is the anti-iPod, the ego to Apple’s id. They’re both white
                        portable devices with screens. But the similarities end there. Where Apple’s
                        devices are Spartan in design, favoring form over function, the Kindle is
                        all buttons and ports, a utilitarian device that was quite obviously
                        designed around the content you’ll be reading onscreen and virtually nothing
                        else. This is what the extreme version of function over form looks like, and
                        its [sic] hard not to wonder whether there isn’t a happy medium between the
                        Kindle and Apple’s form over function devices <ptr target="#thurrott2010"
                        />.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>Thurrott’s comparison attributes to each device a particular aesthetic and
                    affect, doing so in such a way as to further distinguish the Kindle from the
                    iPod: purpose versus pleasure, function over form, id pit in opposition to ego.
                    Indeed if his focus pushes reading to the margins — somewhat appropriately,
                    since the iPod did not feature reading capacity until later — it also enacts the
                    strict functionality he ascribes to the Kindle approach to reading. There is, as
                    he puts it, <quote rend="inline" source="#thurrott2010">virtually nothing else.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>Embedded in this rather damning assessment is, however, a logic that the Kindle’s
                    aesthetic presupposes a view of reading as a disappearing act. In a <title
                        rend="italic">Newsweek</title> interview following the launch of the device
                    Bezos touched on this view as he argued for the Kindle’s distinctiveness. On the
                    one hand, he observed, its portability, wirelessness, and storage capacity would
                    foster reading by bringing readers closer and more quickly to the act. Indeed
                    these features define the Kindle through its capacity to do things <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#levy2007">that ordinary books can’t do</quote>
                    <ptr target="#levy2007"/></cit>. On the other hand, he also insisted that the Kindle’s
                    looks possessed an awareness of form, in particular, the codex form of books.
                    His response to the commentary swirling around the Kindle’s appearance thus
                    pivots on books and their materiality: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#levy2007"
                        >I’ve actually asked myself, <q>Why do I love these physical objects? Why do
                            I love the smell of glue and ink?</q>’</quote>
                    <ptr target="#levy2007"/></cit>. The answer, he went on to say, resides in the smell
                    that reminds him of <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#levy2007">all those worlds I
                        have been transported to…the key feature of a book is that it
                        disappears</quote>
                    <ptr target="#levy2007"/></cit>. Physical sensuality — <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#levy2007">the smell of glue and ink</quote> — enables the
                    fantastic, the imagination of <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#levy2007">all
                        those worlds I have been transported to</quote>
                    <ptr target="#levy2007"/></cit>. If books are made, and their sensual existence as
                    made objects prompts bibliophilia, some of their force resides nonetheless in
                    their immateriality, in their ability to disappear. When read, the book loses
                    its force — its charge — as a physical object; it gives up something of its
                    physicality. While the good faith of Bezos’ comments remains uncertain at best,
                    and while some of the changes in the later Kindle editions have reconfigured its
                    design, it’s important to note that his remarks align reading with form and its
                    erasure. Over the course of the Kindle’s history Amazon has continued to
                    idealize this sense of disappearance in a way that echoes the familiar saying
                    that one is lost to the world when reading a good book. From this point of view,
                    one that Amazon has made profitable, plainness of design aligns the Kindle with
                    this elusive immateriality. </p>
                <p>This investment in immateriality draws on and magnifies the sensibility that
                    idealizes books as icons of culture. To understand this relation is to note, as
                    one commentator did early on, that an <quote rend="inline" source="#carr2011"
                        >aura of bookishness</quote> makes the Kindle <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#carr2011">less of a whizzy gizmo than an austere vessel of
                        culture</quote>
                    <ptr target="#carr2011"/></cit>. The Kindle’s pursuit of the bookish aura has meant
                    eschewing material traits that signify mechanized gadgetry in favor of the
                    unassuming shape and dimensions of a paperback: a slender, slight thing with a
                    tapered silhouette it <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#carr2011">emulates the
                        bulge toward a book’s binding</quote>
                    <ptr target="#carr2011"/></cit>. The early Kindle looked like a printed paperback, and
                    Amazon’s rhetoric made clear that this resemblance was both deliberate (there’s
                    a reason it doesn’t look like an iPod) and purposeful (it seeks to
                        <emph>do</emph> something with this mimicry). Indeed the first Kindle
                    featured on its back cover a series of glyphs, from Egyptian hieroglyphics,
                    Norse runes, and Mesopotamian cuneiform, Hebrew and Arabic script, Greek, and
                    Germanic blackletter, as well as variations of the Romance letterform, that
                    together suggested the evolution of written language, inscribed here as an
                    element of the Kindle’s design.<note> As Robert Mohns notes, the glyphs embedded
                        in the Kindle’s cover constitute its <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            source="#mohns2008">one real concession to design for design’s sake
                            […] It’s a brilliant graphic, expressing the evolution of written
                            language ... and the heights Amazon hopes Kindle will achieve</quote>
                        <ptr target="#mohns2008"/></cit>.</note> In the context of the Kindle’s homage to
                    the book, this representation also recalls scrolls, paper, manuscripts: an
                    invocation of the medium as well as the history of writing and reading. The
                    inscribed glyphs point, therefore, to the book’s long history as <q>an austere vessel of culture.</q>
                    Books possess this status because they are said to transcend the materiality
                    that defines them — their bindings, covers, and pages — by disappearing from
                    view when read. Referring to this transcendence, the Kindle thereby assumes its
                    austerity. In so doing, it becomes an instrument of culture, a <q>vessel</q>
                    that like the book knows it place. </p>
                <p>In this context I want to underscore how the Kindle’s mimicry both calls
                    attention to and absorbs its revolutionary status. This dynamic is especially
                    apparent in talk about the Kindle screen, which Amazon from the outset has
                    heralded as a technological advance that nonetheless maintains reading as it is.
                    For when the website asserts that the Kindle provides a reading experience
                        <q>as sharp and natural as reading ink
                        on paper — and nothing like the strain and glare of a computer
                        screen,</q> its gesture sets the device in relation to both book and
                    computer, places it closer to the book, and perhaps most significantly,
                    naturalizes Kindle-reading through the association.<note>The first Kindle
                        featured <q>electronic paper,</q> while more recent Kindles incorporate
                        E-Ink Pearl display. The rhetoric remains the same.</note> Paper is the
                    measure of the Kindle screen as it indexes readability, and perhaps more
                    importantly, enables the bookish feat of disappearing. As fantasy writer Neil
                    Gaiman put it in his testimonial, <quote rend="inline" source="#gaiman">It’s
                        very, very crisp. Very functional. Very readable</quote>
                    <ptr target="#gaiman"/>. In his account, meanwhile, author Michael Lewis echoes
                    Bezos when he notes that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kafka2010">after five
                        minutes I’ve ceased to think I’m looking at a screen</quote>
                    <ptr target="#kafka2010"/></cit>. Endorsements like these rend the Kindle of
                    technological resonance, while celebrating, almost breathlessly, the advances in
                    technology that have made that erasure possible. Indeed the point might be made
                    that the former enables the latter — the Luddite stance, one that understands
                    reading in all-but pastoral terms, promotes the claim that we are on the cusp of
                    something revolutionary. Or perhaps is it the other way around? When <title
                        rend="italic">Lemony Snicket</title> author Daniel Handler compares the
                    Kindle to a book he emphasizes that the latter requires no connectivity: <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#handler">You just have to put it in your hands and
                        read it</quote>
                    <ptr target="#handler"/></cit>. Here the <emph>point</emph> of Kindle technology
                    appears to be its mimicry of the book. Wireless, the Kindle disdains cables,
                    plug-ins, or battery life; the device is so advanced it’s simple. Implicit in
                    this claim is the primacy of books as technology par excellence. In this way the
                    author’s delight in the Kindle’s wirelessness reminds his audience that the book
                    has always been so unwired. </p>
                <p>As witnesses to Kindle-reading, these authors — whom Amazon invited to try out
                    the device — also legitimate the Kindle through scenes in which the device
                    intensifies reading. Their presence matters, then, because their significance
                        <emph>as readers</emph> derives as much from their authorial positioning as
                    it does from their bibliophilia.<note> Of these testimonials Steve Kessel,
                        Amazon’s vice president of digital media, reported that Amazon had
                        approached numerous authors several months before the launch, returning to
                        film them discussing their reactions to the product. <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#rodgers2007">We don't do a lot of print and other

                        <ptr target="#rodgers2007"/></cit>.</note> When Amazon claims them as <q>people…we knew were lovers of
                        books,</q> its gesture is to assure would-be owners that the device has
                    the right kind of backing. Book-lovers, the authors are first figured in
                    domestic terms, appearing in shots of spaces lined with books, speaking about
                    the Kindle from comfy chairs. When they speak about where the Kindle can go,
                    their terms shift to the Kindle’s mobility, the likes of which makes it equally
                    accessible at home, in airport terminals, and airplanes. The global author —
                    Gaiman cites traveling from Beijing to Budapest, while Toni Morrison refers to
                    giving talks around the world — in this way implies that the Kindle can confer
                    something of his or her cosmopolitanism to reading.<note> One early slogan for
                        the Kindle was <q>Buy once, read
                            everywhere.</q>
                    </note> This yoking of the domestic with the global cosmopolitan perpetuates the
                    sense that the Kindle’s advances are so astonishing that reading, far from
                    losing its transformative force, is just as magical as ever: perhaps even more
                    so, given the Kindle’s affinity for travel. In a conflation of technology with
                    magic, the Kindle contains books even as it snatches them out of thin air. What
                    this means for the reader, Morrison observes, is an almost magical subjectivity.
                    In her testimonial Morrison draws on the equation of reading with empowerment
                    before describing the Kindle as a <emph>spell</emph> for agency, one that allows
                    readers to <emph>do</emph> reading in ways previously unimaginable. <q>That sense of <q>I own it now</q> is the
                        best thing about reading anyway,</q> she says — and the Kindle
                    intensifies that experience because <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#morrison"
                        >it’s faster, it’s lighter, [and] I can carry it and I can have more at my
                        disposal</quote>
                    <ptr target="#morrison"/></cit>. Possession goes hand in hand with
                    <emph>self</emph>-possession because Kindle-reading makes that affiliation
                    literally — materially — possible. In the reverse of this thinking Gaiman claims
                    that the Kindle’s ease of use matches the intuitiveness with which readers
                    approach books. Indeed, if the Kindle’s ability to retrieve books is impressive
                    because it resembles having a genie on call, it is his experience of
                    Kindle-reading over which he lingers. After reading for a few minutes, he
                    remembers, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#gaiman">I’d done the thing that you
                        do with books where you’re actually on the other side of the text…there’s
                        nothing between you and the story…you’re in book-reading land</quote>
                    <ptr target="#gaiman"/></cit>. Like Morrison’s reference to the spell of reading,
                    Gaiman’s account is of the reader magicked, an Alice who crosses with the Kindle
                    in hand to the Wonderland that book-reading has always been. This Kindle-reading
                    is therefore fantastically <emph>familiar</emph>.<note> In the discourse of
                        technoculture, I might use the term <q>automagic,</q> which describes a
                        process that occurs so seamlessly and automatically that it appears as
                        magic. Techies use the term as a rhetorical sneer, a gesture that among
                        other things, opposes technology and magic, and insists that reading must
                        always rely on technology. My thanks to John Laudun for making me aware of
                        the term.</note>
                </p>
                <p>A recursive logic, then, underlies claims that the Kindle is extraordinary, and a
                    bookish resonance remains even when Bezos and other Kindle advocates insist that
                    the Kindle differs in kind from the book. That this logic extends as far as
                    features touted explicitly for their pragmatism suggests the extent to which the
                    Kindle needs this evocation of book-reading. In its marketing Amazon has made
                    much of the device for its ability to meet readerly needs, highlighting, for
                    instance, alterable font size, ever-increasing storage capacity, and search
                    features as conveniences designed with the reader in mind. And specific readerly
                    needs — economic, technological — frame the accounts of each of the Kindles
                    currently on the market: there exists, it’s implied, a Kindle for every
                        need.<note> Thus the Kindle Wi-Fi, targeted at the user who seeks usage tied
                        to wireless capacity at home and elsewhere, or the Kindle 3G, for those who
                        imagine usage in terms parallel to cell phone roaming, or the Kindle app,
                        for usage across platforms and media.</note> In all these instances the
                    Kindle functions, as one observer notes, as an <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#levy2007">extension of the familiar Amazon store,</quote> and
                    foregrounds service as a constitutive dimension of the reading it imagines <ptr
                        target="#levy2007"/>. To put it slightly differently, Amazon is frank in its
                    claim that the Kindle anticipates and offers what readers need: it is there
                    before reading actually takes place, preparing the way for its felicitous
                    happening. At the same time, this pragmatism is enabled by the sensibility that
                    as an act, reading requires, if it does not deserve, such service. Free chapter
                    samples seek to create anticipation, but so do they rely upon the notion that
                    anticipation is one of reading’s greatest pleasures. The canniness of these
                    samples therefore derives from their intimation of the particular value of
                    pleasure and its attachment to reading.<note> Since 2009, sampling and reading
                        could also occur on smart mobile phones and on computers using Kindle
                        software; in fall 2010, Amazon announced that readers could now sample first
                        chapters via web browsers. Meanwhile a reader can also look for a book by
                        searching the entire contents of the Kindle Store.</note> Like the dynamic
                    that defines the actual act of purchase, this tableau of reading on demand
                    justifies turning immediacy into a consumer good by recalling the good
                    associated with reading. The notion that the Kindle’s speed of delivery
                        <emph>serves reading</emph> confers some of that loftiness onto the device,
                    softening the consumerist logic that equates an Amazonian subject’s desire with
                    need. If the Kindle exceeds the material limits of reading it does so by
                    insisting on the value of remaining attached to them.</p>

                <p>The legibility of that value emerged early on in discourse that tied the Kindle

                    foregrounded an idiomatic use of the term — in an interview a senior public

                    vision into something more literal <ptr target="#herdener2008"/>. This more
                    skeptical reading of the device’s name inserted books as the objects of a
                    material kindling, thereby resisting Amazon’s figure of the Kindle as the bearer
                    of a populist reading that spreads like fire.<note> See Steven Heller, <title

                    dissuade posters on forums and message board discussions from asserting that the
                    origin of the Kindle’s naming lay in the novel’s dystopic milieu <ptr
                        target="#herdener2008"/>. Implicit in those conversations was the suggestion
                    that the institutionalized book burning in <title rend="italic">451 </title>had
                    an analog in the virtuality Kindle books occupy: thanks to that association, the
                    Kindle’s naming acquired a graphic ideological tenor, one made excessive by
                    virtue of the material act described. Taking Bradbury’s novel as the Kindle’s
                    eerie precedent thus enabled readers to articulate their unease, and in so
                    doing, generated a resistant understanding that reading <emph>451</emph> on a

                    also resonated with a metacritical impulse that readers on Amazon forums — where
                    both Bradbury and the Kindle have a loyal and close following — were
                    articulating. In two forums devoted to the Bradbury-Kindle affair, Amazon
                    readers expressed their sympathy and respect for Bradbury’s position, but were
                    nearly uniform in their conclusion that the Kindle and Bradbury need not be
                    opposed. His insistence on keeping his works only in print was explicable, as
                    one poster wrote, <quote rend="inline" source="#mcmillan2010">since KINDLE
                        implies the onset of burning,</quote> and to that extent the novel <cit><quote

                    <ptr target="#mcmillan2010"/></cit>. On this view the privilege <title rend="italic"
                        >451</title> accords to books has everything to do with their physicality,
                    and Bradbury’s hostility towards the Kindle, understood here as a dystopic end
                    to print materiality, is justifiable. The majority of posts, however, claim the
                    Kindle for its potential to skirt that future through an increase in reading,
                    and go on to argue that the device could constitute <quote rend="inline"

                    this line of thinking further still, suggesting, interestingly, that a
                    comprehensive digitization of books, had it occurred, would have pre-empted the
                    scenario <title rend="italic">Fahrenheit 451</title> imagines. Digitization
                    would have made Bradbury’s firemen unnecessary because there would have been

                    assertions speculate about a past that did not occur — a past in which the
                    firemen, fictional or not, never existed — testifies, I think, to the posters’
                    imagination of reading in a world of Kindles. For both posters, apparently aware
                    of the fantastic historicizing at the heart of much dystopic fiction, subject

                    Bradbury, somewhat strangely, becomes an author without a story.</p>
                <p>For all the protesting on Bradbury’s part, Kindle readers considered, queried,
                    ventured opinions about, and debated the work the Kindle might do (or not do)
                    for reading by citing the novel as the Kindle’s metaphorical ground. That this
                    gesture anchored the Kindle in fiction, that a literary representation of a
                    dystopic future should frame an understanding of the device, produced no qualms:
                    readers were willing to assume the link between device and text, and thereby
                    granted <title rend="italic">451</title> an explanatory authority. That
                    authority generated much of the conversation about information control and
                    censorship, and turned the world Bradbury represents into a likely model for the
                    unforeseen consequences of Kindle reading. Bradbury’s vision of a world forced
                    to accept book burning in the name of civility and peace should, these posters
                    argued, force Kindle owners to think about the security of reading in the
                    digital moment.<note> W. Cook writes, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#cook2010"

                    banning precisely because it suggested that e-books, touted for their
                    immateriality, were no less vulnerable than their print counterparts. Indeed one
                    line of thought reiterated that e-books are particularly susceptible because
                    their materiality is less trace-able. When one reader reported that Amazon had
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#bremner2008">reached down to my Kindle and
                        deleted the book</quote> he had returned earlier for a refund, he
                    articulated his unease with Amazon’s reach in a way that clarifies another’s
                    anxiety about scale: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bremner2008">if all books
                        become e books, isn’t it very easy to control what books are allowed? Have I

                            <ptr target="#turiya2008"/>. </note> A similarly dystopic view fueled a
                    series of posts concerned that the Kindle could make what one reads open, and
                    therefore useable and exploitable, knowledge. Here the <emph>reader’s</emph>
                    security is said to be at stake, and the prospect of institutional access to
                    one’s readerly choices (the thread also takes up the notion that the government
                    is a corporation) becomes something like surveillance. This possibility unnerved
                    even the most vocal of Kindle supporters on the <title rend="italic">Amazon
                        Kindle: The Start of the Fahrenheit 451 reality?</title> forum which opened
                    by asking <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#turiya2008">Is there danger in giving
                        CORPORATIONS knowledge of what books you have read?</quote>
                    <ptr target="#turiya2008"/></cit>. The familiar belief in Kindles and their fluid
                    materiality thus runs aground an anxiety the novel depicts: about being tracked,
                    about leaving a trace. However much they endorsed the e-book for its
                    elusiveness, however much they imagined themselves as virtual Book People whose
                    preservation of books means erasing their physicality, readers articulated
                    unease when contemplating the prospect of having <emph>their</emph> own readerly
                    selves found out. </p>
                <p>These responses, in refering to Bradbury’s novel to make sense of what the Kindle
                    might mean to reading, converged on the broader worry that the Kindle might
                    displace culture. That these responses occurred with regularity online, cropping
                    up on blogs and websites and forums devoted, on the one hand, to e-books, and on
                    the other, to science fiction, that they emerged with some mass on Amazon
                    testifies to the coherence of a discourse about reading that takes the literary
                    as its precedent. Here a longstanding debate about genre witnesses readerly
                    protectiveness of <title rend="italic">451</title>, of the novel’s status that
                    the Kindle was said to threaten. For those Kindle advocates who were also
                    self-identified readers of science fiction, this tension was as familiar as it
                    was frustrating, for in casting science fiction in opposition to
                        <q>literature,</q> it damned the legitimacy of the genre with faint praise.
                    This view then fingered the Kindle for its complicity in isolating <title
                        rend="italic">451</title> from the literary, suggesting that reading <title
                        rend="italic">451</title> with a Kindle tainted the novel with the very
                    technophilia it critiques (here Bradbury’s comment that the novel is less an
                    anti-censorship screed and more so a manifesto for literature acquires new
                    strength). In this context that the Kindle’s relation to the literary canon
                    should emerge as an issue is not surprising. Readers who reveled in the prospect
                    of downloading canonicity at little cost — most of Austen’s novels, for
                    instance, are available for free as Kindle books — faced the disdain of those
                    who not only expressed a preference for print but insisted, in a way Bourdieu
                    would recognize, that it is the rightful medium for the reading, say, of
                    Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">Twelfth Night</title>. The
                        <emph>association</emph> with the Kindle raised readerly hackles and was
                    said to diminish <title rend="italic">451</title>’s credibility as a literary
                    classic (this despite the fact that it exists only in print). The reception of
                    Bradbury’s novel and the Kindle are therefore <emph>mutually</emph> illuminating
                    of how readers articulated their desires around the literary. To take a more
                    synthetic view, however much the Kindle divided readers, that split emerged with
                    all the more force when the literary was at stake. As a result, the Kindle
                    emerged as an agent of the novel’s erasure from literature.</p>
                <p>If discourse on the Kindle saw readers reaching for <title rend="italic"
                        >Fahrenheit 451</title> to understand their newly mediated relationship to
                    reading, the reception of the novel on Amazon found in the novel’s cautionary
                    rhetoric a coherent view of the shape and fate of reading in the Kindle age. The
                    novel, to put it another way, provided readers with an analogy for anxieties
                    about the Kindle’s capacity to make print obsolescent, to make its disappearance
                    a reality. Thus while Amazon reviews of <title rend="italic">451</title>
                    preceded the Kindle’s release by a decade, discussion of shifts in media
                    technology and their impact on reading were in the air from the outset — in the
                    title of the first review, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#customer1996a"
                        >Literal bookburning in a world too like our own,</quote>
                    <ptr target="#customer1996a"/></cit> and in the early remark that the novel <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#customer1996b">raises issues about…letting the

                    <ptr target="#customer1996b"/></cit>. And in the months leading up to the Kindle’s
                    release in November 2007 reviews of the novel hewed closely to the position that
                    the doom Bradbury imagines for books — as one post put it, <quote rend="inline"

                    <ptr target="#jimiwine2007"/></cit> books are understood to stand little chance of
                    engaging attention. In comments like these, posters described the immediacy of
                    attention these demanded, and implied of book reading that its mediations,
                    however meaningful or pleasurable, were thereby obscured. Indeed in reviews that
                    both predate and follow the release of the Kindle, posters echoed a lament that
                    had fueled much of the early public discourse about the digital and new media
                    supported by it precisely by sounding a death knell for reading. As melancholic
                    as Sven Birkerts, these reviews constructed and cohered around an opposition in
                    which reading <emph>ought</emph> to have nothing to do with media. If for
                    Birkerts reading is immersive, an act of measured consideration, of slow and
                    deliberate existence, <title rend="italic">451</title> endorses this view,
                    reviewers argued, through its unflinching account of life without books. Again
                    and again the reading of <title rend="italic">451</title> triggers a diagnosis
                    of contemporary culture; again and again the reading of <title rend="italic"
                        >451</title> occasions references to reading made bereft, <cit><quote

                    <ptr target="#swaty2011"/></cit>. The impulse to translate the novel’s account of a

                <p>Nostalgic for reading <emph>before</emph> it disappears, these reviews of <title
                        rend="italic">451</title> are all the more striking because they refer to
                    Kindle-reading despite the fact that the novel, as a result of Bradbury’s
                    insistence, remains only in print. Indeed, that Amazon constitutes the
                    infrastructure for their commentary, that the device embodies reading imagined
                    by Amazon foregrounds for these reviewers that their reading of <title
                        rend="italic">Fahrenheit 451</title> must be marked by it in some way.
                    Kindle reading, in other words, becomes for these reviewers an almost
                    irresistible example of the novel’s cautionary rhetoric. Meanwhile, if the
                    novel’s sense of the inevitable prompted an urgency of response to Montag’s
                    world, so did it emphasize for posters the sense of <emph>this</emph> moment in
                    the history of reading, when <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#kdbrewer2011">books
                        have been translated into electronic forms and more and more people watch

                    <ptr target="#kdbrewer2011"/></cit>. Implicit references to the Kindle index this
                    awareness, as reviewers, wondering to what extent virtual reading resembles
                    video game play or web surfing, articulated the blurring of contemporary media
                    use with contemporary reading practices. These rather more tangential
                    observations about media culture stand in contrast to the explicit references
                    that charge the Kindle with displacing relations of production long enabled by
                    print. <quote rend="inline" source="#lascowicz2008">The most important thing
                        about this book is how much more relevant it seems today than when it was

                    <ptr target="#lascowicz2008"/></cit>. Either unaware, indifferent, or skeptical of the
                    newspaper subscriptions the Kindle makes possible, this reader insisted the
                    Kindle’s existence means the erasure of print. His error is less at issue here
                    than his belief that the novel’s importance lies in its present relevance, for
                    that occasions the directness with which he yokes the Kindle to the
                    circumstances depicted in <title rend="italic">Fahrenheit 451</title>. Like many
                    of his fellow reviewers, this reader applauds the novel for its futurist
                    imagination of a stark moment in the history of reading. His comments are
                    distinctive because they turn directly to the Kindle, and, in situating the
                    device in a history of reading parallel to the world of <title rend="italic"
                        >451,</title> he emphasizes the irony that the device is an Amazon
                        product.<note> See Paul Theis’ remark that <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            source="#theis2008">I find it very ironic that Amazon is out with

                        <ptr target="#theis2008"/></cit>.</note> That references like these represent only
                    a fraction of the reviews of <title rend="italic">451</title> uploaded since
                    June 1996 (1407) is an oddity given that elsewhere, particularly on the Amazon
                    forums devoted to Bradbury or the device, the discourse is rife with commentary
                    linking the Kindle with <title rend="italic">451</title>. These forums were full
                    of commentary about the kind of kindling the device would make possible: either
                    the demise of books or their human reincarnation. Why, then, has the dynamic not
                    been reciprocal? More specifically, if <title rend="italic">451</title> readers
                    willingly imagined the novel’s relevance to the contemporary milieu, and openly
                    discussed the position of book culture in this moment, then how does the
                    Kindle’s absence signify? As a body the reviews focus on the novel’s social
                    critique of a world without books in a way that makes the Kindle’s absence from
                    that critique pronounced. In a way, though, this absence is fitting. For it
                    marks a <emph>readerly</emph> enactment of the device’s disappearance from the
                    scene of reading. </p>

                <p>While the association with <title rend="italic">Fahrenheit 451</title> originated
                    in the Kindle’s first release, it has extended to the device’s entire biography,
                    marking it broadly with narrative and political resonance. Indeed to a certain
                    extent <title rend="italic">451</title> so prevails in the imagination of Kindle
                    readers that their attachments to the novel’s metaphorical force yields the
                    device sui generis: the Kindle as such. The security of this attachment,
                    however, began to unravel shortly after Amazon, announcing the release of the
                    Kindle 2 (February 2009), also revealed that it had commissioned a story from
                    Stephen King that if pre-ordered, would appear on Kindle screens on the day of
                    its release. King readers in particular responded with enthusiasm that the
                    author had inscribed his stamp on the device — in <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur</title> a Kindle with hyperbolic features allows the protagonist to
                    download novels written in alternate dimensions as well as news from that
                    urgently compelling dimension, the future — but also expressed dismay that he
                    had agreed to the commission in the first place. For a significant portion of
                    these fans the commission bound King to Amazon, and interrupted a prior, and
                    more meaningful relation between an author and his readers.<note>No burning
                        occurs in <title rend="quotes">Ur,</title> but it’s worth noting that King’s
                        1980 novel <title rend="italic">Firestarter</title> raises, albeit
                        minimally, the relationship between burning and textuality. At the end of
                        the novel, the protagonist Charlie McGee, having escaped from the government
                        agency The Shop, takes her story to the New York offices of <title
                            rend="italic">Rolling Stone</title> magazine in an effort to publicize
                        the events that led to her father’s death. In a striking echo of <title
                            rend="italic">Fahrenheit 451</title>, fire consumes everything but the
                        story, which lives on in the person who tells it <ptr target="#king1980"/>.
                        My thanks go to Jessica Pressman and Lisa Swanstrom for reminding me of the
                        novel.</note> Taken by the prospect of having <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur</title> materialize on Kindles on the day of its release, struck by the
                    fitness of having a King story about a Kindle appear on thousands of Kindles,
                    these readers were equally taken aback by their sense that Amazon had intruded
                    on, and therefore weakened what they knew, felt about, and expected from
                    reading. <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> inflected their unease that the Kindle
                    could unmake their status as readers and owners of Kindles and the texts that
                    appear on them. </p>
                <p> The two initial sources framing the news that <title rend="quotes">Ur</title>
                    was on the horizon — the official King website and Amazon’s press release —
                    first positioned author and device as an irresistible match, a pairing that
                    promised great things. The King website greeted readers first with the reminder
                    that the author’s longstanding history <quote rend="inline" source="#king2009"
                        >as a writer who constantly redefines his readers’ experience [sic] by
                        working in various genres and formats</quote> testifies to his ability
                        <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#king2009">to deliver a reading experience
                        like no one else can</quote>
                    <ptr target="#king2009"/></cit>. <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> is no exception, the
                    web blurb goes on to remark, for it bears King’s signature qualities and
                    demonstrates them in his command of a form that the blurb notes is fast
                    disappearing. While this account defers mention of the Kindle until the bottom
                    of the page, its reference to genre, and its claim that <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur</title> gives the novella new life, anticipate the link to the Kindle
                    press release by emphasizing King as an author open to (and practiced in)
                    innovation. King’s generic flexibility thus frames the way the website figures
                    the Kindle as a technological chameleon. The Amazon press release, meanwhile,
                    follows a similar rhetoric. There the announcement of the Kindle 2, emphatic
                    about this edition’s improvements, goes hand in hand with a summary of the
                    extraordinary events that occur when Wesley Smith receives a mysterious pink
                    Kindle in the mail. The breathless claim that the Kindle 2 is <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#amazon2009">thinner, faster, crisper, with longer
                        battery life and capable of holding hundreds more books</quote> thus
                    corresponds to the observation that the <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> Kindle
                        <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#amazon2009">unlocks a literary world that
                        even the most avid of book lovers could never imagine</quote>
                    <ptr target="#amazon2009"/></cit>. Meanwhile the boast that the Read-to-Me feature is
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#amazon2009">something new we added that a
                        book could never do</quote> anticipates the flourish that the <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title> Kindle opens doors to <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#amazon2009">things that one hopes we’ll never read or live
                        through.</quote> Rhetorical counterparts, these tie the device to its
                    textual self. In so doing, they situate King in the middle, and foreground his
                    authorship as a bridge between Amazon’s Kindle and the Kindle of <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur.</title>
                </p>
                <p> Aligning the two Kindles was, of course, a marketing gesture, one that sought to
                    create anticipation by blurring the lines between product and representation.
                    While readers were well aware of the realities of this gesture, and, as I will
                    argue, prepared to live by their readerly critique of it, this symmetry set out
                    the terms by which they nonetheless continued to idealize the bond linking
                    device and text. King himself participated in this conversation, observing
                    shortly after the story’s release that his condition for writing <title
                        rend="italic">a story for the Kindle</title> was his desire to <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#king2010">do one <emph>about</emph> the
                        Kindle</quote> (original emphasis) <ptr target="#king2010"/>. Meanwhile King
                    fans, quick to assert that the author’s metafictional gesture was no surprise —
                    as one poster put it, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#edwards2011">Leave it to
                        King to write a story about the Kindle on the Kindle</quote>
                    <ptr target="#edwards2011"/></cit> — were just as quick to claim <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur</title>
                    <emph>for</emph> the Kindle. Several describe choosing <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur</title> as the first download for their new Kindle 2s, suggesting that
                    the text’s fantastic Kindle has inflected their enthusiasm for the device and
                    its new features <ptr target="#customer2010a"/>; <ptr target="#wickham2009"/>;
                        <ptr target="#tharp2009"/>; <ptr target="#jean2009"/>. One reader says of
                        <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> that it marks <q>a great way to start my new adventure in
                        reading,</q> while another claims that <q>I can’t imagine a better way to have broken in my
                        new toy</q>: out of positions like these <title rend="quotes">Ur</title>
                    emerges as an exemplary Kindle text <ptr target="#customer2010a"/>; <ptr
                        target="#wickham2009"/>; <ptr target="#tharp2009"/>. This sense of
                    exemplarity reached its apex when <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> reviewers
                    agreed that the novella, because of its especially immersive nature, should
                        <q>come pre-loaded on all new
                        Kindles.</q> That <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> is said to suit the
                    Kindle because it is so wholly absorbing — one Kindle owner compares finishing

                <p>The enthusiasm generated by the Kindle and <title rend="quotes">Ur</title>
                    pairing in turn indexed readerly identifications. Thus a number of reviewers
                    described their pleasure at the novella’s speculative literary histories,
                    remarking that they, like Wesley Smith, would find an unheard-of Hemingway or an
                    unpublished Poe an irresistible temptation. Others admitted, significantly, to a
                    jealousy prompted by <title rend="quotes">Ur's</title> account of universes in
                    which authors long-dead continue to write. A fascinating mix of affect, these
                    comments articulate posters’ identities as <soCalled>book-obsessed,</soCalled> as <soCalled>avid readers</soCalled> whose desires <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title> both illustrates and renders fantastic. King fans,
                    meanwhile, insisted that their history of reading, and not a one-time corporate
                    commission, constituted an authentic exclusive relation to the author. Here the
                    Constant Reader — a figure of loyalty in King fan discourse since the
                    publication of <title rend="italic">Misery </title>— emerged as a point from
                    which readers, citing the novella’s intertextual references to the <title
                        rend="italic">Dark Tower</title> series, could recommend <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title> as a King classic. <quote rend="inline"

                    in reading. The refrain that <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> needs an expert
                    King reader thus privileges a knowing intimacy, one made all the more exclusive
                    by what one reader calls <q>hidden</q> references, or, more broadly, by the
                    sense that with <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> King was <quote rend="inline"

                <p>That there exists a correspondence between the novella’s articulation of readerly
                    investments and readers’ insistence on clarifying their identifications goes a
                    long way to explaining the strength of their feelings about <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur</title> as a Kindled text. For when <title rend="quotes">Ur</title>
                    readers declare their readerly selves they do no less than the novella’s
                    protagonist, whose views on the Kindle shift from refusal to fascination to
                    horror. <title rend="quotes">Ur's</title> plot shifts into high gear when a pink
                    Kindle, appearing mysteriously at Wesley Smith’s door, pushes him — on the heels
                    of an unhappy break-up — to break from his rather Luddite notions and give the
                    device a try. The scene thus associates the Kindle’s sudden, inexplicable
                    presence with the beginnings of a medial shift in reading for Smith, for whom
                    books are simultaneously professional and personal objects. More entrenched in
                    his identification with print than many <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> readers,
                    Smith embodies a romanticized, vocational book reading, and in this way he too
                    figures a constancy of reading, a fidelity to books — he considers them his
                    cherished <q>friends</q> — he will not dream of betraying <ptr
                        target="#king2009" loc="258–267"/>. The <q>minor chill</q> he feels when a
                    student in one of his literature classes demonstrates that the image of pages on
                    the Kindle screen <quote rend="inline" source="#king2009">flutter, like in a
                        real book</quote> testifies to his unease with its bibliographic
                    remediation; when this sense intensifies with the arrival of his Kindle, so does
                    the chill <ptr target="#king2009" loc="258–267, 267–274"/>. Indeed, faced with
                    operating his own Kindle Smith’s imagination takes a horrific turn, and he
                    contemplates turning the device off, as the narrator puts it, before <cit><quote
                        rend="inline" source="#king2009">a hand — or perhaps a claw — was going to

                    <ptr target="#king2009" loc="473–478"/></cit>. If King’s gesture to grant this Kindle
                    a monstrous agency follows, as many <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> readers
                    observed, a line of thinking the author had already pursued elsewhere, its force
                    lies in the way it marks the Kindle’s remediation in uncanny terms.<note> See,
                        for instance, <title rend="italic">Cell</title>
                        <ptr target="#king2006"/> and <title rend="quotes">Word Processor of the
                            Gods</title>
                        <ptr target="#king1985"/>.</note> Remediation at this moment is as
                    aggressive as any of the instances Bolter and Grusin describe precisely in its
                    threat to the reader’s self-possession. This tension increases when Smith, after
                    having discovered that the Kindle <emph>can</emph> reach out to alternate
                    dimensions, shares with a colleague and a student the knowledge that that range
                    can put one in touch with literary histories wonderful in their strangeness. In
                    these Urs, Hemingway, Poe, and Shakespeare author unheard-of texts that read
                    with authenticity, their remediations constituted by their radical familiarity.
                    Smith’s colleague says of <title rend="italic">A Black Fellow in London</title>,
                    a play written by one of the several Shakespeares the Kindle locates, <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#king2009">it’s got his <emph>lilt</emph>
                    </quote> (original emphasis) <ptr target="#king2009" loc="764–770"/>. His
                    observation speaks to the impossible truth of the play’s existence; it also
                    performs his identity as a reader who is rightly and properly moved by this
                    truth. Even as it points out the horror of a Kindle that knows no limits, <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title> authenticates Smith and his circle as readers whose
                    identifications lie with the texts they read. </p>
                <p>However forceful, these identifications do not last, displaced when the group
                    abandons its literary forays to explore other temporalities to which Smith’s
                    Kindle has access. For would-be <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> readers access
                    was precisely the dilemma, as it interrupted the idealized bond between text and
                    device. The <emph>contingency</emph> of <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> led more
                    than one poster to urge Amazon and King to issue a print <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur,</title> claiming that their respective histories of reading the
                    author’s works should deserve just recompense: <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#anonymous2010">I have everything King so please a BOOK</quote>
                    <ptr target="#anonymous2010"/></cit>. Appeals like these constituted the gentler end
                    of response. For if Amazon had touted the Kindle for increasing access to books,
                    and if King had done much the same in interviews, the novella’s exclusivity also
                    generated ill-will, hard-line response and even outright resistance. From this
                    perspective one reader’s question — <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#kimberly2009">Since when do we have high end books?</quote> — is
                    simultaneously naïve and pointed, revealing the end to a faith readers had
                    previously had in Amazon and King and the cynicism that now informed their view
                    of both company and author <ptr target="#kimberly2009"/>. The populist aura that
                    Amazon and King had courted, the popularity both enjoyed as one effect of that
                    stance: neither could absorb what readers perceived as a deliberate production
                    of inequity. An economics of scale thus drove commentary that refused the
                    built-in expense of the Kindle that owning <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> would
                    require; here readers, finding the Kindle’s price disproportionate to the price
                    of the novella, shifted the terms of their response to Amazon and held the
                    company responsible for creating an impossible situation. Even when one poster
                    declared her decision not to purchase a Kindle her comment was no less pointed
                    in charging Amazon: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#carrieb2009">Since I
                            <q>won’t</q> be making that purchase, I guess I don’t get to read the
                        story</quote>
                    <ptr target="#carrieb2009"/></cit>. Resigned to her fate, this reader still invokes
                    the sense that <title rend="quotes">Ur's</title> exclusivity has stripped her of
                    rights as a reader. That her resignation is another’s ire is revealing not only
                    of the range of response generated by <title rend="quotes">Ur,</title> but also,
                    and perhaps more importantly, of its personalized nature: <quote rend="block"

                        >Ur</title> represents, claiming her right as a fan to read the text,
                    significantly, by calling attention to her inability to do so. Having agreed to
                    the commission, King had, on her view, compromised his authorship by aligning
                    himself with Kindle readers. He was now a Kindled King. </p>
                <p> What is a Kindle author, then, and who or what is the author of <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title>? Readers who regarded <title rend="quotes"
                        >Ur</title> as a betrayal asked a version of this question when they charged
                    King with having abandoned his principles and his fans. And more: Constant
                    Readers in their critique of King implied that his relation to fans, more than
                    anything else, had distinguished his authorial integrity, and should continue to
                    do so. Thus while few questioned <title rend="italic">Amazon’s</title>
                    investment in pursuing King, observing that the company’s behavior was to be
                    expected and, interestingly, that King’s imagination made him a natural choice
                    for the enterprise, many fumed at King for what they called improper authorial
                    conduct. A sense of a moral high ground thus informed almost all the commentary
                    that viewed <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> as an instance of product placement
                    gone awry. <quote rend="inline" source="#atlantic2010">Product placements are a part of our

                        <q>everywhere possible,</q> this
                    reader seeks to draw a line between it and the work of an author he admires.
                    Over and over again posters like these cited the aesthetic weaknesses — <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title> feels incomplete, rushed, and uninspired — that
                    resulted, they argued, <emph>from</emph> the novella’s commercial
                        sensibility.<note> John Fulton <title rend="quotes">Power Reader</title>
                        remarks that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#fulton2011">this Kindle

                        <ptr target="#fulton2011"/></cit>. Meanwhile Heather Bella writes that the product

                            and interrupted the flow of the story</quote>
                        <ptr target="#bella2010"/></cit>. </note> In this way textual criticism,
                    originating in moral judgment of the commercial, generated a critique of King’s
                    lapse in authorial judgment. For some, this effect confirmed their suspicions
                    that the logic driving King’s recent work — work that prompted one reader to
                    compare the author’s rate of production to <quote rend="inline"

                        target="#higby2009"/>; <ptr target="#mastrangelo2011"/>. Those less willing
                    to see the ironies of this development opted for sharper critique, framing their
                    disappointment in terms of a failed transaction between author and reader.
                    Complaints that <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> is no more than a <q>well written advertisement</q> or that
                    the reader <q>should have been paid for
                        this one</q> thus implied King’s responsibility in diminishing the value
                    of readers’ possession of the text. Even the most balanced of these accounts
                    cited Seth Goldin before going on to offer a blunt assessment of this commercial
                    occlusion: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#lee2009">this is a product that tells
                        a story</quote>
                    <ptr target="#lee2009"/></cit>. In this way <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> may have
                    fulfilled its promise to <emph>appear</emph> as magically as Smith’s pink
                    Kindle, but that materialization could not signify enough. The perception that
                    King had sacrificed <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> to Amazon for many marked
                    the loss of the text, or at least the loss of its resonance as <q>a story.</q> Hailed for its immediacy,
                        <title rend="quotes">Ur's</title> presence on Kindle screens turned out,
                    interestingly, to matter too little.</p>

                <p>The reception of <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> revealed a darker side to the
                    promise of instant gratification. Indeed this devolution of response suggests
                    that the <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> experience had rendered Kindle-reading
                    dystopic for King readers. The thrill Wesley Smith experiences when his pink
                    Kindle discovers unheard-of Hemingway novels intensifies his desire to read, but
                    for King readers, their frisson of pleasure was short-lived. For them the Kindle
                    had interrupted a much-cherished sense of kinship with the author, and without
                    that relation, not even the idea of reading Wesley’s Smith near brush with fate
                    could temper their embitterment. Their ire over the exclusivity of <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title> led King readers to turn against the reading Amazon
                    imagined for them, to articulate a rather more possessive sense of reading in
                    response, and ultimately to charge the author himself for having compromised his
                    bond with readers. This last makes clear that the ownership King readers had in
                    mind involves the author as a subject whom reading possesses. It would be fair
                    to say, given the ferocity of critique eventually leveled at King, that readers
                    felt as strongly about having a relation with the author through reading as they
                    did about having <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> appear on their Kindles on the
                    day of its release. There was no question that Amazon had with <title
                        rend="quotes">Ur</title> another delivery success on its hands; this pursuit
                    of day-of-release delivery had endeared the company to Harry Potter fans since
                    2000, prompting hundreds of thousands to pre-order the novels in order to be
                    able to put their hands on the books as immediately as possible. Already auratic
                    for fans, these release dates became distribution events, and time itself became
                    a good for Potter fans, who like King’s Constant Readers, constituted an
                    audience whose intensity of devotion suited the desire for such
                        timeliness.<note> Amazon managed these operations beginning in 2000 through
                        a partnership with FedEx <ptr target="#amazon2000"/>. The temporal urgency
                        of possession drove Potter fans to order 350,020 advance copies of <title
                            rend="italic">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</title>, and the
                        success of that venture prompted Amazon to normalize the procedure for the
                        remaining novels in the series.</note> Yet in the case of <title
                        rend="italic">Ur,</title> the compression of time — itself a remediation of
                    the anticipation of waiting for one’s book — could not overcome readers’
                    dissatisfaction with Amazon’s mediation of King. </p>
                <p>The overwhelming sense that the Kindle had stripped ownership from the act of
                    reading returned with greater force six months later, when copies of Orwell’s
                        <title rend="italic">1984</title> disappeared from several thousand Kindles
                    in July 2009. In the sixteen discussions on Amazon forums alone Kindle readers
                    took to the boards, writing to one another and to Amazon in ways that for the
                    most part mirrored media coverage of the incident. Like that coverage, Amazon
                    reader discourse regarded the deletion as an unjustifiable outrage, one that for
                    many warranted a boycott of the company. Even in the wake of Bezos’ apology,
                    which observed that the copies had been illegally published before calling their
                    removal <quote rend="inline" source="#bezos2009">stupid, thoughtless, and
                        painfully out of line with our principles,</quote> readers urged a return to
                    books and the view of reading implicit in that return <ptr target="#bezos2009"
                        />.<note> Bezos’ apology appeared in the Amazon Kindle forums on 23 July
                        2009 <ptr target="#bezos2009"/>. The copyright on <title rend="italic"
                            >1984</title> has not yet expired in the U.S. The copy of <title
                            rend="italic">1984</title> in question was made available by Mobile
                        Reference.</note> That call for a return emerged, in other words, as a
                    refusal of Amazon, and a critique that the company had, in its failed
                    remediation of <title rend="italic">1984</title>, revealed its indifference to
                    the readerly subjects constituted by the Kindle. Those discussing Justin
                    Gawronski’s case felt variously about his claim that the deletion had lost his
                    annotations to the novel, but most agreed that his suit lodged the very real
                    objection that Kindle readers are defined most, and most unfortunately, by their
                        <emph>tenuous</emph> ownership of the texts they purchase.<note> For an
                        overview of the incident and Gawronski’s suit, see <quote rend="inline"

                    <ptr target="#postcall2009"/></cit>. Contingency scripts this poster’s question,
                    marking the discrepancy between purchase and possession. It’s not surprising,
                    then, that in the aftermath readers imagined going back to bookstores — as one
                    put it, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#white2009">Good chance to go to Border’s
                        and socialize</quote>
                    <ptr target="#white2009"/></cit>. Doing so not only reverses earlier claims that
                    virtual Kindle conversations would enhance readerly interaction but seeks to
                    relocate readerly self-possession in a space at once physical and social. </p>
                <p>At the same time there was also a sense that this incident was to be expected,
                    that the fluidity of copyright in the almost-digital moment made possession
                    precisely a risky and fleeting prospect, and that the incident would measure
                    just how long-sighted Amazon was in its understanding of the future it had
                    brought to reading. For these reasons, commentary on the forums — less driven by
                    a personalized disappointment over the author/Amazon pairing that had yielded
                        <title rend="quotes">Ur</title> — concerned itself primarily with the
                    company, and in particular, with its management of relations with
                    reader-consumers. The discussion thread titles are on their own revealing for
                    they cite again and again Amazon as an agency possessed with a directness and
                    invisibility of action, the likes of which now highlighted the position from
                    which Amazon had operated as a model of distribution. The perceived discrepancy,
                    a kind of aporia illuminated by Kindle libraries suddenly bereft of their copies
                    of <title rend="italic">1984</title>, prompted readers to discuss what Amazon
                    could or should do to acknowledge and remedy the situation even as they
                    struggled to account for the intrusion in the first place. In all the furor,
                    however, the novel’s presence was unremarkable, appearing primarily as an iconic
                    analog for Amazon’s dystopic conduct. Caught up in the conversation about an
                    ownership undone, Amazon readers remediated <title rend="italic">1984</title> in
                    the light of their Kindles, doing so by targeting Amazon as a direct and literal
                    referent. If King’s fictional Kindle led readers to comment on the corresponding
                    desires Amazon constructed for them, the erasure of <title rend="italic"
                        >1984</title> made drawing the parallels between Big Brother and Amazon a
                    fitting, if not necessary, response. In this instance, Kindle-reading had
                    shifted the dynamic through which texts, themselves no less made than things,
                    articulate and critique the conditions of their production. For the turn to
                    analogic reading that these Kindled texts have inspired has as <emph>its</emph>
                    focus what it means for reading to be so newly mediated.</p>
