                        <p>Kevin G. Smith is a doctoral candidate in the English Department at
                            Northeastern University. He has been a fellow at the NULab for Texts,
                            Maps, and Networks at Northeastern and is currently serving as Editorial
                            Assistant for Research in the Teaching of English. His research focuses
                            on intersections between digital humanities and rhetoric and
                            composition, especially new media, digital pedagogy and digital writing
                            practices. His prospective dissertation will study schema development
                            and the use of markup for authoring in undergraduate composition

                    researchers examining the intersections and affinities between rhetoric and the

                    University of Chicago Press, 2015), this volume is a valuable effort to sustain
                    a conversation across these important fields. The essays that make up this
                    collection are relevant to both titular fields, and to a wider range of writing

                    collection of essays by rhetoricians and writing studies researchers examining
                    the intersections and affinities between rhetoric and the digital

        <body>
            <p>The twenty-three chapters that make up <title rend="italic">Rhetoric and the Digital
                    Humanities</title>, edited by Jim Ridolfo and William Hart-Davidson, represent
                the first book-length effort to sustain a conversation around the affinities between
                these two fields. Though only <q>rhetoric</q> is included in the title, this volume
                really speaks more broadly across writing studies — rhetoric, composition, computers
                and writing, and technical and professional writing. The theoretical and
                methodological conundra worked through in the chapters (especially demonstrated
                through specific project applications) are important first steps toward what will
                hopefully be a more sustained engagement between the digital humanities and writing
                studies. On the whole, the volume should be read by the writing studies community,
                especially as an introduction to the tools and methods employed in the digital
                humanities that might be of use to their research. </p>
            <p>Yet, it might be slightly less obvious at the outset what digital humanists outside
                of rhetoric and writing studies might gain from reading the volume. Part of the
                confusion may arise from the tone of the introduction. Citing an increased level of
                investment in the digital humanities, both within institutions and through external
                funding agencies, Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson begin their introduction by calling on
                Matthew Kirschenbaum’s <title rend="quotes">Digital Humanities as/is a Tactical
                    Term</title> to argue that rhetoric and writing studies scholars can leverage DH
                in two ways: <quote rend="block" source="#ridolfo2015">First, we argue that scholars
                    may want to consider selectively redefining digital projects under the umbrella
                    of DH in order to leverage funding, institutional recognition, and extrafield
                    audiences, Second we propose studying the DH job market as an example of how
                    fields in crisis (literary studies and history) are responding to market
                    pressures and, additionally, how rhetoric studies can leverage DH for additional
                    hires. <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="4"/></quote></p>
            <p>This is pragmatic, to be sure. However, one might imagine beginning this volume not
                with concerns of funding and disciplinary legitimation, but rather with a vision of
                how the two titular fields can be more mutually constitutive. Ridolfo and
                Hart-Davidson work toward this vision at the end of their introduction, especially
                when they sketch the many lines of inquiry animating the contributions of the
                volume. The fourteen bullet points that close the introduction indeed look both ways
                — toward how rhetorical theory can inform DH praxis and how DH methods and theories
                can be adopted and adapted to rhetoric and writing studies research. </p>
            <p>Perhaps the stance Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson begin with is merely reactive to a less
                productive version of conversations between writing studies and the digital
                humanities: what Shannon Carter, Jennifer Jones, and Sunchai Hamcumpai call a
                territorial dispute, pitting computers and writing scholarship against digital
                humanities scholarship in a struggle over who was here and who said what first <ptr
                    target="#ridolfo2015" loc="36–37"/>. The pragmatic opening may be an effort to
                shake stubborn computer and writing scholars from their defensive positions into a
                more open dialogue. Some chapters in the volume still stake territorial claims — DH
                should recognize certain kinds of work as DH scholarship (Sano-Franchini), or
                rhetoric and writing programs should be cautiously defensive in the face of
                institutional pressures to conform/contribute to DH initiatives (Walls) — but the
                stance throughout is more productive, and more reflective of the fourteen rich
                questions with which Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson end their introduction.</p>
            <p>The volume is divided into three sections. In Part One, <title rend="quotes"
                    >Interdisciplinary Connections,</title> the authors take up relations between
                rhetoric and the digital humanities, seeding new conversations by providing
                frameworks for digital humanities work (Reid; Sano-Franchini; Anderson and Sayers),
                examining fruitful ground for collaboration (Brown; Carter, Jones, and Hamcumpai;
                Eyman and Ball), and advocating for DH methods to be taken up in rhetoric (Johnson).
                At times, though, there seem to be assumptions or misunderstandings about the
                digital humanities within the chapters. For example, James Brown Jr. seeks to draw a
                parallel between the current relations between rhetoric and the digital humanities
                and past disciplinary struggles within English departments between rhetoric/writing
                studies and literature faculty. In doing so, Brown paints a monolithic portrait of
                the digital humanities as literary criticism. His discussion of electronic
                literature and software studies is compelling: arguing that the <soCalled>procedural
                    rhetoric</soCalled> of electronic literature is a potential point of
                interrogation for rhetoricians to <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015"
                    >theorize the relation between production and interpretation</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="29"/></cit>. However, his larger point about the
                disciplinary identity of the digital humanities elides scholarship outside of
                literary studies (especially history, geography, and the public humanities). </p>
            <p>Despite possible mischaracterizations, Part One outlines some of the potentials for
                rhetorical theory to inform approaches to digital humanities work. In particular,
                Sano-Franchini’s <title rend="quotes">Cultural Rhetorics and the Digital Humanities:
                    Toward Cultural Reflexivity in Digital Making</title> is a timely effort that
                can speak to the transformative and postcolonial digital humanities initiatives of
                scholars like Roopika Risam, Moya Bailey, and others. Sano-Franchini employs a
                    <soCalled>cultural rhetorics</soCalled> approach, which <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">theorizes how rhetoric and culture
                        are interconnected through a focus on the process by which language, texts,
                        and other discursive practices like performance, embodiment, and materiality
                        create meaning</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="52"/>
                </cit>. In so doing, she provides a heuristic for the creation of multimodal texts
                and the metadata associated with those texts from a cultural rhetorics viewpoint.
                Her heuristic is also a powerful call for rhetoricians moving toward digital
                representations to be reflexive to how metadata and underlying data structures can
                affect projects, often in unforeseen ways. Sano-Franchini’s chapter is
                representative of the best the volume has to offer — contributions that look both
                toward DH and back upon rhetoric and writing studies to imagine a mutually
                beneficial relation. </p>
            <p>Nathan Johnson’s chapter, <title rend="quotes">Modeling Rhetorical Disciplinarity:
                    Mapping the Digital Network,</title> the last chapter in Part 1, is the first in
                the volume to take up quantitative methods. Johnson argues for the use of factor
                mapping in the humanities for tenure and promotion. According to Johnson, with
                factor mapping, humanities scholars can leverage <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">one of the more powerful
                        argumentative rhetorics of the twenty-first century — the use of mathematics
                        to support an argument</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="100"/>
                </cit>. He closes his chapter with an interesting discussion of metadata: <cit><quote
                    rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">Even though full-text analysis is possible
                    for humanistic interpretation, perhaps some of the richest types of metadata for
                    factor-mapping projects are the subject headings, classifications, descriptors,
                    and keywords associated with primary and secondary texts. This type of
                    information is frequently generated by human interpretation, usually by
                    librarians or indexers who are hired specifically to interpret the nature of
                    books</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="105–106"/></cit>. Here, the humanistic aversion to
                quantitative data that Johnson identifies is mitigated through the mediation of
                library metadata practices. Johnson’s chapter could certainly provide a starting
                point for further research and also provides a nice transition to Part Two, <title
                    rend="quotes">Research Methods and Methodology.</title></p>
            <p>The volume may ultimately be most useful for rhetoricians and writing studies
                scholars as a primer or introduction to DH methods as they have been (or could be)
                applied. Johnson’s contribution is the first instance of this type of text, and Part
                2 of the volume provides a wide range of projects and methodological discussions
                that anchor the volume. Johnson’s focus on quantitative, computer-aided methods is
                mirrored in contributions by Kennedy and Long, Hart, Hoffman and Waisanen, and
                Koteyko. Likewise, McNely and Teston’s <title rend="quotes">Tactical and Strategic:
                    Qualitative Approaches to the Digital Humanities</title> should be required
                reading for almost any DH researcher, but especially those coming newly to DH from
                rhetoric and writing studies. Their warning bears quoting in full since the history
                of methodological appropriation in rhetoric and composition runs deeply: <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">rhetorically informed digital
                        humanists should proceed with caution — <emph>doing</emph> DH is not as
                        simple as choosing a digital tool and then combining that tool and tactic
                        with a given methodological approach; indeed, a given tactic may be at odds
                        with one’s strategy</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="112"/>
                </cit>.</p>
            <p>Hoffman and Waisanen’s is the most introductory of the cluster of essays on
                computer-aided methods. They provide an overview of the four major functions of
                computer-aided textual analysis to enable researchers to <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">make intelligent choices about the

                    <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="179"/>
                </cit>. The authors see three potential applications of large-scale text analysis
                for rhetorical studies: tracing ideographs and memes and their meaning shifts over
                time (concordances); systematic comparisons of broad features of textual style and
                tone (dictionary comparisons); and large-scale studies of framing (cluster analyses)
                    <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="180–81"/>. By delimiting the limitations and
                potential contributions of textual analysis for rhetoric, Hoffman and Waisanen trace
                a rough topography which is brought into focus by the more project-based chapters of
                Kennedy and Long, Hart, and Koteyko.</p>
            <p>Kennedy and Long highlight the usefulness of a <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#ridolfo2015">quantitative, data-driven inquiry</quote> method for
                qualitative authorship studies by mining Wikipedia <ptr target="#ridolfo2015"
                    loc="148"/>. They also point to versioning software programs like Git and
                Subversion that trace the iterative development of collaboratively-authored texts
                (among other things, like pieces of software). Looking to what Ed Finn has called
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#finn2013">digital traces</quote>
                <ptr target="#finn2013" loc="4"/>, or those data (incidentally) left behind through
                online processes, Kennedy and Long seem to be just scratching the surface of what
                kinds of data could be useful to rhetoric and writing studies scholars.</p>
            <p>Hart, on the other hand, lauds one particular method – sentiment analysis – and one
                particular tool – DICTION – as relevant to rhetorical research. Hart briefly

                contributions here is to temper what he calls the positivistic and humanistic
                overreactions to automated text analysis <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="154"/>.
                Recalling the work of Jerome McGann and Stephen Ramsay (deformative/algorithmic
                criticism), Hart argues that DICTION, by employing a bag-of-words approach to
                documents, can <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">make the text
                    strange</quote> in ways that readers are unlikely to do on their own <ptr
                    target="#ridolfo2015" loc="158"/>. For her contribution, Koteyko critiques text
                analysis programs like DICTION as <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">often
                    of little value to scholars of rhetoric owing to the decontextualized nature of
                    results</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="184"/></cit>. Her focus on the corpus-assisted discourse
                analysis attends to the social (and networked) aspects of a text in ways that
                rhetoricians coming from an ethnographic background may find more compelling than
                Hart’s automated text analysis. </p>
            <p>In a slight departure from automated and computer-assisted analysis, Boyle’s <title
                    rend="quotes">Low Fidelity in High Definition: Speculations on Rhetorical
                    Editions</title> takes on scholarly markup and digital editions: topics rarely
                discussed in rhetoric and writing studies writ large (even in computers and writing,
                the subfield that shares the most obvious affinities to the digital humanities). As
                such his chapter is an important initial foray into this long-standing branch of DH
                work. Boyle argues that literary digital editions in DH privilege a <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">fidelity to texts and
                    interpretation</quote> while a rhetorical edition would <cit><quote rend="inline"

                    primary, secondary and tertiary</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="132"/></cit>. Boyle’s understanding of digital editions
                created in DH comes largely from Stephen Ramsay’s algorithmic criticism, but he also
                mentions Jerome McGann’s <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">idea of
                    radiant textuality</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="132"/></cit>. It is surprising, then, that Boyle ascribes
                such stability and fidelity to digital critical editions. One can see the theory of
                a dynamic and unstable text Boyle lauds as uniquely rhetorical in Jerome McGann’s
                    <title rend="quotes">The Rationale of Hypertext,</title> originally written in
                the mid-1990s and republished in his 2001, <title rend="italic">Radiant

                    <quote rend="block" source="#mcgann2004">Unlike a traditional edition, a
                        hypertext is not organized to focus attention on one particular text or set
                        of texts. It is ordered to disperse attention as broadly as possible. Of
                        course it is true that every particular hypertext at any particular point in
                        time will have established preferred sets of arrangements and orderings, and
                        these could be less, or more, decentralized. The point is that the
                        hypertext, unlike the book, encourages greater decentralization of design.
                        Hypertext provides the means for establishing an indefinite number of
                            <q>centers,</q> and for expanding their number as well as altering their
                        relationships. One is encouraged not so much to find as to make order — and
                        then to make it again and again, as established orderings expose their
                        limits.</quote>

            <p>McGann is not claiming to have achieved this decentered text, and even closes the
                chapter with a recognition that, in presentational interfaces, the ideal is
                undermined and that future research should <cit><quote rend="inline"

                editions be useful for student-authored corpora? </p>
            <p>Taken wholly, Part Two of the volume seems much more directed at rhetoric and writing
                studies researchers just beginning to explore the theories and methods of the
                digital humanities than the other two parts of the volume. Given the extensive focus
                on multimodal compositions in Part One and Part Three, Part Two retains a surprising
                textual bias, especially in discussions of computer-aided analysis. This bias may be
                expected, but it does elide parallel work in large-scale image analysis <ptr
                    target="#manovich2012"/> and mapping projects <ptr target="#bodenhamer2010"/>.
                This may be why I perceived a disconnect between the chapters adapting
                DH/computational methods to rhetoric studies and the chapters proceeding from
                rhetorical theory to inform DH praxis.</p>
            <p>Part 3 of the volume, <title rend="quotes">Future Trajectories,</title> is anchored
                by a cluster of chapters dealing with archives and historiography. These chapters
                are of particular interest to rhetoric and composition scholars. As the recent
                    <title rend="italic">College Composition and Communication</title> special issue
                on Research Methodologies shows, archival research and archive building are
                important topics in rhetoric and composition.<note> See <title rend="italic">College
                        Composition and Communication</title> volume 64.1 (September 2013),
                    especially Gaillet; McKee and Porter; Carter and Conrad; Rice and Rice.</note>
                The chapters in this volume extend many of these conversations with particular
                interest in digital archives and historiography. </p>
            <p>In her chapter, Potts argues that, in the rush to build archives, we have privileged
                data over user experience. She calls for archives that are <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#ridolfo2015">focused on engagement and outreach with the
                    public</quote> through rhetoricians engaging in DH projects as <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">user advocates, experience
                        architects, and participant-centered researchers</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="255"/>
                </cit>. Toward this end she discusses three elements of user-centered design that
                can serve as a heuristic for digital archive builders: people, purpose, content <ptr
                    target="#ridolfo2015" loc="259–260"/>. Graban, Ramsey-Tobienne, and Myers also
                speak directly to rhetoricians who would be digital archivists. They underscore the
                recursive, dynamic, and political processes of preservation <emph>and</emph>
                dissemination necessarily involved in digitization. They suggest a methodology of
                invention to <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">enact the kind of
                    intervention</quote> we may seek in historiographic projects.</p>
            <p>In a slight departure, Rice and Rice describe ephemeral archival production as a
                performative pedagogical strategy, creating <emph>digital archivists</emph>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="251"/>, rather than digital archives. This shift in
                focus is twofold: first it refigures the object of study from the stable (or not)
                archive to the network of associations arising from the archival act. This focus
                recalls Boyle’s argument that rhetoricians should concern themselves less with what
                a text is than with what a text does. Second, the chapter reflects on pedagogical
                goals and outcomes in a way that is not often made explicit in the collection. Along
                with the contribution of Rice and Rice, several chapters in the collection should be
                of great interest to compositionists or rhetoricians concerned with the teaching of
                rhetoric of/through technology.</p>
            <p>Glaser and Micciche, in their chapter <title rend="quotes">Digitizing
                    English,</title> reflect on lessons learned from leading an introductory DH
                course as newcomers to DH themselves. Their insights call attention to the new
                requirements of graduate education in the face of conservative English departments.
                On the whole, their recommendations are not revolutionary, but their narrative of
                coming to them <emph>through</emph> engagement with DH is compelling. Chapters by
                Walls and Brooks, Lindgren, and Warner are useful for Writing Program Administrators
                and K-16 teachers/administrators, respectively. These chapters form a triptych in
                Part 3, addressing pedagogical, curricular and institutional promises and
                challenges. </p>
            <p>Reading thematically across the volume, there are three other chapters that are more
                implicit in their pedagogical implications, yet may be of particular interest to
                compositionists and rhetoricians working and teaching in writing studies programs.
                The contribution by Anderson and Sayers is one such chapter. By calling attention to
                the layered materiality of compositions (including the composition of their
                chapter), Anderson and Sayers negotiate a more complex view of digital compositions
                and composing practices that may blur disciplinary lines — between, <cit><quote
                    rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">digital humanities, digital rhetoric,
                    media studies, textual studies, and electronic literature, for example</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="83"/></cit>, by enabling critical reflection on
                communicative practice. Pedagogically, their focus on <quote rend="inline"
                    source="#ridolfo2015">composing through — not just about — digital materials
                    and networked culture</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="84"/> may have implications for what teachers ask
                students to do in multimodal (and multimedia) writing courses. </p>
            <p>Similarly, chapters by Ballentine and Stolley can each be read pedagogically.
                Ballentine recognizes that true understanding and engagement with new media requires
                new kinds of literacy and engagement that exceeds merely the presentational,
                interface level of digital objects. Ballentine calls on Ian Bogost’s <quote
                    rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">procedural literacy</quote> to argue for
                code-level literacy to become <quote rend="inline" source="#ridolfo2015">endemic
                    to the digital humanities</quote>
                <ptr target="#ridolfo2015" loc="278"/>, while he simultaneously recognizes that the
                humanities is not, and should not become, computer science. That Ballentine, like
                Anderson and Sayers, toes disciplinary lines is unsurprising. Stolley similarly
                navigates in the space between humanities and computer science as he argues
                compellingly for research <emph>through</emph> programming-as-writing, for
                programming as a genuine form of humanistic inquiry <ptr target="#ridolfo2015"
                    loc="268–269"/>. Ballentine and Stolley are convincing in establishing rhetoric
                as a disciplinary home for coding and code literacy, and their adaptation of
                computer science theories and methods joins a venerable tradition in composition and
                rhetoric of looking to other fields for methodological invigoration. These
                implicitly pedagogical chapters share a focus on doing as a way of knowing, a focus
                long embraced by writing studies as well as the digital humanities. This,
                ultimately, may be fruitful ground for the more mutually constitutive relationship
                between rhetoric and the digital humanities that does not find its way into Ridolfo
                and Hart-Davidson’s introduction.</p>
            <p>Taken as the beginning of a conversation, <title rend="italic">Rhetoric and the
                    Digital Humanities</title> is an important collection. The affinities between
                the digital humanities and rhetoric and writing studies are numerous, varied, and
                brimming with potential for mutual collaboration. Though the volume, as signaled by
                Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson’s introduction, may be more explicitly aimed at rhetoric
                and writing studies scholars in their disciplinary homes, many chapters speak to the
                nascent possibilities for rhetorical theory to animate our approaches to digital
                humanities projects, especially at the level of data representation. The influence
                of writing studies, too, can be a useful bridge to thinking about our pedagogical
                frameworks and approaches. One hopes that the big tent of the digital humanities is
                capacious enough for rhetoric and writing studies scholars to be included, and that
                we can avoid the territorial disputes of which Carter, Jones, and Hamcumpai warn us.
                    <title rend="italic">Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities</title> is a step in
                that direction.</p>
