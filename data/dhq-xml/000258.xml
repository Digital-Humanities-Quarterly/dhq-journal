            <dhq:abstract>
                <p>In this paper we introduce the syntagm <soCalled>pragmatic modelling</soCalled>
                    as a productive way of contextualising research in Digital Humanities (DH). We
                    define <soCalled>pragmatic modelling</soCalled> as a middle-out approach
                    (neither top down nor bottom up) that combines formal and experimental modelling
                    techniques with an effective use of language. Furthermore, in order to elucidate
                    a <soCalled>pragmatic understanding</soCalled> of model building, we reflect on
                    texts (considered here as objects) and modelling (or strategy of analysis) in DH
                    research (and teaching). This paper does not identify a new practice or
                    approach; rather it offers an explanatory framework for existing practices. As
                    the paper explains, this framework goes beyond existing ones and allows us to
                    think about modelling in a more integral way. Drawing on this framework, we
                    reveal how DH modelling practices challenge epistemological and linguistic
                    restrictions, by, for example, problematising the adoption of terminology
                    belonging to the domain of computer sciences. Reflections on metaphorical
                    reasoning are used to exemplify how polarities and some rigidities DH research
                    could find itself embedded in are overcome in practice. We conclude by
                    advocating the importance of a diachronic and historical analysis of the role of
                    metaphors in DH to further explore the relation between theory and practice as
                    well as to develop models of modelling integral to DH research.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction</head>
                <p>DH or humanities computing in its former vest <ptr target="#schreibman2004"/> is
                    being institutionalized and is an example of how cross-border fertilisation,
                    namely interdisciplinarity, is possible <ptr target="#mccarty2016"/>
                    <ptr target="#marras2012"/>. DH scholars and professionals are making use of a
                        <soCalled>blended</soCalled> style reflected both in their language, by
                    adopting expressions to account for new scenarios, and in their research and
                    teaching approaches, often integrating computational methods and terminologies
                    with modes of <emph>discourse</emph> associated with more established
                    scholarship in the humanities <ptr target="#marras2013"/>
                    <ptr target="#flanders2009"/>. DH is surely a field in rapid evolution, where
                    open questions are numerous and self-reflexivity is not new (see for example
                        <ptr target="#gold2012"/>). Modelling is widely agreed to be a central
                    activity of DH; as the discipline is institutionalised to a greater degree, new
                    opportunities and challenges are being opened up, not least to understand the
                    act of modelling far better than we have done in the past. In particular, the
                    sharing of empirical practices and methodologies across borders makes DH
                    somewhat comparable to the techno-sciences;<note> For an overview of models in
                        science see in particular <ptr target="#frigg2012"/>. For an in depth
                        discussion and examples of the use of analogical modelling in science, see

                        science see <ptr target="#mahr2009"/>. Note that we use the term
                        techno-sciences, as McCarty does in his work, to be inclusive towards
                        engineering and to recognise the profound role of computing in contemporary
                        science.</note> it also anchors humanities scholarship to a practical
                    dimension that renews its 15th-century roots of empirical <foreign xml:lang="la"

                        perspective, empirical approaches in humanities research have an

                                believe that they are moving towards science when they use an
                                empirical approach in studying texts, art, music, or the past. They
                                are mistaken. Scholars using empirical methods are returning to
                                their roots in the 15th-century <foreign xml:lang="la">studia

                        </cit></note> This paper will make a contribution to this discussion by
                    asking the following questions: other scholarship in the humanities and
                    techno-sciences has passed/passes via the experimental and the formal; in what
                    way is the experimental and the formal done in DH different and similar? Where
                    do DH modellers position their models in the polarity between texts/objects and
                    theory/practice? Is modelling in computing going to lift our way of seeing, and
                    therefore thinking, to another level of analysis? </p>
                <p>To address these questions our argument will engage with two interrelated
                    concepts: <list type="unordered">
                        <item><q>text</q>: dynamic cultural objects (material documents as well as

                                it akin to what in the philosophical debate is described as
                                fictional models (we will return to this under section 3). </note>

                    sciences and therefore in mathematical reasoning. It is also directly
                    interconnected with work on texts <ptr target="#buzzetti2002"/>, the privileged
                    objects of humanities research. Here the perspectives that it can grant are

                    them <ptr target="#eide2015"/>. It should be specified that it is modelling

                    describing their modelling activities DH researchers tend to privilege a
                    symbolic analysis of texts instead of a pragmatic one. The former view on text
                    focuses on partitioning it into descriptive chunks or components, be they
                    material or conceptual, while the latter, as we intend it here, calls for an

                            <soCalled>pragmatic</soCalled> we subscribe to a functional perspective,
                        which favours the <emph>use</emph> of language over other aspects. By
                        focusing on use, a pragmatic perspective is also integrative in that it aims
                        at encompassing the full complexity of the cognitive, social, and cultural
                        functioning of language <ptr target="#verschueren2012"/>. </note>

                        Kralemann and Lattmann call the <quote rend="inline" source="#kralemann2013"

                        aspect of pragmatic modelling might need further attention in a DH context
                        with respect to the two following elements: flexibility of language and
                        fuzzy polarities (in particular object vs. model). By using the term
                        pragmatic modelling we intend to emphasise an understanding of the act of
                        modelling as anchored to theory and language. Kralemann and Lattmann explain

                    <p>Their theory of models as icons in the Peircean sense acts as a generic
                        framework to contextualise the creation and use of models in the sciences,
                        humanities and, we could even say, life. To exemplify how this applies to DH
                        (in line with established understandings of modelling), one could think of a
                        researcher who is modelling a set of historical documents (her objects). In
                        doing so she must engage with a theory of text and hence with an
                        understanding of textual features relevant to her historical research. In
                        her modelling activity, the researcher maps the theory of text and scholarly
                        language she uses to describe and understand her documents to a digital
                        model of her texts. She may use, for instance, a formalisation of the widely
                        adopted Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects (OHCO)<note> For a recent
                            discussion on the OHCO model as empirical observation of the publishing

                        (TEI) document model. Our researcher chooses a hierarchical model of text
                        (the OHCO model) which she presumably thinks will allow her to map some of
                        her understandings of the historical documents under study to a pre-defined
                        structure (e.g. a TEI schema) and to process those data in some automatic
                        form (e.g. to create indexes of certain selected elements, to perform
                        combined searches or specific content analysis). However, in the modelling
                        process itself she might question deeply the OHCO model as well as the TEI
                        categorisations, reflecting on her own theory of the historical documents at
                        hand and realising the constraints of both theory and model with respect to
                        her objects of interest. She will most likely go back and forth in her
                        modelling efforts to match ‚Äì based on her knowledge and scholarly language ‚Äì
                        what she would like to elicit in the document (e.g. the organisation of the
                        diplomatic formulas, the occurrence of names of witnesses in certain
                        locations in the document, the abbreviations occurring in the date clauses)
                        with the formal hierarchical structure proposed by one or more of the TEI
                        guidelines chapters on the encoding of primary sources. Once this mapping
                        reaches a certain stability and she is able to actually process that model,
                        her interpretative activity will likely have to zoom in and out of these
                        manifestations (e.g. between single cases and emerging patterns). She will
                        often puzzle over exceptions that will allow her to iteratively refine the
                        original mapping or require a total rethinking of categories and of the OCHO
                        model being adopted. Single components or parts of the model itself (e.g.
                        the specific schema adopted and its syntax, the technology, the versions of
                        the model at <hi rend="italic">x</hi> moments in time) cannot account for
                        the complexity of <quote rend="inline" source="#kralemann2013">model
                            relation</quote> as described above by Kralemann and Lattmann. Within
                        such a reductive analysis of modelling practices, the contextual and
                        relational construction of the semantics of the model as well as its
                        pragmatic end are lost. </p>
                    <p>A pragmatic understanding of modelling, as we understand it here, and as
                        practiced in DH research, can facilitate the recognition that modelling
                        operates within relational and dynamic cycles which are elicited via
                        negotiations over the use of modelling languages (e.g. by renaming
                        categories of analysis or adopting neologisms). The interplay (usually
                        referred to as mapping) between the object of analysis (texts in this case)
                        and the model, as well as across different levels of the interpretative
                        process (e.g. close and distant reading, symbolic/syntagmatic and
                        semantic/paradigmatic levels of text analysis), exemplify some of these
                        dynamic aspects.</p>

                <head>2. Modelling in DH</head>
                <p>Models and modelling - pervasive in scientific empirical practices ‚Äì have become
                    part of the methodological approaches of DH research. Thus the question is: in
                    what way is DH rhetoric and practices not only attracted by but borrowing from
                    the techno-sciences? What <emph>model of modelling</emph> can be considered
                        <soCalled>adequate</soCalled> to DH? To this end, it is necessary to point
                    out which are the distinctive features of modelling in the humanities. If
                    modelling acts as understood from a semiotic tradition are used to make sense of
                    our cultural objects (mainly but not only texts), they are meaning-making
                    practices and hence in themselves objects of study for the humanities. Indeed,
                    as stated below, the modelling process is often recognised as part of what is
                    being modelled. In this respect it is interesting to note how this applies to
                    natural and literary languages as well as markup languages: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#flanders2012">[...] by its nature the TEI is

                            self-awareness: the non-transparency of the modeling process is itself
                            part of what is being modeled (and again, I would claim that this is a

                            dynamicity combines the notion of variants of material texts with an
                            overarching principle of fluid textuality and the sociology of texts
                            theory. With respect to the former, for instance, Burdick et al. state: <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">Fluid textuality refers

                        particularly in the relationship between models and objects as well as
                        models and interpretations. DH researchers have engaged with linear texts
                        all the way towards discontinuous narratives, for instance as structured in
                        relational databases. In addition, texts as objects being modelled in DH
                        research are not only or mainly verbal and encompass hybrid modalities such
                        as maps <ptr target="#eide2013b"/>. Indeed, dynamic aspects of texts as
                        modelled in DH research and connected to the nature of cultural artefacts as
                        such could be exemplified in a variety of ways. Researchers engaged in
                        scholarly digital editing, for instance, have attempted at modelling the
                        whole range of material incarnations of texts and the associated
                        interpretative processes from manuscript witnesses to printed editions, from
                        diplomatic transcriptions to critical editing. Hence, often within one and
                        the same digital editing project, textual models do not sit still; they
                        shift along multiple axes with respect to their objects and interpretations.
                        The models themselves change shape. So, the axis of textual sources vs.
                        models of analysis and interpretation of those same sources is mobile; for
                        example, during the modelling process the sample of sources being selected
                        might reveal new important features to model ‚Äì such as a late pagination
                        within a codex under study originally not included in the encoding model -
                        which in some cases might also challenge the previous knowledge of those
                        sources such as the biography of that codex. The axis between the textual
                        models and the reading interfaces being generated out of them is also
                        mobile; while developing an interface to a digital edition, the DH modeler
                        might realise that some features of the original encoding model are not
                        refined enough to allow for certain visualisations or specific manipulation
                        of the data.<note> These two axes illustrate the interplay of
                                <soCalled>model of</soCalled> vs. <soCalled>model for</soCalled> as

                        the study of texts that emerges from the relation between objects and

                        text <ptr target="#sahle2006"/>
                        <ptr target="#sahle2012"/> which states that the definition of text (e.g.
                        text as semantic and intentional vs. text as version containing specific
                        graphemes; text as complex visual sign vs. text as linguistic utterance;
                        text as material document vs. text as work or rhetorical structure) depends
                        on how we look at it, on the aspects we are most interested in making
                        explicit in our modelling efforts and the tacit knowledge invested in those
                        efforts. This is why the TEI standard aims to account for many models of
                        texts and is a mobile guide in itself.</p>
                    <p>Next we turn to historicity, which is the aspect via which we put models in
                        relation to their historical interpretations. The concept of historicity is
                        useful to argue that, usually, in DH, modelling acts are also and
                        necessarily meta-modelling activities because they explicitly engage with
                        non-neutral objects, that is with objects mediated by prior interpretative
                        activities even if not always passing via computational
                            formalisations.<note> On the historiographical aspect to modelling see
                            also <ptr target="#flanders2015" loc="16"/>.</note> Therefore, our
                        models of texts also embed historical understandings, categorisations and
                        definitions of those texts.<note> It is evident that this statement does not
                            apply only to modelling in the humanities. However, while the expression
                            of the molecular model or of the evolutionary theory have their own
                                <soCalled>historicity</soCalled>, the meta-modelling role in the
                            sciences is much less prominent and necessarily embedded in modelling
                            activities: <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#knox2012">If that past model has
                                    changed, or is inconsistent, or incoherent, or unintelligible,
                                    we may be able to correct it, or we may need to incorporate it
                                    and model its difficulties and historicity as well, depending on
                                    what we are trying to accomplish.</quote>

                    </p>
                    <p>The last aspect we mention concerns the processuality of the study of texts
                        located at the interface between objects and subject‚Äôs interpretations. This
                        concept aims at highlighting a further connection between the reading (and
                        hence also modelling) of texts and our being human. How we read, interpret,
                        engage with texts is intimately situated in the performative and eventful
                        process of creating and confirming our own identity <ptr

                    <p>In conclusion, what this brief encounter with texts aimed to highlight is a
                        reiteration of how entangled any DH modelling process is with the cultural,
                        historical and personal engagement we have and had with these complex and
                        open objects.</p>

                    <p>In philosophy of science there has been a lively debate around theorisations
                        of models and their position in the middle between theory and data or
                        objects (e.g. <ptr target="#frigg2012" loc="24‚Äì25"/>). Models as used in
                        experimental settings, including computer simulations, are often
                        conceptualised as <cit>

                        </cit>. Hence, also computer simulations, as a special type of model, can be
                        perceived as links <cit>

                        </cit>. In a simplified view of experimental settings theorised within such
                        frameworks, a rather stable physical system exists; any new knowledge
                        acquired during an experiment is mediated by models of that system (models
                        of materiality) via a causal connection. </p>
                    <p>Without aiming at defining experimental practices in the techno-sciences,
                        this paper dwells on how they are commonly perceived and how DH practice
                        relates to them.<note> Flanders and Jannidis state for example that <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#flanders2015">In computer science,
                                    among both theorists working in the academy and those working in

                                    modeling as a description of a real and objective world (which
                                    includes the possibility of assessing the correctness of data
                                    models) while only a minority views it as a design process.
                                    However, in digital humanities there seems to be a general
                                    understanding that a data model, like all models, is an
                                    interpretation of an object, either in real life or in the
                                    digital realm. Michael Sperberg-McQueen in his closing keynote
                                    to the workshop stated this position clearly: <quote
                                        rend="inline" source="#flanders2015">modeling is a way to make explicit
                                        our assumptions about the nature of a text/artefact.</quote>
                                    Furthermore, most digital humanities researchers assume that
                                    data modeling is primarily a constructive and creative process
                                    and that the functions of the digital surrogate determine what
                                    aspects have to be modeled.</quote>

                            </cit></note> These perceptions and relations explain the borrowing from
                        the techno-sciences we aim to unpack and also suggest directions towards a
                        model of modelling integral to DH research. In the case of computational
                        models, for example, a physical system is represented by a simulation model,
                        which is the result of a <cit>

                        </cit> passing via various mathematical models of that system.<note> For
                            example, (ANSYS) offers a comprehensive software suite that spans the
                            entire range of physics, providing access to virtually any field of
                            engineering simulation that a design process requires. CAD (Computer
                            Aided Design) suites are another example of systems to draw objects
                            independently from their assumed representation scale, implying a high
                            level of abstraction from the object. Such modelling systems are of
                            course also applied in the humanities but this paper aims to focus on a
                            wider interpretation of modelling embedding processes and
                            language.</note> Now even if this is a simplified view which does not
                        take into account that a pure empiricism where objects and theories are
                        entirely separate entities has been questioned by scientists,
                            philosophers<note> For example, Morrison argues that direct materiality
                            can be seen as a myth in empirical sciences too when she states <cit>

                            etc. in quantum physics bring to the fore all sorts of interesting
                            bridges between the humanities and the techno-sciences which are beyond
                            the scope of this paper.</note> what is interesting for our analysis is
                        that computer simulations in a techno-scientific context seem to be
                        perceived as adding a level of <soCalled>immateriality</soCalled> (or better
                            <soCalled>fictionality</soCalled>) to experimental settings, while in DH
                        they tend to be perceived as adding an element of materiality to humanistic
                            interpretation.<note> See for instance the vision proposed by Svensson
                            (2012): <cit>

                            also connected to design practices, as argued, for example, by Burdick
                            et al.: <cit>
                                <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">The methodologies of

                        popular claim of DH as evidence-based humanities - or what we could call a
                        Cartesian approach to the humanities - as well as to the criticism towards

                    <p>History of culture and science can be read as progressively distancing and
                        detaching human life from the world of nature via the meditation of tools
                        and technologies.<note> Interesting the position of Floridi <ptr

                            scientific enquiries see <ptr target="#daston2000"/>.</note> This is a
                        process that can be summarised as a dialectic tension between two
                        polarities, that of <foreign xml:lang="gr">physis</foreign> and of <foreign
                            xml:lang="gr">techne</foreign>. Philosophers tried to explain and
                        mediate this process, but the dichotomy between objects and thoughts, models
                        and objects, theories and practices, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                            >explanans</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">explanandum</foreign>,
                        observer and <foreign xml:lang="la">observetur</foreign> has become
                        pervasive and intrinsic to the development of Western thought. So we ask:
                        does the fuzziness of the two polarities of objects and models emerge in a
                        new vest in a DH context?<note> This polarity is theorised in philosophy of
                            science as well as in more generalist approaches like the one in <ptr
                                target="#kralemann2013"/> outlined above and more or less implicitly
                            inherited by DH research.</note> Above we saw this with respect to
                        objects (texts); here we also see it contextualised with respect to the
                        language we use, whether intended as modelling language, language of
                        representation or language as vehicle of theories and methods. That
                        modelling practices and language are tightly connected is not new. This is
                        also the case for modelling in DH (our italics): <cit>

                        <ptr target="#mccarty2006"/>. In the context of modelling, language operates
                        at different levels; for our purposes we could identify at least two: (1)
                        functional and (2) conceptual. In the former case, a language is used to
                        describe a model in descriptive yet operational terms; an example is, for
                        instance, how effectively we apply genealogical terminology (e.g. parent,
                        ancestors, siblings, children) to navigate the hierarchical structure of an
                        XML document or to describe any arboreal organisation of knowledge. On the
                        other hand, in the case of metaphorical language, the terminology being
                        chosen and the relevant metaphorical models being applied organise the
                        modelling processes themselves. Below we provide some examples of what this
                        means in practice.</p>
                    <p>DH scholarship has been reflecting on the limits of adopting uncritically one
                        language of computer sciences. Starting from semantic data modelling and the
                        widely adopted yet controversial term of <q>ontology</q>, Pasin and Ciula,
                        stated that DH approaches seem to privilege a pragmatic rather than a
                        realist understanding of the term in light of the fact that <quote
                            rend="inline" source="#pasin2009">ontologies for the humanities must
                            support <emph>diversity</emph> and <emph>variety of viewpoints</emph>;
                            thus they cannot adhere to an underlying model which neglects
                            multiplicity in favor of a monolithic vision of the world.</quote> The
                        authors promoted the pragmatic <cit>
                            <quote rend="block" source="#pasin2009">concept of an ontology as the
                                    <emph>agreement</emph> reached by multiple <emph>parties</emph>
                                (e.g., programmers, scientists, collaborators, librarians) with the
                                aim of accomplishing some objectives (e.g., data exchange between
                                applications, communication between people, integration of disparate
                                representations). Using a metaphor, ontologies are
                                    <emph>contracts</emph>, they are the <emph>currency</emph> used
                                to perform some valuable operations. Thus, their importance is
                                ultimately related not to their truth or beauty, but to the ease
                                they bring to the collaboration among people. To use a less
                                    <soCalled>commercial</soCalled> metaphor an ontology is a
                                    <emph>compromise</emph> or a point of contact between specific
                                and possibly divergent models. The issue is therefore not only to
                                identify commonalities between projects, for instance, but also to
                                agree that the compromises so found won ºt diminish the value of the
                                underlying idiosyncratic models, the specificity of any single
                                project or interpretation. We believe that in the humanities this
                                agreement is not necessarily reachable once for all or hoped for,
                                because it may imply the negation of the interpretative efforts that
                                make a work or a project unique and the negation of the evolutionary
                                nature of scholarship. However, we also think that the possibility
                                to make two incommensurable categorical systems communicate could be
                                a challenge worth pursuing.</quote>

                                    historians to worry [...]. It is precisely in this context that
                                    the ‚Äòfactoid‚Äô- based prosopography was first developed. [...]
                                    the factoid model has been used in a number of prosopographical
                                    projects that, taken as a whole, span across almost two thousand
                                    years of history. This would not have been possible unless this
                                    conceptual framework was general enough to allow this degree of
                                    reusability; however, it is also true that each single project
                                    required a number of extensions to the model. [...] our factoid
                                    approach can show that formal structuring if designed correctly
                                    need not impose, as Veltman implies, a single perspective on the
                                    data it models, but is capable of accommodating a range of views

                        context-aware approach to history, but, as explained by Pasin and Bradley,
                        it becomes also a metaphor structuring the corresponding digital resources
                        in very practical terms: <cit>
                            <quote rend="block" source="#pasin2013">During the <soCalled>data
                                    acquisition</soCalled> phase, factoids provided historians with

                    <p>These cases cast light on the trade-offs of projecting historical lexicons in
                        new contexts. They are also evidence that, in DH modelling practices,
                        language is not purely observational, but correctable and ambiguous. A model
                        is not an addition to a theory; the non-univocal character of scholarly
                        language has to be recognised. In this perspective, the relationship across
                        borders of disciplines is also to be considered as a translation, which
                        establishes a sort of metaphorical relationship. As the result of an
                            <soCalled>intercultural marriage</soCalled> between digital and
                        humanities, DH is a realm of grafting across disciplines. Its scholarship
                        requires adaptable models that are able to grasp such specificity of
                        language as well as models that emerge from the specificity of its theories
                        and objects of analysis, models which emerge out of a modelling process not
                        directly linked to its observational contexts. Without diminishing the value
                        of formal and functional languages at the interface between human and
                        machine communication, what is therefore of interest to us is the strong
                        intrinsically metaphorical component of the DH modeler‚Äôs use of language
                        (discussed below as modeler‚Äôs talk). </p>

                <p>So where the middle ground is or where models sit depends on where the modeller
                    stands. How DH practices can use the lens of computing to make critical
                    scholarship depends on how imaginative our act of modelling is. According to
                    Godfrey-Smith, it is the modeler‚Äôs <q>talk</q>
                    which fictionalises models and makes them become objects independently of how
                    they are expressed and of where they lie on the continuum between analytic (or
                    descriptive) models adhering to physical objects, on one hand, and schematic (or
                    idealised) models, on the other. He states: <cit>

                            has probably become more prominent, and more recognizable as a distinct
                            strategy rather than an ingredient in a blend. (This would make some
                            sense of the earlier tendency to see fictionalizing as either everywhere

                            extent. They also make it possible to model more causal detail, and are

                    <p>The pragmatic take on modelling, as outlined above, implies some equilibrium
                        between the two polarities (observation/objects/literal language, on one
                        hand, and theory/model/metaphorical language, on the other) and overcomes
                        the misleading dichotomy between observation of the objects and theorisation
                        (hence modelling) of those objects. A nomologic-deductive process in
                        building models which distinguishes sharply between theory and observation
                        has been surpassed in DH theory. With respect to this but mainly focusing on
                        visual languages in DH, Drucker argues that: <cit>

                        as framed so far. In this respect, metaphorical reasoning exemplifies a
                        specific strategy that can guide modelling in DH to move away from the
                        dichotomy between bottom-up (models emerging from particulars) and top-down
                        (models imposed on particulars) approaches. We argue that pragmatic
                        modelling brings into focus a middle-out method which acts at the crossing
                        point between data and models adapting itself to specific <soCalled>textual
                            contexts</soCalled>. Three interrelated properties belonging to
                        pragmatics (adapted from <ptr target="#verschueren2012"/>) can be associated
                        with this method and explain how metaphorical reasoning functions: <list

                                implying the indeterminacy and unexclusiveness of the choices being
                                made;</item>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>These properties characterise pragmatics not merely in terms of its
                        interpretative function in reading a specific communicative domain, but as a
                        cognitive, social and cultural study of language (and communication) as
                        anticipated at the beginning of this paper. The awareness of the value of
                        pragmatics in modelling acts contributes to making rigorous practices open
                        to a creative and imaginative dimension. In this context, metaphors often
                        function as models to integrate the interpretation of theories, especially
                        when there are not terms or concepts to be used that are directly related to
                        the observed facts/objects, in other words when there is an indirect or
                        remote relation between observer and <foreign xml:lang="la"

                    <p>Metaphors have been largely used by scientists in building experimental and
                        theoretical sciences, in representing and describing a domain, and in
                        promoting understanding in scientific investigation. Scientific metaphors
                        are pervasive in science from antiquity to our time, from Aristotle‚Äôs <title
                            rend="italic">De Partibus Animalium</title>, to the early modern
                        scientific attitude to modelling as a partnership with craftsmanship and
                        engineering; from the notion of the world machine, of God as artisan or
                        architect and the world as his handicraft, to Darwin‚Äôs <soCalled>tree of life</soCalled>, from the mind-computer to
                        the protein-protein interaction as network in more recent science. Metaphors
                        often act through different <soCalled>pragmatic</soCalled> mechanisms
                        directly related to the properties listed above: from transposition - moving
                        concepts from a context to another (variability), to corrections and
                        interpretations due to new contexts (negotiability), to its reformulation
                        (adaptability to new contexts). Metaphors describe novelties, help in
                        understanding and interpreting theories but should not be reduced to be
                        simply the language of a model <ptr target="#hoffman1985"/>. In this sense,
                        the use of metaphors is a strategy to guarantee a non-rigid, descriptive
                        approach to modelling. This allows the preservation of the
                            <soCalled>openness</soCalled> of a middle-out pragmatic approach to
                        modelling as a DH context of study requires.</p>
                    <p>In DH research, the use of structuring and modelling metaphors is more and
                        more evident. The metaphorical lexicon certainly pervades the DH discourse,
                        where terminology and metaphors are intertwined (e.g. surfing, navigating,
                        artificial intelligence, computer machinery, etc.). Moreover, metaphors are
                        not only linguistic entities; an interesting range of metaphors in DH is
                        used for structuring concepts at a macro-level, for example, in the use of <cit>

                        </cit> to stand for research environment <ptr target="#textgrid"/> or the
                        cartography/landscape metaphor where the <cit><quote rend="inline"

                        <ptr target="#knowledge"/></cit>. Metaphors are also used to organize content and
                        visualise knowledge and data <ptr target="#hestia"/> or to conceptualise the
                        main features and aims of a research project, for instance in the use of
                            <soCalled>discovery</soCalled> in the Steve project <ptr target="#steve"
                        />, where the social tagging is conceived to lead to new ways to describe
                        and access cultural heritage collections. A metaphor is the

                        promoted by <ptr target="#NINES"/>; metaphors design the process-orientation

                            target="http://recensio.net">Recensio.net</ref>). Furthermore, metaphors
                        are used to structure the knowledge embedded in some research projects,
                        highlighting for example their innovative aspects, as in the Discovery
                        project (<cit>

                    <p>In a pragmatic understanding of model building theory and object are
                        complementary; the model takes a middle position operating within a

                        representational characteristics <foreign xml:lang="fr">vis √† vis</foreign>

                        in section 1.1 - but the reality such a model organises at a conceptual
                        level is not based on a purely descriptive language nor in a projection or
                        interpretation of properties.<note> As argued in <ptr
                                target="#batterman2009"/> for mathematical modelling.</note> The
                        model has its syntax, grammar, and semantics but within a processual
                        consideration of the use of language (a non-static perspective according to
                        the pragmatic properties listed above).</p>
                    <p>Bringing to the fore the metaphorical language element allows DH modellers to
                        also give prominence to the openness and complexity of their objects of
                        analysis. So within a pragmatic understanding of modeling any model is
                        primarily pragmatic because it privileges the specificity of the objects and
                        the contexts of use (of the humanities), but also because its pivot lies in
                        the manipulability of the models themselves, in terms of their negotiability
                        and flexibility.</p>

                <head>4. Conclusions</head>
                <p>In conclusion, departing from open and interdisciplinary conceptualisations of
                    objects of analysis (such as texts, Section 2.1) and of certain explorative and
                    epistemological strategies of analysis (such as modelling, see 2.2) we have
                    attempted to show how a pragmatic framework can be used to contextualise DH
                    research (under 3.1). Such a framework is useful because it emphasises the
                    fallacy of rigid polarities (object vs. model; model vs. theory) and the
                    prominent role of language in the central activity of modelling in Digital
                    Humanities. What we call <soCalled>pragmatic modeling</soCalled> is not a new
                    approach but rather a more adequate explanatory framework for existing practices
                    that combine formal and experimental modelling techniques with a constructive
                    use of language.</p>
                <p>Indeed, this de-dichotomisation reveals that modelling practices are constrained
                    by the language they are embedded in. In order to overcome this, we attempt to
                    show how metaphorical language facilitates cohesion and coherence within theory
                    and practice. Therefore, we draw attention to the role metaphors assume in
                    organising and structuring knowledge in DH and within its modelling activities
                    in particular, where the dichotomy between theory and objects is very nuanced. </p>

                        using the ontology embodied in the practice (e.g. that models are
                        representing the real world). Such deflationary views appear in the way we
                        talk (hence the connection to language) about e.g. fictional models: <quote
                            rend="inline" source="#godfrey-smith2009">Scientists in the field get used to discussing
                            how such systems behave, get used to talking of what is true or false of

                            itself. An outsider might come along and re-interpret this talk as a
                            collection of claims about deductive relations, conditionals, and so on,
                            giving a deflationary account of model systems as objects. But inside
                            the field, it does not seem like this; there it feels like the fictional

                    practices in DH. Indeed, on one hand, we take the insider‚Äôs perspective by
                    accounting for these practices and by treating our models as independent objects
                    to study and manipulate, but on the other hand, we enact the outsider‚Äôs critical
                    perspective of self-reflexivity by highlighting the metaphorical nature of the
                    DH modeler‚Äôs talk. </p>
                <p>In this paper we attempted to problematise some of the established conceptions
                    and practices around modelling in DH; however, each issue around model-building
                    would need further analysis both at the theoretical and practical level. For
                    instance, it would be useful to corroborate our work with a diachronic and
                    historical analysis of the role of metaphors in DH and build a map of
                    DH-specific as well as wider thematic metaphors. In order to further explore the
                    relationship between theory and practice within DH models of modeling, it will
                    be important to develop appropriate <foreign xml:lang="la">ad hoc</foreign>
                    guiding frameworks (based on case studies designed around the needs of specific
                    contexts of modelling). Eliciting a pragmatic awareness and giving prominence to
                    a metaphorical language seems to us a promising way forward to explore such
                    relationships.</p>
