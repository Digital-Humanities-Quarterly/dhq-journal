                <p> The article discusses the current situation in the adoption of digital tools and
                    practices in the humanities and arts in Lithuania, based on a major European
                    survey conducted by the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and
                    Humanities (DARIAH) in 2014 and 2015. The survey was aimed at understanding
                    existing scholarly practices, methods and tools that are applied by researchers,
                    as well as attitudes towards digital technologies in research and scholarship.
                    This article analyzes specific aspects of scholarly research activities and
                    digital needs in Lithuania, and provides evidence-based insights on the national

                <head>1. Understanding scholarly practices in the digital humanities</head>
                <p> Digital Humanities can be broadly characterized as the adoption of an array of
                    computational methodologies for humanities research <ptr
                        target="#schreibman2004"/>. As a field of study it became more akin to a
                    common methodological outlook, rather than just dependent on digital data or
                    even digital technologies <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2012"/>. The definition of
                    digital humanities presented in the Digital Humanities Manifesto, originally
                    published in 2008, puts emphasis on research activity by describing digital
                    humanities as a variety of scholarly practices evolving along digital data,
                    media tools and techniques: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block">Digital Humanities is not a unified field but <hi
                                rend="bold">an array of convergent practices</hi> that explore a
                            universe in which: a) print is no longer the exclusive or the normative
                            medium in which knowledge is produced and/or disseminated; instead,
                            print finds itself absorbed into new, multimedia configurations; and b)
                            digital tools, techniques, and media have altered the production and
                            dissemination of knowledge in the arts, human and social
                            sciences.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#dhm2009"/>
                    </cit></p>
                <p> While scholarly practices are in the very essence of the concept, defying and
                    understanding them remains an important task for researchers, especially in the
                    field of information behavior, its management, curation and communication, and
                    use of digital technologies within information science. The nature of digital
                    humanities as an interdisciplinary field, where research practice continues on
                    developing differently within separate research areas, or (even more so) it
                    tends to hinge on a single project or individual research, entails inevitable
                    complexity. Nowadays, the enhancement of the scholarly research process is being
                    challenged by the need to build an infrastructure for digital scholarship
                    similar to that already established in the sciences, commonly identified as
                        <emph>Cyberinfrastructure</emph> or <emph>eScience</emph>
                    <ptr target="#crane2007"/>. Its development and capacity to support the field
                    and ensure better research quality strongly relies on identification of actual
                    scholarly needs. Even if it is hard to predict the full form of such an
                    infrastructure in the future, the identification of services already in use may
                    significantly contribute to its establishment, shifting from isolated, project
                    based applications to ubiquitous and often invisible elements of a shared
                    infrastructure <ptr target="#crane2007"/>. </p>
                <p> The exclusion of processes in scholarly work, such as changing, browsing and
                    extracting, is an important part of the information behavior research <ptr
                        target="#ellis1993"/>. The revised model of information seeking behavior,
                    which derived from the data collected from interviews of social science
                    researchers, included six generic features, such as starting, chaining,
                    browsing, differentiating, monitoring and extracting <ptr target="#meho2003"/>.
                    Endeavours in seeking to perceive the basic functions of the digital humanities
                    lead to the notion of <quote rend="inline" source="#unsworth2000">scholarly
                        primitives</quote>, the term describing scholarly activities, which are
                    independent from theoretical orientation and cross the boundaries of different
                    research disciplines <ptr target="#unsworth2000"/>. Similar principles apply to
                    the idea of <quote rend="inline" source="#mccarty2002">methodological
                        commons</quote>, as the set of the most common activities that inter-connect
                    different content, tools and methods <ptr target="#mccarty2002"/>. The later
                    notions were developed into recombination of scholarly activities under five
                    main categories, such as searching, collecting, reading, writing and
                    collaborating <ptr target="#palmer2009"/>. </p>
                <p> A digital humanities taxonomy, on the other hand, is a pragmatic expression of
                    classifying such activities and representing them in a categorized manner. In
                    2005, the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) ICT methods network started to
                    develop a taxonomy of computational methods, showcasing digital humanities in
                    practice in order to understand the impact of digital content, tools and methods
                    on humanities and arts scholarship <ptr target="#ahds2004"/>. The taxonomy
                    serves as a controlled vocabulary and classifies method terms according to two
                    dimensions: firstly, <quote rend="inline" source="#speck2005">content
                        types</quote>, based on the nature of the content of the digital resource
                    employed, and, secondly, <quote rend="inline" source="#speck2005">function
                        types</quote>, based on the broad functions commonly undertaken in digital
                    resource creation processes <ptr target="#speck2005"/>. The taxonomy was later
                    adopted by the Digital Humanities Observatory (DHO) and by the Oxford University
                    Digital Humanities Programme, and used for the description of digital humanities
                    projects, thus providing a framework for understanding how digital methods
                    enable research practice and how they work with existing content and tools <ptr
                        target="#hughes2015"/>. </p>
                <p> Another initiative on developing a Digital Humanities Taxonomy was launched by
                    Project Bamboo and its Digital Research Tools (DiRT) Directory, which focused on
                    allowing researchers to find and compare digital research resources and software
                    tools <ptr target="#DiRT2016"/>. In collaboration with DARIAH-DE, the national
                    project affiliated with DARIAH-EU in Germany, it developed the Taxonomy of
                    Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH). The taxonomy splits
                    into three main categories: a) research activities, b) research objects, and c)
                    research techniques, and includes more detailed sub-categories with descriptions
                        <ptr target="#TaDiRAH2016"/>. The creation of TaDiRAH was based on a
                    pragmatic, bottom-up and user centric approach, where the emerging taxonomy
                    framework was developed by summarizing existing collections of content and
                    allowing tool users such as scholars, developers and practitioners to review and
                    add content <ptr target="#luise2016"/>. </p>
                <p> A more profound view on scholarly work inevitably leads to the development of a
                    conceptual domain model, or ontology, that seeks to be more theoretically
                    rigorous than a taxonomy. Such an ontology could help to establish a common
                    understanding and vocabulary within the digital humanities community, to link
                    content, tools and methods and tackle their heterogeneity, as well as to
                    approach theoretical issues questioning critically the underlying processes of
                    contemporary scholarship <ptr target="#hughes2015"/>. The creation of a digital
                    humanities ontology is an ongoing effort, undertaken by the Digital Curation
                    Unit, Athena Research Centre in collaboration with the Network for Digital
                    Methods in the Arts and Humanities (NeDiMAH) and DARIAH-EU <ptr
                        target="#NeDiMAH2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#DARIAH-EU2018"/>; the first edition of the upper and middle layers
                    of the ontology has been published in 2015 (<ref target="http://nemo.dcu.gr"
                        >http://nemo.dcu.gr</ref>). The development of the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology
                    (NeMO) is based on the Scholarly Research Activity Model (SRAM), which
                    conceptualizes the research process through a network of inter-related entities,
                    such as actors, activities, methods, procedures, resources, formats, tools and
                    services, and goals. It seeks to capture three complementary aspects of
                    research, i.e., from the point of view of actors (agency), processes and
                    resources, using the central notion of activity to provide a common ground for
                    all of them <ptr target="#benardou2013"/>. The NeMO ontology seeks to encompass
                    not just digital humanities work in the stricter sense but also
                    digitally-enabled work in general by including a broad spectrum of humanities
                    disciplines and covering in equal measure methods focused on use and
                    modification of digital resources, as well as research methods representing all
                    phases of the scholarly research life cycle <ptr target="#hughes2015"/>. </p>
                <p> Research work on scholarly information behavior and needs, on taxonomies of
                    digital methods and tools and on conceptual modeling of the scholarly process
                    are the background for the investigation of the scholarly practices, digital
                    needs and attitudes of European researchers in the human sciences <ptr
                        target="#dallas2018"/>. It attempts to take stock of the digital work,
                    researchers’ needs and attitudes to provide much needed baseline to understand
                    these practices for educational purposes of early researchers in the field and
                    for better requirement analysis of digital infrastructures, tools and services,
                    as well as for much needed epistemological reflexivity within the current state
                    of the human sciences <ptr target="#dallas2018"/>. In this context, the DARIAH
                    European survey on scholarly practices and digital needs in the arts and
                    humanities was planned as a transnational study aiming to capture the use of
                    digital methods and tools among all human science disciplines across Europe. The
                    Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH) is a
                    pan-European network of institutions, which aims <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#DARIAH-EU2018">to enhance and support

                        <ptr target="#DARIAH-EU2018"/>
                    </cit>. The work of Task 2 <title rend="quotes">Understanding and expanding
                        scholarly practice</title> within DARIAH had focused on scholarly
                    information activities, research needs, scholarly use and impact of digital
                    technology and later carried out its work as Digital Methods and Practices
                    Observatory (DiMPO), employing an international research team of more than
                    twenty researchers from fourteen European countries seeking to develop and
                    provide an evidence-based, up-to-date, and pragmatically useful account of the
                    emerging information practices, needs and attitudes of the arts and humanities
                    researchers in the evolving European digital scholarly environment <ptr

                    state of the art scholarly research across Europe and identifying the actual
                    needs of the researchers in the various fields of arts and humanities. </p>

                <p> Based on this approach and considering the main information activities
                    undertaken in the course of the scholarly work, the final set of survey
                    questions was selected to cover the five following areas: <emph>Use of digital

                    <ptr target="#dallas2018"/>. The questionnaire consisted of twenty questions.
                    Twelve of them concerned scholarly information practices and needs of
                    respondents, as well as digital methods and tools in the course of scholarly
                    work constituted by information seeking, research data organization, annotation,
                    curation, collaboration and dissemination patterns (e.g. use of devices to
                    consult research material, identification of digital methods and tools that one
                    uses, commonly accessed applications, ways of research dissemination, etc.).
                    While eight of them invited researchers to provide some biographical
                    information, which contributed to the definition and composition of community
                    members (e.g. one’s primary discipline, institutional affiliation, year in
                    research, gender, age, etc.). </p>

                    researchers who clearly identified themselves as digital humanists, but also
                    included those who were keen or interested in using digital services and tools. </p>
                <p> The analysis and interpretation of the survey results was undertaken by DiMPO
                    researchers who provided country-based reports of statistically-significant
                    results. This article is the presentation of the Lithuanian results on scholarly
                    work and the employment of digital methods and tools by the national digital
                    humanities community, conducted as part of this broader research. It seeks to
                    present the national position towards digital humanities and to provide insights
                    on the existing research community that is engaged or interested in using
                    various digital tools in scholarly work, based on the evident statistical
                    results, which has never been collected to systematically approach the issue
                    related to national information practice, even though the digitization of
                    cultural heritage and the creation of digital research data along with
                    digitally-enabled scholarly work has been going on in Lithuania for more than 20
                    years. The first study designed to analyze the effect of digital technologies
                    was done in 2003 in the area of archaeology and underlined an existing necessity
                    indicated by the majority of archaeologists to use digital data in research,
                    which was mainly driven by personal research interests <ptr
                        target="#laužikas2006"/>. Significant drawbacks at the moment were
                    associated with obsolete software, lack of digitized research data and low level
                    of standardization in the area of digital archaeology <ptr
                        target="#laužikas2006"/>. Another study more broadly related to the
                    development of national digital humanities infrastructure was carried out by the
                    Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University <ptr target="#laužikas2012"/>. It
                    attempted to provide an overview and analysis situation regarding the
                    digitization of cultural heritage and research data in relation to existing
                    national information infrastructures. The analysis showed the creation and
                    development of the Lithuanian digital research infrastructure would be greatly
                    influenced by institutional, technological and function distribution factors,
                    and less so by legal and administrative factors, while the influence of economic
                    and social factors would be the least important <ptr target="#laužikas2012"/>.
                    However, the research did not include any analysis of scholarly activity and did
                    not seek to capture the needs of researchers working in the area of digital
                    humanities. Another similar study done in 2014 focused on the strategic
                    management of heritage digitization in Lithuania and sought to develop a
                    conceptual approach towards digital cultural heritage presenting it in a

                    </cit>. The issue of the study was on heritage digitization, which was carried
                    out without fully evaluating the social context and consolidating resources,
                    thus resulting in poor quality digitization products, which were unrelated and
                    satisfied the needs of institutions rather than of the users <ptr
                        target="#laužikas2014"/>. Additionally, periodic statistical studies of the
                    Lithuanian scientific and scholarly institutions and research communities are
                    carried out providing important evidence-based data on the current national
                    research situation and statistical trends. Two of them, conducted within the
                    time span of the survey, are considered relevant for this publication to provide
                    insights on the quantitative aspects of human sciences in Lithuania <ptr

                    <ptr target="#pauliukaitė-gečienė2016"/>. However, it is important to note that
                    none of these studies had properly assessed the prevalence of digital
                    technologies across all humanities disciplines and the impact of digital
                    research at national, nevertheless international, scales. The DARIAH European
                    survey on scholarly practices and digital needs in the arts and humanities
                    disseminated at the national level was the first attempt to fill the gap in
                    information practices and information behaviour research by comprehensively
                    identifying and analyzing scholarly activities in the digital environment
                    carried out by Lithuanian scholars. Furthermore, it was the first assay to
                    compare the national phenomena with the European dimensions, thus providing an
                    international context to the Lithuanian case study and seeing it as an integral
                    part of the European digital humanities community. </p>
                <p> A purposive sampling process was adopted during the recruitment of the
                    Lithuanian respondents. The invitations to participate in the survey were sent
                    to eight accredited universities<note> Kaunas University of Technology, Klaipėda

                    </note> that conduct research in the arts and humanities or are engaged in
                    digitization activities and digital cultural heritage projects. Professional
                    associations or societies, such as librarians, museum professionals, archivists,
                    archaeologists, historians, etc., were also addressed. Thus the survey was
                    designed to focus on defining a broader community of digitally-enabled
                    researchers. The survey was disseminated as DARIAH digital humanities survey and
                    explicitly invited scholars working in the field of digital humanities and arts,
                    as well as scholars working in the area of digitization and also with digital
                    technologies to respond. Therefore, the assumption was made that all 137
                    respondents should be considered to be a part of the national community of
                    digital humanities, though the proficiency to adopt digital technologies may
                    vary among community members. Based on the survey results, this assumption later
                    on led to the distinction of <q>digitally-enabled humanists</q> and
                        <q>digitally-aware humanists</q>, both considered to be relevant to a
                    current state and development of the national digital humanities research
                    community. The study draws attention to scholars and actual scholarly work that
                    happens not only in digitization projects or within digital infrastructure, but
                    also very much depends on one’s personal attitudes and needs, thus contributing
                    to a better understanding of the national state of art digital research

                <head>2. Defining the community of Lithuanian digital humanists</head>
                <p> The overall community of Lithuanian humanists working in higher education
                    consists of 1108 members <ptr target="#pauliukaitė-gečienė2016"/>. The survey
                    sample consisted of 137 complete responses coming from the Lithuanian digital
                    humanists thus representing 12,4% of the total scholarly population. Two key
                    indicators, gender and age, were used to define basic demographic aspects of
                    respondents. The former indicated that the majority of researchers working in
                    the arts and humanities field are female (60,6%), while male researchers
                    constitute 39,4% of the community (see <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>).
                    The ratio of male to female digital humanities scholars is consistent with the
                    general characteristics of the Lithuanian scientific community. As indicated in
                    the <title rend="quotes">Report of the Lithuanian science state</title>
                    <ptr target="#bumelis2014"/> the ratio of female researchers has been
                    consistently increasing over the last decade and it is one of the highest in the
                    European Union countries exceeding an estimated EU average by 20%. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> According to the age indicator, middle-aged respondents between 36 and 50 years
                    form the largest age group in the sample (53,3%) (see <ref target="#figure04"
                        >Figure 4</ref>). This suggests that the Lithuanian research community in
                    digital humanities is of more mature age while compared to the general
                    scientific community in Lithuania, where the majority of researchers working in
                    the area of higher education are from 25 to 35 years old <ptr
                        target="#bumelis2014"/>. The latter age group of young researchers
                    constitutes 27% of the national digital humanities community. Other age groups
                    are represented in the sample by smaller proportions: senior researchers from 51
                    to 65 years old form 14,6% of the community, while 3,6% of the respondents are
                    young adults from 18 to 25 years old, and 1,5% are scholars over 65 years (see

                    considered in the survey. Most respondents (57,7%) confirmed being experienced
                    researchers working for more than 10 years in research, which complies well with
                    the age representation in the community. Another large group, represented by
                    29,9% of the respondents, have been engaged in research from 3 to 10 years. 8,8%
                    of the respondents have worked as researchers for 1 to 3 years and only 3,6% of
                    the respondents have worked as researchers for less than a year (see <ref
                        target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>). </p>

                </figure>
                <p> In tandem with age and years spent in research, most of the respondents
                    respectively defined their professional status as either senior researchers,
                    e.g. full or associate professors (36,6%), or assistant professors and lecturers
                    (36,4%). PhD students are also represented in the Lithuanian sample by 15,2%,
                    while master’s students, junior or contract-based, independent and post-doctoral
                    researchers are represented in the sample by very small proportions (see <ref
                        target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>). The latter composition suggests that the
                    community of professionally employed digitally-aware humanities researchers in
                    Lithuania mainly consists of experienced researchers usually having tenured or
                    tenure-track academic status, whilst there is very low representation of
                    starting researchers holding sessional (adjunct) lecturer or post-doctoral
                    positions. It also indicates that contract-based academic workers are offered
                    inadequate opportunities to conduct research in this area. </p>

                <p> The majority of researchers (79,4%) are attached to universities, while only
                    14,5% of them work at research centres. Very few respondents are associated with
                    a government department (2,3%), a private company (1,5%) or are independent
                    researchers not attached to any institution (2,3%) (see <ref target="#figure06"
                        >Figure 6</ref>). The institutional affiliation suggests that much of
                    digital research is done by academic community with universities being main
                    facilitators of digital humanities, while other organizations or independent
                    researchers may find less possibilities to conduct digital research projects. </p>

                <p> The survey showed a heterogeneous representation of disciplines, as indicated by
                    Lithuanian digital humanities researchers. However, history is the most
                    frequently represented discipline within Lithuanian digital humanities (21,2%),
                    followed by linguistics and archaeology, which are equally represented by 16,8%
                    of respondents (see <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>). Furthermore, art,
                    history of art or visual studies is practiced by 13,3% of researchers, while
                    8,9% of respondents represent language and literature-related disciplines.
                    Traditionally, a significant leaning towards text-based disciplines, such as
                    history, linguistics and literature, is very common in digital humanities, while
                    the relation with archaeology is more complex even though archaeology havs been
                    at the forefront of using ICT methods and tools <ptr target="#huggett2012"/>.
                    The national composition of digital humanities disciplines complies with general
                    trends and concurrently reveals the importance of applied research, especially
                    in the field of archaeology, where its relation with digital humanities is
                    difficult to track. </p>
                <p> Other digital humanities related disciplines identified by respondents in the
                    sample are classics, anthropology or ethnology, museum studies, ethnic, gender
                    or cultural studies, philosophy and medieval studies, all together forming up to
                    no more than 18% percent of the sample (see <ref target="#figure07">Figure
                        7</ref>). 5,3% of respondents specified a discipline not mentioned in the
                    list. Some specifically mentioned disciplines not in the original questionnaire
                    are education, and music semiotics. Other scholars emphasized their engagement
                    in cross-disciplinary research. It is also important to note that some
                    disciplines presented in the survey, such as drama, theatre, or performance
                    studies music, theology or religious studies and folklore, remain missing among
                    national responses. </p>

                        Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Switzerland.</note>
                    suggests that both scholarly communities are similar in terms of gender, age and
                    professional status <ptr target="#dallas2017"/>. It indicates that both
                    communities consist of a greater number of female researchers, which is higher
                    by 21,2% in Lithuania and 13,1% in Europe. It also shows that the larger part of
                    digital humanists (53,3% in Lithuania and 39,5% in Europe) belong to the
                    middle-age (36-50 years) group. Moreover, a greater majority of scholars (57,7%
                    in Lithuania and 49,9% in Europe) are experienced researchers having more than
                    10 years of research experience. Universities are the main facilitators of
                    digital research in Europe (66,50%) and even more so in Lithuania (79,4%).
                    However, there is a greater proportion of research centers (24,30%) involved in
                    European digital research, while in Lithuania only 14,50% of scholars reported
                    being attached to a research center. </p>

                <head>3. Use of digital media in scholarly work</head>
                <p> The application of digital methods and the use of digital technologies in
                    research are the main indicators confirming the presence of digital humanities.
                    One of the goals of the survey was to measure to what extent digital media is
                    actually used in scholarly work, by asking the respondents to indicate whether
                    they use or are interested in using digital media for their research. The
                    interpretation of the responses in the Lithuanian context becomes even more
                    important as there is neither an explicit definition of the national digital
                    humanities, nor a well-established digital humanities research community
                    supporting the field. Moreover, the digitization of heritage and scientific data
                    in Lithuania faces major challenges, such as decentralization of national
                    digitization activities, low level of standardization, weak interinstitutional
                    cooperation and the lack of interoperability between different research
                    infrastructures <ptr target="#laužikas2012"/>. Therefore, tracing the actual use
                    of digital media is an important task, showcasing the prevalence of the national
                    digital humanities field and the persistence of existing digital practices in
                    scholarly research. As shown by the survey data the Lithuanian community of
                    digital humanists involves not only advanced digital researchers or steady
                    digital methods and tools users, but also includes intermediate users and
                    digitally aware scholars. The great majority (89,1%) of scholars who responded
                    to the survey indicated that digital technologies are very relevant in their
                    work (see <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>). Herewith the majority of the
                    community represented by 58,4% of respondents are advanced digital humanists,
                    who acknowledged regular use of digital methods and tools in research (see <ref
                        target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>). 30,7% of respondents noted that they are
                    interested in using digital methods or tools representing a substantial
                    proportion of digitally-enabled or highly digitally-aware humanists, who are
                    likely to become more persistent digital humanities researchers in the near
                    future (see <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>). On the other hand, 10,9% of
                    scholars said that they neither use, nor are interested in using digital methods
                    or tools. The latter group of reluctant scholars cannot be determined by any
                    particular characteristic in relation to respondents age, research discipline,
                    etc. Thus it should be associated with lack of motivation to use digital
                    technologies, which could be caused by different reasons. A recent study of
                    digital humanities users <ptr target="#warwick2012"/> points out that humanities
                    scholars could be very easily deterred from using digital infrastructures for
                    numerous factors, including technical problems, complicated interfaces, poor
                    quality of resources, incomplete content, etc. To learn new skills in order to
                    deal with technological complexities requires persistent and highly motivated
                    users, who appear to be only a few <ptr target="#warwick2012"/>. While
                    institutional decentralization is defined as the main existing problem in the
                    Lithuanian arts and humanities <ptr target="#laužikas2012"/> it also could
                    explain the lack of interest in using digital technologies. Separate
                    institutions relying on individual digitization projects usually are not able to
                    accumulate enough financial or technological resources to develop highly usable
                    digital products, as well as to digitize vast collections or data sets that
                    could face the needs of all scholars working in the field. On the other hand,
                    the willingness of <soCalled>digitally-reluctant scholars</soCalled> to
                    participate in the digital humanities survey also reveals a certain concern
                    about digital humanities expressed by participants. 10,9% of theresearch
                    community may also represent a significant proportion of digitally-aware
                    humanists, who currently monitor digital research developments and may become
                    potential users of digital infrastructures in the future. </p>

                <p> The frequency of using particular devices to consult research material strongly
                    relates to the type of material being accessed. E-publishing and online access
                    to journals and books expands the research possibilities for scholars, and has
                    many advantages in scope and speed over printed material. Most importantly, it
                    welcomes new means of communication by incorporating multimedia, hypermedia or
                    interactivity into published scholarly work. Scholarly journal publication is
                    shifting rapidly towards electronic formats, even if it has not yet benefited in
                    ways that online publishing in the hard and natural sciences has <ptr
                        target="#borgman2009"/>. Respondents confirmed that articles in scholarly
                    journals or conference proceedings are very much preferred in their digital form
                    (94,2%) rather than print (30,7%). Furthermore, the vast majority of respondents
                    mentioned videos (88,3%), images (86,1%), maps and audio (both 81,8%) as kinds
                    of resources very often accessed digitally through PCs or laptops, and more than
                    half of the researchers stated that they use a desktop or laptop PC to read
                    books (67,2%) or to view archival holdings (65%) (see <ref target="#figure09"
                        >Figure 9</ref>). </p>

                </figure>
                <p> It also emerges from the survey that mobile devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones,
                    etc.) are increasingly used in research as well, even if not as widely as
                    desktop and laptop computers. The most common kinds of research materials
                    accessed by mobile device are maps (24,1%), audio resources (22,6%), video files
                    and images (both 21,2%) (see <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>). All
                    mentioned types of material tend to converge in the use of multimedia
                    technologies, with mobile devices seeming to be more suitable for this purpose. </p>
                <p> On the other hand, print or analogue access to research materials is still
                    widely adopted by Lithuanian scholars. Books are most often used in print form
                    (64,2%), as well as archival holdings, which are quite commonly (46,7%) studied
                    by using some non-digital device or form. 30,7% scholars read printed scholarly
                    articles and 21,2% view paper maps (see <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>). </p>
                <p> The comparison between use of digital media and printed or analogue media shows
                    that digital devices are of greater use in all cases. However, to consult books
                    and archival holdings in print form or on an analogue device is still a common
                    practice among researchers. On the other hand, articles in scholarly journals or
                    conference proceedings are becoming far less commonly accessed in their printed
                    form, while images, maps, video and audio are mainly consulted in some digital
                    form and very rarely in printed or analogue form. The latter, and especially
                    video and audio resources, are also more likely to be consulted on mobile
                    devices, such as tablets and smartphones, even if these devices in general are
                    not as widely used as desktop and laptop computers. The greater use of mobile
                    devices to view maps, as well as audio and video material goes in line with the
                    most recent tendency to adopt these kinds of resources in interactive cultural
                    heritage representations by using new media and GPS based mobile applications.
                    It also relates with an emerging interest in mobile learning that has been

                <p> The overall usage of desktop or laptop PC in scholarly work is considered to be
                    a primary mean to consult research material among Lithuanian digital humanists,
                    which tallies a broader European digital humanities practice (see <ref

                    cases PCs are more preferred than printed or analogue devices showing a well
                    balanced practice in using digital (67,2%) and printed (64,2%) books.
                    Furthermore, as shown in <ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref>, the use of
                    printed or analogue devices is overall greater among European scholars when
                    compared to Lithuanian digital humanists. The latter far less relies on printed
                    or analogue devices, especially when handling images, video and audio material,
                    while European scholars tend to use non-digital material alongside digital

                    as searching, collecting, reading, writing, collaborating, etc. <ptr

                    <ptr target="#benardou2013"/>. In the survey, the respondents were presented
                    with five major activities, or processes, representing different stages of the
                    research cycle, such as: 1) discovery, collection and creation of research
                    assets; 2) organization, structuration and management; 3) annotation, enrichment
                    and curation; 4) processing, analysis and visualization; 5) publishing,
                    dissemination and communication, and were asked to identify on which stage they
                    usually employ digital methods and tools. As shown in <ref target="#figure12"
                        >Figure 12</ref>, all five suggested activities, connected with successive
                    stages of the scholarly research process, are relevant to researchers. The
                    initial research stage shows the highest level of digital methods and tools
                    application. Indeed, the most frequent purpose of using digital methods or tools
                    cited by researchers was to discover, collect or create their research assets
                    (83,9%). Also organizing, the following stage of structuring or managing
                    research data (76,6%), as well as processing, analyzing or visualizing research
                    assets (the penultimate stage of scholarly research), were also very frequently
                    mentioned as a purpose of using digital technologies (75,2%). Less frequent use
                    of digital methods or tools is reported with regard to the middle stage (i.e.
                    annotate, enrich or curate their research assets) and the last stage (i.e.
                    publishing, disseminating or communicating about one’s research) of the
                    scholarly research process. However, it should be noted that over half of the
                    respondents reported that they use digital methods or tools for all stages of
                    the research process. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> The respondents who stated that they already use digital methods and tools were
                    also asked to specify which particular methods or tools they use. This open
                    question allowed us to gain deeper insight in how researchers perceive the use
                    of digital methods and tools, as well as to indicate the most popular of
                    preferred digital methods and tools selected by researchers among broader
                    possibilities. Responses were categorized into five groups, according to the
                    explicit scholarly research processes related to them. Since responses comprise
                    a mix of methods, or recurrent activities, and examples of applications
                    mentioned together, they were separated into two groups where activities were
                    matched with applications. The findings presented below aim to represent
                    particular cases and provide grounded examples of individual research activities
                    or digital methods that are relevant to research, as well as to name specific
                    applications or tools used by digitally-aware Lithuanian humanities scholars.
                    Some cases also take into account the frequency of occurrence of a specific
                    response. </p>

                    <head>4. 1. Discovering, collecting or creating research assets</head>
                    <p> In order to discover and collect research assets, specific respondents
                        stated that they access digital repositories, library catalogues or
                        electronic text corpora covering national and international digital
                        resources. Listed examples include well-known online repositories for

                    <p> It is no accident that web search (e.g. Google or Yahoo) and academic search
                        engines (e.g. Google Books and Google Scholar) are widely used to discover
                        resources on the Internet as more books, journals or other research material
                        are digitized and could be readily accessed online. The use of web search
                        engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo) is the most popular among researchers as
                        75,2% of them indicated using them very often or often (19%) (see <ref
                            target="#figure13">Figure 13</ref>). Just 5,1% of respondents said that
                        they seldom use them, while 0,7% don’t use them at all. Approximately one
                        out of two (49,6%) researchers stated very often using academic search
                        engines (e.g. Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, etc.), while 27,7%
                        report using them often (see <ref target="#figure13">Figure 13</ref>). Fewer
                        respondents could be defined as occasional users (15,3%) or non-users (7,3%) </p>
                    <p> Online library catalogues are also very often or often used by the great
                        majority of researchers (82,8%). Only 17,2% of researchers said that they
                        seldom use them, and none of them indicated that they have never used an
                        online library catalogue. </p>
                    <p> Digital archives, digital collections or data repositories are used
                        frequently by researchers, though slightly to a lesser extent than online
                        library catalogues. 37,7% of the respondents use digital archives very often
                        and 32,3% often (see <ref target="#figure13">Figure 13</ref>). 23,3% of them
                        stated that they seldom use digital archives, digital collections or data
                        repositories and 6,8% indicated they never use them. </p>
                    <p> Very similarly, online journals (e.g. JSTOR, Emerald, Springer, etc.) are
                        used indicating that 37,9% of scholars use them very often and 31,8% often
                        (see <ref target="#figure13">Figure 13</ref>). 26,5% noted that they seldom
                        access online journals and 3,8% stated never. </p>
                    <p> Finally, social media sites seem not to be used by 52,2% of the respondents
                        to discover research assets. 35,1% stated that they seldom use them, while
                        8,2% use them often, and only 4,5% said that they use social media sites for
                        research purposes very often (see <ref target="#figure13">Figure 13</ref>). </p>

                    <p> Another set of questions relevant to the discovery and collection of the
                        research assets was oriented towards common scholarly activities performed
                        during the research process, i.e.: a) visiting historical archives, special
                        collections or museums; b) seeking information or advice from archivists,
                        subject librarians or collection curators; and c) accessing primary sources
                        outside one’s country of residence (see <ref target="#figure14">Figure
                            14</ref>). The frequency of performing these activities was measured as
                        an important aspect for its prevalence. </p>
                    <p> 16% of the respondents stated that they very often or often (26,5%) visit
                        historical archives, special collections or museums, while 41,2% stated that
                        they visit them seldomly (see <ref target="#figure14">Figure 14</ref>).
                        16,2% of researchers never visit museums or archives during their research.
                        Besides, assistance from an archivist, librarian or collection curator is
                        not considered crucial in the information seeking process as usually only
                        one of three researchers requests it (see <ref target="#figure14">Figure
                            14</ref>). Half of researchers (51,9%) rarely seek information or advice
                        from professional assistants, while 20,7% of scholars never need it. </p>
                    <p> National and international sources are equally important to Lithuanian
                        scholars for the discovery and collection of their research assets. Almost
                        half of them indicated that they access primary sources outside their
                        country of residence very often (11,1%) or often (37,8%) (see <ref
                            target="#figure14">Figure 14</ref>). 40,7% of the respondents said that
                        they seldom access primary sources outside their country of residence, while
                        10,4% rely only on national sources of information. </p>

                        scanning and GPS based methods (see <ref target="#table01">Table 1</ref>).
                        The most common tools used in these activities are digital cameras,
                        dictaphones, scanners, GPS receivers, etc. Respondents also indicated using
                        computer-assisted web interviewing as an online research method for data

                    <p> There is a variety of online and offline computer programs that could be
                        used to organize, structure or manage research data. The most widespread
                        among Lithuanian digital humanists are offline tools, such as a word
                        processor (98,5%) or spreadsheet application (75,9%) (see <ref
                            target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref>). MS Excel or MS Office programs are
                        among specifically named offline tools used for systematization of research
                        assets (see <ref target="#table02">Table 2</ref>). The latter are the most
                        popular data management tools that have been increasingly used by Lithuanian
                        researchers for over a decade <ptr target="#laužikas2006"/>. </p>

                    <p> The majority of the digital research community (73%) uses databases (see
                            <ref target="#figure16">Figure 16</ref>) and almost one-third (27%) of
                        it a database management system to organize, structure or manage research
                        assets (see <ref target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref>). When using databases,
                        researchers tend to choose personal databases (31,4%) over institutional
                        databases (10,2%). However, using both personal and institutional databases
                        is also a common practice, as one out of every three (31,4%) researchers
                        indicated (see <ref target="#figure16">Figure 16</ref>). </p>
                    <figure xml:id="figure16">

                    </figure>
                    <p> A few more specific examples of software allowing management of digital
                        resources in the database were named by respondents: Microsoft Access,
                        WinBasp and ArcGIS (see <ref target="#table02">Table 2</ref>). While MS
                        Access is a very versatile software and can be applied in different areas,
                        WinBasp and ArcGIS are software packages focused exclusively on
                        archaeological research. </p>
                    <p> The researchers who indicated they use databases were also asked to state
                        what kind of content is stored in their databases, among the following
                        options: a) characteristics (attributes) of data or sources, b) textual
                        descriptions or commentaries, c) photographs or scanned images, d)
                        transcripts, e) maps, f) audio recordings, g) videos, and h) 3D models (see
                            <ref target="#figure17">Figure 17</ref>). As indicated by survey
                        results, research databases used by digitally-aware Lithuanian humanists
                        most often contain textual descriptions or commentaries (86,6%), and
                        characteristics or attributes of their data or sources (84,4%). They are
                        also frequently used to store and manage photographs or scanned images
                        (74,7%), as well as transcripts (69,6%). To a lesser extent, they are used
                        to store maps (48,3%), audio (32,6%) or video recordings (32,6%). The least
                        common kind of content in humanities research databases is 3D models (20,5%) </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p> Additionally, researchers were also asked if they use keyword lists or
                        thesauri to organize research assets. Overall, researchers seem to use their
                        own keyword lists or thesauri to the same extent as standard ones, though a
                        personal keyword list is slightly more preferable for usage (see <ref
                            target="#figure18">Figure 18</ref>). 41,2% of researchers are frequent
                        users of personal keywords and 35,4% use standard keyword lists or thesauri.
                        However, one of three researchers report that they seldom, or never use
                        standard or personal keyword lists or thesauri (see <ref target="#figure18"
                            >Figure 18</ref>). The latter fact relates to an indicated low level of
                        standardization and lack of strategic reglementation in national research
                        infrastructures dealing with scholarly data <ptr target="#laužikas2012"/>.
                        On the other hand, a considerable number of reported use of thesauri or
                        standard keyword lists could be associated with digital heritage research.
                        Cultural heritage sector had adopted a national digitization strategy, which
                        ensures more advanced development and application of standards in
                        digitization activities <ptr target="#laužikas2012"/>. </p>

                    <p> Other less common applications for research data management include
                        note-taking programs and web-based content management systems (see <ref
                            target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref>). Only 15,3% of researchers tend to
                        take notes digitally by using reference management software, such as Endnote
                        or Zotero (see <ref target="#table02">Table 2</ref>). Cloud storage systems,
                        services and platforms were also mentioned as being used, but only 10,9% of
                        digital humanists mentioned using web-based applications (see <ref
                            target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref>). Wordpress software was mentioned as
                        one of the examples of online content management (see <ref target="#table02"
                            >Table 2</ref>). </p>
                    <p> Finally, it is important to note that not all work done by digital humanists
                        entirely rely on digital technologies. 43,80% of respondents mentioned using
                        some non-digital method to organize research assets (see <ref
                            target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref>). </p>

                    <p> The survey data revealed little about scholarly practices concerning
                        annotation, enrichment and curation of the research assets. These activities
                        also represent a middle stage of the scholarly work lifecycle, which is the
                        least exposed to digital technology, as only half (56,90%) of researchers
                        reported using digital methods and tools in this stage (see <ref
                            target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>). Only a few mentioned examples
                        showcase scholarly activities, methods and tools used for these purposes
                        (see <ref target="#table03">Table 3</ref>). The respondents state that they
                        use citation programs, such as EndNote and Zotero, to manage bibliographies
                        and references. Sometimes scholars also choose to manage their own citations
                        in order to measure research impact by using <soCalled>Publish or
                            Perish</soCalled>. </p>

                    <p> However, using a note-taking application is not very common practice among
                        Lithuanian digital humanists as only 15,30% of respondents indicated using
                        it (see <ref target="#figure15">Figure 15</ref> above). The same applies to
                        using a bibliographic management application whereas it is very often used
                        by 7,5% and often used by 9% of scholars. One of five respondents (19,5%)
                        use it seldom and the majority of respondents (63,9%) never use such an
                        application to manage citations (see <ref target="#figure19">Figure
                        19</ref>). </p>

                    <p> A wide range of activities and tools were identified by researchers when
                        trying to describe digital practices linked with data processing, analysis
                        and visualization. Mentioned examples mainly concentrated on data analysis
                        where the choice for the particular digital method or tool depends on
                        specific data that is relevant to respondents’ research field, e.g. for
                        archaeological data analysis ArcGIS, ArcMap and WinBasp tools are used,
                        linguistic analysis uses tools provided by AntConc and WordSmith software,
                        and social network analysis is often implemented with Gephi software (see
                            <ref target="#table04">Table 4</ref>). On the other hand, many digital
                        methods and tools are versatile and spread across different digital
                        humanities disciplines. Such examples include qualitative, quantitative,
                        comparative, computational, statistical, web analysis, etc. and a list of
                        appropriate tools that allow to process data, e.g. MS Excel, MS Word,
                        Loglet, Mathcad, HAMLET, MAXQDA, PSPP, SPSS, OriginLab, Google Analytics,
                        etc. (see <ref target="#table04">Table 4</ref>). Other activities to process
                        research data include programming, transcribing, audio and video editing.
                        Some of them also mention tools used for these purposes, e.g. online
                        keyboard TypeIt for phonetic transcription or Adobe Premiere Pro and
                        Videopad software – for video editing (see <ref target="#table04">Table
                            4</ref>). The visualization of data, including drawing and 3D
                        visualization, is another important activity mentioned by researchers. The
                        most common image processing tools are Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop,
                        CorelDRAW and AutoCAD (see <ref target="#table04">Table 4</ref>). </p>

                    <p> With reference to the scholarly research cycle, 59,10% of digital humanists
                        use digital methods and tools that enable research publication,
                        dissemination or communication (see <ref target="#figure12">Figure 12</ref>
                        above). Mentioned examples of activities are lecturing, presenting,
                        collaborative learning, online dissemination, blogging and social networking
                        (see <ref target="#table05">Table 5</ref>). Tools contributing to these
                        activities include Microsoft Powerpoint used for lecturing or presenting and
                        online tools, such as WordPress for blogging and social network sites, such
                        as Facebook or Academia.edu, in supporting online communication and
                        dissemination (see <ref target="#table05">Table 5</ref>). </p>

                    <p> The dissemination of scholarly work could be done by using different means,
                        e.g. an institutional repository or portal, an open content journal, one’s
                        own website or blog and social media sites. A distinction between the latter
                        was made having in mind an existing diversity of social media sites where
                        dissemination is done through different ways or different kinds of content.
                        Also, not all social media tools could be used to the same extent.
                        Respectively a few options were suggested to respondents in order to avoid
                        overgeneralization of social media tools. Proposed options include scholarly
                        community sites (e. g. academia.edu, ResearchGate) (1), generic online
                        content communities (e. g. Slideshare, Flickr, Youtube) (2) and social
                        networks (e. g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+) (3). An important aspect of
                        collaboration in the digital humanities community is the shift over the last
                        two decades from a focus on the audience to participation that includes
                        scholars, students and the general public <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>. Many
                        scholars are familiar with Web 2.0 tools and social media possibilities
                        allowing to be engaged in more profound scholarly communication and perform
                        miscellaneous participatory activities. The use of these technologies is an
                        important indicator showcasing the change of information behavior in the
                        context of scholarly communication. </p>
                    <p> However, even with an existence of a variety of options provided by digital
                        technologies and Web 2.0 tools, researchers still prefer more traditional
                        means to disseminate their research results. The survey revealed that the
                        dissemination of scholarly work in Lithuania is mostly done through an open
                        content journal or publication (see <ref target="#figure20">Figure
                        20</ref>). 30,1% of the respondents use it very often and 36,8% of them
                        often. 23,5% of researchers indicated using it seldom, while 9,6% of them
                        stated they never used such means of dissemination. </p>
                    <p> Using the portal or repository of their institution is the second most used
                        mean of dissemination (see <ref target="#figure20">Figure 20</ref>). 12,5%
                        of the Lithuanian researchers reported using it very often, while 34,4% use
                        it often. On the other hand, the activity is seldom performed by 32,8% of
                        the respondents and never performed by 20,3% of them. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p> The survey indicated that digital humanists in Lithuania are still not
                        steady users of social media. Dissemination through a scholarly community
                        site seems to be seldom amongst Lithuanian researchers in the humanities
                        (see <ref target="#figure20">Figure 20</ref>). Scholarly community sites
                        (e.g. academia.edu, ResearcGate, etc.) are the most popular type of social
                        media used in research dissemination, followed by social networks (e.g.
                        Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.). 11,6% of respondents are very frequent
                        and 14% frequent users of online academic communities, while social networks
                        are very frequently used by only 3,9% and frequently by 10,2% of
                        researchers. One out of four (24%) researchers are occasional users of
                        online scholarly communities and one out of five (19,7%) of social networks.
                        However, the majority of researchers never use scholarly communities (50,4%)
                        or social networks (66,1%) to promote research. </p>
                    <p> Blogs or personal websites are even less preferred in scholarly
                        communication activities, while generic content communities are the least
                        preferable mean of scholarly communication. Only 3,1% of respondents very
                        often and 11% often use one’s web site or blog, while content communities
                        are accessed very often only by 2,4% and often by 1,6% of researchers. 10,2%
                        of researchers rarely use blog sites, while 15,1% seldom share content
                        through generic online communities. The vast majority of scholars report
                        never using one’s web site or blog (75,6%) or generic online content
                        community (81%) to disseminate research work (see <ref target="#figure20"
                            >Figure 20</ref>). </p>
                    <p> Overall, the use of social media for dissemination purposes seems to be low
                        in the national digital humanities as researchers prefer more formal ways of
                        dissemination, such as journals or institutional portals. Social media usage
                        patterns demonstrate a slow shift towards participatory and more
                        collaborative scholarly communication, but do not indicate a breakthrough
                        point in the community. Usually researchers with adequate Web/Web 2.0 skills
                        have a greater variety of information practices, more choices for multi
                        communication, and more tools in social media <ptr target="#gu2011"/>. Thus
                        a wider application of Web 2.0 technologies in national digital humanities
                        may be expected in the future, when researchers will develop a specific set
                        of skills and a certain level of confidence in using them. </p>
                    <p> Additionally, related questions were asked to gain deeper insight about
                        digital publishing, communication and dissemination practices carried out by
                        Lithuanian digital humanists. Researchers were asked to indicate their
                        publishing preferences regarding scholarly work. Publishing in their native
                        language is the priority for Lithuanian researchers as it is done by the
                        majority (79,5%) of them. English is the most preferred second language for
                        publishing research work as 19% of scholars stated they primarily publish in
                        English. Only 1% primarily publish in some other language (see <ref
                            target="#figure21">Figure 21</ref>). The major preference for publishing
                        in national language and relatively low proportions of other languages used
                        in scholarly publishing suggest that international cooperation and
                        collaboration between researchers in digital humanities is inadequate. </p>
                    <figure xml:id="figure21">

                    </figure>
                    <p> Collaboration is one of the most important aspects relevant to the current
                        state of digital humanities. It is known that traditional humanities still
                        obtains an image of the <soCalled>lone scholar</soCalled>, while digital
                        humanities are becoming more collaborative <ptr target="#borgman2009"/>.
                        Collaboration is an effective way to produce new knowledge and could be
                        easily and effectively done in a digital environment. Some of the Lithuanian
                        scholars mentioned collaborative learning as part of their scholarly
                        activities (see <ref target="#table05">Table 5</ref> above). Respondents
                        were also asked to state how often they collaborate with others on research
                        projects. It seems that collaboration is quite common research practice
                        among Lithuanian scholars as 24,1% do it very often and 46,6% often
                        collaborate with others (see <ref target="#figure22">Figure 22</ref>). 24,8%
                        of respondents stated that they collaborate seldom and only 4,5% said they
                        never collaborate with others on a research project. The results of the
                        survey appear to contradict the conclusion presented in the <title

                            target="#bumelis2014"/>. However, as noted by the report authors
                        themselves, the estimations were made according to the index of co-authored
                        publications, which deals with an objective and easily measured data, but it
                        does not take into account other means of collaboration. An existing example
                        like this suggests that in some cases the impact of humanities research
                        might be nationally underestimated as present strategies on evaluating
                        scholarly research might be questionable. </p>

                    <p> The comparison of latter activity at European and national levels revealed
                        that European scholars generally are more keen to use innovative
                        dissemination tools, e.g. blogs, online communities and social networks,
                        (see <ref target="#figure24">Figure 24</ref>) which leads to overall greater
                        application of digital tools during the last stage of the research cycle

                        tools for dissemination (see <ref target="#figure24">Figure 24</ref>). Also,
                        certain kinds of tools (e.g. blogs and personal websites) in this case are
                        particularly overlooked by Lithuanian scholars (see <ref target="#figure24"

                    </figure>
                    <p> Another slight difference between national and European research communities
                        was observed during the middle stage of the research cycle encompassing
                        annotation, enrichment and curation practices <ptr target="#dallas2017"/>.
                        European respondents reported a higher percentage of using digital methods
                        and tools (65,5%) when compared to national digital humanists (56,9%) (see
                            <ref target="#figure23">Figure 23</ref>). Accordingly, note-taking
                        applications (e.g. Zotero, Endnote, etc.) as one of the main digital tools,
                        which could be used for annotation, as well as for organization of data, are
                        twice as often employed by European (33,70%) than Lithuanian (15,30%)
                        scholars (see <ref target="#figure26">Figure 26</ref>). </p>
                    <p> The use of digital methods and tools during other stages of the research
                        cycle is reported to be very similar in European and Lithuanian digital
                        humanities communities (see <ref target="#figure23">Figure 23</ref> above)
                            <ptr target="#dallas2017"/>. However, more detailed analysis of
                        particular practices revealed few important disparities that deserve closer
                        attention. One of the aspects that separates the national field of digital
                        humanities from the European dimension is the use of social media for
                        research purposes. It concerns not only dissemination or scholarly
                        communication, but also involves the discovery and collection of research
                        assets. Only 12,70% of Lithuanian digital humanists very often or often seek
                        information via social media, while almost twice as many (22,70%) scholars
                        in Europe use it for the same purpose (see <ref target="#figure25">Figure
                            25</ref>). </p>

                        spreadsheet applications along with some non-digital methods are slightly
                        more popular among Lithuanian researchers, while European scholars tend to
                        use database management systems, note-taking applications and web-based
                        content management systems slightly to a higher extent (see <ref

                <head>5. Assessing research needs</head>
                <p> Finally, in order to better understand existing scholarly requirements for
                    digital research, respondents were asked to rate the importance of a series of
                    statements regarding their research needs on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is
                    the least important and 10 is the most important. The survey revealed that all
                    available statements of needs are relevant to Lithuanian digital humanists.
                    Nevertheless, improved findability or access to existing digital research
                    resources, having an average score of 9,2, seems to be the most important
                    requirement for the majority of scholars (see <ref target="#figure27">Figure
                        27</ref>). Additionally, respondents also noted that digitization of
                    research resources (av. sc. 8,6) and improved access to digital tools and
                    software (av. sc. 8,3) are important issues for them as well (see <ref
                        target="#figure27">Figure 27</ref>). It seems that the digitization of
                    research data still remains one of the most essential requirements since 2003,
                    seeing that the absolute majority of archaeologists (93,3%) at that time
                    indicated the necessity to digitize research material <ptr
                        target="#laužikas2006"/>. The period of 2005–2009 is considered to be a
                    turning point in national cultural policy with an approval of strategic
                    documents in the area of digitization, which consolidated memory institutions
                    and fostered collaboration in national cultural heritage digitization activities
                        <ptr target="#laužikas2014"/>. In spite of the fact that there has been a
                    significant increase in quantitative digitization of cultural heritage resources
                    over the last decade, the digitization of data still remains an important matter
                    for researchers. One of the reasons leading to inefficient outcomes of digital
                    projects is the prevalence of conservative strategic management resulting in
                    poor quality digitization products, which do not satisfy users’ needs <ptr
                        target="#laužikas2014"/>. Moreover, as noted in the national case study of
                    2011 on digitization of cultural heritage and scientific data <ptr
                        target="#laužikas2012"/>, existing research infrastructures had accumulated
                    digital and digitized content with great social and cultural significance, but
                    they still require more efficient access. This could be achieved by aggregating
                    them in a single infrastructure and by developing a more consistent national
                    strategy for existing digital scholarly data <ptr target="#laužikas2012"/>.
                    Finally, it is also important to note that digitization is a continuing activity
                    evolving along with digital tools and software, which require ongoing
                    development. Therefore these requirements must always be properly considered in
                    future projects and national digitization activities. </p>
                <p> Another scholarly need listed among the key requirements is networking with
                    other researchers (av. sc. 8,3) (see <ref target="#figure27">Figure 27</ref>).
                    Networking or collaboration is one of the most important aspects of digital
                    humanities, which refers to <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="dhm#2009">iterative scholarship, mobilized
                            collaboration, and networks of research</quote>
                        <ptr target="#dhm2009"/>
                    </cit>. Rating the importance of scholarly networks revealed that Lithuanian
                    digital humanists highly regard networking, which is considered to be as
                    important as improved access to digital tools and software. </p>
                <p> Online advice and information on using digital methods and tools (av. sc. 7,2),
                    as well as technical support on digital infrastructures, tools and software (av.
                    sc. 7,1) are also considered relevant to Lithuanian digital humanists, though
                    the importance is to a lesser extent (see <ref target="#figure27">Figure
                        27</ref>). These indications suggest that Lithuanian scholars consider
                    technical support and online information to be adequate or they are quite
                    confident in their abilities to apply digital methods or tools in their
                    research. </p>
                <p> The least important needs stated by digital researchers include courses or
                    workshops on digital humanities (av. sc. 6,6) and online support from a
                    professional assistant (e.g. archivist, librarian, curator, etc.) to find online
                    material (av. sc. 6,4) (see <ref target="#figure27">Figure 27</ref>). The latter
                    indication confirms that Lithuanian scholars highly depend on their personal
                    skills to navigate the complexities of digital humanities research and do not
                    consider help <soCalled>from outside</soCalled> to be crucially important. One
                    of the reasons relates to the evolution of national digital research, which at
                    least in the field of digital archaeology was fostered by personal research
                    interests bringing up self-taught digital humanists <ptr target="#laužikas2006"
                    />. However, the qualitative development in the national digital humanities
                    greatly relies on professional competence-based training, which is pointed out
                    to be one of the priorities for the national digitization strategy in 2014–2020
                        <ptr target="#laužikas2014"/>. </p>

                    <head>Importance of needs. N=137.</head>

                </figure>
                <p> The assessment of digital research needs does not show a significant difference
                    between national and European digital humanities communities both underlying the
                    importance of improving the access to existing digital research resources, which
                    is the key concern altogether. Other important needs for both national and
                    international communities include the continuity of digitizing current
                    non-digital resources, ensuring better access to digital tools or software and
                    fostering networking among scholars and research institutions in the field of
                    digital humanities. Minor deviations between national and European level
                    researchers could be traced when other needs (e.g. online information, technical
                    or professional support, digital humanities courses and workshops) are
                    considered. In comparison, they are valued with a lower score by European
                    researchers and more appreciated by national scholars. It suggests that
                    Lithuanian digital humanists, who in many cases are self-taught and driven by
                    personal motivation, place more value on the opportunity of getting professional
                    training, as well as receiving technical support and competent assistance. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Discussion and conclusions</head>
                <p> The outcomes of the DARIAH survey on scholarly methods and tools suggest that
                    the Lithuanian digital humanities community is in many ways similar to one
                    established in Europe as they both show great similarities in research community
                    composition, as well as in patterns of using digital methods and tools during
                    the research process. There was no indication of any distinctive national
                    phenomena that would significantly contradict the usual European research
                    practice suggesting that in many ways Lithuanian digital humanities should be
                    seen as an integral part of a global practice enabled by digital technologies
                    that crosses disciplinary and geographical borders. </p>
                <p> As seen from the national response sample, which composes 12,4% of all
                    Lithuanian scholars in the humanities, digital humanists vary in their abilities
                    to effectively apply digital methods and tools in scholarly work, and most
                    probably to understand particular aspects of digital research itself. Whereas
                    the majority of the community (58,4%) are considered to be advanced digital
                    humanists, who indicated using digital methods and tools on a regular basis, a
                    substantial proportion of scholars (30,7%) should be perceived as
                    digitally-enabled humanists, who tend to declare interest in digital methods and
                    tools instead of constant usage. Furthermore, despite the fact that nowadays
                    it’s hard to imagine research work being done without the help of a computer or
                    the Internet, 10,9% of Lithuanian scholars expressed a reluctant attitude
                    towards the use of digital technologies when the option of stating <q>I neither
                        use, nor I am interested in using digital methods or tools</q> was left
                    open. While the reluctant approach may indicate main drawbacks associated with
                    digital technologies, it also may represent weak understanding and perception of
                    digital methods and tools, as well as of digital humanities. The latter group of
                    scholars represents a notable proportion of digitally-aware humanists, who admit
                    lacking knowledge about digital research and/or does not consider themselves to
                    be part of the digital humanities community, but judging by their responses to
                    other questions these researchers actually use digital methods and tools in
                    their work, though to a lesser extent. The issue of perceiving one’s identity as
                    a digital humanist is part of broader discussion focusing on existing
                    complexities related to the definition of digital humanities, which brings down
                    the typology and broadly conceived landscape of digital scholarship <ptr
                        target="#svensson2010"/>. However, these dimensions were out of the scope of
                    the DARIAH survey and remains an important task for further qualitative research
                    within the DiMPO working group. </p>
                <p> The use of digital media in scholarly research is widespread in national, as
                    well as European research communities. While a desktop or laptop PC is the
                    primary mean to consult all types of research material, mobile devices show a
                    high potential to become an alternative medium in the future, especially for
                    visual and interactive research data (e.g. video, images, maps, audio). On the
                    other hand, non-digital material and analogue devices still play and important
                    role in scholarly research as it is a common practice to use digital devices in
                    parallel with non-digital, especially in case of viewing books and archival
                    records. Generally, this tendency is relatively more explicit among European
                    digital humanists, whereas Lithuanian scholars reported being far less likely to
                    use non-digital devices, which means that there is a significant amount of
                    digitized or born-digital research data available to the national research
                    community. </p>
                <p> Digital methods and tools are used by scholars throughout the whole research
                    cycle that starts with research data collection and ends with research results
                    dissemination. However, it seems that digital methods and tools serve better in
                    particular research cycle stages, which concern discovery, organization,
                    analysis and dissemination of research data. Accordingly, a great deal of tools
                    specifically named by researchers support the latter activities, which not only
                    reveals the most common competencies and skills developed by European digital
                    humanists, but also showcase a current situation of tools available on the
                    digital research market. The main drawback in this case is digital annotation,
                    enrichment and curation tools that serve the intermediate stage of the research
                    cycle, which opens a discussion on the potential of developing more efficient
                    tools enhancing the practice. In fact, as noted by the study on scholarly
                    annotation <cit>
                        <quote source="#bradley2007" rend="inline">established Humanities Computing

                        <ptr target="#bradley2007"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p> It is important to note that the main difference between the European and
                    national scholarly communities occur in the last stage of the research cycle,
                    which concerns publishing, dissemination and communication of research results.
                    National digital humanists are less keen on using digital methods and tools, and
                    are still accustomed to long-established research dissemination practices.
                    Moreover, the use of social media for research purposes seems to be particularly
                    underestimated by Lithuanian scholars. Social media as an innovative
                    communication and dissemination tool has been increasingly employed by
                    individuals and business companies over the last decade, and the overall use of
                    social media by Lithuanian enterprises takes a median position among the
                    European Union countries <ptr target="#sms2016"/>. A national study of scholarly
                    communication facing these concerns could provide insights on the issue of
                    innovative communication and help to ensure better preservation, quality and
                    outreach of Lithuanian digital humanities research results in the future. </p>
                <p> The DARIAH survey should be seen as the first attempt to gather comprehensive
                    evidence-based results on the scholarly work done by Lithuanian digital
                    humanists, and provided accurate and measurable data to keep abreast of
                    scholarly needs and current state of the art. It also pointed out particular
                    areas of concern that may require more thorough investigation, which could be
                    done by carrying on multi-case studies or other types of qualitative research to
                    gain a proper understanding of underlying reasons, attitudes and motivations
                    concerning digital humanities research. </p>
