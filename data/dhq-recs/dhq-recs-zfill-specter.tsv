000002	2007	1.1	Jeff Howard	University of Texas, Austin	Interpretative Quests in Theory and Pedagogy	In this paper, I extend theoretical understandings of the gaming activity and literary form called the quest and its relationship to issues of interpretation, focusing primarily on game theory with concrete examples as well as some broadly applicable pedagogical uses of these ideas in literature classrooms. The argument contributes to a recent theoretical and practical discussion of quests by scholars of games studies such as Aarseth 2004, Juul 2005, Tosca 2003, and Tronstad 2001. I build upon and revise these theorists’ understandings by approaching a “quest” as a goal-oriented activity in which players undertake a journey in search of meaning. By demonstrating similarities between the literary traditions in which quests are central and the practice of digital game design, I argue that quests can be better understood theoretically and more productively used in the classroom if meaning and action are regarded as complementary design principles instead of conflicting impulses. A revised understanding of quests can help to mediate between games and narratives by showing strategies by which game designers have created meaningful action, often in ways that are either unconsciously similar to or inspired by the literary traditions of mythology, epic, and romance. Specifically, game designers can use level design to create labyrinthine spaces that encode thematic implications, in the tradition of literary allegory. If these symbolic spaces are coordinated with significant obstacles and challenges, the apparent conflict between meaning and action can be resolved through engaging gameplay that allows players to enact a range of thematic ideas, contributing to the ongoing replay value of a digital game. I also suggest ways in which this understanding of quests can allow literature teachers to plan assignments where students transform literary narratives into interpretative quests taking the form of digital games. As a paradigmatic example, I describe one such assignment, in which my students adapted episodes from Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 into design documents and prototypes, and I suggest some theoretical implications of its results for other instructors. By adapting works of literature into quests, students learn to discover and create meaning through the active exertion of cognitive and imaginative effort rather than absorbing it passively.	000486	000066	000501	000101	000360	000165	000331	000429	000085	000417	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000002/000002.html
000003	2007	1.1	Drew VandeCreek	Northern Illinois University Libraries	Webs of Significance: The Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project, New Technology, and the Democratization of History	Lincoln/Net (http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu), a product of the Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project at Northern Illinois University Libraries, represents a new type of historically oriented digital library resource. Like many other digital libraries, it contains a large amount of searchable primary source materials. Like a number of other historically oriented online resources, project staff have organized Lincoln/Net around a specific topic, in this case Abraham Lincoln’s life and times in antebellum Illinois. In addition to Lincoln’s own papers, the project’s databases contain resources shedding light on his context, including letters, diaries, and publications prepared by his peers. Unlike most historically oriented digital libraries however, the project Web site also includes a wealth of multimedia materials, including image, sound, video, and interactive map resources. But Lincoln/Net is perhaps most unique in that it furnishes its users with an extensive set of interpretive materials. This approach suggests that historians may play an expanding role in the development of digital libraries. It can also provide them with a badly-needed means of communicating with an audience beyond their own scholarly community and students. This communication can facilitate what one digital history pioneer has described as the democratization of history, as defined by an expanded user group enjoying primary source materials and using them to engage in historical thinking .	000207	000144	000086	000321	000140	000355	000428	000575	000353	000369	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000003/000003.html
000004	2007	1.1	Linda E. Patrik	Department of Philosophy, Union College	Encoding for Endangered Tibetan Texts	For over a thousand years, Tibet has preserved and translated ancient Buddhist Sutras from India, keeping the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and meditation alive long after it died out in India by the 12th Century. Recent efforts to digitize materials from this textual tradition offer opportunities to broaden the circulation of rare materials to the exiled Tibetan scholarly community, but also suggest conceptual challenges arising from the complexity of the texts and their inherently multimodal character. This paper describes the scholarly and meditative traditions from which these texts come, and discusses possible approaches to their digitization.	000071	000050	000117	000546	000247	000059	000589	000058	000175	000199	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/000004.html
000005	2007	1.1	Mark Wolff	Hartwick College	Reading Potential: The Oulipo and the Meaning of Algorithms	Recent efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers in order to broaden the appeal of humanities computing have invoked the example of the Oulipo. Although there are similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted literary analysis, the development of tools for the express purpose of encouraging scholars to play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into potentialities. For the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question of interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are better understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some objective in mind. The procedures for making sense of texts provide for their own interpretation: they are not only instruments for discovering meaning but also reflections on making meaning.	000325	000069	000378	000436	000362	000349	000457	000012	000555	000478	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000005/000005.html

000009	2007	1.2	Dennis G. Jerz	Seton Hill University	Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original Adventure in Code and in Kentucky	Because so little primary historical work has been done on the classic text computer game Colossal Cave Adventure, academic and popular references to it frequently perpetuate inaccuracies. Adventure was the first in a series of text-based games (interactive fiction) that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and story, typically in a fantasy setting; these games had a significant cultural impact in the late 1970s and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will Crowther based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an occasion for narrative encounters and as an aesthetic masterpiece of logic and utility ; however, previous attempts to assess the significance of Adventure remain incomplete without access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's original source cave. Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a backup of Woods's student account at Stanford, and documents an excursion to the real Colossal Cave in Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther, Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions. Real locations in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod and an axe head) correspond to their representation in Crowther's version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had expanded the game to include numerous locations that he invented, along with significant technical innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory). Sources that incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are sourced thinly if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during the 1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976. The original game employed magic, humor, simple combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly expanded. While Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real cave, his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to improve the gameplay.	000010	000486	000101	000135	000022	000548	000153	000501	000089	000002	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000009/000009.html
000010	2007	1.2	Eric Eve	Harris Manchester College, University of Oxford	All Hope Abandon: Biblical Text and Interactive Fiction	Among the alternative kinds of narrative opened up by computer technology, one of earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the text adventure or adventure game), which first came into being in the 1970s. Text-based interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial success in the 1980s until it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots in computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature. Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, All Hope Abandon, explores aspects of Biblical Studies through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several examples from All Hope Abandon will be given, and instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end.	000101	000009	000089	000171	000360	000429	000134	000135	000165	000548	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000010/000010.html
000011	2007	1.2	Steve F. Anderson	University of Southern California	Aporias of the Digital Avant-Garde	This article maps two divergent trajectories within a narrowly defined sphere of short-form, time-based digital media created between 1995 and 2005. These works are considered in relation to the historical avant-garde - particularly the Structural film movement of the 1960s and 70s - and analyzed as responses to a range of cultural concerns specific to the digital age. The analysis identifies movement toward two terminal points: first, a mode of remix-based montage inspired by open source programming communities and peer-to- peer networks; and second, the emergence of a mode of imaging termed the digital analogue, which foregrounds the material basis of digital production.	000099	000601	000382	000503	000276	000527	000155	000528	000207	000154	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000011/000011.html
000012	2007	1.2	David Hoover	New York University	The End of the Irrelevant Text: Electronic Texts, Linguistics, and Literary Theory	The close study of literary texts has a long and illustrious history. But the popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just at the time that widely available electronic texts were making traditional analytic tools easier to apply and encouraging the development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without claiming any simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the dominance of Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory. Certainly both an introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic approach and literary theories deeply influenced by ideas about the sign's instability and the tendency of texts to disintegrate under critical pressure minimize the importance of the text. Using examples from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a return to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what corpora, text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship attribution can reveal about meanings and style. The recent resurgence of interest in scholarly editions, corpora, text- analysis, stylistics, and authorship suggest that the electronic text may finally reach its full potential.	000171	000152	000069	000346	000181	000051	000207	000457	000150	000226	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000012/000012.html

This article is a description of an attempt to build such a program from the ground up, rather than from the top down. That is, the authors and others created a series of courses, both multi-disciplinary and disciplinary, a database, and a core course designed to make digital humanities a reality, even without having it certified as a program by the governing bodies of their faculty and university. In this article, the database and core course are described in some detail in order to offer what the authors believe to be worthwhile ideas to others who would advance the cause of digital humanities.

000019	2008	2.1	Gerhard Jan Nauta	Leiden University	As You Can See: Applying Visual Collaborative Filtering to Works of Art	Art historically relevant visual knowledge can be deconstructed and the resulting components of this visual knowledge — visual discernments — lend themselves to be socially negotiated. Individual visual experts (like connoisseurs) do not share some grand and undividable cognitive cataloguing system; they are attentive to piecemeal visual discernments and the patterns in which these occur in reality. In conventional scholarly communication sophisticated tools to discuss perceptual patterns are lacking. This paper not only proposes a theoretical model of visual knowledge accumulation, but also describes a practical implementation, Art.Similarities, which is designed as a prototype of such a sophisticated tool. Using a custom-made interface it records visual behavior: the non-verbally expressed visual similarity judgments of distributed individuals. Users can be assigned to groups according to the qualities of their judgments. These qualities may be distilled from emerging similarity patterns. The implications of individual judgments in different user groups may vary considerably. Emerging patterns can be assessed both according to human analysis and statistical procedures. Most studies on art evaluation are attentive to either the characteristics of works, or the characteristics of observers. In this study both are considered as interdependent entities consistently.	000560	000497	000363	000159	000457	000299	000265	000452	000275	000175	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/2/1/000019/000019.html

000026	2009	3.1	Bruce Robertson	Mount Allison University	Exploring Historical RDF with Heml	The Web, though full of historical information, lacks a means of organizing that information, searching on it or visualizing it. The Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (Heml) was begun six years ago to explore how disparate historical materials on the Internet can be navigated and visualized, and for the past four years has used an XML data format defined in W3C Schemas. This format aims for conforming data that can be quickly parsed but provide a variety of facets on which to search for historical materials. While the project's graphical visualizations are in some respects successful, they have revealed some deficiencies in the underlying data format: it ought to provide for nested events, it ought to represent relations of causality between events and it ought to express the varieties of scholarly opinion about the attributes of events. By encoding the Heml data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to undertake these improvements. Moreover, an RDF-encoded Heml process provides easier access to CIDOC-CRM data into Heml events. Finally, a historical RDF language would simplify the discovery of references to historical events in digitized texts, thereby automating a growing network of historical information on the Web.	000449	000475	000354	000262	000624	000206	000370	000290	000605	000328	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000026/000026.html
000027	2009	3.1	Jeffrey A. Rydberg-Cox	University of Missouri-Kansas City	Digitizing Latin Incunabula: Challenges, Methods, and Possibilities	Incunabula, or books printed before 1500, are extremely difficult and expensive to convert to digital form. The primary challenges arise from the use of non-standard typographical glyphs based on medieval handwriting to abbreviate words. Further difficulties are also posed by the practice of inconsistently marking word breaks at the end of lines and reducing or even eliminating spacing between some words. As such, these documents form a distinct genre of electronic document that poses unique challenges for conversion to digital form. From 2005–2007, the Preservation and Access Research and Development Program at the National Endowment for the Humanities funded a study to explore methods for digitizing these difficult texts. This paper describes some of the results of that project. The work described in this paper was completed by the Approaching the Problems of Digitizing Latin Incunables project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Division of Preservation and Access. The material in this paper is drawn from the project application, internal technical reports, grant project reports and the project descriptions included in and . Much of this work was inspired by Ross Scaife and his work building a corpora of Latin Colloquia. I am deeply grateful for Ross's comments, advice and support. A version of this paper will also be published as part of the project web site.	000491	000268	000346	000257	000247	000237	000457	000117	000456	000033	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000027/000027.html

000029	2009	3.1	Casey Dué | Mary Ebbott	University of Houston, Texas | College of the Holy Cross	Digital Criticism: Editorial Standards for the Homer Multitext	In this article we argue for the necessity of a digital edition to most accurately represent the textual tradition of the Homeric epics and to better understand the oral performance tradition that created the poems. We demonstrate how such a digital criticism would differ from the traditional textual criticism as practiced for editions in print and suggest how a digital criticism might open new avenues for the interpretation of the poetry. In defining our needs and goals for a digital edition, we discuss what our project has in common with other digital editions of literary works, but how the oral, traditional nature of the poetry creates special requirements as well. In addition to elaborating the editorial approach for the project, we reaffirm the principles of collaboration, international standards, and open access that we have learned from Ross Scaife, the founder of the Stoa Consortium.	000021	000154	000181	000447	000173	000382	000171	000207	000111	000150	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000029/000029.html

Many epigraphists in the last 20 years have been investigating how to use digital technology to advance their research, but until the present decade, these undertakings were restrained by aspects of the technology. The late 1990s will be seen as a watershed moment in the transition from print-based to born-digital epigraphic publication. At present, the majority of new editions are still published solely in print, but by 2017 we believe this circumstance will change drastically. The history of epigraphy makes it quite clear that such transitions are natural to the discipline.	000608	000457	000453	000109	000459	000352	000355	000241	000071	000021	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000030/000030.html

First, we hand-code default inheritance hierarchies in the KATR formalism, treating inflectional exponents as markings associated with the application of rules by which complex word forms are deduced from simpler roots or stems. The high degree of similarity among verbs of different conjugation classes allows us to formulate general rules; these general rules are, however, sometimes overridden by conjugation-specific rules. This approach allows linguists to gain an appreciation for the structure of verbs, gives teachers a foundation for organizing lessons in morphology, and provides students a technique for generating forms of any verb. Second, we start with a paradigm chart, then automatically remove common parts and redundant morphosyntactic property sets (columns), combine similar conjugations (rows), and generate the KATR theory that produces a complete table of forms for a set of lexemes. This second approach automatically determines principal parts (for Latin, we verify that there are four), groups inflection classes into super-classes, and builds full paradigm charts.	000033	000357	000346	000022	000027	000249	000237	000362	000447	000345	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000032/000032.html

As we build a cyberinfrastructure for Classics in the future, we must explore the role that automatic methods can play within it. Using technologies inherited from the disciplines of computational linguistics and computer science, we can create a complement to these traditional reference works - a dynamic lexicon that presents statistical information about a word’s usage in context, including information about its sense distribution within various authors, genres and eras, and syntactic information as well.	000346	000027	000362	000059	000022	000589	000323	000349	000457	000237	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000033/000033.html

The word finish can mean two things that have quite different implications for large-scale humanities computing projects: to bring to completion; to make or perform completely; to complete and also to perfect finally or in detail; to put the final and completing touches to (a thing). The word finish is just not part of the deal for the Linguistic Atlas Project in either sense. However, granting agencies must ask what do you want money for this time? and, from this viewpoint, the Atlas Project consists of a series of particular tasks or experiments, each one of which is capable of being finished in both senses of the word. This paper discusses the reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables, as they relate to the sequence of tasks that make up the larger Atlas Project. There are no once-and-done, permanent solutions. The largest humanities computing projects require continuing care and maintenance, and the best way forward is to create some sort of stable institutional setting for large projects that will provide continuity and baseline resources for the work.	000037	000174	000008	000078	000241	000380	000643	000411	000077	000007	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000038/000038.html

But a scholarly publisher undertaking preparation and sale of digital objects cannot altogether dispense with traditional notions of deadlines and completion if those publications are to enter the dual marketplaces of peer review and institutional purchase. The Electronic Imprint of the University of Virginia Press was funded in 2001 with the goal of bringing born-digital scholarly projects under the aegis of the same review and marketing system that applies to books. In this article I describe how we defined the criteria for done-ness in creating two very different projects, a born-digital edition of Herman Melville’s Typee manuscript and a conversion of the letterpress Papers of George Washington into a digital edition. Our experience suggests that it is possible to categorize different genres of digital creations based on the extent to which intrinsic criteria for “done-ness” can be applied to them, and that decisions about completeness are always subject to extrinsic factors as well, such as budgetary constraints and the pressures created by competition and the evolution of standards.	000021	000040	000037	000051	000174	000192	000459	000053	000411	000194	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000039/000039.html

The idea of doneness circulates discursively within a complex and evolving scholarly ecology where new modes of digital publication are changing our conceptions of textuality, at the same time that models of publication, funding, and archiving are rapidly changing. Within this ecology, it is instrumental and indeed valuable to consider particular tasks and stages done, even as the capacities of digital media push against a sense of finality. However, careful interrogation of aims and ends is required to think through the relation of a digital project to completion, whether modular, provisional, or of the project as a whole.	000037	000425	000039	000179	000591	000227	000174	000051	000632	000215	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000040/000040.html

Text Mining Gender Difference in French Literature	In this study, a corpus of 300 male-authored and 300 female-authored French literary and historical texts is classified for author gender using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation SVMLight, achieving up to 90% classification accuracy. The sets of words that were most useful in distinguishing male and female writing are extracted from the support vectors. The results reinforce previous findings from statistical analyses of the same corpus, and exhibit remarkable cross-linguistic parallels with the results garnered from SVM models trained in gender classification on selections from the British National Corpus. It is found that female authors use personal pronouns and negative polarity items at a much higher rate than their male counterparts, and male authors demonstrate a strong preference for determiners and numerical quantifiers. Among the words that characterize male or female writing consistently over the time period spanned by the corpus, a number of cohesive semantic groups are identified. Male authors, for example, use religious terminology rooted in the church, while female authors use secular language to discuss spirituality. Such differences would take an enormous human effort to discover by a close reading of such a large corpus, but once identified through text mining, they frame intriguing questions which scholars may address using traditional critical analysis methods.	000043	000566	000346	000045	000223	000612	000365	000357	000349	000371	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000042/000042.html

In this study, we apply comparative text mining to a large database of 20th century Black Drama in an effort to examine linguistic distinctiveness of gender, race, and nationality. We first run tests on the plays of American versus non-American playwrights using a variety of learning techniques to classify these works, identifying those which are incorrectly classified and the features which distinguish the plays. We achieve a significant degree of performance in this cross-classification task and find features that may provide interpretative insights. Turning our attention to the question of gendered writing, we classify plays by male and female authors as well as the male and female characters depicted in these works. We again achieve significant results which provide a variety of feature lists clearly distinguishing the lexical choices made by male and female playwrights. While classification tasks such as these are successful and may be illuminating, they also raise several critical issues. The most successful classifications for author and character genders were accomplished by normalizing the data in various ways. Doing so creates a kind of distance from the text as originally composed, which may limit the interpretive utility of classification tools. By framing the classification tasks as binary oppositions (male/female, etc), the possibility arises of stereotypical or lowest common denominator results which may gloss over important critical elements, and may also reflect the experimental design. Text mining opens new avenues of textual and literary research by looking for patterns in large collections of documents, but should be employed with close attention to its methodological and critical limitations.	000045	000042	000566	000223	000346	000266	000371	000188	000341	000365	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000043/000043.html

Mobilizing many of the great – and the not-so-great – philosophes of the 18th century, the Encyclopédie was a massive reference work for the arts and sciences, which sought to organize and transmit the totality of human knowledge while at the same time serving as a vehicle for critical thinking. In its digital form, it is a highly structured corpus; some 55,000 of its 77,000 articles were labeled with classes of knowledge by the editors making it a perfect sandbox for experiments with supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we train a Naive Bayesian classifier on the labeled articles and use this model to determine class membership for the remaining articles. This model is then used to make binary comparisons between labeled texts from different classes in an effort to extract the most important features in terms of class distinction. Re-applying the model onto the original classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about the consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the Encyclopedists. Finally, by applying this model to another corpus from 18th century France, the Journal de Trévoux, or Mémoires pour l'Histoire des Sciences & des Beaux-Arts, new light is shed on the domain of Literature as it was understood and defined by 18th century writers.	000068	000349	000346	000449	000574	000033	000549	000490	000231	000338	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000044/000044.html

Interacting with personal screens during a lecture or other live event has become commonplace and, as a result, the economy of attention that defines these situations has changed. Is it possible to pay attention when sending a text message or surfing the web? For that matter, does distraction always detract from the learning that takes place in these environments? In this article, we ask questions concerning the texture and shape of this emerging economy of attention. We do not take a position on the efficiency of new technologies for delivering educational content or their efficacy of competing for users’ time and attention. Instead, we argue that the emerging social media provide new methods for choreographing attention in line with the performative conventions of any given situation. Rather than banning laptops and phones from the lecture hall and the classroom, we aim to ask what precisely they have on offer for these settings understood as performative sites, as well as for a culture that equates individual attentional behavior with intellectual and moral aptitude.	000386	000407	000393	000391	000457	000110	000363	000352	000143	000453	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000049/000049.html

000051	2009	3.3	Peter M. W. Robinson	University of Birmingham	The Ends of Editing	Many ends of editing in the digital world may be distinguished. One may speak of end as in the supersession of one model of editing (the intentionalist, definitive-text model) by another (the multiple texts, multiply-intentioned views enabled by digital methods). One may speak of end as in aim: not only the aim of the author or authors, but also the aims of the editor or editors. These questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent of digital methods has both focussed and widened the contests around these concepts. The essay reviews some of these questions, with examples drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the two George Bushes, from editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer, Dante, and of Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United States. The essay concludes that a huge shift is indeed underway in the editing world, towards a more open and participatory model of editing and reading.	000356	000369	000171	000039	000207	000552	000152	000457	000226	000111	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000051/000051.html

In the 1990s, as humanists began to sense the advantages of networked computing on the web, they conceived major new editorial projects that would depend to an extraordinary degree upon the documentary power of pictures. Despite evident progress in devising sturdy and responsive standards, images, and tools, stubborn problems persist in several key areas that are explored here through an overview of issues that arise as the William Blake Archive acquires images, prepares them for reproduction, and makes them available for manipulation by its users. Editing electronic images in so unsettled and unsettling an environment generates the provisional success — weak success — that is utterly characteristic of X-editing, electronic scholarly editing in our time. Our dependence on current technology and the expertise of others is not a remediable condition. We must play the game as it presents itself, making the compromises that are necessary, and move ahead.	000071	000030	000021	000457	000150	000411	000601	000372	000524	000234	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000052/000052.html

Simulations have been used by meteorologists to predict and report weather behavior, by climatologists to forewarn about the inevitable damage that global warning will cause, and by government officials to foresee the potential destruction of a major hurricane. In particular, my poster examines the latter — a set of visuals from Hurricane Pam, a computer simulation and set of training exercises that predicted the devastation that Hurricane Katrina would cause one year prior to the tragedy. FEMA conducted preparation workshops for state and local officials, arming them with workbooks with projection maps, conceptual models, and other visuals meant to help ready them.

The study was conducted during a 2007 advanced Shakespeare course at the University of Central Florida that focused heavily on a new historicist approach to studying literature. In this paper we first establish the theoretical foundation for this particular approach to literary studies, then discuss more in-depth how the collaborative, inter-connective nature of wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the concealed assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or narrative. We also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology allowed our students realize some of the stakes in describing history for the present. In other words, having students create wikis based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeare’s works developed an implicit awareness of motives for doing history. We also show how employing open source technology in a localized classroom setting can assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical apparatus and students’ experience of meaningful connections to material. On a larger scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the humanities’ disengagement from the real world that many have been suggesting of late.	000320	000274	000314	000369	000336	000171	000478	000302	000388	000330	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000063/000063.html

While it now plays a critical role in the infrastructure of many digital library operations, XML's promise of interoperability of data across systems and organizations has not been fully realized within digital libraries. The reasons for this are not primarily technical in origin, but social, and relate to the cultures of XML's designers and XML language implementors, and a failure on the part of the digital library community to grapple with the sociotechnical nature of XML and its implementation. Possible strategies for addressing these issues of interoperability might include reduction of the flexibility afforded by specific XML-based markup languages used by the digital library community, and an increased focus on standardizing translations between various communities of practice use of such markup languages.	000459	000293	000318	000457	000117	000441	000458	000007	000199	000460	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000064/000064.html

It is argued that this renaming of humanities computing as digital humanities carries with it a set of epistemic commitments that are not necessarily compatible with a broad and inclusive notion of the digital humanities. In particular, the author suggests that tensions arise from the instrumental, textual and methodological focus of humanities computing as well as its relative lack of engagement with the digital as a study object. This article is the first in a series of four articles attempting to describe and analyze the field of digital humanities and digital humanities as a transformative practice.	000112	000080	000020	000001	000077	000008	000167	000241	000277	000155	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000065/000065.html

The avatar is typically described as our second self in the virtual world of the game. The paper challenges this theory, suggesting that the avatar is better understood as a set of possible interactions, and proposes a second concept, the avatari. If the avatar is our second self, the avatari is the rebellious figure on the screen that we cannot quite control, and that jumps into the pit, gets hit by the enemy, or otherwise fails despite our best efforts to succeed. Conceptualizing video games in terms of the avatar and avatari enables thinking about video games via a more sophisticated and productive model of interactivity than many of the existing paradigms.	000486	000002	000429	000100	000122	000101	000339	000131	000153	000143	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000066/000066.html

The trained droplets provide several functions. Their primary purpose is to encapsulate the results of the software training phase. They can be saved for future re-use against other collections or combinations of collections. They can be modified by having the user accept or reject features identified by the data mining software. Finally, they can also contain choices for how to display and organize items in the collection. The opportunity to develop a new interface object presents the designer with the challenge of effectively communicating what the tool is good for and how it is used. This paper outlines the design process we followed in creating the visual representations of these interface objects, describes the communicative strengths and weaknesses of a number of alternative designs, and discusses the importance of the study of new interface objects as the means of providing the user with new interface affordances.	000487	000091	000403	000406	000259	000547	000555	000402	000205	000569	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000067/000067.html

In this article, we evaluate approaches using logic reasoning applied to an ontology for literary characters. The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario. Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce with solely logic constructs. Furthermore, information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of logic reasoning. At the moment, to the author’s knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in literature studies, have been published. Existing approaches show promising results in modelling information in humanities. Therefore, further research should be directed to make ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more popular and applicable in the humanities and literature studies.	000454	000354	000044	000316	000449	000538	000279	000362	000475	000365	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000068/000068.html
000069	2010	3.4	Kari Kraus	College of Information Studies and Department of English, University of Maryland	Conjectural Criticism: Computing Past and Future Texts	Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology. The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. Computation is here broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression. The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the written word and the emerging field of biohumanities.	000165	000087	000012	000325	000005	000362	000022	000171	000456	000188	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000069/000069.html

Little application has been made of the processing power of grid technologies to humanities data, due to lack of available large-scale datasets, and little understanding of or access to e-Science technologies. The Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH) scoping study, an AHRC-funded e-science workshop series, was established to investigate the potential application of grid computing to a large dataset of interest to historians, humanists, digital consumers, and the general public: historical census records. Consisting of three one-day workshops held at UCL in Summer 2006, the workshop series brought together expertise across different domains to ascertain how useful, possible, or feasible it would be to analyse datasets from Ancestry and The National Archives using the HPC facilities available at UCL. This article details the academic, technical, managerial, and legal issues highlighted in the project when attempting to apply HPC to historical data sets. Additionally, generic issues facing humanities researchers attempting to utilise HPC technologies in their research are presented.	000078	000462	000008	000380	000163	000077	000321	000079	000471	000401	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000070/000070.html

Not always accurately catalogued, manuscripts copied onto animal skins may have started life in the same workshop but over the centuries have become dispersed, coming to rest in libraries all over the world; bringing these together entails travel, microfilm purchases and reassembly and collation of the data within reach of a microfilm reader. These unwieldy machines afford only moderate scope for exploring single manuscripts at close quarters. High-resolution digitisation yields not just better surrogates in full colour; it allows for the development of additional research tools using image compression and manipulation, and new modes of representation, e.g. juxtaposed display of several related witnesses. This paper outlines research questions underpinning the development of an electronic tool for viewing, transcribing and manipulating manuscripts; it moves on to show how the viewer can be adapted for access from remote sites, to compare and annotation one or more witnesses (interactively and in real time), and for use as an integral part of an online edition. Finally, it explores how it can be deployed for use on projects taking knowledge outside the academy: in museums, galleries and other public spaces.	000030	000546	000052	000457	000021	000079	000593	000061	000411	000541	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000071/000071.html
000072	2010	3.4	Nicolas Gold	King's College London, Department of Computer Science	Service-Oriented Software in the Humanities: A Software Engineering Perspective	Software Engineering, as a sub-discipline of the broader field of computer science, is concerned with the production, use, and maintenance of large, complex software systems. On first inspection, the set of managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for collaborative data sharing, but also the modelling, capture, provenancing, and replay of the research (and possibly creative) process itself. This paper examines, from the perspective of a software engineer relatively new to the digital humanities, how the recent developments in service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new approaches to digital enquiry in the arts and humanities. The first part of the paper presents a brief history of software engineering, with particular reference to the aspects that have led to service-oriented architectures. In the second part, the paper offers some thoughts on how certain aspects of service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new kinds of computer-based research and practice in the arts and humanities. It also introduces important national initiatives in this area, such as the JISC e-Framework programme for Higher Education.	000001	000107	000112	000127	000065	000196	000174	000007	000119	000008	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000072/000072.html

This essay discusses the purpose of doing such a thing, arguing there is a distinct method in the apparent randomness of labelling something e this or that. Far from simply denoting that it might be done with computers (and, indeed, what isn't today), Sporton argues that beyond the effect of explaining this is something to do with technology, there is an emergent e-culture that reunites the arts and sciences after two hundred years of separate development within the academy. An e-Culture emerges that reflects the values, opportunities and restrictions of Internet as a research environment. The potential of that environment requires a mindset focussed on collaboration to achieve anything of creative significance.	000079	000020	000608	000076	000352	000119	000457	000453	000077	000459	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000074/000074.html

Based on the results of a study conducted by the Public Knowledge Project and introduced at Digital Humanities 2006 (Siemens, Willinsky and Blake), continued and augmented since, this paper discusses the reactions of Humanities Computing scholars and graduate students to using a set of online reading tools. The results of our study reveal both the potential strengths and perceived weaknesses of online reading environments.

000076	2010	3.4	Angela Piccini	University of Bristol	Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space: Challenging the Institutionalized Spaces of e-Science	This paper arises out of a brief period in the early- to mid-2000s when the British funding and research climate facilitated a relationship between the technical, operational language of e-Science and the creative and performing arts. It concerns the ways in which live creative practices produce media traces that are fractured across screens and networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and their records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these highly mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions between the live event and the recorded document. That is, the discourses, technologies and practices (if we may separate these) of e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between events and their archives, they enact the liveness of archives as they are accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series funded by the A&H e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to investigate how e-Science technologies might inform new understandings of space and time for distributed, creative research practices. Arts and technology researchers from the UK, US and Japan met to generate, analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed practice-led research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships produced between time-based, live events and their immediately mediatized traces. This paper investigates those performative fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that the potentialities and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of practice-based research: from the politics of surveillance to the aesthetics of video compression, from the ethics of multidisciplinary collaboration to the theoretical implications of mixing video time and space with the time and space of the performance event.	000620	000080	000541	000375	000239	000509	000485	000074	000477	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000076/000076.html

Borgman	Professor & Presidential Chair in Information Studies, UCLA	The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities	The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and infrastructure — all of which are necessary for achieving academic recognition. As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are called to action with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?	000420	000163	000215	000020	000485	000065	000464	000480	000401	000112	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000077/000077.html

The second part is an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool, study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue.	000065	000112	000020	000077	000167	000241	000420	000464	000485	000136	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/1/000080/000080.html

Crafting the User-Centered Document Interface: The Hypertext Editing System (HES) and the File Retrieval and Editing System (FRESS)	This article traces the development of two important hypertext systems in the history of computing, and the new paradigms they created: the Hypertext Editing System (HES) and the File Retrieval and Editing System (FRESS). HES was the world's first word processor to run on commercial equipment. It was also the first hypertext system that beginners could use, and pioneered many modern hypertext concepts for personal use. Although the idea of hypertext predates HES and FRESS, this article argues that these two systems were successful because they demonstrated hypertext to a sceptical public; they were both working prototypes.	000128	000457	000016	000196	000459	000199	000588	000602	000552	000075	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/1/000081/000081.html

These encoding experiments reflect the diverse nature of the artifacts and represent a critical assessment of the effectiveness of present encoding practices for the multidimensional and pragmatic aspects of authorial drafts. Thus far, it seems that the TEI has yet to offer a convincing theoretical model and adequate practical solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally present in manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general. Our conclusion is that there is a potential conflict between the linear and hierchical nature of current formal language systems such as XML, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing process. In such cases we may have to rethink present models of document modeling, and to develop, within an adequate epistemological framework, a new theory of digital text.	000525	000199	000362	000430	000457	000175	000069	000348	000447	000192	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/1/000082/000082.html

Hanlon	Digital Humanities Observatory | Marquette University	Determining Value for Digital Humanities Tools: Report on a Survey of Tool Developers	While the purpose and direction of tools and tool development for the Digital Humanities have been debated in various forums, the value of tool development as a scholarly activity has seen little discussion. As a way of filling this gap, the authors conducted an online survey of developers of digital humanities tools in March 2008. The survey focused on their perceptions of their work, how they felt their tool development fit into a structure of academic rewards, and the value of tool development as a scholarly pursuit. Survey results indicate that tool development is indeed considered a scholarly activity by developers, but recognition of this work and rewards for it lag behind rewards for traditional scholarly pursuits (such as journal articles and book publication). This paper presents a summary of the results of the survey, ending with some suggestions for further research.	000136	000174	000114	000007	000241	000336	000075	000401	000322	000441	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000083/000083.html

Information science, long the academic frame of archival programs in the U.S. and elsewhere, currently allows for considerable co-expansion with digital humanities innovations when we consider the possibility of digital libraries, digital archives, and web-based collections integrating a humanist approach to display and users' interactivity with cultural objects. This paper reviews a workshop dedicated to charting the relationship between digital humanities and archival scholarship, as well as the opportunities to refine curricular and theoretical development in these two disciplines. The concepts expressed here would facilitate the efforts of practitioners to critically examine issues of pedagogy, practical training, and disciplinary alignment under a goal of sustaining the extraordinary expansion of applied humanist theory exemplified in research ventures we have seen thus far.	000077	000303	000256	000420	000112	000524	000241	000136	000177	000215	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/1/000084/000084.html

After work with community development corporations on the East Coast, Plotkin entered graduate school in urban history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. During this period in the early nineties, Plotkin had a job with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and then collaborated on the development of the forum that became H-Net. In addition to standards and protocols about new communication technologies, face-to-face relationships grew out of online exchanges, often with lively disagreements about the direction of H-Net. Plotkin’s own broadening use of digital tools prompts her concluding reflections on historians’ continuing need to use the Internet to overcome physical and intellectual fragmentation, and how the Internet has democratized the field of history.	000355	000321	000369	000241	000232	000155	000207	000003	000437	000277	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000086/000086.html

It comes not only with presumed technology or infrastructure, but also with certain assumptions, discursive patterns, and models. This paper analyzes these critically and advocates a humanities-based notion of cyberinfrastructure, not necessarily built on a science-and-engineering paradigm or exclusively grounded in existing humanities infrastructure. It is argued that we need to maintain a critical stance while simultaneously engaging in the exploration of research issues and technologies. There is often a gap between the material details of infrastructure and underlying, foundational ideas, and it is suggested that a model based on conceptual cyberinfrastructure and design parameters can be one way of connecting the ideational level with actual implementation. HUMlab at Umeå University serves as a case study.	000184	000020	000241	000077	000073	000112	000158	000352	000093	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000090/000090.html

These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.	000547	000556	000487	000285	000406	000408	000402	000534	000457	000452	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html
000092	2011	5.2	J.J. Butts	Assistant Professor of English, Wartburg College	Missed Connections: The Collective Novel and the Metropolis	This essay argues that the urban collective novel serves as an important modernist precursor to network narratives. The collective novel is a literary form, particularly popular during the 1930s, that explores a wide context through a decentered narrative. Previous discussions of these novels have focused on them as exemplars of modernist form in proletarian literature. However, this essay shows another origin for the form in concerns about the metropolis and mass culture that complicates our understanding. Drawing on examples from novels by John Dos Passos, Daniel Fuchs, Albert Halper, Josephine Herbst, William S. Rollins, Jr., and Edwin Seaver it shows how these texts offered not only radically ambivalent assessments of networked existence but often a pessimistic view of the possibilities of political community, extending at times to specific critiques of communist politics. In its conclusion, the essay draws links between these novels and the cinematic network narratives that became popular in the first decade of the 21st century.	000094	000300	000097	000355	000353	000446	000178	000093	000495	000361	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/2/000092/000092.html

Unlike today’s seamlessly embedded networks, however, the prototypical form depicted in Winesburg, Ohio functions as a kluge, an ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole . Anderson’s kluge augurs network technology and therefore suggests that the form loomed large in modernists’ mind. However, Winesburg, Ohio illustrates the network’s propensity to foster users’ inner alienation while enabling their unprecedented connection and thereby warns against the antagonistic quality of the network’s rhizomatic structure.	000158	000097	000094	000608	000596	000352	000347	000413	000105	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/2/000093/000093.html

Trilogy	Wesley Beal examines John Dos Passos’s U.S.A. trilogy (1930-36) to read its complex form — what the author once referred to as a four-way conveyor system — as an intricate networking scheme, and considers it as an archive of early network thinking. Contrary to traditional readings of U.S.A. that discuss its formal properties in terms of dispersal and the supposedly ruinous disconnections of modern life, the paper argues that the interplay of these formal fragments results in a semiotic web that drives Dos Passos’s narrative strategy toward a totalizing vision of the nation and, indeed, history. Beal’s paper deals with the progressive widening of network figuration in American modernism to think the very politics of national space, and in focusing on the machinic dynamics of Dos Passos’s form, the article establishes network discourses as the organizing principle of several pre-digitization modes of production, including Fordism and the modern corporation.	000093	000097	000092	000361	000353	000355	000347	000193	000105	000003	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/2/000094/000094.html

Impractical Applications	The question of how we justify digital humanities to unknowing or skeptical audiences cannot be disentangled from how we justify studying the humanities in an era of anxiety and doubt regarding the pursuit of anything without supposedly practical aims. Answering these concerns requires not only rejecting the faulty assumptions on which they are based, but also bringing more information to bear regarding the connections between our work and the values, both practical (judged in terms of effects) and not (judged on its own terms) of the larger economy and culture in which we participate.	000109	000366	000334	000352	000587	000608	000453	000457	000459	000050	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000095/000095.html
000096	2011	5.2	Stacy Lavin	Independent Scholar	The Globe is All One: Wars I Have Seen as Proto-Network Narrative	The Globe is All One: Wars I Have Seen as Proto-Network Narrative charts Gertrude Stein's characterization of the human mind as an data-processor by tracing the conceptual correspondences between her writings and early information theory, including the work of Norbert Weiner, Claude Shannon, and Vannevar Bush. The article argues that Stein first sees language as data that human beings are compelled to parse in even the most contextless and semantically noisy frameworks, which shapes the purpose and form of Stein's notoriously difficult prose poem, Tender Buttons; the ease with which meaning can be exchanged emphasizes the importance of the ways in which a given meaning is selected from a set of possible meanings rather than interpreted or revealed. While this may simply reiterate the mode of Tender Buttons in different terms, the paper's crucial intervention is in its positioning of the chance selection of significance as the mode of signification that animates her wartime memoir Wars I Have Seen. Like words in the poem, political identity in occupied France is unstable and waits to be parsed in the act of encounters with others and with history. In her narrative's foregrounding of and experimental play with the conventions of memoir, Stein discovers the shifting nature of her main character (herself) in a series of ruminations and chance meetings; an early version of the network narrative emerges in the nodal structure of the story that undermines chronological and nationalist frames of signification.	000105	000348	000457	000346	000648	000598	000109	000353	000347	000093	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/2/000096/000096.html

Although handwriting was never a fully embodied writing technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often characterize it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not only in critical literature but also in contemporary graphical media such as video games. Two recent Nintendo DS games, Scribblenauts (2009) and The World Ends with You (2007), represent two alternative modalities of such nostalgia for handwriting. Scribblenauts claims to fully restore the creative properties of handwriting, but inevitably fails to do so. By contrast, TWEWY claims to offer not handwriting itself but a digital- and DS-specific equivalent. Therefore, it opens up possibilities for critical reflection on the past meaning of handwriting and on the future of the values that handwriting has come to symbolize.	000356	000558	000085	000161	000138	000051	000155	000457	000341	000226	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/000098.html
000099	2011	5.3	Maria Engberg | Jay David Bolter	Blekinge Institute of Technology | Georgia Institute of Technology	Digital Literature and the Modernist Problem	What is the status of digital literature in contemporary culture? Many scholars and practitioners assume that digital literature constitutes a contemporary avant-garde, which does its work of experimentation outside or in opposition to the mainstream. The notion of the avant-garde might seem thoroughly out of date in a consideration of the digital future. Important theorists (e.g. Huyssen, Drucker) have argued that the avant-garde is no longer viable even for traditional media and art practices. On the other hand, the avant-gardes of twentieth-century modernism made claims about the function of art that remain surprisingly influential today – within the art community and within popular culture. As Peter Bürger and others have discussed, an important division grew up in modernism on the question of whether art should strive for formal innovation or for sociopolitical change. Avant-gardes of the twentieth century took up positions along a spectrum from pure formalism (e.g. the Abstract Expressionists) to overt political action (e.g. the Situationists). While the digital literature community is in general committed to formal innovation, some are critical of this commitment, in part on the political grounds that (technological) innovation has become a byword for the digital culture industry. Although the modernist problem is still apparent in some digital art and digital literature today, writers such as Jason Nelson seem to be moving beyond that dialectic.	000207	000616	000141	000055	000011	000369	000155	000503	000154	000172	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000099/000099.html
000100	2011	5.3	Gregory L. Ulmer	Professor of English and Media Studies University of Florida, Gainesville	Avatar Emergency	The original usage of avatar referred to the incarnation or human appearance of a deity, particularly Vishnu, in Hindu mythology. The term was adapted to cyberspace to name one’s online persona. This usage has come to include every aspect of one’s online representation, from the icon on a blog, or an email signature to the figure one plays in Second Life. Avatar, then, is a practical point of entry for theorizing the emergence of the new identity experience of electracy, that is supplementing and displacing selfhood, the identity formation of literacy. Playing one’s avatar is to electracy what writing an essay is to literacy. The point addressed in this essay is that an avatar is not merely the appearance of one’s representation, since through interactivity and even telepresence, I am t/here with my image. What is it to be/have an image? The answer begins with noting the literal meaning of the avatar in Sanskrit: Descent. Vishnu has descended (taken on embodiment) nine times, to correct a disordered world condition. This essay initiates a review of the cultural archive to see what is known already about our question (representations of descent). It is perhaps obvious, considering the prominence of Christianity in our heritage, that the West accumulated a huge amount of information about becoming body. Two examples are referenced in this introductory piece: Krishna and Orpheus.	000158	000457	000355	000608	000109	000241	000347	000453	000331	000030	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000100/000100.html
000101	2011	5.1	Aaron Kashtan	Department of English, University of Florida	Because It's Not There: Ekphrasis and the Threat of Graphics in Interactive Fiction	Existing scholarship on interactive fiction (IF, also known as the text adventure) tends to treat it as a video game genre and/or as a category of electronic literature. In this essay I argue that IF can be understood as participating in traditions of visual prose and ekphrastic textuality, insofar as IF consists of room and object descriptions which direct the player to visualize the things they describe. Unlike traditional ekphrastic literature, however, IF also asks the player to take practical actions in response to the images he or she visualizes. During the commercial era of IF, ekphrasis was the most effective means available of providing players with immersive visual experiences. However, graphical video games have now surpassed IF in this area. Therefore, in order to justify the continued existence of IF, contemporary IF authors have been forced to conceive of the visuality of IF otherwise than in terms of the logic of transparency. One strategy for doing this, exemplified by Nick Montfort's game, Ad Verbum, is to abandon visuality almost entirely and emphasize IF's linguistic and textual qualities. An alternative strategy, exemplified by Emily Short's game City of Secrets, is to assert that IF is visual in a non-transparent way, because IF offers visual experiences which are user-generated rather than pre-rendered.	000010	000486	000161	000429	000619	000234	000085	000143	000002	000360	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000101/000101.html

Burgess | Jeanne Hamming	University of Maryland Baltimore County | Centenary College of Louisiana	New Media in the Academy: Labor and the Production of Knowledge in Scholarly Multimedia	Despite a general interest in exploring the possibilities of multimedia and web-based research, the humanities profession has been slow to accept digital scholarship as a valid form of intellectual endeavor. Questions about labor, peer-review, and co-authorship often arise in academic departments’ attempts to evaluate digital research in the tenure and promotion process. In this essay, we argue that these tensions stem from a general misunderstanding of the kinds of work that goes into producing scholarship in multimedia form. Multimedia work, we suggest, places scholars in an extended network that combines minds, bodies, machines, and institutional practices, and lays bare the fiction that scholars are disembodied intellectuals who labor only with the mind. We argue that while traditional ideas of what counts as scholarship continue to privilege content over form, intellectual labor over physical labor, and print over digital media, new media’s functional (and in some cases even biological) difference from old media contributes to a double erasure, for scholars working in multimedia, of both their intellectual contributions and their material labor.	000077	000055	000369	000215	000399	000256	000210	000425	000616	000480	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000102/000102.html
000103	2011	5.3	Brian Greenspan	Carleton University	The New Place of Reading: Locative Media and the Future of Narrative	Locative technologies hold out the promise to transform literary space in all of its dimensions, including its represented spaces, reading interfaces, and the very spaces within which literature is produced and consumed. Yet, despite the growing use of location-based technologies, authors and readers alike have been slow to take to site-specific narrative due to limitations inherent in both the current design of locative media systems and our received notions of what constitutes the narrative experience. This paper argues that new mobile reading platforms in general are altering conceptions of literary space in highly conflicted ways, by radically expanding the sites where narratives can be accessed and experienced even as they reinforce a residual notion of literary reading as a sedentary and decontextualized experience. Locative media likewise hold out the promise of increased mobility and contextual awareness, but confront several cultural and technological factors preventing such an enhanced emplacement of narrative, factors that current performance-oriented approaches cannot fully address. At the level of cognitive engagement, the conditioned expectation of being transported to a remote fictional world interferes with readers' appreciation of the locative narrative's close ties to the real world, as well as the contextual effects it elicits by means of transportation through the actual world. At the technical level, the discontinuous algorithms of place that inform the architecture of most locative media systems hinder the perception of narrative patterning and flow across more extensive spaces. Locative media thus operationalize the spatial tension between conventionally sedentary modes of literary engagement and new modalities of mobility, a tension that is constitutive of our present mediality. The study concludes with a discussion of StoryTrek, a next-generation locative hypernarrative system designed to enable more complex, dynamic and fluid modes of embodied narrative spatiality. By encouraging the user to actively form complex narrative links between real and fictional spaces, StoryTrek enables utopian forms of spatial play that neutralize both the spatial limitations of current locative media design and the sedentary reading practices that continue to structure the experience of digital literature.	000378	000389	000180	000171	000457	000197	000444	000478	000353	000616	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000103/000103.html
000104	2011	5.3	John Cayley	Brown University	Writing to be Found and Writing Readers	Poetic writing for programmable and network media seems to have been captivated by the affordances of new media and questions of whether or not and if so, how certain novel, media-constituted properties and methods of literary objects require us to reassess and reconfigure the literary itself. What if we shift our attention decidedly to practices, processes, procedures — towards ways of writing and ways of reading rather than dwelling on either textual artifacts themselves (even time-based literary objects) or the concepts underpinning objects-as-artifact? What else can we do, given that we must now write on, for, and with the net which is itself no object but a seething mass of manifold processes? Part one of the essay presents a brief analysis of recent experiments in writing to be found with Google, making some claim that such writing may be exemplary, that its aesthetic and conceptual engagements are distinct, and that there is something at stake here for the literary or rather for certain practices of literary art. After very brief discussion in part two of some broader implications of writing with the Google corpus and its tools, part three addresses more examples of writing to be found, and introduces a collaboration with Daniel Howe, The Readers Project, many processes of which engage with writing to be found in Google and making use of its tools.	000356	000154	000111	000171	000314	000378	000087	000155	000226	000389	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000104/000104.html

Gochenour	Towson University	Nodalism	This paper focuses on the use of the trope x is like a node in a network in works of critical theory, and shows it to be an indicator of a larger discourse, nodalism, that has its origins in 19th century neuroscience and Associationist models of mind. This discourse provides a relationship between structure and function that is used in attempts to model thought in technological devices, as in the work of Vannevar Bush and JCR Licklider. These technological instantiations of nodalism in turn provide the material basis for the expansion of the discourse into other domains, such as politics and economics. The paper concludes by considering the potential positive and negative consequence of nodalism, and the role of the digitial humanities in the reproduction of this discourse.	000097	000109	000457	000096	000352	000347	000030	000355	000369	000348	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000105/000105.html

This paper grows out of a sense that digital pedagogy is too frequently conceived in terms of instructional technologies. Technology, at least in its electrified forms, can be a limiting factor in imagining how humanities instruction can be digital: something to get your hands on, to deal with in dynamic units, to manipulate creatively. What might an electronically-enabled pedagogy look like if we pulled the plug? This paper surveys several examples to suggest that an unplugged digital humanities pedagogy can be just as productively disorienting as doing humanities digitally, and can potentially help students prepare for and contextualize their learning experiences with instructional technologies or in online environments.	000310	000177	000191	000394	000304	000358	000311	000119	000417	000315	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000106/000106.html

While it makes sense to adapt the accumulated expertise of the commercial and government IT sectors, care needs to be taken to ensure any new approaches enhance rather than undermine the aims of the humanities generally. While digital humanists are uniquely positioned to help the humanities, care needs to be taken to ensure new project management and design techniques sourced from the IT world are applied critically and do not undermine the core aims of the discipline. If these caveats are kept in mind the IT world has a lot to offer digital humanists, however, especially in the field of Enterprise Architecture (EA), which aims to produce a holistic, high level view of technological systems with a view to understanding social and cultural as well as technological issues.	000119	000001	000112	000016	000020	000072	000241	000174	000284	000065	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000107/000107.html

W. Marinetti, Kay Boyle, Nancy Cunard, Eugene Jolas, and many others. Each of these contributors had sent works prepared for Bob Brown's machine, and he called the prepared texts readies. In the midst of building the collection of texts, the researcher realized that moving the texts through an electronic version of Brown's machine, or through the interface constructed on the website to simulate Brown's machine, changed how one read — even changed the essence of what one read. Speed, pace, direction, and visual cues took on new importance already apparent in reading printed texts, but not stressed. Punctuation now represented an illegible and non-representational, visual cue rather than a direct link to the phono-centric pauses and stops that are more commonly represented by punctuation. The futures of reading, and the use of new devices like e-readers, will have consequences for the definition and practice of what we call reading.	000197	000457	000356	000558	000389	000018	000363	000109	000478	000393	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000108/000108.html

In so doing, they probe the future cultural scenarios looming beyond digital technologies and their related practices, concepts, and perspectives. Such a collective interrogation of our digital future investigates the full spectrum of the humanities. As a result, our notions of subjectivity, identity, consciousness, literacy, text, and medium emerge in these essays as significantly altered by the digital in unusual and unexpected ways. Papers scrutinize a variegated set of relationships between the human neurological network and the networked computer, real and virtual spaces, and subjectivity and procedurality. Scholars in this cluster re-envision such issues in the light of an all-encompassing ontological shift underway as a consequence of the increasingly pervasive presence of the digital in our relations with machines and their processes.	000334	000608	000457	000352	000366	000453	000050	000459	000030	000095	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000109/000109.html

Contemporary media devices, what people do with them, and how all of this fits into the organization of our everyday life disrupt and unsettle well-established views of the role media play in society. Instead of continuing to wrestle with a distinction between media and society, this contribution proposes we begin our thinking with a view of life not lived with media, but in media. The media life perspective starts from the realization that the whole of the world and our lived experience in it are framed by, mitigated through, and made immediate by (immersive, integrated, ubiquitous and pervasive) media.	000118	000158	000437	000143	000457	000638	000241	000386	000369	000608	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000110/000110.html

In this work, which is published conjointly with the LLC piece Toward Modeling the Social Edition: An Approach to Understanding the Electronic Scholarly Edition in the Context of New and Emerging Social Media, we consider a typology of electronic scholarly editions adjacent to activities common to humanities scholars who engage texts as expert readers, noting therein that many methods of engagement both reflect the interrelated nature of long-standing professional reading strategies and are social in nature; extending this framework, the next steps in the scholarly edition’s development in its incorporation of social media functionality reflect the importance of traditional humanistic activities and workflows, and include collaboration, incorporating contributions by its readers and re-visioning the role of the editor away from that of ultimate authority and more toward that of facilitator of reader involvement.	000194	000154	000075	000202	000478	000616	000314	000241	000121	000356	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000111/000111.html

Based on a rich set of materials closely associated with the formation of the digital humanities, this article explores the visions and expectations associated with the digital humanities and how the digital humanities often becomes a laboratory and means for thinking about the state and future of the humanities. It is argued that this forward-looking sentiment comes both from inside and outside the field, and is arguably an important reason for the attraction and importance of the field. Furthermore, the author outlines a visionary scope for the digital humanities and offers a personal visionary statement as the endpoint to the article series.	000065	000020	000080	000241	000077	000007	000001	000155	000260	000119	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000112/000112.html

More specifically, it establishes continuities between a pre-digital historical conception of close reading and the sort of materially-conscious hermeneutics that digital textuality requires. The author applies the updated conception of close reading digital literature to Steve Tomasula's TOC , a self-described new media novel.	000207	000171	000152	000180	000178	000616	000140	000162	000369	000154	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000113/000113.html

In order to understand its role in supporting the field’s development and acceptance, SSHRC commissioned a survey of the larger Humanities and Social Science’s community to understand the issues related to DH’s development and acceptance and the types of activities that should be funded. The survey results suggest there is reason for optimism regarding the growing acceptance of digital methods, resources and tools and electronic dissemination as instructors, researchers, and students are using and publishing in digital outlets and creating and employing digital recourses, methods and tools andventuring into new research fields. This trend is likely to continue as students and younger scholars continue to embrace the digital in all aspects of their personal and professional lives. However, this optimism should be tempered to some extent as students and junior faculty are still less likely than associate professors to present and publish their digital-oriented research for a variety of reasons. The field’s more senior faculty can mentor their junior colleagues and students to this end and shape salary, tenure and promotion policies to recognize and reward these efforts. Finally, issues remain around the amount of funding required for the initial development and ongoing sustainability and relevance of digital resources and may become more critical over time. Granting agencies will need to evaluate their funding role in this regard.	000077	000480	000233	000007	000241	000401	000485	000464	000570	000311	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000114/000114.html

A version of that question has occupied commentary about Amazon’s Kindle since news of its release first made its way to public attention in September 2007. Posed out of curiosity, excitement, as well as trepidation, the question includes anxiety about the re-invention of reading embodied by new features and the intricacies of downloading policy. In this essay, I focus on disappearance for the ways in which it indexes concerns about the Kindle’s material impact on reading. Tracking these concerns, I turn to three major moments in the Kindle’s biography in order to emphasize Amazon’s investment in mimicking the transcendence associated with reading and the ways in which this investment is met, and at times exceeded, by readerly desires to possess that transcendence. That the very name Kindle should occasion parallels between e-reading and book burning, that Jeff Bezos should claim unobtrusiveness as the device’s exemplary feature, and that Amazon’s unannounced deletions of Orwell’s 1984 from thousands of Kindle libraries should meet with such ire, makes visible the two ideologies of reading — on the one hand, the invaluable (because ephemeral) force of reading and on the other, reading as a relation of ownership and agency — that stand in both an uneasy and profitable tension for Amazon and its reader-consumers.	000601	000197	000180	000356	000171	000389	000457	000459	000075	000558	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000115/000115.html

Walsh	Indiana University	Comic Book Markup Language: An Introduction and Rationale	Comics, comic books, and graphic novels are increasingly the target of seriously scholarly attention in the humanities. Moreover, comic books are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication. The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with other complex documents studied by humanists — illuminated manuscripts, artists’ books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake, letterpress productions like those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated children’s books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media. Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML vocabulary for encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and related documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for developing CBML, reviews the various content types found in comic book publications, provides an overview and examples of the key features of the CBML XML vocabulary, explores some of the problems and challenges in the encoding and digital representation of comic books, and outlines plans for future work. The structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial and textual elements.	000199	000212	000181	000459	000004	000234	000137	000457	000569	000059	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/000117.html
000118	2012	6.2	Lissa Holloway-Attaway	Blekinge Tekniska Högskola	Beyond Representation: Embodied Expression and Social Me-dia	The contemporary digital media ecology is one of convergence and hybridity. As virtual and technical interfaces intersect in increasingly complex formulations, the ability to identify organic vs. technical forms has become problematic. Virtual environments predominate within everyday cultural practice arguably limiting real or unmediated human experience. The advent of social media artifacts and networks in particular — those that create fusions of personal experience and communal activity and that support and broadcast user-generated content as a foundation for media productions of real-life — have made organic bodies and personal experience difficult to discern. Extending Mark B.N. Hansen’s model for identifying embodied experience within contemporary mixed reality culture, I argue that embodied expression is more, not less, present in the contemporary media age. Organic expressions, those that emanate from primal, tactile, and motile forces and that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at the core of many social media artifacts circulated within the networks of contemporary culture and operating outside the aesthetics of traditional semiotic representation. Recovering the organic body and foregrounding its presence in such media asserts the functional non-aesthetic principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in those dependant on documenting the minutiae of real-life under-represented in mainstream and traditional media. As personal and public spaces collide, situating the me or the embodied subject within production is problematic. I identify such embodiment within contemporary social media, particularly on YouTube, to illustrate that the human body does not operate from a position of erasure within social media networks and artifacts, and its expressive value is therefore central in much current user-generated me-dia.	000143	000110	000158	000557	000386	000161	000439	000457	000369	000437	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000118/000118.html

This paper will explore some of the characteristics of the digital humanities and examine some of its hard interdisciplinarity relationships. It is the contention of the author that one of the central epistemological challenges within the field is to empower students to successfully manage the thorny interdisciplinary relationship intrinsic to technology and the humanities. Without understanding and managing this relationship, there is a danger that student projects lapse into exceedingly reductive pragmatism or overly theorised clumsiness. The author will suggest a model where this hard-interdisciplinary relationship may be taught and assessed through the critical use and analysis of digital objects within the framework of a Virtual Research Environments (VREs).	000127	000112	000065	000080	000485	000241	000001	000155	000020	000465	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000119/000119.html

In particular, the digital places a central emphasis on abstraction, and digital artifacts and culture demonstrate this ontology of abstraction even while remaining concrete. The kinds of social structures grouped under the label Web 2.0 exemplify the materialized abstraction of the digital, and this essay points out the formal and technical features of the digital that carry the abstract nature of the binary code into the human relations and behaviors of Web 2.0.	000158	000459	000020	000457	000608	000352	000241	000155	000347	000437	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000120/000120.html
000121	2012	6.2	John Bradley	Kings College London	"Towards a Richer Sense of Digital Annotation: Moving Beyond a ""Media"" Orientation of the Annotation of Digital Objects"	Digital technology often gives us the chance to re-conceive common scholarly practices with the humanities, and one of these is the practice of annotation. Whereas many in the digital humanities look at annotation through the lens of social media, in this paper we consider annotation’s already established function in scholarship: to support the development of an interpretation of a body of material. It begins by applying a “software application” perspective to annotation and it notes that personal annotation sits at the nexus between the publishing application of the material being annotated, and an interpretation development application that aims to support the reader’s thinking. Once this application orientation is taken up, it becomes evident that it is useful to re-conceptualise aspects of annotation beyond the annotation-of-media focus which the World Wide Web has encouraged in all of us. The paper does this by considering annotation in an application that is not media oriented in nature, Northwestern University’s WordHoard, and it explores some of the significance of annotation where the application’s data model – with its inherent semantic significance – is available to be annotated. There is a growing interest in thinking of the WWW as a delivery mechanism for software applications rather than merely for documents, and thus many of the issues that this paper raises could apply to the work of web-oriented developers too.	000111	000512	000655	000425	000196	000154	000181	000104	000164	000194	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000121/000121.html

After reviewing the ways in which anamorphosis has been deployed as a philosophical tool for investigating digital media in terms of human phenomenology, specifically through the criticism of Espen Aarseth and Mark Hansen, this paper analyzes how contemporary videogames like Sony’s Echochrome series, levelHead by Julian Oliver, and Mark ten Bosch’s forthcoming Miegakure technically, aesthetically, and conceptually explore anamorphic techniques. While The Ambassadors is famous for its anamorphically skewed skull, a classic memento mori, we propose that the anamorphic effects of videogames can be more accurately described as a memento mortem mortis: not reminders of human mortality, but of a nonhuman the death of death. By foregrounding the impossibility of ever fully resolving the human experience of computational space, the memento mortem mortis in these anamorphic games gestures toward experiential domains altogether indifferent to human phenomenology to create allegories of the beyond.	000505	000521	000599	000246	000508	000158	000161	000409	000415	000066	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000122/000122.html

The goal of the project, which has been run three times since 2009, is to bring together participants to reflect on the question, Just what do computing humanists really do? To do this, participants document their day through photographs and commentary using one of the Day of DH blogs set up for them. The collection of these journals (with links, tags, and comments) is, after editing, made available online. This paper discusses the design of this social project, from the ethical issues raised to the final web of journals and shares some of the lessons we have learned. One of the major challenges of social media is getting participation. We made participating easy by personally inviting a seed group, choosing an accessible technology, maintaining a light but constant level of communication prior to the event, and asking only for a single day of commitment. In addition, we tried to make participation at least rewarding in formal academic terms by structuring the Day of DH as a collaborative publication. In terms of improvements, we have over the iterations changed the handling ethics clearances for images and connected to other social media like Twitter.	000241	000007	000638	000643	000351	000260	000020	000112	000536	000167	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000123/000123.html
000124	2012	6.2	Paul Stephens	Columbia University	From the Personal to the Proprietary: Conceptual Writing's Critique of Metadata	The past decade has seen a remarkable proliferation of new works of constrained and appropriated writing that prominently incorporate, and in turn investigate, metadata schemes. I argue that these works ought to be of considerable interest not only to critics of contemporary avant-garde writing — but also to media theorists, librarians and textual scholars. By emphasizing classification protocols, conceptual writing makes an implicit case for the interrelationship of these fields. Each of the four main books under discussion here — Tan Lin’s Seven Controlled Vocabularies, Craig Dworkin’s Perverse Library, M. Nourbese Philip’s Zong! and Simon Morris’ Getting Inside Jack Kerouac’s Head — draws upon pre-existing textual archives. In doing so, these books suggest that processes of data storage, classification and transmission are key to how poetry is created, recognized and disseminated. Conceptual writing’s attention to information classification protocols offers not only a critique of contemporary models of authorship, but also of contemporary frameworks of personal agency and intellectual property.	000181	000053	000321	000615	000171	000215	000192	000151	000104	000202	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000124/000124.html

First, it describes how the project team sought to recruit volunteer transcribers to take part, and discusses which strategies were successes (and which were not). We then examine Transcribe Bentham's results during its six-month testing period (8 September 2010 to 8 March 2011), which include a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of website statistics, work completed by the amateur transcribers, as well as the demographics of the volunteer base and their motivations for taking part. The paper concludes by discussing the success of our community building with reference to this analysis.

Whereas news media coverage of its operations considers only their human aspects, mostly in relation to crime and cyberterrorism, Daniel Suarez's recent novel Daemon provides a suggestive glimpse into how, in a webbot assemblage, new forms of human and machinic agency are complexly intricated. The significance of this assemblage becomes further evident when it is considered in relation to how the Internet is increasingly perceived: no longer as a neutral medium but as an ecosystem defined by netwar, software arms races, and the possible evolution of low forms of artificial life.	000347	000073	000365	000352	000184	000453	000535	000093	000267	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000126/000126.html

Drawing on a combination of primary and secondary sources of information, including the Preserving Virtual Worlds project (an academic investigation into viable models of preservation for videogames and 3D virtual worlds based on a series of archiving case studies) and the results of a game documentation survey conducted by Donahue, we examine how players are taking responsibility for collecting, managing, curating, and creating long-term access to computer games. Because our interest lies with the contact zone between players and information professionals, we also describe and analyze how we and other scholar-archivists are collaborating with or relying on the user community to preserve virtual worlds, with an eye to how these relationships might eventually be codified within a larger preservation framework.Early versions of portions of this paper were delivered by Kari Kraus, Rachel Donahue, and Megan Winget, Game Change: The Role of Amateur and Professional Cultures in Preserving Virtual Worlds Conference paper.

It explores Siemens' early training and involvement in the field that is now known as digital humanities. He recalls that his first experience with computing was as a video gamer and programmer in high school. He had the opportunity to consolidate this early experience in the mid-1980s, when he attended the University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the department of English where he undertook, inter alia, formal training in computing. He communicates strongly the vibrancy of the field that was already apparent during his graduate years (up to c. 1991) and identifies some of the people in places such as the University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Oxford, and the University of British Columbia who had a formative influence on him. He gives a clear sense of some of the factors that attracted him to computing, for example, the alternatives to close reading that he was able to bring to bear on his literary research from an early stage. So too he reflects on computing developments whose applications were not immediately foreseeable, for example, when in 1986 he edited IBM's TCP/IP manual he could not have foreseen that by 1989 TCP/IP would be firmly established as the communication protocol of the internet. He closes by reflecting on the prescience of the advice that his father, also an academic, gave him regarding the use of computing in his research and on his early encounters with the conference scene.	000135	000085	000459	000457	000241	000158	000132	000155	000007	000352	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/3/000131/000131.html

He and his colleagues wanted to set up a new journal as only one other journal existed in that area. They were introduced to the recently released LISTSERV software and the first issue of the journal was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was called Postmodern Culture and twenty-two years later is still published by Johns Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed electronic journal in the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior colleagues were in favour of it and, as a junior faculty member, his participation in it. He recounts that was not able to avail of formal training in computing but he did have technical knowledge of computing, mostly picked up while procrastinating on this PhD. By the early 1990s he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused on electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and non-academic projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia where he directed the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the wide range of people and projects that he worked with and that it was around this time that he became involved with the community now known as digital humanities. He reflects in detail on the first digital humanities conference he attended in Paris in 1994 and concludes by discussing some of the changes that the advent of the Web has heralded.	000007	000020	000241	000172	000457	000369	000155	000154	000493	000321	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/3/000132/000132.html

There, whilst undertaking summer work in the library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450 people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late Antonio Zampolli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised them. He closes by discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars into and out of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have had an impact on digital humanities centres.	000135	000457	000007	000351	000336	000459	000134	000241	000352	000453	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/3/000133/000133.html

He recounts that his earliest encounter with computing was in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkley where he worked with semi-automated scanning equipment for the Alvarez high-energy physics projects. After his dreams of becoming a physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. There he did not have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. So, he learned to programme on the job with help from a talented physicist turned computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft). His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the University of Toronto where he worked on the Records of Early English Drama project whilst undertaking a PhD on 17th century non-dramatic poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic support role at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Toronto, where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's College London. In Toronto he was keenly aware of the staff-faculty divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that the role brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a lasting influence on him. So too, with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada he was able to undertake a research project on Ovid's Metamorphosis. He closes the interview by reflecting on his early involvement with the conference scene and people who have influenced him, from academics to his calligraphy teacher Lloyd Reynolds.	000135	000457	000493	000183	000167	000001	000241	000628	000258	000369	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/3/000134/000134.html

He narrates that he had been aware of computing developments when growing up in Italy but it was in college in the late 1970s that he took formal training in computing. He bought his first computer, an Apple II clone, after graduation when he was working as a teacher in the Middle East. Throughout the interview he reflects on the various computers he has used and how the mouse that he used with an early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the mid-1980s he was attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was accepted on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in Philosophy, he spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This resulted in the building of text analysis tools and their application to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, as well as some of the earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the digital humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of influences that shaped and inspired his early work in the field, for example, the Research Computing Group at the University of Toronto and their work in visual programming environments. In 1994 he applied, and was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he reflects that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth of digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one.	000134	000457	000355	000493	000133	000548	000241	000628	000007	000131	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/3/000135/000135.html

Through an open-ended survey and virtual panel discussion, our study outlines the experience of historians using various digital tools. The results of the study reveal the variety of users interested in digital tools as well as their enthusiasm, reactions, and frustrations, including the expectations and confusion that has created barriers to tool use and to the wider adoption of new research methodologies.

It will then examine the apogee of intra-Biblical linking systems in the Thompson Chain Reference Bible, particularly its chain-referencing system for thematic linking between texts. Finally, it will use this mature print technology to consider the state of the hyperlink in current Web-interfaces. It will show that while in many ways modern attempts at a dynamic hyperlink surpass this elaborate linking system in functionality, in a few key functions this old print technology out-performs what is commonly and readily available in current Web-browsers. In pursing this comparative analysis we aim to demonstrate the importance of understanding the organization and navigational structure of the codex in designing digital reading environments that will meet and surpass the affordances of print.	000181	000199	000117	000192	000197	000569	000257	000021	000029	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000137/000137.html

However, there has as yet been little scholarship that problematizes the exhibition of manuscripts and the responses they elicit from their audiences. This essay, then, investigates the cultural perception of handwriting as an inherently unique and authentic embodiment of its writer, the assumption of which lies behind its display. Through a series of close readings of responses to the sight of the autograph, I examine the ways in which handwriting’s association with the human body has been historically shaped and interpreted; its current function as a locus for concerns about the loss or degradation of corporeal identity in an increasingly technologized world; and how multimedia museum exhibitions of handwritten documents — as digitally manipulable surrogates of original artifacts — expose, complicate, and break down the oppositions in this cultural discourse. Ultimately, I argue, digital interactives are part of a new exhibitionary paradigm, which not only offers new ways of considering an artifact’s essential meaning, but also refines and redefines our understanding of human effort, intentionality, and embodiment in a digital age.	000382	000102	000161	000356	000159	000234	000052	000214	000457	000151	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000138/000138.html

Its argument, implied in the catalogue version, can be stated explicitly in the present scholarly format, namely that narrative, associated with the development of the modern novel in print, is distinctly unsuited to literary arts produced in and for the electronic medium. Narrative in the Dynamo! is not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into question. The same holds for the place of argumentation in critical writing. The Dynamo! develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and by the popular and literary narratives it samples; the essay develops similarly, in blocks of partly autobiographical, partly analytical text. Propositions emerge not sequentially or through feats of interpretation, but at the moment when a block of text encounters a cited image from the Dynamo! Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of contemporary fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative was only ever a mode, one among many and not necessarily the dominant mode, in print literature itself. References are made to Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, to Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear, non-sequential narratives by Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are as open to innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter. In this context, Graphic Sublime also introduces a major, as yet unpublished novel from the early 1970s by Phillip Wohlstetter, Valparaiso.	000503	000161	000101	000171	000162	000214	000264	000225	000234	000104	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000139/000139.html

Why then, do many scholars of historically-minded fields consider digital humanities to be a “helping discipline” instead of a full-fledged area of study in itself? Beginning with the above question, this paper explores the ways in which scholars need not use the digital humanities to update historical disciplines or vice versa. By examining the pre- and post-print histories of the book, and interrogating the ways in which reading technologies and interfaces link the past and future of the book together, the past and present histories of reading coalesce and offer scholars novel ways of approaching many different disciplines that engage with the digital humanities.	000546	000207	000155	000154	000171	000321	000478	000256	000369	000113	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000140/000140.html
000141	2012	6.2	Terry Harpold	University of Florida	The Underside of the Digital Field	This essay takes as axiomatic that the subject of new media – which in other contexts we call the user, the reader, the writer (or in institutional contexts, the researcher, the teacher, the student…) – is a subject of language. This subject’s engagements with media and, by way of media, with other subjects, are determined by relations founded on language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the social bond of discourse. I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital field, particularly as the field shifts towards a more unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing, can be described in relation to the graphs of Lacan’s four discourses – of the University, Master, Hysteric, and Analyst. I conclude that deliberate reflection on structures of our research and pedagogy, mapped by the graphs, may lead us beyond the confidence games of the master and the University – on and by which our inquiries are founded and oriented, but also narrowed – to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose collaborations are more productive of new forms of knowledge.	000369	000457	000472	000055	000207	000171	000154	000099	000312	000158	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/000141.html

As a consequence, our approach to culture may be modified because technology allows us to now visualize our thoughts and theories using digital and computing techniques. This research focuses on merging humanities research with computational sciences to explore the processes involved in culture dynamics. We present an interdisciplinary approach that combines literary studies, economics, and agent-based modeling (ABM) and give details of how literature maybe used as a data set that can be translated into a dynamic Java-based simulation of human interactions constructed around Game Theory. Our model of Cross-Cultural Cooperation is designed to study culture at various levels of granularity simultaneously in order to show how micro-behaviors might lead to macro outcomes such as cultural group formation. We present one experiment based on the literature of discovery and conquest in the U.S. Southwest translated into the language of ABM. Additionally, we explore the role of space, time, and population-size in this process and offer a discussion of possible future directions for this type of research. The creation of our simulator of cultural exchange between individuals of differing cultures allows researchers to experiment with ideas about first and ongoing contact and speculate with “What if?” scenarios.	000195	000352	000355	000241	000007	000457	000336	000608	000409	000347	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000142/000142.html
000143	2013	7.1	Johanna Drucker	UCLA	Performative Materiality and Theoretical Approaches to Interface	This article outlines a critical framework for a theory of performative materiality and its potential application to interface design from a humanistic perspective. Discussions of the materiality of digital media have become richer and more complex in the last decade, calling the literal, physical, and networked qualities of digital artifacts and systems to attention. This article extends those discussions by reconnecting them to a longer history of investigations of materiality and the specificity of media in critical theory and aesthetics. In addition, it introduces the concept of performative materiality, the enacted and event-based character of digital activity supported by those literal, physical conditions, and introduces the theoretical concerns that attach to that rubric. Performative materiality is based on the conviction that a system should be understood by what it does, not only how it is structured. As digital humanities matures, it can benefit from a re-engagement with the mainstream principles of critical theory on which a model of performative materiality is based. The article takes these ideas into a more focused look at how we might move towards integrating this model and critical principles into a model of humanistic interface design.	000118	000386	000457	000557	000158	000439	000110	000496	000239	000329	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000143/000143.html
000144	2013	7.1	Ryan Cordell	Northeastern University	Taken Possession of: The Reprinting and Reauthorship of Hawthorne's Celestial Railroad in the Antebellum Religious Press	In this article, Cordell demonstrates the transformative possibilities of large-scale digital archives for literary history and bibliography. Focusing on the recently-uncovered reprinting history of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story, The Celestial Railroad, in the nineteenth-century press, the article demonstrates the central, shaping influence of religious readers and editors on Hawthorne’s early career. Cordell shows how the best traditional bibliography of Hawthorne’s works could be dramatically altered after only a few weeks’ work in digital archives of newspapers, magazines, and books, and using relatively simple search tools. Such tools not only expanded the number of known witnesses of the text, but also uncovered numerous paratexts: introductions to the story, articles reviewing or referring to the story, sermons derived from the story, etc. This social text of The Celestial Railroad, Cordell argues, lay buried amidst millions of pages that accumulated in the nineteenth century and required modern tools to be uncovered. The article also discusses how digital interpretive tools can help make better sense of such enlarged bibliographies. By comparing multiple printings of The Celestial Railroad using the Juxta Collation tool from NINES, Cordell argues that textual fluidity can tell modern readers much about how texts were understood by their original publishers and readers. The many changes to and discussions of The Celestial Railroad, for instance, indicate that the tale was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but nonetheless deployed as a weapon in denominational debates.	000207	000003	000152	000178	000113	000140	000595	000171	000240	000062	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/000144.html

Such representations take part of a network where cultural, ethnic, social, artistic, literary, and racial information circulates, giving shape to centers with multiple connections at different scales. In accordance with this, the main aim of this article is to demonstrate how Cuba’s predominance for the representation of such cultural pattern is not only based on the significance of particular artistic figures, but also on the connectivity that the island as a cultural node has with respect to the ‘global’ network of African and African-descendant representations. In order to achieve this aim, we carry out two main tasks: a) network analysis looking at related concepts such as centrality, connectivity, betweenness, modularity, etc., through a methodology that takes into account topic-map analysis and the use of Page Ranking Algorithm [the algorithm used by good part of search engines such as Google] as the basic formula to filter and organize information; b) local analysis of two nodes that take part of Cuba’s cluster in order to compare the results of the analysis of networks with a more socio-literary analysis that focuses on detailed reading of some of their messages (works, paratexts, prologues, interviews, etc): Nicolás Guillén and Alejo Carpentier. As matter of conclusions, we evaluate not only our findings with regards to Cuba but also the methodology as a contribution to the field of the Digital humanities and its practices of analysis.	000353	000346	000347	000608	000338	000604	000355	000352	000613	000534	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000145/000145.html

This essay shows that there are many other features of literary texts by which humanists make meaning other than the word, such as prosody and sound, and how computational methods allow us to do what has historically been a more difficult method of analysis — trying to understand how literary texts make meaning with these features. This paper will discuss a case study that uses theories of knowledge representation and research on phonetic and prosodic symbolism to develop analytics and visualizations that help readers discover aural and prosodic patterns in literary texts. To this end, this paper has two parts: (I) We describe the theories of knowledge representation and research into phonetic and prosodic symbolism that underpin the logics and ontologies of aurality incorporated in our project. This basic theory of aurality is reflected in our use of OpenMary, a text-to-speech application tool for extracting aural features; in the flow we coordinated to pre-process texts in SEASR’s Meandre, a data flow environment; in the instance-based predictive modeling procedure that we developed for the project; and in ProseVis, the reader interface that we created to allow readers to discover aural features across literary texts. And (II), we discuss readings of several works by Gertrude Stein (the portraits Matisse and Picasso and the prose poem Tender Buttons) that were facilitated by this work.	000364	000346	000254	000229	000507	000457	000173	000548	000496	000512	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000146/000146.html
000147	2013	7.1	Robin Wharton	Independent Scholar	Digital Humanities, Copyright Law, and the Literary	Embedded in the rich textual record of international copyright law, we often encounter a quaint, and perhaps naïve definition of the literary around which the law has crystallized and which has the potential to influence the work of all digital humanists, whether they think of themselves as literary scholars or not. The first part of this article explores how a relatively narrow definition of the literary as a category of high or belletristic cultural production has informed the contours of U.S. copyright law, in particular. Section 101, Title 17 of the United States Code expressly defines literary works as any works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied . US courts have, however, often employed a narrower, more commonplace understanding of the literary as an aesthetic category when sorting artifacts or content into other legally more significant categories such as idea, expression, criticism, parody, and satire. The second section of the article considers some of the potential implications and consequences of the current regulatory structure for the work of digital humanists. Judges engaging in a fair use analysis more often than not expect scholarship to come packaged in print monographs written in academic language aimed at an audience of disciplinary specialists. When they encounter scholarly artifacts that depart from those formal expectations and draw from pre-existing work, judges are less likely to find the use of pre-existing work is fair and therefore non-infringing. Finally, the article examines whether the literary as a category should be abandoned altogether, or whether digital humanists might productively redefine the literary as part of a strategy for re-imagining the institutional and legal regulations that govern academic work.	000154	000155	000171	000207	000232	000256	000140	000616	000314	000226	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000147/000147.html
000148	2013	7.1	Ed Finn	Arizona State University	Revenge of the Nerd: Junot Díaz and the Networks of American Literary Imagination	Junot Díaz’s writing actively questions the boundaries between genre and literary fiction, aesthetics and politics, and English and Spanish, using a framework of multiple linguistic, formal and cultural registers to establish an authorial presence that defies critical categorization. Díaz arrived explosively on the U.S. literary scene with his second book, the novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. The multi-generational story of a Dominican American family overshadowed by a brutal dictatorship and the challenges of forging a new life in the United States earned many accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. I read Díaz’s transgressive blending of genre and linguistic registers as a reverse colonization that calls into question the demarcations of American ethnicity as well as the racial politics of nerds. My argument uses Díaz as both an object of study and a paradigm for the potential of a hybrid digital humanities methodology. The complex cultural translation that Díaz asks his readers to perform creates a middle ground where Caribbean history, language politics and the class and ethnic tensions of immigration collide with the nerdy core of the mainstream American imagination.	000287	000494	000531	000157	000524	000353	000369	000491	000226	000171	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/000148.html

Often assembled by software as facsimile publications or OCR ""plain text"" editions, then printed and delivered before the text is seen by human eyes, these POD books are altering how the material weight of the past bears on the present.

000151	2013	7.1	Matthew Kirschenbaum	University of Maryland	The .txtual Condition: Digital Humanities, Born-Digital Archives, and the Future Literary	In 1995 in the midst of the first widespread wave of digitization, the Modern Language Association issued a Statement on the Significance of Primary Records in order to assert the importance of retaining books and other physical artifacts even after they have been microfilmed or scanned for general consumption. A primary record, the MLA told us then, can appropriately be defined as a physical object produced or used at the particular past time that one is concerned with in a given instance (27). Today, the conceit of a primary record can no longer be assumed to be coterminous with that of a physical object. Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all sorts are also now, indisputably, primary records. In the specific domain of the literary, a writer working today will not and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, because the basic material evidence of their authorial activity — manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals — is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm. This essay therefore seeks to locate and triangulate the emergence of a .txtual condition — I am of course remediating Jerome McGann’s influential notion of a “textual condition” — amid our contemporary constructions of the literary, along with the changing nature of literary archives, and lastly activities in the digital humanities as that enterprise is now construed. In particular, I will use the example of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland as a means of illustrating the kinds of resources and expertise a working digital humanities center can bring to the table when confronted with the range of materials that archives and manuscript repositories will increasingly be receiving.	000256	000154	000140	000546	000207	000616	000321	000171	000155	000087	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000151/000151.html
000152	2013	7.1	Mike Frangos	University of Umeå	The End of Literature: Machine Reading and Amitav Ghosh’s The Calcutta Chromosome	Digital humanities discussions of distant reading, machine reading or not-reading have often turned on a depiction of the field of literary production in which individual texts and authors recede in importance as units of analysis. At the same time, the question of what is specific to the literary in discussions of electronic textuality, or the digital literary, has been under-analyzed. This article contributes to theorizing the digital literary by way of an analysis (or close reading) of the role of machine reading in a postcolonial science fiction novel by Amitav Ghosh, The Calcutta Chromosome. This novel participates in the imagination of electronic textuality and digital forensics at a moment when the imagined possibilities of the digital archive were of intense interest to both cultural critics and literary writers. The figure of the writer of vernacular literature in the novel, I argue, brings together the text's interest in both electronic textuality and the subaltern archive, thus establishing the stakes of the digital precisely on a revamped role for the literary in the context of globalization. As such, Ghosh's novel provides a useful opportunity for re-considering proposals for distant reading in relation to world literary studies and postcolonial criticism.	000207	000171	000113	000140	000546	000178	000616	000154	000369	000314	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000152/000152.html

"What does the category of the literary give to digital humanities? Nothing and everything. This essay considers the ""idiocy"" of the literary: its unaccountable singularity, which guarantees that we continue to return to it as a source, inspiration, and challenge. As a consequence, digital humanities is inspired and irritated by the literary. My essay shows this in three ways. First, through a speculative exploration of the relation between digital humanities and the category of ""the literary."" Second, through a quick survey of the use of literature in digital humanities project. Thirdly, through a specific examination of TEI and character rendering as digital humanities concerns that necessarily engage with the literary. Once again, the literary remains singular and not abstract, literal in a way that challenges and provokes us towards new digital humanities work."	000154	000241	000140	000171	000020	000207	000314	000065	000112	000546	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000155/000155.html

Assessing Feminist Interventions in Digital Literary Archives	This essay is a meditation on the possibility of a feminist assessment of digital literary archives and the interdisciplinary tools needed to do such work. Using the Women Writers Project and The Orlando Project as exemplary instances of digital literary scholarship, I discuss possible sites of feminist intervention (content, technological politics, labor structures,etc) and the kinds of theoretical paradigms one might use in such work. I also argue that such assessments are essential to recognizing the ways in which feminist digital literary studies have impacted the field of digital humanities. Drawing on recent work in technology studies and feminist theory, the essay problematizes simplistic celebratory claims and troubles the idea that simply saving women’s work in digital form is enough. I conclude with a set of reflections on the impact of shifting ideas about the value of feminist work and theory in both public and scholarly contexts. This includes a proposal that more established scholars proactively highlight the feminist interventions that they make and that all digital literary scholars consider increasing access to not only the work of women, but to the technologies that are integral to that access as well.	000527	000209	000217	000616	000186	000428	000216	000422	000207	000528	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000156/000156.html

Although the tool can be applied to any border, the chief border it has been tied to and tested on is the US-Mexico border. The EDT present the project as an artistic disruption of the tired national political theater staged at that border. The piece refocuses attention on the basic human needs of those caught in the middle of the stale and stalemated divide. For the EDT, every part of the piece participates in this disruption not merely the finished app or the poetry but the code as well. In this paper, I ask, what would it mean for the code to poetic disruption? One set of poetry for the project created by Amy Sara Carroll offers instructions for desert survival. By presenting instructions as poems, she offers one entre into reading the source code of the app as poetry.

The central role of the curator has been further emphasized with the rise of the curator as artist and the institutional and physical limitations of museum spaces. We argue that there are important alternative spaces of meaning to be developed between object and audience. Digital curating, in particular, allows for greater audience participation, both by expanding the potential audience and by allowing visitors to navigate through the virtual galleries under their own direction. We contend that by facilitating the site visitors’ creation of their own visual arguments, a new level of audience participation in visual analysis — indeed, in a fundamental intellectual and intuitive aspect of curating — is made possible. We explore how digital resources can be modified to allow for that contextual sense of making a visual argument through arrangement. An installation at the University of Houston debuted a new tool for digital content management and allows us to make some preliminary observations about the process of visual analysis, its role in curatorial practice, and explore future directions for work.	000290	000497	000227	000275	000547	000487	000262	000337	000228	000239	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/2/000159/000159.html

It attempts to reinscribe the body in ekphrastic practice by adding touch to the abstracted visualism of the eye, and emphasize defining features of the ancient usage: orality, immediacy and tactility. What I call the digital ekphrasis with its emphasis on enargeia, its strong connections with the ancient definition, and on the bodily interaction with the work of art, conveys an aesthetic of tactility; digitalis=finger. By tracing and elucidating a historical trajectory that takes the concept of ekphrasis in the ancient culture as a starting point, the intention is not to reject the theories of the late 1900s, but through a reinterpretation of ekphrasis put forward an example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could challenge or revise more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities. In this context ‘the digital’ is not only a phenomenon that could be tied to certain digital objects or used as a digital tool, but as an approach to history, with strong critical potential. The aim is to show that one of the most important features of our digital culture is that it offers new perspectives – not only on current technology – but also on literary, cultural and aesthetic historical practices.	000246	000155	000457	000158	000503	000207	000601	000253	000171	000407	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000161/000161.html

Funkhouser, New Directions in Digital Poetry (London: Continuum, 2012). Both books engage new media works and practices in ways that are transformative of the conceptual apparatus and tools of literary theory and literary analysis. Moving between the deep analysis of the Funkhouser’s and the high-level abstraction of Eskelinen’s will give readers an exhilarating sense of just how new media is changing our aesthetical experience and our way of thinking and writing about the textual experience. Markku Eskelinen’s Cybertext Poetics and C.T. Funkouser’s New Directions in Digital Poetry set new standards for the theory and analysis of digital texts. Eskelinen’s groundbreaking book synthesizes his research of the last decade into a theory for the new media textual condition with profound implications for the entire field of poetics. Through Eskelinen’s transmedial reframing of the operative categories of the field, it becomes clear how certain universals of literary theory have been in fact strongly dependent on a limited corpus of print-based situations. Funkhouser’s close readings of digital poetry are also deeply informed by a hands-on poetics of digital writing and reading practices on the web. Building on his historical account of computer poetry , his main concern here is to analyze the multimedia and programmable specificity of post-WWW digital poetry. Eskelinen’s permutational descriptions of the narratological and ludological variables involved in ergodic and non-ergodic works, and Funkhouser’s close attention to the signifying dynamics sustained by the variability of programmable forms extend the critical landscape for thinking about literary poiesis, digital and otherwise.	000207	000154	000155	000171	000113	000616	000503	000314	000178	000152	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/3/000162/000162.html

Now is the Future Now? argues that the progress made in digital humanities toward these goals has depended and will depend not only on digital data, but also on their appropriate curation.

It then considers and evaluates the digital curation work undertaken in the sciences and in the humanities after the report’s publication. In theory and in practice digital curation has benefited substantially from practices developed and tested first in the natural sciences and subsequently adapted for and extended in the humanities.

The issue arises with particular force when we consider how to cite digital humanities projects and tools.

Instead of reaching fixed endings, such works also tend to be of indefinite length or at least suggest indefinite possible combinations. I argue that the impact of such works can instead be found in how one attempts to work through their underlying grammar, based on limits in the algorithms that generate the content — not those limits themselves, but how their outlines come to be known. Repetitively iterating through these works simultaneously upholds the chance nature of the epiphenomenal occurrences while also illustrating the sameness of the underlying algorithm over time, creating a future-oriented interpretive arc. I examine two works that play off of this technique in different ways: Nick Montfort’s Taroko Gorge, a poetry generator which uses random generation to distill the essence of its object’s possibility, and the action role-playing game Torchlight, which attempts to elevate chance beyond a mere gameplay mechanic and toward an ethic.	000069	000325	000503	000171	000104	000022	000002	000101	000085	000548	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/3/000165/000165.html

All three parts of the interface can be edited; edits in any individual section appear in the others; and all three can be played back simultaneously. While emphasizing that the traditional medium of theatrical performance is the actor’s body moving in time and space, and providing a digital analogue for that medium, the system also frees users from the limitations of the single, time-bound spectator’s perspective.

If this is the case, it ought to concern Digital Humanities (DH) scholars, many of whom continue to be more interested in how we connect than in the substance and dialogue of that very connectedness. I would like to argue for a better balance between the how and the what of DH - for a qualitative turn of sorts away from an interest in gaining and making accessible more information only, to an interest in also making sense of and understanding that information. For such a turn, computer scientists need input from the humanities whose specialty has always been to turn information into knowledge by means of critical interpretation and contextualization.	000351	000065	000369	000261	000477	000241	000620	000020	000080	000136	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/3/000167/000167.html

This paper traces the steps taken in a collaborative research project that aimed to analyze newspaper coverage of a high-profile murder trial, which occurred in New York City in 1873. A corpus of approximately one-half million words was produced by converting original print sources and image files into digital texts, which produced a substantial rate of OCR-generated errors. We then corrected the scans and added document-level genre metadata. This allowed us to evaluate the impact of our quality upgrade procedures when we tested for possible differences in word usage across two key phases in the trial's coverage using log likelihood ratio . The same tests were run on each dataset – the original OCR scans, a subset of OCR scans selected through the addition of genre metadata, and the metadata-enhanced scans corrected to 98% accuracy. Our results revealed that error correction is desirable but not essential. However, metadata to distinguish between different genres of trial coverage, obtained during the correction process, had a substantial impact. This was true both when investigating all words and when testing for a subset of judgment words we created to explore the murder’s emotive elements and its moral implications. Deeper analysis of this case, and others like it, will require more sophisticated text mining techniques to disambiguate word sense and context, which may be more sensitive to OCR-induced errors.	000268	000220	000365	000412	000288	000346	000578	000524	000576	000553	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/1/000168/000168.html

There is a growing tendency in some disciplines to publish a digital paper together with supplements such as images, videos, 3D-models and underlying data. More information requires a better usability in terms of overview and finding information, which has led to new features in journals and thus to modifying and extending this genre. These so-called enhanced publications or rich internet publications have various physical forms: PDF documents with embedded interactive models, HTML files enriched with hyperlinks to contextual information and with facilities to highlight information in the text, or aggregations of documents and other resources linked together through metadata which make them findable for semantic search engines. However, many of the originally print-based journals, particularly in the humanities and social sciences, are still rather conservative in format and offer hardly any opportunities for enhanced publishing, which leaves room for some form of self-publishing, perhaps as addition to a regular journal article. In this paper we introduce the Xpos’re tools for authoring and displaying an interactive multimedia scholarly publication, which may be created as a digital companion to a regular journal paper and published, for example, on the author or institution’s website in order to share related research products and to achieve greater visibility. We also report about practical experiences with this software in a few research projects. The Xpos’re software (see: http://xposre.nl/software/) comprises a Flash-based document reader and a set of extensions (plug-ins) that extend the basic functionality of this text browser. The extensions are used to display specific types of multimedia that provide additional functionality, such as viewing images, videos and interactive maps. The input text is XML based, which not only guarantees a durable and flexible encoding of content, but also allows automatic rendering in different formats according to the preferences of users and the limitations of their hardware. In addition, the XML source can be easily transformed to an RDF resource map to meet the requirements of the semantic web. The document reader generates output in HTML, in two flavors, namely a slide based version that uses JavaScript, and a plain HTML text (single page), which is most suitable for printing and which can be used to create e-books. This plain HTML text can also be displayed in a format similar to that of scientific journals through the Xpos’re HTML Reader, which has more features than the automatically generated slides and which can be highly customized by the user.	000459	000030	000071	000457	000164	000352	000453	000608	000061	000458	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000169/000169.html

Popular songs are a good representation of modern culture and society. Songs by female singer-songwriters account for a large portion of the current Japanese hit charts and particularly play an important role in understanding the Japanese language and communication style. In this study, we applied new methods of computational stylistics to the lyrics of the songs. The results clearly show differences in the characteristics of 10 female singer-songwriters, and we found that the visualization of the lyrics is a typical characteristic of current singer-songwriters. Our findings provide an important case study for computational stylistics and can also be useful for understanding Japanese cultural trends.	000364	000440	000499	000341	000146	000346	000188	000434	000362	000520	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/1/000170/000170.html

Particular attention is given to Moretti’s uptake of Immanuel Wallerstein, to his controversial critique of close reading, and to the variety of digital-humanistic methods that comprise Moretti’s quantitative formalism. Most valuable as an artifact of literary-critical history rather than a how-to guide or theoretical treatise, this hodgepodge of essays is at its best as an audacious and defensive academic memoir tracing Moretti’s transformation into a digital humanist. As Moretti champions the broad explanatory power of quantitative literary analysis, he overestimates the scientific objectivity of his analyses while undervaluing the productively suggestive stories of doubt, failure, and compromise that lend nuance and depth to his hypotheses. Combative, absorbing, highly topical, and unevenly persuasive, Distant Reading embodies both the optimism of early digital literary studies and its perils.	000207	000154	000155	000113	000140	000152	000369	000178	000317	000616	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/1/000171/000171.html

It proceeds by isolating a key debate for examination, describing two concepts that go a significant distance to solving issues raised by that debate (but not far enough), and exploring the theoretical writings of a selection of high profile digital humanists. The goal (a non-trivial undertaking) is to illustrate the utility of postfoundationalism as a conceptual tool, its interdependence with postindustrial culture, and the light it sheds on our understanding of what DH is. If successful the article, rather than making an essentialist claim that Digital Humanities is defined by postfoundational method, will constitute a contribution to the developing digital humanities agenda.	000065	000112	000020	000277	000077	000241	000617	000396	000208	000335	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/1/000172/000172.html

Good design is user-centered, focused, and needs-driven, all of which depend on a rich understanding of the target audience or end user. Unsworth’s scholarly primitives and the work of Palmer, Teffeau and Pirmann on scholarly information practices provide a framework for understanding how humanities scholars do their work. We propose applying this framework to the design of a spoken word archive, with the aim of designing a digital tool that is optimized for the documented practices of scholars. We propose that listening and annotation are key activities of humanities scholars performing literary criticism of audio recordings. Taking the SpokenWeb poetry project as an example, we discuss how designing a web-based tool with these key activities in mind could facilitate close and critical engagement with recordings of spoken poetry. We present a methodology for designing a web-based sound archive for literary criticism and we propose features and functionalities that facilitate this criticism.	000254	000512	000239	000543	000507	000227	000586	000029	000516	000542	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000173/000173.html

But coursework and publications related to DH project management tend to focus heavily on the difficulties of planning and launching a new project rather than the challenges of maintaining an established one. Meanwhile, online advice for would-be managers is couched in the language of tips and tricks or steps for beginners. Together these phenomena downplay the professional skills needed to successfully manage a project while suggesting that project management is necessary only in the beginning stages of an endeavor. They may even give the impression that scholarship in the digital humanities is inherently ephemeral. Through a case study of project management practices at the William Blake Archive, which began publishing electronic scholarly editions in 1996, this essay details the challenges and rewards of managing an established digital humanities project. Managers of mature projects may be called upon to oversee expansions in scope and mission, research and recommend new features and tools, grow or shrink the number of project staff, seek out alternate sources of support when early grants run out, maintain continuity as collaborators join and leave the project, and develop new workflows and procedures to reflect these and other changes.	000037	000411	000241	000007	000302	000441	000077	000284	000643	000420	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/1/000174/000174.html

This article focuses on the Boerenpartij(Farmers’ Party), the first political party from the far right that entered Dutch parliament after the Second World War (WWII). The Boerenpartij is remembered as being stigmatized by the traditional political parties as wrong ( fout ), as National Socialism and its supporters were dubbed in the Netherlands.

It proposes an alternative digital humanities approach to the study of world literature, advocating new methods of close comparative reading rather than the mode of distant reading endorsed by Franco Moretti and Alan Liu . Specifically, the research method proposed here is focused on a close reading of the novel The Secret Scripture (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with comparative reference to Pat Barker’s well-known war novel Regeneration (1997). Through the development and implementation of a digital humanities research method which facilitates new forms of digital literary analysis, we demonstrate that close reading and digital humanities can too be practicing partners in a way that serves to advance work in both the fields of world literature and digital literary studies.	000274	000171	000113	000154	000207	000152	000155	000446	000595	000546	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/000178.html

000180	2014	8.2	David Dowling	University of Iowa	Escaping the Shallows: Deep Reading’s Revival in the Digital Age	Among the many reactions against the digital revolution is a humanitarian movement toward long form online reading in collective and social networks. This movement — visible in online book clubs such as Infinite Summer and 1book140, websites such as longreads.com, and the trend of blogs-to-books publication — is a reaction against superficial increasingly brief headline-driven Internet news. Called to action by the threat of what critic Jessica Helfand has diagnosed as digital culture’s narrative depravation, the deep reading revival has reclaimed narrative and returned it to the populace, transforming reading into an act of mass collaboration on an unprecedented scale. Despite studies corroborating Nicholas Carr’s claim in The Shallows (2011) that the distractions of the digital environment are anathema to immersive linear deep reading, online culture has actually enhanced and accelerated the appreciation of longer richer works through its support of radial reading as described by Jerome McGann. This essay argues that while the intrinsically distracting virtual geography of the Internet has threatened to diminish the role of textured narrative in our intellectual and social lives, the Web has ironically provided the media for the most salient movements in support of the deep reading it threatens to obliterate.	000113	000171	000389	000207	000369	000356	000616	000478	000446	000154	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000180/000180.html

Canonical numbers are complex interpretive mechanisms with a great deal of potential for anyone editing and using electronic texts. In this essay I consider the rationale for and nature of canonical reference systems, to recommend principles to consider when deploying them in digital projects. After briefly reviewing the history of canonical references I note how they have been used so far, emphasizing the advances made by Canonical Text Services (CTS). I argue that the practical and theoretical problems that remain unaddressed require engagement with descriptions of how textual scholarship works and how notional literary works relate to the artefacts that carry them (using Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, FRBR). By correlating a theory of canonical reference numbers with those two models — editorial workflow and creative works — I offer key principles that should be addressed when planning, writing, and using digital projects.	000194	000111	000489	000164	000053	000137	000150	000192	000029	000028	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000181/000181.html

Here we extend his concept of the techno-image (successor of the pre-historical hand-drawn image and the historical printed word), to consider the digital image-text that today dominates reading and writing. Our question: Can we reader-writers think the digitas, or are we doomed to perform its functions in an automati[c] or robotiz[ed] fashion, as Flusser put it, so that, if anything, the digitas now thinks us? The short answer to our question is as follows: we can think the digitas, but only if we consider it, firstly, as a kind of writing (digital orthography) and, secondly, as a caricature of thinking, both impoverished and, dare we say it, funny (digital caricature).	000161	000234	000457	000560	000197	000052	000034	000608	000030	000398	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/3/000182/000182.html

Pay close attention to the balance of traditional methods and new ways of conducting research. When gathering resources to do the job, seek contributions of different domain experts. Also, careful consideration of a tool’s intended scope will help refine the required resources needed to complete a project. This case study illustrates how one project, the Social Networks and Archival Context Project (SNAC), has defined these variables. The process of building a new tool also benefits from an awareness of older infrastructure that has come before it. SNAC illustrates this awareness in the way it has taken advantage of previously existing infrastructure, both cyber and not, by extending its purpose and building new features on top of it.	000241	000090	000007	000073	000413	000453	000123	000347	000077	000464	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/3/000184/000184.html

In classic comic book collections such as Watchmen and Batman: Year One by Alan Moore and Frank Miller, the original scripts by the authors are included in special editions in both print and Kindle format. But these original script pages are shrouded in forms of anonymity as they illustrate signs of digitization, either through scanning or during production and thus display various visual clues, such as errors, which relay levels of realness. Furthermore online versions of these script pages, found on fan website databases and authors’ blogs, are complicated by the anonymity the Internet and digital editions produce. Therefore a digital forensics methodology is used to interrogate these script pages in both print and digital format to create an ordering system for digitally manipulated text. It also endeavours to illustrate the possibilities for a forming digital forensics field by using various technical calculations and recreations of text with original software and hardware.	000087	000457	000117	000253	000460	000546	000021	000264	000212	000608	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/3/000185/000185.html

Aspects of the science question that consider the politics underlying epistemologies of purportedly value-neutral claims and practices resonate for the work (the research, theory, and practices) being done to build information infrastructure in the humanities today — the work that I am defining here as digital humanities work. Reconsidering this work by using the lens of feminist inquiry to understand the concerns common to information science and digital humanities is the perspective I describe here.

Prior to my interventions, the primary method for reading faint, obscured, and obliterated manuscript texts had been multi-spectral imaging, which is prohibitively expensive, limiting its utility as a general research tool, although it is still sometimes in use. There have not been many alternative digital paleographical methodologies. The potential of image manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop, has been noted by a few scholars, but not explored. Working in Adobe Photoshop, I have developed a method of deciphering heavily deleted or obliterated text through the use of layering techniques, altered color levels, and the employment of certain kinds of filters. The method is more advanced than simple image enlargement techniques used by most researchers. Importantly though, it remains far less expensive than multi-spectral imaging. The technique contributed to the recovery of nearly all of the obliterated text in the first two volumes of The Court Journals and Letters of Frances Burney, which were published by Oxford University Press in 2011, and it was also used within in-progress volumes from The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Samuel Richardson.

Screenplays contain capitalized character names, indented dialogue, and other formatting conventions that enable an algorithmic approach to analyzing and visualizing film narratives. In this article, the authors introduce their new tool, ScripThreads, which parses screenplays, outputs statistical values which can be analyzed, and offers four different types of visualization, each with its own utility.

Through a focused study of Jonathan Safran Foer’s Tree of Codes, this article confronts the difficulty of citation as an occasion to develop a web based prototype or model of this decidedly paper bound text. The result of this experiment produced a digitized version of Tree of Codes that allows for a further discussion of issues of loss, deformation, and versioning alongside a wider conversation on presentation semantics on the web and browser capabilities. This article argues that experimental features on the web have a great deal to gain in a reciprocal exchange between experimental print media.	000181	000039	000459	000601	000561	000455	000150	000194	000199	000307	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/4/000192/000192.html

The Electronic Literature Organization’s 2012 Media Art Show, for example, hosted exhibits in five different locations in Morgantown, including a community arts center, local gallery, the university library, a department’s conference room, and the city’s amphitheater, while the MLA 2012 and 2013 exhibits were held at the Washington State and Hynes convention centers, respectively. The Library of Congress, the most important repository of books in the U.S., hosted Electronic Literature & Its Emerging Forms in April 2013 while Illuminations gallery at University of Ireland Maymooth featured an exhibit of electronic literature in March 2014. This range of venues suggests a flexibility and appeal of electronic literature that is both scalable and broad. With these qualities in mind, this article outlines the various exhibits of electronic literature that the author has curated in order to highlight the two main challenges facing all scholars curating digital –– that is, the challenge of availability and the challenge of presentation.	000111	000154	000616	000046	000207	000314	000425	000017	000155	000163	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/4/000194/000194.html

000198	2015	9.1	Katina Rogers	The Graduate Center, City University of New York	Humanities Unbound: Supporting Careers and Scholarship Beyond the Tenure Track	As humanities scholars increasingly recognize the value of public engagement, and as the proportion of tenure-track faculty positions available to new graduates continues to decline, many humanities programs are focusing renewed attention on equipping graduate students for careers as scholars both within and beyond academe. To support those efforts, the Scholarly Communication Institute has carried out a study investigating perceptions about career preparation provided by humanities graduate programs. The survey results help to create a more solid foundation on which to base curricular reform and new initiatives by moving the conversation about varied career paths from anecdote to data. The findings make it clear that there are a number of effective interventions that programs can undertake. Many of the skills that people working beyond the tenure track identify as crucial to their positions — things like project management, collaboration, and communication — are also highly beneficial to those working within the professoriate. Structuring courses and projects in a way that emphasizes the acquisition of these skills not only contributes to the success of students who pursue employment outside the tenure track, but also to the vibrant research, teaching, and service of those who pursue academic roles. With the availability of new data to work from and the recommendations above as possible guiding principles, graduate programs have a robust set of tools available that can help facilitate curricular assessment and new initiatives. As the importance of assessing the effectiveness of existing structures and considering potential benefits of reform continues to grow, humanities programs have a strong incentive to demonstrate the ways that their graduate programs contribute to the vitality of the university and the broader public sphere. Equipping graduate students with the skills and literacies needed for 21st century scholarly work — from technical fluency to an understanding of organizational structures — is critical to ensuring continued rigorous and creative research, scholarship, and teaching.	000421	000420	000302	000006	000174	000418	000643	000597	000570	000077	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000198/000198.html

The course built on a core pedagogical principle in Computer Science of teaching through projects rather than from unrelated one-off programming or web development assignments. Teaching the Text Encoding Initiative after students had completed hands-on projects (using xHTML, CSS, and a digital archive working in a standard content management system) enabled the building of technological skill sets in a logical and complementary manner. From a literary perspective, building a digital archive — and teaching text encoding — enabled an in-depth consideration of textual materiality, the processes through which literary scholarship must inform technological building decisions, and the ways in which the act of digitization can be used to ask new questions of the text (or to prompt the text to ask new questions of itself). This paper will survey our techniques and approaches to interdisciplinary teaching, culminating in our usage of text encoding for exploring issues of textuality through digital presentation.	000314	000175	000254	000117	000293	000181	000210	000151	000192	000021	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000199/000199.html

When game studies became an area for scholarly inquiry in the academy, feminist game studies soon followed. The first generation of feminist theory in game studies built on the work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda Laurel, and Janet Murray, although some might argue that the legacy of challenging gender norms in game studies goes back even earlier. Now feminist game scholars organize international conferences, edit journals and scholarly collections, and shape trends in the profession, much as their counterparts in the digital humanities attempt to do, but critics in feminist game studies have been able to take advantage of what is seen as a relatively long trajectory of feminist theoretical inquiry and field development. Articulating a need for a feminist corrective in the digital humanities has come at a much slower pace, perhaps because the instrumentalism of a tool seems much less blatantly anti-feminist than the instrumentalism of a gun. Furthermore, calls to action from more radicalized forms of feminist approaches to science and technology studies have been noticeably absent in the literature around digital information retrieval in the humanities. This issue of DHQ indicates that a sea change may finally be taking place.	000216	000217	000186	000007	000156	000085	000080	000020	000417	000241	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000200/000200.html

In response to Crane, the exploration of the living edition detailed here examines the process of creating a publicly editable edition and considers what that edition, the process by which it was built, and the platform in which it was produced means for editions that support and promote gender equity. Drawing on the scholarship about the culture of the Wikimedia suite of projects, and the gendered trolling experienced by members of our team in the production of the Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript in Wikibooks, and interviews with our advisory group, we argue that while the Wikimedia projects are often openly hostile online spaces, the Wikimedia suite of projects are so important to the contemporary circulation of knowledge, that the key is to encourage gender equity in social behavior, credit sharing, and knowledge organization in Wikimedia, rather than abandon it for a more controlled collaborative environment for edition production and dissemination.	000527	000111	000217	000261	000404	000216	000180	000322	000595	000446	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000202/000202.html

While it can result in unique literary juxtapositions, bricolage also challenges the boundaries of authorial ownership. Understanding the methods and responses to textual bricolage reflects how a culture engages with textuality. Yet such study is often hindered by the sheer extent of compared texts. In this article we explore the potential of using Factotum, text similarity recognition software with visual interface, for analysing textual bricolage. Using examples from medieval and recent texts, we discuss different compilation techniques as well as the interaction between the notions of authorship, plagiarism and intertextuality.	000579	000152	000171	000237	000229	000489	000346	000178	000313	000245	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000203/000203.html

The present study builds on prior work investigating the value and accuracy of folksonomies by: (1) demonstrating the benefit of user-generated tags - or unregulated keywords typically meant for personal organizational purposes - for facilitating item retrieval and (2) assessing the accuracy of descriptive metadata generated via a game-based crowdsourcing application. In this study, participants (N = 16) were first tasked with finding a set of five images using a search index containing either a combination of folksonomic and controlled vocabulary metadata or only controlled vocabulary metadata. Data analysis revealed that participants in the folksonomic and controlled vocabulary search condition were, on average, six times faster to search for each image (M = 25.08 secs) compared to participants searching with access only to controlled vocabulary metadata (M = 154.1 secs), and successfully retrieved significantly more items overall. Following this search task, all participants were asked to provide descriptive metadata for nine digital objects by playing three separate single-player tagging games. Analysis showed that 88% of participant-provided tags were judged to be accurate, and that both tagging patterns and accuracy levels did not significantly differ between groups of professional librarians and participants outside of the Library Science field. These findings illustrate the value of folksonomies for enhancing item findability, or the ease with which a patron can access materials, and the ability of librarians and general users alike to contribute valid, meaningful metadata. This could significantly impact the way libraries and other cultural heritage organizations conceptualize the tasks of searching and classification.	000265	000410	000435	000327	000459	000462	000450	000469	000620	000205	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000204/000204.html

Pressman identifies a genre of contemporary electronic literature, digital modernism, and uncovers continuities linking it with early twentieth-century modernism. In spite of an uneven style that oscillates between belabored scholasticism and brilliant description, Digital Modernism rigorously wrangles a wide array of data points — historical, literary, and technological — to create an account of contemporary electronic literature relevant for digital humanists, literary scholars, and New Media scholars. This review contextualizes the work within new currents in modernist scholarship, reflects on the modernism and digital modernist canon Pressman assembles, and then provides chapter summaries, with an emphasis on Digital Modernism’s reinvention of close reading for the twenty-first century.	000113	000616	000171	000140	000152	000154	000162	000155	000369	000226	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000207/000207.html

Through interviews with digital humanities scholars and academic librarians within the Center for Institutional Cooperation, this study aims to explore some points of common perspective and underlying tensions in research relationships. Qualitative interviews revealed that, while both groups are enthusiastic about the future of faculty-librarian collaboration on digital scholarship, there remain certain tensions about the role of the library and the librarian. Scholars appreciate the specialized expertise of librarians, especially in metadata and special collections, but they can take a more active stance in utilizing current library resources or vocalizing their needs for other resources. This expertise and these services can be leveraged to make the library an active and equal partner in research. Additionally, libraries should address internal issues, such as training and re-skilling librarians as necessary; better-coordinated outreach to academic departments is also needed.	000441	000418	000420	000077	000215	000464	000399	000485	000114	000401	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000213/000213.html
000214	2015	9.3	Aaron Scott Humphrey	University of Adelaide	Multimodal Authoring and Authority in Educational Comics: Introducing Derrida and Foucault for Beginners	Academic writing has generally been understood as operating primarily within the linguistic modality, with writing remediating the voice of an educator or lecturer. Comics, by contrast, are more explicitly multimodal and derive much of their meaning from visual, spatial and linguistic modalities. Because of their multimodality, educational comics challenge the conception of an authoritative author’s voice, as is typically found in traditional educational and academic writing. To examine how authorship and authority function in multimodal educational texts, this paper examines several books in the popular For Beginners and Introducing series of graphic guides, which use images, text, and comics to summarise the work of major philosophers – in this case Derrida and Foucault. The books chosen for this study are all collaborative efforts between writers, illustrators, and designers. In each book, the collaborations function differently, engendering different divisions of authorial labor and forging different constructions of multimodal relationships between image, text, and design. In order to more fully interrogate the ways that these educational comics combine multimodal modes of meaning, this paper itself takes the form of a comic, mimicking at times the books that it is examining. In this way, it serves as a self-reflexive critique of the idea that authorial voice is central to academic writing, and as an example of the challenges and opportunities presented by composing multimodal scholarship which eschews this conception of linguistic authorship.	000225	000234	000171	000407	000457	000210	000388	000503	000155	000230	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/3/000214/000214.html

In this article, I argue that the perceived immateriality of scholarship privileges conventional academic labor over similar pursuits, such as data curation, resulting in them being glanced over and ignored in tenure reviews and job evaluations. To counter this, I create a theoretical framework that places materiality at the forefront. More specifically, I draw on and expand Gilles Deleuze's notion of assemblages, as outlined by new materialist philosopher Manuel DeLanda, to posit the idea of data assemblages, which are the result of digital humanities labor and consist of material parts contingent on their contextual relations and always in flux. I use the Digital Public Library as a case study and highlight how the reconceptualization of digital humanities labor moves beyond the merely theoretical to allow us to better understand the interdependency of individuals in the academic ecosystem and has broader implications for the nature of materiality in the digital age.	000077	000418	000399	000213	000163	000420	000425	000321	000322	000411	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000215/000215.html

Many of us and our work fall into these gaps, cracks, and in some cases, void space. This work is not intended to indict the two collections examined here, Debates in the Digital Humanities and Companion to Digital Humanities, and in fact I am represented in Debates in a piece entitled, This Digital Humanities That Is Not One.

Parker	Baylor University	Graphic Images of YHWH: Exploring and Exploding the Bounds of Sexual Objectification in Ezekiel 16	For nearly its entire textual life Ezekiel 16 has barely survived. Early Jewish communities were wary of including it in their canon of sacred texts because of the chapter’s explicit and disturbing imagery. Christian communities have likewise wrestled with the text by essentially barring it from communal worship (the text does not appear in any lectionary) as well as nearly bracketing it in scholarship (most, if not all, scholars see the text as a violent and gross misrepresentation of gender roles as well as one of the most exacerbating cases of divine violence. Kathryn Phisterer Darr’s work stands out as one of the few that allows the tension of the text to stand.). Despite all of these objections, however, the text remains in the canon. In this one chapter of the Book of Ezekiel, one finds themes of hope, love, despair, suffering, betrayal, grace, and abandonment — all foundational to the human experience. In addition to a colorful theological tapestry, one also finds a definitively historical text that is troubling to most contemporary readers. Theology, history, and contemporary reader combine to make the text and its message shocking at best and inaccessible at worst; this project proposes a solution by way of sequential art. Because the theological message of Ezekiel 16 is both wrapped up in the larger narratival context and presents itself through forceful and explicit imagery, exegeting the text via sequential art offers the reader a new medium for understanding the text. I propose a retelling of the story found in Ezekiel 16 that consciously creates space for the theological themes, historical realities, and contemporary cultural concerns all to be heard and to stand in tension with one another. Along with a sequential retelling of the story of Israel and YHWH, I will also annotate my work to provide historical, artistic and scholarly perspectives for the reader. I will first create the comic by traditional pencil and ink and then scan the images. The images can then appear in any form needed.	000331	000144	000595	000217	000566	000214	000429	000446	000202	000216	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/4/000218/000218.html

The review finds much to like in Marwick's book: it is an eloquent take-down of Silicon Valley culture and its pretense of being part of the counter-culture while forwarding distinctly neo-liberal ends. But the review also finds that Marwick has a tendency to study up. Her ethnography is so focused on Silicon Valley elites that it ignores how people outside Silicon Valley produce and consume (and tweet about) digital culture.	000535	000353	000608	000638	000193	000207	000241	000086	000369	000093	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000219/000219.html

Up to this point the DH community has been mainly focused on scholars from a handful of English speaking countries and there is little or no participation from other regions of the world. This paper discusses the experience of setting up a DH community in Mexico. The aim is to describe the multi-faceted approach used for DH community building as well as discussing different strategies employed, difficulties encountered, produced results as well as areas for future growth.

During this data sprint, we developed a method to map the fields of Digital Humanities and Electronic Literature based on title recommendations from the largest online bookseller, Amazon, by retrieving similar purchased items from the Amazon API. A first step shows the overall Amazon recommendation network for Digital Humanities and allows us to detect clusters, aligned fields and bridging books. In a second step we looked into four country-specific Amazon stores (Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr and Amazon.de) to investigate the specificities of the Digital Humanities in these four countries. The third step is a network of all books suggested for the Electronic Literature field in the four Amazon stores we searched, which offers a comparison to the field of Digital Humanities.	000265	000450	000459	000460	000241	000620	000270	000163	000007	000078	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/3/000222/000222.html

A Historical Method for Algorithmic Gender Prediction	This article describes a new method for inferring the gender of personal names using large historical datasets. In contrast to existing methods of gender prediction that treat names as if they are timelessly associated with one gender, this method uses a historical approach that takes into account how naming practices change over time. It uses historical data to measure the likelihood that a name was associated with a particular gender based on the time or place under study. This approach generates more accurate results for sources that encompass changing periods of time, providing digital humanities scholars with a tool to estimate the gender of names across large textual collections. The article first describes the methodology as implemented in the gender package for the R programming language. It goes on to apply the method to a case study in which we examine gender and gatekeeping in the American historical profession over the past half-century. The gender package illustrates the importance of incorporating historical approaches into computer science and related fields.Please see the lmullen/gender-article GitHub repository for the code used to create this article.	000566	000377	000216	000544	000365	000217	000043	000460	000244	000346	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/3/000223/000223.html

Black	University of Massachusetts Lowell	A Textual History of Mozilla: Using Topic Modeling to Trace Sociocultural Influences on Software Development	This essay applies a digital humanities methodology to the study of digital media by framing software history as a problem of big data and textual criticism. While many scholars have already identified source code as an important site for the cultural study of software, this essay proposes that close reading is not suited to the scale and scope of modern application software. Applying text analysis tools to large bodies of source code can help address these problems as well as provide a basis for narrativizing its development and contextualization amidst a complex network of economic, political, and other sociocultural processes. Using source code produced over 15 years of development by the Mozilla foundation, this essay argues that software interfaces act as an extension of public relations narratives, often representing a developer's idealized version of their software which may not necessarily correspond with the state of the application's source code. Topic modeling Mozilla's source code allows us to explore a more nuanced narrative of development that shows how Mozilla has negotiated between the political ideals of open source software and the corporate ideology of its parent companies.	000336	000457	000135	000085	000588	000369	000404	000063	000355	000450	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/3/000224/000224.html

The comic first looks at comics criticism, visual rhetoric, and comics scholarship to set a base to build a methodology build in critical pedagogy and ancient rhetoric. Critical pedagogy’s tradition of inviting students to find meaning in the origin of ideas fits in with having students design and study a medium that’s often overlooked during their college experience. Such an approach echoes Freire’s ideas of using critical strategies as an effective model for change. Progymnasmata, and Quintilian’s work in general, allows students to approach the new medium of comics through reading and production through an ancient rhetorical practice that relies on a step-by-step process. Looking at Quintilian's pedagogy, we demonstrate a modern classroom study that uses progymnasmata to make the strange familiar while introducing visuality. The actual study is briefly discussed as well. This amalgamation of ancient rhetoric, comics studies, and critical pedagogy is the basis of the research behind this pieces’ goal of exploring comics as a multimodal means of composition.	000214	000230	000226	000212	000314	000234	000323	000503	000516	000203	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/4/000225/000225.html

The article begins by asking why comics scholars should create comics as scholarship and traces possible answers through a variety of related fields: English, Rhetoric and Composition, Art, and Games. It then investigates the question of whether this article is itself a comic, by reviewing the history of the conversation about defining comics as an imitation of the Bayeux Tapestry. This tapestry section outlines the major camps, positions, and moves that comics scholars have made. The two major threads are the essentialist camp (with Kunzle, Eisner, McCloud, Harvey, Carrier, and Hayman and Pratt) and the constructivist camp (Meskin and Beaty). The section ends with Bart Beaty’s recent (2012) conceptualization of a comics world that does not need to define individual artifacts as being or not being comics. The article ends with a discussion of the importance of distinguishing definition from conceptualization. Building on Beaty’s conceptualization and Gilles Deleuze’s theory of the concept and critique of representation, it offers applications to the comics world. Finally, it returns to the question of whether or not this article is a comic. The answer (yes, and becoming something else), calls for further interventions throughout the comics world that don’t ask what comics are but what comics might become.	000212	000225	000444	000214	000210	000226	000503	000207	000155	000314	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/4/000230/000230.html

The emergence of directories that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries has also spurred interest in categorization, with the practical goal of helping scholars identify, for instance, projects that take a similar technical approach, even if their subject matter is vastly different. This paper tracks the development of TaDiRAH, the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities developed by representatives from DARIAH, the European cyberinfrastructure initiative, and DiRT, a digital humanities tool directory. TaDiRAH was created specifically to connect people with information on DiRT and in a DARIAH-DE bibliography, but with the goal of adoption by other directory-like sites. To ensure that TaDiRAH would be usable by other projects, the developers opened drafts for public feedback, a process which fundamentally altered the structure of the taxonomy and improved it in numerous ways. By actively seeking feedback from the digital humanities community and reviewing data about how the source taxonomies are actually used in order to inform term selection, the development of TaDiRAH provides a model that may benefit other taxonomy efforts.	000241	000450	000007	000460	000464	000037	000080	000351	000020	000174	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000235/000235.html

000238	2016	10.1	Renée Farrar	United States Military Academy at West Point	Word Processor Art: How User-friendly Inhibits Creativity	My paper contains original Word Processor Art compositions and an explanation of the theoretical grounding for my work. I compose visual images (comprised of words primarily taken from advertisements about the object they construct) in a program not intended for that purpose (Microsoft Word). I break from the expected form of the Word Processor Document to scrutinize how machines, especially computer programs and the graphical user interface (GUI), influence the consumer's utilization of computers. In particular, my project questions how machines influence users' thinking and how the user-friendly inhibits creativity. The process disassembles the notion of user-friendly as a transparent influence and reveals how media shapes the author's imagination and creations. The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the typewriter in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment with the grid-like form of mechanical type to create concrete and, eventually, dirty concrete poetry. My work is inspired by these artists and the typewriter poetry they composed. My work also references art collective JODI's compositions and how our contemporary society resists the limitations of the GUI. My intent is to draw attention to the media of the composition. My work disobeys the prompts of the GUI to emphasize the idea that pre-packaged programs elicit conditioned responses and stifle genuinely creative uses of computing devices. Nietzsche writes that our writing tools are also working on our thoughts (quoted in ). My purpose in producing this work is not a rejection of computing or the GUI, but to draw attention to an interface’s existence and influence on its user. My work points to a creative space outside of conditioned responses to the GUI.	000439	000457	000362	000234	000588	000085	000608	000352	000409	000109	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000238/000238.html

Cheap and useful, the almanac was one of the most commonly purchased and frequently read print genres during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By focusing on readers’ annotations in almanacs about everything from social engagements and weather to historical events and the breeding of livestock, The Almanac Archive offers insights into everyday life and ideologies of time. Creating a searchable, digital corpus of high-resolution images from annotated almanacs will encourage new research questions about the relationship between historical events, individuals’ everyday lives, and the materiality of Romantic-era interfaces for tracking time. By theorizing and sharing the ultimate goals and, indeed, challenges of the project even at its early stages, our aim in this paper is to answer Johanna Drucker’s call to pay [m]ore attention to acts of producing and [to put] less emphasis on product during the creation of an interface in order to expose and support the activity of interpretation, rather than to display finished forms . In openly describing the unfinished form of The Almanac Archive and its relationship to current scholarly trends, we outline the technical and theoretical work going into its creation.	000595	000257	000457	000528	000171	000355	000615	000446	000444	000227	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000240/000240.html

Hayler's text is an investigation into the current theoretical framework surrounding our contemporary usage of the term technology. To do this Challenging the Phenomena of Technology moves through how we define technology, why the same artefacts might be fundamentally different for different users, how this might change our understanding of embodied knowledge, and finally places these issues into a nonhuman context. The book offers exemplary accounts of how to tackle interdisciplinary concerns that relate to so many aspects of our lives.	000457	000158	000369	000352	000329	000608	000143	000530	000105	000118	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000242/000242.html

Existing scholarship on historical social networks is scattered across an unmanageable number of disparate books and articles. A researcher interested in how persons were connected to one another in our field of study, early modern Britain (c. 1500-1700), has no global, unified resource to which to turn. Manually building such a network is infeasible, since it would need to represent thousands of nodes and tens of millions of potential edges just to include the relations among the most prominent persons of the period. Our Six Degrees of Francis Bacon project takes up recent statistical techniques and digital tools to reconstruct and visualize the early modern social network. We describe in this paper the natural language processing tools and statistical graph learning techniques that we used to extract names and infer relations from the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. We then explain the steps taken to test inferred relations against the knowledge of experts in order to improve the accuracy of the learning techniques. Our argument here is twofold: first, that the results of this process, a global visualization of Britain’s early modern social network, will be useful to scholars and students of the period; second, that the pipeline we have developed can, with local modifications, be reused by other scholars to generate networks for other historical or contemporary societies from biographical documents.	000604	000534	000346	000423	000298	000022	000355	000565	000289	000353	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000244/000244.html

Department of Informatics, University of Oslo	Experiential Analogies: A Sonic Digital Ekphrasis as a Digital Humanities Project	Humanistic uses of digital technologies have opened up new ways to think about, communicate, and discuss historical research. The common use of digital tools to visually represent ancient cultures and sites, however, has also introduced new issues. For example, critics have argued that digital visualisations, largely synonymous with reconstruction in 3D models, often attempt to represent a photorealistic-artificial vision of the past, and may often prove to be a way to communicate history to a large(r) audience . Against this backdrop, this article will discuss precisely how technology may help immerse researchers into historically situated life, and radically advance historical research. Adding to related criticisms of ocularcentric traditions of knowledge production, we contribute to this stream of research by arguing that contemporary visual representations of the past often concentrate on visual representations and seemingly maintain antiquity as a sanitised historio-cultural ideal . More specifically, this article seeks to demonstrate the potential of digital humanities to move beyond mere representations on screen and to mobilize other senses (specifically sound) as a historically situated component for research. For this purpose, we focus on the abstract principles and overall methodology for a recreation of the experience of sounds in the Roman amphitheatre.	000161	000505	000385	000508	000541	000239	000557	000335	000071	000543	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000246/000246.html

It was also essential for cracking the code of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Although digital humanities has been hailed as distinctly interdisciplinary, enabling new forms of knowledge by combining multiple forms of disciplinary investigation, technical obtacles exist for creating a resource useful to both linguists and historians, for example. The nature of the language (outside of the Indo-European family) also requires its own approach. This paper will present some of the challenges -- both digital and material -- in creating an online, open source platform with a database and tools for digital research in Coptic. It will also propose standards and methodologies to move forward through those challenges. This paper should be of interest not only to scholars in Coptic but also others working on what are traditionally considered more marginal language groups in the pre-modern world, and researchers working with corpora that have been removed from their original ancient or medieval repositories and fragmented or dispersed.	000593	000313	000257	000245	000546	000447	000027	000346	000460	000449	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000247/000247.html

Linguistic annotation for the Hellespont Project	The Hellespont project (DAI, Tufts University) aims to structure the text of a passage from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides (1.89-118), in order to highlight events, persons and peoples that populate the world of the author and connect the different digital sources available for their study. Event annotation in the text in particular requires an in-depth linguistic analysis of morphology, syntax and semantics. However, the available resources for Ancient Greek do not provide adequate standards to support the encoding of semantic and pragmatic phenomena in Ancient Greek texts. In this paper, we discuss the motivation of the project and how we adapted the so called tectogrammatical annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank to identify the events and describe their structure. The linguistic notion of valency, which is central to tectogrammatical sentence representation, proves very useful for this analysis of Ancient Greek.	000538	000447	000313	000245	000247	000357	000346	000606	000449	000475	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000251/000251.html

Through a specialized GIS course a small group of advanced undergraduate students learned how to interpret map data, create effective maps, and build map hypothesis - skills that are recognized as necessary for enhancing spatial thinking and thus spatial literacy. In the last decade GIS technologically has changed dramatically. The advent of Geospatial Semantic Web (Web 2.0) now makes it possible to integrate spatial thinking concepts at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum. This paper argues that spatial literacy must be more intentionally integrated into the Classical Studies curriculum and illustrates how we have begun to do that at DePauw University.	000031	000352	000116	000355	000353	000458	000608	000457	000283	000383	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000252/000252.html

Clement	University of Texas at Austin	Towards a Rationale of Audio-Text	Digital humanities scholars have made a tradition of problematizing our understanding of textuality through discussions concerning the design of information systems for texts that, in many cases, still look like books. This discussion is concerned with how creating opportunities for studying audio texts further complicates our understanding of the rationale of a textualized document, defined by Jerome McGann as the dynamic structure of a document as it is realized in determinate (artisanal) and determinable (reflective) ways. This discussion frames a rationale of audio text within the context of developing information infrastructures for accessing audio texts. I introduce a tool called ARLO that we have been developing in the High Performance Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship (HiPSTAS) project (http://www.hipstas.org) for accessing and analyzing sound collections alongside new standards being proposed for the development of audio visual (AV) metadata and content models. The discussion concludes by considering what these interventions tell us about how a rationale of audio textuality helps us rethink rationales of text in digital environments.	000173	000541	000239	000512	000542	000527	000507	000509	000516	000543	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000254/000254.html

In Classics, in particular, the references to passages of the ancient texts — the so-called canonical citations (or references) — play a prominent role. The potential of these citations, however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities. In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable. Firstly, I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using Natural Language Processing techniques, especially Named Entity Recognition. Secondly, I discuss the creation of a three-level citation network to formalise the web of relations between texts that canonical references implicitly constitute. As I outline in the conclusive section of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted citation network include the development of search applications and recommender systems for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read primary sources with links to related secondary literature; and the application of these network to the study of intertextuality and text reception.	000028	000164	000349	000181	000298	000561	000436	000194	000348	000346	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000255/000255.html

But various kinds of digital material are not digital in the same way, which a distinction between digitized, born-digital, and reborn-digital may help us acknowledge, thereby helping us to understand how each of these types of digital material affects different phases of scholarly work in its own way. This is illustrated by a detailed comparison of the nature of digitized collections and web archives.	000546	000277	000140	000077	000154	000151	000065	000020	000196	000155	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000256/000256.html

To begin with, the following paper argues that this is not a genuinely new situation, since all cultural Western history attests to written texts as never having been autonomous from oral discourses and versioning steps. Thenceforth – after analyzing the relationship between paper and body, relying notably on Derrida – this article will claim that we have the right and indeed, an obligation, to capture new covers and bindings. During the 17th century, in the lawless parts of the ocean, buccaneers realized that the right to depart was the condition for the capacity to be bound. Therefore, let us dare to depart from ancient bindings and create new boundaries.	000546	000457	000240	000140	000171	000459	000155	000312	000245	000348	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000257/000257.html

We define pragmatic modelling as a middle-out approach (neither top down nor bottom up) that combines formal and experimental modelling techniques with an effective use of language. Furthermore, in order to elucidate a pragmatic understanding of model building, we reflect on texts (considered here as objects) and modelling (or strategy of analysis) in DH research (and teaching). This paper does not identify a new practice or approach; rather it offers an explanatory framework for existing practices. As the paper explains, this framework goes beyond existing ones and allows us to think about modelling in a more integral way. Drawing on this framework, we reveal how DH modelling practices challenge epistemological and linguistic restrictions, by, for example, problematising the adoption of terminology belonging to the domain of computer sciences. Reflections on metaphorical reasoning are used to exemplify how polarities and some rigidities DH research could find itself embedded in are overcome in practice. We conclude by advocating the importance of a diachronic and historical analysis of the role of metaphors in DH to further explore the relation between theory and practice as well as to develop models of modelling integral to DH research.	000167	000369	000477	000337	000457	000351	000620	000241	000556	000336	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000258/000258.html

While new techniques are proliferating they still fall short of offering whole language experimentation. We provide a mathematical technique that maps words and symbols to ordered unique numerical values, showing that this mapping is one-to-one and onto. We demonstrate this technique through linear, planar, and volumetric visualizations of data sets as large as the Oxford English Dictionary and as small as a single poem. The visualizations of this space have been designed to engage the viewer in the analogic practice of comparison already in use by literary critics but on a scale inaccessible by other means. We studied our visualization with expert participants from many fields including English studies, Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer Graphics.

000260	2016	10.3	Stan Ruecker	IIT Institute of Design	How do we get to the Humanitarium from here?	For the past century, the sciences have made terrific strides in capturing the public imagination. From dedicated television channels to online learning materials to science-related entertainment and educational facilities for families in practically every major city on the planet, the scale of public relations has been impressive and continuous. However, the same cannot be said for the Humanities. Although we certainly have cultural institutions for adults, ranging from art galleries to opera houses, their primary emphasis has been on providing opportunities for passively consuming cultural production, rather than with the core interest of the Humanities, which is in enriching objects of study by analyzing them through a variety of theoretical lenses. In this paper, I argue, as others have been doing for some time, that the Humanities need to learn in this respect from the sciences, in order to increase their public stature. Further, the driving force behind this education is Digital Humanities. Since public relations has been on the back burner for so long, this initiative is both important and daunting; it is one of the ways in which the Digital Humanities are strengthening the Humanities while at the same time encouraging them in a task that seems difficult enough that everyone wishes it was not necessary.	000369	000020	000112	000077	000167	000079	000241	000158	000277	000261	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000260/000260.html
000261	2016	10.3	Julianne Nyhan	UCL	It is time to address the Public Communication of DH	This introduction addresses two facets of the communication of Digital Humanities (DH) that have framed this special edition of DHQ. I begin by discussing a number of articles about DH that have relatively recently appeared in mainstream newspapers. I then observe that a number of these articles not only show an impoverished understanding of the field’s frame of reference but also misrepresent various aspects of it, for example, its interrelationship with the Humanities. Given that many academic publications on the question what is DH? have appeared in recent years, yet DH is, nonetheless, misrepresented in this way, I propose that the field must look again at the communication of its activities in the round. Now that DH is arguably moving from the margins to the mainstream I propose that the time has come to address what we might call the Public Communication of DH so that we can better communicate to the general public and academics working in other disciplines what it is that we do. As the nature of DH’s relationship to the Humanities is one that is frequently misrepresented in the mainstream media I propose that this would be an important area for endeavours in the Public Communication of DH to address and explore as early as possible. The articles included in this special edition enrich and expand ongoing conversations about the nature of this relationship. In doing so they make available a wealth of case studies, arguments and insights that can, in due course, be drawn on to further the Public Communication of DH.	000007	000241	000167	000636	000369	000216	000239	000460	000277	000541	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000261/000261.html

Combining methodologies of narratology, historic research and Digital Humanities we aim to extract, classify and quantify events in a way that preserves their inherent multiplicity and multivocality.

In this paper, we use digital tools to search for expressions of nationalism in Dutch newspaper discourse in the late nineteenth century by text mining in large newspaper repositories.

000264	2016	10.3	Elyse Graham	SUNY Stony Brook	The Printing Press as Metaphor	These days, we are constantly looking for an image of ourselves in the historical past. “The first ever information revolution,” begins a typical book jacket blurb, “began with the advent of the printed book, enabling Renaissance scholars to formulate new ways of organizing and disseminating knowledge” . A communications scholar offers a view of our place in history that has echoes in countless other publications and presentations: “At present we are witnessing an information revolution whose significance parallels and perhaps even surpasses that of the information revolution caused by the printing press in the fifteenth century” . Publishers, both academic and trade, have created a new genre of book titles that confidently find the digital sizzle in the analog past: The Renaissance Computer (on printed books), The Victorian Internet (on the telegraph), Social Media: The First 2,000 Years (on letters, pamphlets, and graffiti). Scholars give talks with titles like Books as Social Media (Leah Price), Blogging Now and Then (250 Years Ago) (Robert Darnton), and What’s in a Visitor’s Book? Social Media and Volcanic Tourism in the Nineteenth Century (John Brewer). Surrounded as we are by these analogies — by these claims in favor of specific ways of construing the relationship between the past and the present, and by the significance claims that go with them — it seems fair to ask what purposes they serve. There is no doubt that we feel ourselves to be in the midst of a period of dramatic change in our media and information environments. My interest in this essay lies not in these environments themselves, but rather in our popular uses of historical metaphor to explain them. Why, in particular, do we turn to the rise of the printing press, out of all the options available, as our standard analogy for the rise of the internet? What value does this metaphor hold for us, what does it enable and what does it constrain, and what value does metaphoric thinking in general hold for analysis in media studies? It is as common for us today to use the printing press as a unit of measure in estimations of information history as it is for us to discuss our current circumstances in terms of an information revolution. But how historically accurate are these kinds of description? What do they mean for the ways in which we as futurists make use of history — and what do they mean for the ways in which we as historians take the long view?	000457	000355	000109	000352	000353	000608	000459	000460	000347	000601	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000264/000264.html

One example of an art history search engine is RemBench, which provides access to information in four different databases related to the life and works of Rembrandt van Rijn. In the current paper, RemBench serves as a case to (1) discover the requirements for a search engine that is geared towards the art history domain and (2) make recommendations for the design of user observation studies for evaluating the usability of a search engine in the art history domain, and in digital humanities at large. A user observation study with nine participants confirms that the combination of different source types is crucial in the art history domain. With respect to the user interface, both free-text search and facet filtering are actively used by the observed participants but we observe strong individual preferences. Our key recommendation for specialized search engines is the use of faceted search (free text search combined with filtering) in combination with federated search (combining multiple resources behind one interface). In addition, the user study shows that the usability of domain-specific search engines can successfully be evaluated using a thinking-aloud protocol with a small number of participants.	000327	000222	000204	000270	000620	000459	000376	000307	000205	000450	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000265/000265.html

This review finds that Jockers' Macroanalysis provides a clear and provocative argument in favor of literary critics' use of data mining in their efforts to understand literary history. The review finds Jockers' case for a blended approach, one that combines data mining with close-reading techniques, compelling, and it finds, in addition, that his claim that such an approach holds the potential to revolutionize literary study to be a fair assessment of the possibities offered by data mining tools and techniques.	000346	000565	000188	000171	000203	000152	000616	000140	000434	000323	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000266/000266.html

One can now relatively easily participate in the building and implementation of a variety of digital products, such as mobile apps, that can then be used to study user experiences through interactions with rhetorical forms, including a variety of types of informatics. Our experiences in several projects that use both large- and small-scale mobile apps offer a critique and lessons learned directly from engaging in this type of field experimentation, including reflections on observations, survey responses, and other types of data collection made possible through this model. Four larger issues are addressed here, about conducting research through making apps, providing potential research paths, opportunities and challenges to consider. Perhaps most importantly, this research approach offers the ability to tailor an instrument specific to research needs and then test that instrument in a natural setting, affording a true sense of how people interact with their environments in real situations and real settings.	000439	000226	000457	000232	000143	000158	000110	000369	000329	000258	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/3/000267/000267.html

As a result, modern efforts to transcribe these documents tend to produce the textual gibberish commonly known as dirty OCR (Optical Character Recognition). This noisy output is most frequently seen as a barrier to access for scholars interested in the computational analysis or digital display of transcribed documents. This article, however, proposes that a closer analysis of dirty OCR can reveal both historical and cultural factors at play in the practice of automatic transcription. To make this argument, it focuses on tools developed for the automatic transcription of the Primeros Libros collection of sixteenth century Mexican printed books. By bringing together the history of the collection with that of the OCR tool, it illustrates how the colonial history of these documents is embedded in, and transformed by, the statistical models used for automatic transcription. It argues that automatic transcription, itself a mechanical and practical tool, also has an interpretive effect on transcribed texts that can have practical consequences for scholarly work.	000288	000027	000168	000577	000412	000491	000346	000197	000313	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000268/000268.html

This has advantages and disadvantages; digital archives can disappear from sight almost instantly but they can also be easily safeguarded and restored. Borrowing the critical vocabulary of performance studies, digital archives could thus be understood as repertoires rather than traditional archives. By treating digital archives as repertoires, this article explores different threats and opportunities presented by their volatile nature and makes policy and technical recommendations on how to ensure their relevance and sustainability.	000484	000411	000459	000603	000446	000457	000608	000352	000536	000460	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000269/000269.html

BHO is a digital library of key printed primary and secondary sources for the history of Britain and Ireland, with a principal focus on the period between 1300 and 1800. The collection currently contains 1,250 volumes, and 120,000 web pages of material. During a website rebuild in 2014, the project team asked its registered users about their preferences for searching and browsing the content in the collection. Respondents were asked about their current search and browsing behaviour, as well as their receptiveness to new navigation options, including fuzzy searching, proximity searching, limiting search to a subset of the collection, searching by publication metadata, and searching entities within the texts such as person names, place names, or footnotes. The study provides insight into the unique and often converging needs of the site’s academic and genealogical users, noting that the former tended to respond in favour of options that gave them greater control over the search process, whereas the latter generally opted for options to improve the efficacy of targeted keyword searching. Results and recommendations are offered.	000282	000265	000321	000222	000355	000450	000007	000460	000561	000353	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000270/000270.html

Drawing from recent convergences in writing, rhetoric, and DH research, this article investigates how trends operate within complex networks. Through a study of trend data mined from Twitter, this article suggests the possibility of identifying a virality threshold for Twitter trends, and the possibility that such a threshold has broader implications for attention ecology research in the digital humanities. This article builds on the theories of Jacques Derrida, Richard Lanham, and Sidney Dobrin to suggest new theories and methodologies for understanding how attention operates within complex media ecologies at a macroscopic level. While many various theories and methods have investigated writing, rhetoric, and digital media at the microscopic level, this article contends that a complimentary macroscopic approach is needed to further investigate how attention functions for network culture.	000344	000450	000535	000613	000226	000604	000598	000243	000445	000353	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000271/000271.html

Seshat is a comprehensive dataset covering human cultural evolution since the Neolithic. The article describes in detail how the Seshat methodology and platform can be used to tackle big questions that play out over long time scales whilst allowing users to drill down to the detail and place every single data point both in its historic and historiographical context. Seshat thus offers a platform underpinned by a rigorous methodology to actually do longue durée history and the article argues for the need for humanists and social scientists to engage with data driven longue durée history. The article argues that Seshat offers a much-needed infrastructure in which different skill sets and disciplines can come together to analyze the past using long timescales. In addition to highlighting the theoretical and methodological underpinnings, Seshat's potential is demonstrated using three case studies. Each of these case studies is centred around a set of longstanding questions and historiographical debates and it is argued that the introduction of a Seshat approach has the potential to radically alter our understanding of these questions.	000355	000575	000396	000240	000468	000312	000298	000313	000353	000442	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000272/000272.html

This is a case study of the only daily newspaper, the Toledo Blade, in the midwestern city of Toledo, Ohio. A data set was constructed by searching a nine year collection of Blade articles, available in full-text searchable format in a ProQuest database, that included the most frequently used directional terms and had specific street addresses (a total of 981 stories). Besides bibliographic data, each story was coded for its location and the general nature of the story. Street addresses were used to compile relevant census tract information on the proportion of minorities in each area referenced. These references were then plotted over a street map of Toledo revealing geographic distributions that do not relate to actual cardinal directions. Population data corresponding to each data point was then analyzed to show that directional terminology correlates with the concentration of minority population. Additionally, a comprehensive content analysis of all 21,667 Blade articles published in this period revealed racial differences in reporting. Such quantified observations are reinforced by examination of particular examples of racialized usage of geographic terms.	000353	000346	000148	000408	000355	000371	000609	000157	000457	000280	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000273/000273.html

The humanities is faced with a digital medium that is changing the way scholars conduct their exploration of research. This study encourages the examination of imagery through qualitative coding, or annotation, to reveal themes and visual stories to further unravel the layers of a visual object. Images from the work of 1960s pop artists James Rosenquist and Roy Lichtenstein were evaluated using ATLAS.ti to determine common themes, visual stories, and aesthetic differences. Qualitative coding is usually associated with textual data, but using a software analysis tool such as ATLAS.ti can centralize the collection of data to efficiently code imagery, text, audio, and video. This case study will be used to introduce researchers, faculty, and students to qualitative analysis tools and the usefulness of coding to reveal themes in imagery. Furthermore, librarians have an opportunity to facilitate the learning of these tools in combination with the various proprietary and open access image databases housed in the library.	000541	000524	000239	000497	000159	000276	000542	000547	000586	000620	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000275/000275.html

As an alternative, cinema and media studies should pursue a mostly-ignored digital surrealism that uses computer-based methods to transform film texts in radical ways not previously possible. This article describes one such method using the z-projection function of the scientific image analysis software ImageJ to sum film frames in order to create new composite images.

The argument looks through the lens of DIY culture as an attempt to try and understand the future for the humanities in terms of both cultural material and processes. The argument is made first by examining the case of information sharing within DIY culture as an expression of current day cultural material. Secondly, it illustrated how traditional humanities scholarship, such as reading ancient documents, compares to it’s DIY equivalent within family history circles, and how both will continue to use digital and non-digital methods.	000256	000065	000546	000155	000335	000077	000261	000241	000020	000401	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000277/000277.html

Drawing on the experience of the Pliny project, and recent work done within that project to explore how Pliny materials might connect with the semantic web, we explore ways in which structured graph-like thinking might be revealed in — to peek out from — parts of humanities research that is common to digital and non-digital humanists alike. Out of this, we propose a number of different ways that scholars might engage with the Semantic Web, and provide examples – arising from the building of a prototype extension to Pliny – of how these engagements could be dealt with. We also explore the challenge of ambiguity and incompleteness in scholarship, explain how 2D space operates in Pliny to cope, to some degree at least, with these issues, and consider the boundaries between the expressiveness of 2D space and the formal graph model of the Semantic Web.

These studies have done much to affirm the power and flexibility of GIS technology as a resource for humanities scholarship. At the same time, however, these studies share a common limitation in that they tend to rely on the analysis of point-based cartographic representations. Such representations are suitable for modelling quantitative geographical phenomena, but they are inadequate for modelling qualitative human phenomena. This inadequacy constitutes a significant problem for researchers who aspire to analyse the geographical experiences and spatial relationships represented in works of literature, including works that contain accounts of travel. The present article proposes a solution to this problem by demonstrating how advanced spatial analyses within GIS such as Cost-Surface Analysis (CSA) and Least-Cost-Path Analysis (LCP) can be used to facilitate more nuanced interpretations of historical works of travel writing and topographical literature. Specifically, the article explains how GIS, CSA and LCP can be combined to build coherent spatial models of the journeys recorded in the works of three canonical eighteenth-century British travellers, each of whom composed influential accounts of their travels through the English Lake District: the poet Thomas Gray (1716–1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726–1798) and the agriculturist Arthur Young (1741–1820).	000116	000031	000355	000383	000057	000337	000415	000353	000458	000547	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/1/000283/000283.html

However, DH literature deals with this issue merely by listing the basic principles, or offering specific tips and tricks, which seriously simplifies management of DH projects. DH projects involve building (or at least using) digital tools, which brings the complex tensions between digital and humanistic aspects of these projects. In order to address such a complexity, there is a need for a model for managing DH projects that will learn from information studies and methods in software development, while still being based on values of the humanistic tradition and methods. This article combines a model of scholarly information practices with some concepts of agile software development into a hybrid model for managing DH projects.	000174	000336	000241	000037	000083	000107	000007	000179	000611	000477	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/1/000284/000284.html

The Relationship between Modern Languages and Digital Humanities, and an Argument for a Critical DHML	This article addresses the relationship of the disciplines of Modern Languages and Digital Humanities in Anglophone academia. It briefly compares and contrasts the nature of these disciplines – most frequently conceived of as either inter- or transdisciplines – before going on to examine in some detail the participation of Modern Linguists in Digital Humanities and that of Digital Humanists in Modern Languages. It argues that, while there is growing evidence of work that crosses disciplinary boundaries between DH and ML in both directions, more work of this sort needs to be done to optimise the potential of both disciplines. It also makes a particular case for Digital Humanities to remain open to critical cultural studies approaches to digital materials as pertaining to the discipline rather than focusing exclusively on more instrumental definitions of Digital Humanities. This argument is consistent with the concerns raised by other scholars with regard to the need for heterogeneity of approach and in particular for increased cultural criticism in Digital Humanities scholarship. Furthermore, we argue that this is where Modern Linguists can make their most decisive contribution to Digital Humanities research, offering what we term a critical DHML approach. We illustrate our arguments with a range of examples from the intersection of ML and DH in the broad field of Hispanic Studies, including the major findings of our own research into digital cultural production in a Latin American context conducted over the last ten years.	000443	000531	000312	000494	000274	000369	000261	000477	000524	000172	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/1/000287/000287.html

Training specific OCR models was possible because the necessary ground truth is available as error-corrected diplomatic transcriptions. The OCR results have been evaluated for accuracy against the ground truth of unseen test sets. Character and word accuracies (percentage of correctly recognized items) for the resulting machine-readable texts of individual documents range from 94% to more than 99% (character level) and from 76% to 97% (word level). This includes the earliest printed books, which were thought to be inaccessible by OCR methods until recently. Furthermore, OCR models trained on one part of the corpus consisting of books with different printing dates and different typesets (mixed models) have been tested for their predictive power on the books from the other part containing yet other fonts, mostly yielding character accuracies well above 90%. It therefore seems possible to construct generalized models trained on a range of fonts that can be applied to a wide variety of historical printings still giving good results. A moderate postcorrection effort of some pages will then enable the training of individual models with even better accuracies. Using this method, diachronic corpora including early printings can be constructed much faster and cheaper than by manual transcription. The OCR methods reported here open up the possibility of transforming our printed textual cultural heritage into electronic text by largely automatic means, which is a prerequisite for the mass conversion of scanned books.	000412	000268	000451	000581	000168	000577	000537	000034	000576	000553	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000288/000288.html

The networks developed in this project use the language of Shakespearean plays to trace the relationships between characters in space, in effect, translating the literary text into a web of spatial relations, which are difficult to perceive solely in the act of reading. Our analysis presents a particular method of network visualization, and also demonstrates how this technique can be used as a critical tool to revise our understanding of social disorder in Shakespearean tragedy. We therefore propose a dual scope for this paper. At a methodological level, we argue that network visualization is a way to infer staging and the blocking of theatrical space from the language of the playtext. In our case study, we show how this technique can be used as a form of Shakespearean literary criticism deploying this method to reframe the larger question of social disorder in his tragedies. The network visualizations used in this analysis serve as a stable and reproducible way, beyond any single performance, to delineate how the language of Shakespeare’s plays structures the relationships of characters in space. This study represents the beginning of a digital method that aims to bridge text and performance in the study of Shakespeare by reading the dramatic text for the linguistic codes that organize the space of the stage.	000548	000547	000562	000183	000228	000171	000534	000190	000285	000487	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000289/000289.html

With regards to the specific character of cultural heritage at the intersection of research, education, and public interest, the presented visualization environment aims at meeting the requirements of both researchers as well as a broader public. We present the results from a collaborative interdisciplinary research project that involved a cultural heritage foundation, art historians, designers, and computer scientists. The case study examines the potential of visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at visualizing the quantitative structure of a collection can be coupled with a more qualitative mode that allows for detailed examination of the artifacts and their contexts by displaying high-resolution views of digitized cultural objects with detailed art historical research findings. Making use of latest web technologies, the resulting visualization environment allows for dynamic filtering and zooming of a collection of visual resources that are arranged along a contextualized timeline. We share insights from our collaborative design process and the feedback and usage data gathered during the deployment of the resulting prototype as a web application. We end with a discussion of transferability of carefully crafted and collaboratively negotiated visualizations of cultural heritage and raise questions concerning the applicability of our approach to related strands of humanities research.	000487	000547	000285	000159	000497	000406	000091	000262	000383	000548	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000290/000290.html
000291	2017	11.2	Christof Schöch	University of Würzburg, Germany	Topic Modeling Genre: An Exploration of French Classical and Enlightenment Drama	The concept of literary genre is a highly complex one: not only are different genres frequently defined on several, but not necessarily the same levels of description, but consideration of genres as cognitive, social, or scholarly constructs with a rich history further complicate the matter. This contribution focuses on thematic aspects of genre with a quantitative approach, namely Topic Modeling. Topic Modeling has proven to be useful to discover thematic patterns and trends in large collections of texts, with a view to class or browse them on the basis of their dominant themes. It has rarely if ever, however, been applied to collections of dramatic texts. In this contribution, Topic Modeling is used to analyze a collection of French Drama of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment. The general aim of this contribution is to discover what semantic types of topics are found in this collection, whether different dramatic subgenres have distinctive dominant topics and plot-related topic patterns, and inversely, to what extent clustering methods based on topic scores per play produce groupings of texts which agree with more conventional genre distinctions. This contribution shows that interesting topic patterns can be detected which provide new insights into the thematic, subgenre-related structure of French drama as well as into the history of French drama of the Classical Age and the Enlightenment.	000523	000346	000499	000296	000146	000434	000183	000548	000431	000364	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000291/000291.html

It permits mounting of document images and offers page-by-page transcription and display, with the facility for project leaders to recruit and manage transcribers and other contributors, allocating and reviewing transcription work as it is done. Most distinctively, Textual Communities is built on a comprehensive model of scholarly editing, enabling both document (page-by-page) and work (intellectual structure, or entity) views of the texts edited. Accordingly, multiple texts of a single work, or part of a work (an entity) may be extracted and compared, using an embedded installation of CollateX. While completely conformant with Text Encoding Initiative guidelines, Textual Communities goes beyond TEI and XML in its ability to handle multiple overlapping hierarchies within texts. This paper will outline the thinking behind the development of Textual Communities, and show examples of its use by several major projects.	000199	000111	000181	000117	000374	000196	000322	000164	000053	000602	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000293/000293.html

Bankes Archive (1815-1822)	The William J. Bankes Archive, Dorchester, is an impressive collection of original material concerning the archaeological, anthropological and natural heritage of Nubia and was amassed in the years 1815-1822. In the last two hundred years, many geo-human factors caused radical changes in the region. In a landscape almost untouched for centuries, the signs of the interactions between the ancient human communities and the natural environment were much clearer in Bankes’ times than now. Digital humanities offer powerful tools to manage and visualize large amounts of data and GIS in particular is an effective form of relational database, where all items of data have a position on the earth. This paper presents the methodology and the preliminary results of a research project that aims at a draft reconstruction of ancient Nubia based on the Bankes Archive. Archaeological, historical, natural history and ethnographic information extracted from the documents will be georeferenced in the GIS.

Zampolli	Diachronic trends in Homeric translations	In this paper we intend to present a tool we developed for translation studies and diachronically compare various French translations of the Odyssey. This field of study is part of the more general Classical Receptions studies that try to analyse the influence and adaptation of classical texts in modern and contemporary literature, theatre, cinema, and many other artistic fields. While Greek texts have been analysed by scholars for more than two thousand years, research about classical translations is not yet a most renown subject. In recent years this theme has raised a growing interest in the academic community. We developed a program that can align textual sequences (defined as groups of words delimited by a specified grammatical pivot, in our case proper nouns), without need of previous training. We obtained alignments for many different kinds of translationsEven free translations, a problem that wasn’t generally considered by textual aligners since recent studies. While other programs have an upper bound for one-to-many alignments (for example with a maximum of four translated elements aligned to the same original element) this algorithm allows an indefinite number of alignments, both for the source sequences and the target ones. The aligner is based on an implementation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and on a string-based similarity approach to textual segments. The aligner needs to establish proper names as anchor words, as they are a relatively stable feature through different translations and tend to be similar in several languages. Thanks to the alignments obtained using the program, we can explore translations in a number of ways. We will illustrate the creation of a graphical interface to visualize French Homeric translations. With our tool, it is possible to highlight aligned portions of texts and show their immediate differences or similarities, both in meaning and in syntactic distribution. We will show some resulting syntactic analyses carried out on a small sample of texts, taken from a corpus of twenty-seven unabridged French translations of the Odyssey and explore how the study of diachronic translations through algorithms of computational linguistics can produce interesting results for literary and linguistic studies.	000447	000364	000237	000357	000247	000346	000313	000579	000229	000088	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000297/000297.html

Since both services were born digitally, starting with the listserv infrastructure of the Michigan based H-Net and later supplemented by database-driven web sites, the archives are easily accessible by electronic means.

Our work on the collection uses computational methods to extract new metadata surrounding individual photographs from the perspective of both the photographers and the original government archivists. Techniques for accomplishing this include mapping over an historical atlas, recreating historic cataloging systems, and digitally stitching together rolls of film. While many digital projects have focused on analysis at scale, our work on extracting new metadata actively demonstrates the power of digital techniques to assist in the close reading of even small sets of archival records.

If Corinne is first and foremost a Romantic novel that foregrounds the love plot between Corinne and Oswald, it is as much a novel about the role of women in society, articulated through the figure of the femme de génie. The plot of the femme de génie finds its expression through the trope of sociability, which I analyze through a social network analysis of the characters in the narrative and a computational analysis of collocates. I argue that through the constellation of sociability in the novel and the national allegories that accompany it, Staël evokes an enduring partiality for an Enlightenment ideal of sociability that remains deeply connected with female emancipation. The lens of sociability thus allows for a re-articulation of the novel as a social critique of patriarchal society.	000562	000092	000468	000331	000353	000347	000178	000171	000216	000422	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000300/000300.html

McPherson	University of Victoria | University of Victoria | Utah Valley University	The MoEML Pedagogical Partnership Program	Since 2014, The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML) has partnered with professors and students around the world in a unique collaboration between a digital humanities (DH) project and humanities classrooms. The model we have developed addresses a sustainability challenge for DH projects, provides professors with a way of meeting administrative demands for engaged learning, and gives students a high-stakes research-based learning opportunity with the potential for an open-access, peer–reviewed publication. The MoEML Pedagogical Partnership Project emerged from a confluence of problems and opportunities. One longstanding problem for DH practitioners is project-based: how do we sustain the projects already begun? Another problem emerges as DH moves out of the big tent and sets up camp in humanities classrooms at smaller, non-R1 institutions. Also, for scholars not trained in the technologies that drive many DH projects, crossing the analog-digital divide might be daunting and discourage them from contributing to DH projects. To address these challenges, the MoEML Pedagogical Partnership takes Research-Based Learning (RBL) models and turns them into high-profile publication opportunities, mobilizing ubiquitous social networking and communication technologies to connect the project with the new demographic of student contributors. This essay will highlight how digital projects and digi-curious professors can collaborate to develop innovative pedagogical practices that provide projects with content, enliven professors’ pedagogy, and invite students to acquire scholarly research skills, gain digital literacy, and engage in an interdisciplinary and international collaboration. We argue that DH projects can be used innovatively and effectively in the classroom to promote RBL. At the same time, DH projects–open-access ones in particular–can provide a home both for humanities research and for the fruits of digital pedagogy across a wide range of institutional settings.	000570	000241	000419	000310	000311	000330	000322	000305	000632	000485	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000302/000302.html

Digital projects and exercises allow students to engage with new technology, collaborate with peers, graduate students, and faculty, and produce tangible scholarship that is publicly visible. The Lab for the Education and Advancement in Digital Research (LEADR), a new student-focused digital humanities initiative at Michigan State University, has introduced digital components into large numbers of of History and Anthropology courses. Through two years of courses, it has proven fruitful to frame these not as Digital Humanities projects, but as part of a digital liberal arts curriculum that seeks to teach students not only about the domain-specific content, but also essential skills for information retrieval and analysis, media literacy, and communication in the digital age. This framework places these skills as extensions of longstanding skills, literacies, and knowledges that humanities and social sciences have contributed towards liberal arts education.	000315	000311	000647	000177	000421	000302	000239	000312	000077	000274	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000303/000303.html

My paper is a case study investigating the challenges of creating and delivering a partially online course in a university environment where the majority of teaching is done by sessional instructors whose labour is systemically marginalized by administration. Sessional instructors (or educational entrepreneurs) have even more limited resources (in terms of time, access to technical support, and access to administration) than tenure track faculty; however, open-access educational tools aren’t serving merely to level the playing field, but reshape it altogether as technical support and access to administrative support cease to matter in the delivery of an educational product. Today, many of the tools that are sufficient for the creation of a successful online or partially online course, whether generalist - iTunesU, Zotero, YouTube - or specialist - Google NGram, the University of Victoria`s Map of Early Modern London, Internet Shakespeare Editions - are freely available to instructors. Such freely available tools problematize the relationship between the instructor and the university insofar as universities tend to use proprietary systems (e.g. Desire2Learn) for everything, including data management, presentation, communication, and gradebook integration with the registrar’s office. Universities, in insisting on using these universal proprietary systems for every aspect of course delivery, exacerbate the disenfranchisement of sessional instructors, as access to the support required to become experts in these tools is limited and taken on at the instructor’s cost. A sessional instructor can create an entire course using freely available online tools, at minimal cost and reaching a tremendously large and diverse audience, yet cannot then market that course to any university that has a similar course as an educational product. At the present moment, the sessional instructor and the course are both subject to the curriculum of an individual university and department, despite the fact that courses with a heavy DH component tend towards portability, interoperability, and modularity that renders such boundaries largely incoherent. Though there are attempts to provide funding for courses that will bridge interuniversity boundaries such as the $4.5 million put forward by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities as a part of the eCampus Ontario initiative, such funding models largely exclude the sessional instructor, who cannot apply for funding as an educational entrepreneur. My paper will tell the story of how I tried to navigate a university system that tried to keep me from using free tools, while at the same time promoting my course as a part of the eCampus Ontario initiative.	000310	000311	000417	000274	000302	000241	000191	000106	000358	000177	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000304/000304.html

How are we to preserve, survey and index the complex data collection Kittler bequeathed to the German Literature Archive in Marbach in the shape of old computers and hard drives? How are the Digital Humanities to handle the archive of one of its most important forefathers? To address these questions, the presentation will first focus on the estate itself and then describe the design and development of the ""Indexer"", a tool for the initial indexing of technical information. Two especially problematic aspects are the sheer mass of files (more than 1.5 million) and Kittler's idiosyncratic organization, both of which serve to make conventional content evaluation very difficult. Here, the ""Indexer"" has proven to be a powerful tool. Finally, a case study using the indexer's web interface will enable us to tackle the question: When and to what purpose did Friedrich Kittler acquire a computer?"	000307	000321	000460	000457	000411	000468	000348	000298	000151	000546	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000308/000308.html

Most research into recurrent patterns in co-verbal gestures – manual communicative movements emerging spontaneously during conversation – is driven by qualitative analyses relying on observational comparisons between gestures. Due to the fact that these kinds of gestures are not bound to well-formedness conditions, however, we propose a quantitative approach consisting of a distance-based similarity model for gestures recorded and represented in motion capture data streams. To this end, we model gestures by flexible feature representations, namely gesture signatures, which are then compared via signature-based distance functions such as the Earth Mover's Distance and the Signature Quadratic Form Distance. Experiments on real conversational motion capture data evidence the appropriateness of the proposed approaches in terms of their accuracy and efficiency. Our contribution to gesture similarity research and gesture data analysis allows for new quantitative methods of identifying patterns of gestural movements in human face-to-face interaction, i.e., in complex multimodal data sets.	000510	000506	000364	000457	000397	000395	000458	000188	000363	000453	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000309/000309.html

Routing electronic practices in undergraduate teaching through the digital infrastructures with which they operate, this writing tests circuits of power that migrate between disciplinary and physical learning systems. It does so through a discussion of Pedagogy Toolkit, an open source and community-authored teaching repository built with Jekyll and deployed via GitHub Pages. Contributing to an increase of energy for project-based interventions in digital humanities teaching, Pedagogy Toolkit circulates digitized teaching materials, guides to teaching with digital humanities tools, a curated sample of online syllabuses accompanied by a syllabus templating tool, and an accessible website templating framework. An overview of new methods for digital teaching in the undergraduate classroom leads in turn to a reflexive discussion of the design of digital platforms as pedagogical objects, activating issues of labor, diversity, and knowledge transmission along the way. Ultimately, building a toolkit for digital pedagogy constructs infrastructure as a mode of intellectual inquiry, exposing classroom power as a conduit for ethical connections between students, teachers, and digital development teams. Rerouting logics that partition teaching practice and tool development, this article situates building communities at the heart of humanities learning.	000302	000106	000311	000177	000358	000306	000404	000465	000315	000274	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000310/000310.html

Workshopping New Directions in Undergraduate Digital Humanities	Recent years have seen widespread interest in digital humanities (DH) and growing interest in undergraduate-centered digital curricula. However, few undergraduate DH programs resemble those at large research institutions, where digital initiatives tend to be housed in graduate programs and rooted in graduate pedagogy or faculty research. Further, no two undergraduate DH programs are alike. This article seeks to move beyond graduate- and faculty-centered models by exploring new possibilities for undergraduate DH initiatives. It describes a workshop held at the ADHO DH2015 conference. This workshop brought together practitioners of digital pedagogy from small liberal arts colleges and from undergraduate centers within larger institutions. This article details the workshop’s exploration of undergraduate DH education, situating those practices in the context of broader trends in digital pedagogy. Finally, this article charts three broad challenges faced by programs which emphasize undergraduate digital curricula and offers suggestions and strategies to address these common issues.	000315	000421	000306	000303	000305	000302	000570	000241	000177	000310	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000311/000311.html

Introducing DH in the academic programs at an undergraduate level can be a difficult path to traverse. Even so, for the academic year 2016, we managed to include a Specialized Seminar-Workshop on this field of study within the History Course at the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras at the UNAM. This article shows and analyzes the context, the methods and the academic, technical and specialization implications DH has in the History field (and in Humanities in general), and also presents the results of our teaching work, of the research project in teaching to which it is connected, and of some other activities which aim at establishing an academic digital culture in this School’s community.	000221	000241	000477	000472	000401	000335	000460	000575	000546	000396	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000312/000312.html

Key functionalities of DREaM include i) management of orthographic variance; ii) the ability to create specially-tailored subsets of the EEBO-TCP corpus based on criteria such as date, title keyword, or author; and iii) direct export of subsets to Voyant Tools, a multi-purpose environment for textual visualization and analysis.	000231	000346	000447	000434	000203	000247	000579	000237	000197	000059	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000313/000313.html

It offers a practical example of a course taught during the Spring of 2016 at UC Berkeley that combines literary analysis with the teaching of basic programming skills, and DH tools and methods. Concretely, this course is an upper division, undergraduate writing intensive class, where students learn how to write and talk about electronic literature–e.g. hypertext novels, kinetic poetry, automatic generators, social media fictions, etc.–, learning specific terminology and theoretical frameworks, as they gain the skills to build their own digital art pieces in a collaborative workshop setting. By taking this course as a practical example, this essay tackles three important pillars in the humanities. Firstly, the overall concept of literature, and more specifically, the literary; secondly, what we understand by literary studies at the university; and thirdly, and more broadly, what constitutes cultural (beyond technical) literacy in the twenty–first century. This essay’s final claim is that teaching e-it as DH effectively address all three.	000154	000155	000207	000323	000591	000210	000232	000616	000226	000194	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000314/000314.html

In light of the trend of increasing numbers of women entering higher education and choosing humanities and arts degrees, DH can also help women who potentially face gender biases related to digital technology gain competence and confidence with it through their humanities courses. Having more students introduced to DH as a regular part of study may increase diversity in the DH community when they themselves become teachers and researchers. Barriers exist, from reluctance to change to a rising contingent labor force. Therefore, this article offers a selection of accessible DH methods that can be used to positively shape humanities pedagogy.	000311	000303	000305	000233	000633	000177	000421	000302	000465	000570	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000315/000315.html

Existing models, however, do not capture gender-related concepts. This article presents an effort to fill this gap by developing a new ontology for the representation of gendered concepts in CH resources. The new ontology, named GenderedCHContents resulted from combined research in women’s studies, gender theory, and computer science. Its primary aim is to draw attention to the presence of women within CH artefacts. The proposed ontology extends the Europeana Data Model (EDM) with twenty-two new classes, sixteen object properties and seven datatype properties. The article presents a demonstration of the GenderedCHContents ontology’s use in five different representation tasks, which describe five resources related to Pandora’s myth. Lastly, the study stresses the benefits of reasoning support (i.e. enabling computers to infer further information from a set of asserted facts) in revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships between metaphorical concepts, along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to the users.	000538	000449	000370	000068	000262	000354	000457	000239	000353	000355	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000316/000316.html
000317	2017	11.2	Ted Underwood	University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign	A Genealogy of Distant Reading	It has recently become common to describe all empirical approaches to literature as subfields of digital humanities. This essay argues that distant reading has a largely distinct genealogy stretching back many decades before the advent of the internet – a genealogy that is not for the most part centrally concerned with computers. It would be better to understand this field as a conversation between literary studies and social science, inititated by scholars like Raymond Williams and Janice Radway, and moving slowly toward an explicitly experimental method. Candor about the social-scientific dimension of distant reading is needed now, in order to refocus a research agenda that can drift into diffuse exploration of digital tools. Clarity on this topic might also reduce miscommunication between distant readers and digital humanists.	000171	000369	000378	000478	000140	000207	000616	000167	000152	000154	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000317/000317.html
000318	2017	11.3	Rhiannon Stephanie Bettivia | Elizabeth Stainforth	University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign | University of Leeds	All and Each: A Socio-Technical Review of the Europeana Project	Digital technologies offer opportunities for engagement with cultural heritage resources through the development of online platforms and databases. However, questions have been raised about whether this type of engagement is structurally open or bounded by pre-existing institutional frameworks. Michel Foucault’s later work on governmentality speaks to this concern and identifies in modes of government the mutually reinforcing relation of all and each, to develop those elements constitutive of individuals’ lives in such a way that their development also fosters that of the strength of the state . This article takes Foucault’s insight as a point of departure for thinking about how digital technologies are mediating and structuring the relationships between individuals and organizations, using the European Commission-funded Europeana project as a case study. Europeana is the embodiment of all and each as a technique of government: it functions by fostering the contributions of individuals and national audiences in a way that celebrates their diversity, while also engaging in a project to systematically standardize and unify. Examination of the technical elements of Europeana reveals the political imperatives implicit in its technical operations, and how the parameters for audience participation are subsequently defined. In this article, we examine the audiences explicitly and implicitly delimited by Europeana, and then analyze them in relation to the project’s development of the European Data Model (EDM) for the interchange of metadata about cultural heritage objects. The article concludes that a lack of explicit definitions about audiences, what Europeana is, and how its various parts work in concert constitute a definitional void. This void is a technique of government in that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague. It involves power relations that are hard to center and render visible, and it is thus difficult to detect which actors are occupying a space of privilege. We suggest some tentative strategies for addressing this problem by attending to the sites of awkward engagement and difference that are currently masked in the technical framing of Europeana.	000484	000477	000457	000459	000462	000179	000347	000352	000370	000460	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000318/000318.html

In keeping with the collaborative spirit of Wikipedia, the rubrics provided here were primarily created by the class as a whole. Estill demonstrates how this assignment encouraged students to question received notions of literary canon and to engage critically with Wikipedia itself. Perhaps paradoxically, writing for Wikipedia gave students ownership of their writing and research. Ultimately, this assignment facilitated students to become experts on understudied topics and helped them learn about how to do literary research.	000063	000330	000322	000202	000111	000387	000552	000478	000302	000554	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000320/000320.html

Schneider, Jr. at Lawrence University. With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Mellon Foundation, Schneider’s team produced a database from the multi-volume reference work The London Stage 1660-1800 (Southern Illinois University Press, 1960-68). Today, however, most of the project’s outputs are lost or damaged, and its history has been largely forgotten in both theater studies and eighteenth-century studies. This essay traces the history of the Information Bank and my efforts to recover its damaged data and code, offering the project as an object lesson in questions of access, preservation, and institutional memory that digital humanities practitioners continue to confront in 2017. I argue that the project faded into obscurity, not only because of technological obsolescence, but also because the development team was unable to promote the kinds of research questions and behaviors that would enable their tool's widespread adoption and survival. The indifference of literary and theater scholars to the Information Bank throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s demonstrates how vital it is that digital and computational humanities work articulate its meaningfulness within existing intellectual and disciplinary traditions. While digital scholars build new avenues for inquiry that expand and transform humanities research, the survival of these approaches depends on their relationship to current humanities questions, methods, commitments, and epistemologies.	000140	000411	000380	000163	000215	000241	000077	000479	000307	000308	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000321/000321.html

The Golden Age Literature Glossary Online, known by the acronym GALGO, consists of an online glossary of select keywords, from canonical texts of Golden Age Spanish literature, whose multiple connotations illuminate important linguistic and social concepts of the 16th and 17th centuries. GALGO incorporates British cultural historian Raymond Williams’ methodology in his Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society: namely, identifying problem-laden words or keywords, charting their distinct usages across texts, and reflecting critically on clusters of associated words. GALGO seeks to instantiate language as social semiotic by linking the semantic configurations of a literary work simultaneously to the cultural environment, the linguistic system, and the social system. Applying the conceptual design of M.A.K. Halliday’s social semiotic model, GALGO’s interpretive apparatus provides the field of discourse or context of situation for the text in which a specific keyword appears. The field of discourse presents clusters, word groupings of semiotic affinity that describe the social action that is taking place in the text. GALGO also performs an interpretation of the tenor of discourse, highlighting sociological variables connected to class status, gender role and racial category that refine a keyword’s meaning from the perspective of interpersonal relationships. Finally, GALGO adds commentary on discursive structures, such as patterns of grammar, syntactic nuances, and figurative language, that surround the keyword in the text. GALGO’s strength resides in the synchronic connectivity that the system facilitates when identifying the constellation of meanings for any given keyword. From a technical perspective, the system has the ability to efficiently identify the absolute position of all uses of a keyword across multiple texts, so that large texts can be managed and search times minimized for both users and system administrators. GALGO is constructed in such a way that users can not only access existing analysis within the database, but also can assume, when instructed to do so, the role of the system administrator and contribute their own annotations. A team of faculty and student administrators are currently building the database with research previously collected in Spanish Golden Age literature seminars. Providence College students have utilized the social semiotic methodology underlying GALGO for several years now with successful outcomes both in terms of their growth as language majors and critical thinkers.	000314	000346	000152	000457	000447	000478	000337	000312	000353	000207	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000323/000323.html

Using the Pitt Rivers Museum, the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, Harpweek, the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, and Visual Haggard: The Illustration Archive as case studies, I address the question of how digital image archivists ought to approach the task of curating objects with the potential to cause trauma. I bring together several critical strands–most importantly visual culture, race theory, and archival science–to question how the structure of a digital archive database might best achieve the goals of educating the public, supporting social justice, and enabling the researches of humanities scholars.	000524	000644	000275	000635	000642	000626	000636	000479	000411	000344	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000324/000324.html
000325	2017	11.3	Natalie Berkman	Princeton University	Digital Oulipo: Programming Potential Literature	The formally constrained work of the Oulipo (l’Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle, loosely translated as Workshop of Potential Literature) lends itself particularly well to digital studies, which was quickly recognized by the members of the group. To facilitate its goal of avoiding chance in its literary production, the group was naturally drawn to the determinism of computers, where true chance is simply impossible. In its early years, therefore, the group used algorithmic procedures as a starting point for various texts and also attempted to program these texts on actual computers, creating some of the first electronic literature and embarking on proto-digital humanities work as early as the 1960s and 1970s, later abandoning these efforts and relegating all subsequent activity to a subsidiary group. To understand the Oulipo's forays into computer science and more importantly, why they abandoned them, I designed and carried out one of the inaugural projects of the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities. The goal was twofold: first, through exploratory programming, I intended to create interactive, digital annexes to accompany my doctoral dissertation; more importantly, I hoped that by attempting to reproduce the Oulipo's own algorithmic efforts, I would gain similar insights into the nature of Potential Literature and be able to understand why the group abandoned such efforts after the 1970s. This article describes the content, development, and results of my project. For each of my three Python-based annexes, I offer a historical survey of the Oulipian text or procedure discussed within and the Oulipo’s own proto-digital humanities experiments; then, I will talk about my own experiences as a coder-researcher, what learning Python has brought to my project, and how my exploratory programming offered me a new kind of critical reflection. Establishing these annexes forced me to learn to code, a type of work that does not only produce digital texts, but also helped me to reflect on the notion of chance in a more nuanced way. Finally, coding has allowed me to better understand the Oulipian mentality concerning this sort of digital experimentation.	000005	000165	000069	000022	000378	000135	000321	000588	000314	000317	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000325/000325.html

We set out to solve a set of problems faced by many online cultural heritage collections. These problems are lack of accessibility, limited functionalities to explore the collection through browsing, and risk of less known content being overlooked. The object of our study is the Dutch Folktale Database, an online collection of tens of thousands of folktales from the Netherlands. Although this collection was designed as a research commodity for folktale experts, its primary user group consists of casual users from the general public.

Our evaluation shows that MERCKX outperforms similar tools on the task of place disambiguation and linking, achieving over 80% precision despite lower recall scores. These results are encouraging for small and medium-size cultural institutions since they demonstrate that semantic enrichment can be achieved with limited resources.	000462	000370	000449	000354	000206	000605	000475	000574	000026	000333	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000328/000328.html
000329	2017	11.3	Marinella Testori	King's College London	Methods of quality, quality of methods. What does Roberto Busa have to communicate to digital humanists in the 21st century? From hermeneutics to performativity.	Despite being also known as the Father of Digital Humanities owing to his pioneering contribution to the application of informatics to the whole ensemble of texts by the medieval philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), the Jesuit Italian priest Roberto Busa (1913-2011) has still not been fully appreciated with regard to his development of a hermeneutic informatics . Indeed this may represent a key concept to clarify what makes a difference between the common usage of computers in order to speed up procedures, and high-quality practices enhancing the role of informatics in shaping human interaction with machines. In other terms, Busa’s interpretation of informatics may impact not only on the way in which digital resources and tools are developed, but also on the epistemological reflection about Digital Humanities. In this paper, by drawing from many of his texts, I will outline how this innovative hermeneutics is explained by Busa in terms of language dynamisms potentially leading to the development of what Johanna Drucker has described as a humanistic-informed theory of the making of technology .	000457	000369	000503	000477	000459	000460	000352	000258	000453	000608	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000329/000329.html

I argue that crowdsourcing opportunities can offer a way for faculty at small liberal arts colleges and universities to increase digital literacy among their students.

First, Lisa Nakamura’s identity tourism and narratological constructs are applied to formalize the concept of the exploration in digital narratives. Second, exploration of gender and sexual identities is demonstrated through a queer narratological analysis of two digital narratives, Always Sometimes Monsters (2014) and Hustle Cat (2016). Third, the development of character creation mechanics in The Sims (2000-2016) series is examined to reflect the advancement toward progressive game designs. Concerns regarding a sexuality blind approach and the downplaying of homophobia are addressed, and Helene Cixous’s poststructuralist other bisexuality as a transgressive product of the fluidity of identities in digital narratives is emphasized. This study elaborates the often-disregarded workings of queer narratology and theory in digital narratives or game designs.	000429	000217	000216	000178	000155	000562	000100	000158	000639	000200	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000331/000331.html

This study attempts to compare book covers from different countries with a media visualization tool called ImagePlot. The top 100 bestselling books from 13 Amazon.com’s international sites were identified and their cover images were downloaded. Using ImagePlot, median values of brightness, hue and saturation for each image in the data set were extracted and analyzed. Along with one-way ANOVA tests and the resulting graphs from SPSS, ImagePlot outputs show differences in these graphical properties of bestsellers’ cover images in different countries. From the outputs, with all the book cover images displayed on a single canvas (screen), hidden patterns emerged and findings were clearly confirmed. This study makes a contribution by providing connection between research interests in book cover images and media visualization techniques for further research.	000569	000608	000030	000459	000500	000061	000547	000034	000438	000601	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000332/000332.html

NER has been applied to many types of texts and different types of entities: newspapers, fiction, historical records, persons, locations, chemical compounds, protein families, animals etc. In general, the performance of a NER system is genre- and domain-dependent and also used entity categories vary . The most general set of named entities is usually some version of a tripartite categorization of locations, persons, and organizations. In this paper we report trials and evaluation of NER with data from a digitized Finnish historical newspaper collection (Digi). Experiments, results, and discussion of this research serve development of the web collection of historical Finnish newspapers. Digi collection contains 1,960,921 pages of newspaper material from 1771–1910 in both Finnish and Swedish. We use only material of Finnish documents in our evaluation. The OCRed newspaper collection has lots of OCR errors; its estimated word level correctness is about 70–75 % . Our principal NE tagger is a rule-based tagger of Finnish, FiNER, provided by the FIN-CLARIN consortium. We also show results of limited category semantic tagging with tools of the Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo) of the Aalto University. Three other tools are also evaluated briefly. This paper reports the first large scale results of NER in a historical Finnish OCRed newspaper collection. Results of this research supplement NER results of other languages with similar noisy data. As the results are also achieved with a small and morphologically rich language, they illuminate the relatively well-researched area of Named Entity Recognition from a new perspective.	000544	000574	000627	000044	000449	000033	000328	000454	000655	000298	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000333/000333.html

000335	2017	11.3	Simon Mahony	University College London	The Digital Classicist: building a Digital Humanities Community	There has been much discussion about digital humanities (DH) both as a discipline and as a community of practice. This paper is based on my talk given to open the Leipzig eHumanities Seminar series and is presented here with many thanks to the organisers for their kind and generous invitation. Thanks also to the DHQ reviewers whose valuable comments have helped me to strengthen this paper. Whatever the balance of opinion, the emergence of digital scholarship in the humanities has undoubtedly had considerable impact on many disciplines; one such discipline is Classics and the study of the ancient world more generally. This article uses the Digital Classicist (DC) as an example of a DH community in a case study which traces its development and growth to examine what might be learned. As a community the DC joins together practitioners interested in the application of innovative digital methods and technology to the study of the ancient world (in its widest sense). How has this come about and perhaps more importantly, how has it been sustained and indeed provided the inspiration for other affiliated communities? What do we understand by a community and the association of individual practitioners separated by distance? It is important that members feel that they are stakeholders, that they have a sense of ownership and derive value from participation and contribution. It is argued here that a community could be seen as a symbolic and intellectual construct, one of perception rather than physicality to facilitate the exchange of ideas and so effect growth and strengthen the discipline.	000546	000277	000312	000477	000239	000472	000241	000256	000542	000261	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000335/000335.html

This article presents a case study in interdisciplinary collaboration between two disparate fields, web development and anthropology. We explore the challenges of translating between domains with differing values, aims and methodologies, as well as issues that arose for us during the development of a web application designed to provide a digital output of an ethnographic project. We consider our experience using the Agile style of software development, which emphasises rapid prototyping, iteration and even failure. In the long run, we find negative experiences in web development can be more valuable than the positive ones. The concept of ‘knowledge brokerage’ is a useful term to describe the collaboration between the academics – who were forced to conceptualise their data in new ways – and the developer – who negotiated these transitions between abstract information and binary data, and between academia and a public-facing web application.	000620	000163	000351	000477	000375	000241	000464	000597	000136	000484	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/3/000336/000336.html

The study is articulated around three use cases for literary, didactic and historical representations of imaginary and existing cities based on a model (z-text) and interface (Z-editor) for zoomable texts.

An Iterative Text Mining Workflow for Analyzing Advertisements in Dutch Twentieth-Century Newspapers	This article analyses advertisements to shed light on the ways in which the Coca-Cola Company tried to shape the Dutch perception of an American way of life, and by extension provided the discursive building blocks for the construction of a mental map of America. Since the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) digitized its newspaper collection, we could analyze newspapers using both computational and traditional means. The central question this article addresses is: Did Coca-Cola advertisements in Dutch newspapers communicate themes that represented the American way of life? Using two separate workflows, we demonstrate how we combined computational and traditional methods in an iterative and transparent manner. These workflows are systematic descriptions of how we used computational tools to answer this paper’s central research question.	000445	000346	000222	000263	000353	000145	000550	000457	000598	000515	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000338/000338.html

A crafting system is the collection of game mechanics which enable a player to create virtual objects within a game, with examples ranging from making a pickaxe or placing blocks in Minecraft, to combining ingredients to create items in World of Warcraft, or designing a city in SimCity. Within both game design and game journalism there is no systematic understanding of what crafting means in games — rather, the term is used in an informal I’ll know it when I see it way, with different ideas of what constitutes crafting becoming conventional for different game genres. We aim to create a more systematic analysis and language for virtual crafting, using a design space approach where we identify seven features of crafting systems; any given crafting system is understood in terms of the degree and manner in which it exemplifies these features. The features we identify are: recipe definition (how well-defined are the player steps for creating a virtual object), fidelity of action (how detailed is the player-performed enactment of crafting), completion constraints (how is creation constrained by virtual resources), variable outcome (how much can the result vary when the player performs the same crafting actions), system recognition of outcome (to what degree do other game systems understand and take account of what a player has made), player expressiveness (how big is the creative space provided to the player), and progression (how do the possibilities of crafting change over time). We apply these dimensions to the analysis of 64 crafting systems across 47 example games. This more systematic analysis of the crafting system design space provides a deeper understanding of how games function as a creative and artistic medium for players, and provides a language and framework enabling scholars, critics and developers to more deeply understand existing crafting systems as well as unexplored opportunities for future crafting systems.	000486	000066	000002	000009	000089	000501	000278	000592	000417	000101	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000339/000339.html
000340	2017	11.4	Talea Anderson | David Squires	Washington State University | University of Louisiana at Lafayette	Open Access and the Theological Imagination	The past twenty years have witnessed a mounting crisis in academic publishing. Companies such as Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, and Taylor and Francis have earned unprecedented profits by controlling more and more scholarly output while increasing subscription rates to academic journals. Thus publishers have consolidated their influence despite widespread hopes that digital platforms would disperse control over knowledge production. Open access initiatives dating back to the mid-1990s evidence a religious zeal for overcoming corporate interests in academic publishing, with key advocates branding their efforts as archivangelism. Little attention has been given to the legacy or implications of religious rhetoric in open access debates despite its increasing pitch in recent years. This essay shows how the Protestant imaginary reconciles–rather than opposes–open access initiatives with market economics by tracing the rhetoric of openness to free-market liberalism. Working against the tendency to accept the Reformation as an analogy for the relationship between knowledge production, publishers, and academics, we read Protestantism as a counterproductive element of the archivangelist inheritance.	000192	000369	000388	000591	000055	000601	000261	000554	000171	000194	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000340/000340.html
000341	2018	11.4	J. Berenike Herrmann	Basel University	In a test bed with Kafka. Introducing a mixed-method approach to digital stylistics	In the emerging field of digital style analysis, scholars have been dwelling on a perceived irreconcilability of distant reading and close reading . This situation is somewhat reminiscent of the paradigm wars in social science, where for years, one could either adhere to a quantitative or a qualitative mindset. Taking seriously both the hermeneutic and the empirical traditions of (digital) stylistic research, the present paper proposes a mixed-methods coalition of approaches. To establish links between the mixed-methods paradigm from Social Sciences and stylistic practices within Digital Humanities (DH), the present article discusses common methods of distant, close, and ‘scalable reading’ as well as a flexibly adjustable definition of style . In the practical part of the paper, I report a ‘mixed-methods digital stylistics’ study on Franz Kafka’s prose. Scaling the degree of abstraction and contextuality of the data according to particular research questions, I combine (1) quantitative hypothesis testing (examining Kafka’s stylistic uniqueness by means of a stylometric measure); (2) quantitative exploration (analyzing the first hundred statistically overrepresented words in Kafka); and (3) qualitative text analysis (KWIC and close reading to investigate the functions of a particular style marker in the context of Kafka’s The Judgment [Das Urteil]). Generally, for digital stylistics, I propose (a) raising epistemological and methodological awareness within the field, and (b) framing the research within the mixed-method paradigm that in fact seems very well suited to DH.	000188	000457	000346	000566	000460	000499	000171	000362	000022	000298	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000341/000341.html

The continuity hypothesis, stemming from psychological dream analysis work, states that most dreams refer to a person’s daily life and personal concerns, similar to other personal narratives such as diary entries. Differences between the two texts may reveal the linguistic markers of dream text, which could be the basis for new dream analysis work and for the automatic detection of dream descriptions. We used three text analytics methods: text classification, topic modeling, and text coherence analysis, and applied these methods to a balanced set of texts representing dreams, diary entries, and other personal stories. We observed that dream texts could be distinguished from other personal narratives nearly perfectly, mostly based on the presence of uncertainty markers and descriptions of scenes. Important markers for non-dream narratives are specific time expressions. Dream texts also exhibit a lower discourse coherence than other personal narratives.	000346	000146	000377	000291	000548	000414	000229	000598	000360	000493	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000342/000342.html

This article presents a new model for emotion mining, resulting from the research project Embodied Emotions. This project aims: 1. to trace historical changes in emotion expression and in the embodiment of emotions, and 2. to develop methods to trace these changes in sizeable corpuses of digitized texts. Up to now, the mining of sentiments or emotions has mainly been restricted to modern, or even very recent text corpora, such as social media. Sentiment mining techniques are often based on relatively simple emotion models of binary (positive/negative) oppositions, or limited sets of ‘basic’ emotions and are not yet able to deal adequately with the complexity and the historical contingency of emotions and their expression. To meet these challenges, we have developed the Historic Embodied Emotion Model (HEEM), built on a test case of 29 Dutch language theatre plays written between 1600 and 1800 and annotated manually with HEEM labels for emotions and body terms. In this article, we present this model and compare it with other sentiment mining techniques: 1) off the shelf linguistic analysis software LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), 2) a version of LIWC that has been adapted for the analysis of Dutch historical texts, 3) a new Dutch translation of WordNetAffect. We conclude that, although different forms of sentiment mining have their value and use, HEEM provides new opportunities for emotion mining and analysis of embodied emotions in historical texts.	000612	000346	000498	000364	000598	000338	000263	000146	000362	000365	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000343/000343.html

Entre las categorías empíricas que se han manejado como reales y naturales destaca la noción de espacio. La generalización de Internet ha provocado que esta polémica se perpetúe. Así, es posible distinguir una nueva oposición: por un lado, el ciberespacio entendido como un no lugar, desterritorializado, democratizador y asignificativo; por otro, como lugar sujeto a movimientos y repliegues territorializadores e identitarios que vendrían a poner nuevas fronteras, entre ellas la brecha digital, como consecuencia del predominio de la globalización en el contexto de la sociedad-red. En este sentido, se observa cómo, gracias a la velocidad y posibilidad de interconexión casi universal, los flujos dominantes modelan y semantizan continuamente el espacio a través de la inclusión y exclusión de aquellos nodos más o menos valiosos para sus intereses.

000350	2018	11.4	Bridget Almas | Thibault Clérice	The Alpheios Project, Ltd. | Centre Jean-Mabillon (École des chartes) - PSL	Continuous Integration and Unit Testing of Digital Editions	Over the last few years, the Perseus Digital Library (PDL) and the Open Philology Project (OPP) have been moving towards enabling better interoperability and citability of their texts by implementing the Canonical Text Services URN standard and the Epidoc subset of the TEI P5 guidelines. This is a resource-intensive effort necessitating a scalable workflow centered on continuous curation of these texts, from both within and outside the PDL/OPP ecosystem. Key requirements for such a workflow are ease of maintenance and speed of deployment of texts for use by a wide variety of analytical services and user interfaces. Drawing on software engineering best practices, we have designed an architecture meant for continuous integration with customizable services that test individual files upon each contribution made to our public git repositories. The services can be configured to test and report status on a variety of checkpoints from schema compliance to CTS-ready markup designed for flexibility and interoperability.	000605	000449	000181	000602	000411	000438	000430	000489	000163	000366	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000350/000350.html
000351	2018	12.1	Gabriele Griffin | Matt Steven Hayler	Uppsala University | Birmingham University, UK	Collaboration in Digital Humanities Research – Persisting Silences	Collaboration has become a hallmark of Digital Humanities (DH) research. Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged in DH a bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g. ), we analyse three types of DH collaboration: 1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3) machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement with collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through how DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest that understanding these entanglements facilitates a critical DH in which academic hierarchies and disciplinary preconceptions are challenged.	000416	000464	000620	000597	000167	000241	000477	000465	000607	000485	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000351/000351.html

Partimos de la hipótesis de que las humanidades digitales en Iberoamérica pueden recuperar algunas de las aportaciones de los laboratorios ciudadanos para expandir sus alcances a través de la incorporación de nuevos actores y metodologías; establecer una posición crítica frente al sistema dominante de producción de conocimiento y de las humanidades en el escenario geopolítico; y diseñar, hacer visibles y reconocer modelos y locus alternativos de producción, circulación y consumo del conocimiento. Por ello, este texto tiene como propósito caracterizar la cultura del laboratorio y analizar las posibilidades de su apropiación para promover procesos de producción de conocimiento abierto en el ámbito universitario y en particular en el campo de las humanidades digitales iberoamericanas.	000608	000453	000457	000459	000458	000347	000355	000460	000353	000109	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000352/000352.html

Utilizando tanto la lectura distante como la cercana, afirmo que el contenido de los blogs revela dos componentes importantes de la estética transnacional: en primer lugar, a nivel de la poética, al igual que en el mundo analógico, seguimos observando tendencias textuales que se alejan de los temas y espacios asociados con la experiencia nacional, y el mismo reblandecimiento de las fronteras nacionales que se evidencia en la escritura latinoamericana contemporánea. En segundo lugar, el terreno en línea nos obliga a cuestionar la relación entre el espacio y la pertenencia nacional, porque sirve como ámbito para la actividad lectora posnacional sobre la base de territorios de la lengua. Ambos aspectos son centrales para profundizar el estudio de la escritura digital y el modo en que esta opera en el marco más amplio de las tendencias hacia el transnacionalismo. En el presente trabajo, considero en qué medida podemos incluir los espacios virtuales entre las variantes del extranacionalismo, dado que a nivel nacional se los sigue discutiendo.	000355	000352	000460	000608	000347	000457	000458	000346	000453	000459	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000353/000353.html

Al dividir la ciudad de Sídney en seis regiones geográficas, creamos un sitio basado en el conocimiento de la historia de los aborígenes después de la invasión de los colonizadores ingleses. El sitio incorpora nuevas formas de etiquetado, línea de tiempo y cartografía digital, para mostrar múltiples senderos de la información en formato de texto, video y fotografía. Luego de siete años de investigación, podemos ofrecer en nuestro sitio web un balance entre desenterrar conocimientos perdidos y descubrir nuevas fuentes de información. Hemos incorporado al sitio web múltiples opciones mientras explorábamos el potencial de la cartografía digital y la animación para objetivos educacionales y de investigación. Al consultar cuidadosamente a los grupos profesionales indígenas del ámbito educacional, creemos que hemos construido una historia digital indígena de Sídney y al mismo tiempo se la hemos regresado a los aborígenes quienes se han visto privados de ella desde hace tanto tiempo.Este articulo está basado en artículos previos en inglés; ambos citados en la página web del proyecto (READ, P. & SUKOVIC, S. 2010 Piezas de mil historias: repatriación de la Historia de un Sídney Aborigen, Sociedades civiles cosmopolitas, un periódico interdisciplinario, edición digital especial etnografías; 2, 40-54; SUKOVIC,S & READ, P.

Les études quantitatives consacrées à la syntaxe dans le théâtre de Molière sont rares. Cet article propose une analyse syntaxique du discours des personnages de Molière qui repose sur l’extraction de séquences de catégories grammaticales (ou parties du discours) et leur tri et filtrage grâce à l’analyse des correspondances. Il s’agit ici d’étudier l’évolution du personnage de Sganarelle, qui apparaît dans plusieurs pièces de Molière, en vers et en prose, et qui représente souvent le  bourgeois de Paris , dont les valeurs vont à l’encontre de celles que partagent les mondains. L’analyse des résultats est menée du point de vue de ce que D. Biber et S. Conrad appellent la register perspective, afin d’identifier les séquences syntaxiques qui caractérisent les différents Sganarelle en fonction de la situation de communication dans laquelle s’inscrit leur discours. Les résultats montrent les différentes façons dont Molière exploite le personnage à mesure que s’affirme le nouveau comique qu’il met en œuvre, un comique fondé sur le jeu avec les valeurs de la société mondaine.	000349	000346	000362	000365	000457	000354	000364	000348	000366	000544	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000357/000357.html

Tracy | Elizabeth Massa Hoiem	University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign	Scaffolding and Play Approaches to Digital Humanities Pedagogy: Assessment and Iteration in Topically-Driven Courses	Discussions of digital humanities pedagogy have often focused on discussions of scaffolding and play (alternatively, tinkering) approaches, and methods for assessing student work appropriate to both techniques. While these approaches may seem oppositional, we emphasize the need to balance them in most classroom contexts, and explore challenges with integrating new digital humanities platforms in topically-driven humanities classrooms. We examine our experiences as an instructor and a librarian partnering to include a multimedia publishing assignment sequence in a course on the history of children’s literature, and our assessment of our approach to instruction in a distance graduate education context that is not amenable to the lab-based learning usually used in person for DH learning. While discussions of assessment of DH classroom projects generally focus on the question of how to grade student work, we argue that assessment is as important for reflecting on and evaluating pedagogy, including how to balance and iteratively improve scaffolding and play approaches. These issues are important not just for experienced DH instructors, but also humanities instructors without a DH background beginning to integrate digital assignments as a new norm.	000310	000330	000311	000302	000394	000177	000315	000322	000516	000303	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/4/000358/000358.html

In doing so, Ciccoricco expands the remit of the burgeoning field of cognitive literary studies, which despite its recent growth remains largely focused on print fiction published before the 20th century. Refiguring Minds is an exemplary work of cognitive literary studies which showcases both the field’s weaknesses and its strengths. While Ciccoricco sometimes tends towards reductionism — a problem in any scientifically-inflected field of literary study — he also enriches our understanding of the cognitive processes in fictional characters and in ourselves as we engage with those fictional minds.	000171	000548	000429	000180	000478	000178	000356	000113	000243	000369	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/11/2/000360/000360.html

Elle semble se présenter uniquement comme une modification du support matériel : du texte sur papier au texte numérique. Mais elle fait plus que cela. La numérisation touche aussi le texte en tant qu’objet sémiotique. Or, les multiples opérations de cette technologie mettent en œuvre des décisions interprétatives qui ne sont pas sans affecter le texte sémiotique, c’est-à-dire celui qui se donne à lire et à analyser. En ce sens, la numérisation des textes n’est pas neutre.

Toutefois, une autre voie, aussi prometteuse, est actuellement moins explorée : celle de la lecture partagée, que l’on pourrait également nommer crowdreading, et qui consiste à soumettre un même texte à de multiples lecteurs, afin d’observer les convergences et les divergences entre leurs compréhensions et interprétations du texte. Cet article présente les résultats d’une première expérience de crowdreading, visant à comprendre de quelles façons les lecteurs construisent l’image des personnages littéraires, et dans quelles mesures ils en perçoivent les différentes dimensions qui ont été dégagées par des théoriciens de la littérature comme Ph.

The results suggest that, during this period, cuneiform syllabaries were variable. That variation can further inform us about the regional, temporal, and dialectical contexts in which they existed. The addition of this research to the wider literature on the early adaptation of cuneiform enhances the field's understanding of how cuneiform syllabic values began to emerge and spread across the ancient Near East, and demonstrates how computational methods of analysis can be applied to research questions in humanities subjects.	000022	000346	000188	000412	000341	000560	000355	000247	000362	000357	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000368/000368.html

Katherine Hayles’s argument that digital media has reorganized how we think about and physically do our work in the social sciences and humanities. Some new methodologies enabled by digital media are obvious and others just emerging. A major shift that digital media have enabled is dethroning close reading as the gold-standard methodology in the humanities and augmenting it with hyper and machine reading. Hayles’s argument has far-reaching implications for the social sciences and humanities, but those implications expand much further when we consider that digital media often represents contending parties’ interests and that those parties are often drastically unequal in resources.	000171	000478	000167	000260	000317	000207	000261	000274	000404	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000369/000369.html

Recently, Clark (2015) has queried the long-established notion that Part I is the work of a single author, Paine himself. Clark argues that a passage of approximately 6000 words just prior to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizens, near midway through the book, was written by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and inserted by Paine into his book, perhaps with some editing. Clark's assertion rests mainly on judgement of the tone and content of the queried passage, as well as a hint in a letter by Lafayette to George Washington. This paper presents the results of a stylometric study of this question. Three computational approaches to stylistic analysis — one involving a consensus of six attribution techniques — were applied to the text of the Rights of Man, Part I, along with a corpus of comparison texts from the same period. Our findings tend to corroborate Clark's contention, as well as identifying two other short passages in which Lafayette may have had a hand, thus rendering this important document ripe for re-interpretation.	000365	000346	000022	000349	000460	000088	000566	000188	000355	000181	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000371/000371.html

The photographed or scanned images are made faithful to their original objects in scale, color, and detail. The editors’ notes are largely bibliographic and informative. The illustration descriptions consist of precise observations deliberately void of interpretation. The transcriptions are as diplomatic as the digital medium allows. And the explicit relationships between objects in the Archive are material; one can see, for example, copies of prints from the same relief-etched copper plate, or a design carried from a water color drawing to an engraved illustration. The scholar must be free to make his or her own interpretations. Since beginning to redesign the back end and front end of the site, the editors and staff have realized that more kinds of relationship might be made explicit. The challenge has been to decide which ones conform to our emphasis on accuracy and objectivity. In a neutral presentation of art and its contextual information, we can’t tell the scholar that object X relates to object Y because they embody the same theme. That would impose on him or her our own interpretation. But we can say that X relates to Y because they contain some of the same text. In this paper we discuss the difficult task of digitally presenting more kinds of relationships in the Archive while staying objective. We explain how the task has compelled us to reevaluate Blake’s methods and reencode the connections amongst his works accordingly. We describe planned enhancements to our tools used for representing and displaying these connections--enhancements that would benefit all archives, not just the Blake Archive. And finally we gesture towards further research into the philosophical context of Blake's practice of making related art and into the idea of relationship in archives in general.	000355	000052	000457	000615	000159	000240	000264	000021	000307	000321	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000372/000372.html

Streaming media is a case in point, and the purpose of this article is to provide some findings from an ongoing audio (and music) research project, that deals with experiments, interventions and the reverse engineering of Spotify’s algorithms, aggregation procedures, and valuation strategies. One such research experiment, the SpotiBot intervention, was set up at Humlab, Umeå University. Via multiple bots running in parallel our idea was to examine if it is possible to provoke — or even undermine — the Spotify business model (based on the so called 30 second royalty rule). Essentially, the experiment resembled a Turing test, where we asked ourselves what happens when — not if — streaming bots approximate human listener behavior in such a way that it becomes impossible to distinguish between a human and a machine. Implemented in the Python programming language, and using a web UI testing frameworks, our so called SpotiBot engine automated the Spotify web client by simulating user interaction within the web interface. The SpotiBot engine was instructed to play a single track repeatedly (both self-produced music and Abba’s ""Dancing Queen""), during less and more than 30 seconds, and with a fixed repetition scheme running from 100 to n times (simultaneously with different Spotify Free ‘bot accounts’). Our bots also logged all results. In short, our bots demonstrated the ability (at least sometimes) to continuously play tracks, indicating that the Spotify business model can be tampered with. Using a single virtual machine — hidden behind only one proxy IP — the results of the intervention hence stipulate that it is possible to automatically play tracks for thousands of repetitions that exceeds the royalty rule."	000366	000352	000453	000457	000095	000365	000522	000459	000364	000109	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000373/000373.html

The project developed and tested methods for automatically creating meaningful links and expanding archival television data. In the project, a high level of collaboration was required between scholars from two different disciplines: computer sciences and media studies. The majority of the epistemological encounters between the two disciplines took place in the design of the developed tools and the user studies to test the tools. The article is based on structured conversations between the two central staff members in the project, i.e. the computer science PhD-student and the media studies postdoctoral researcher. By unravelling the research project as a process of confrontation, identification and acknowledgement of situated knowledges, the article shows when and how the boundaries between the two disciplines have been maintained, crossed and blurred. The authors point to the benefits and challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration in the Digital Humanities, and formulate some best practices for future Digital Humanities-projects.	000620	000477	000542	000336	000167	000326	000241	000524	000401	000464	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/3/000375/000375.html

Using BigDIVA.org as an example of networked browsing, this paper presents the results of a small usability study that compared how participants (N = 8) engaged with BigDIVA’s networked browsing in comparison to use of a search engine such as Google. In doing so, we situate our study within performative conceptualizations of human-computer interfaces in order to explore the potential becomings when human and nonhuman machinic component are entangled together. Based on the observations from our usability study, we argue that networked browsing is suggestive of Whitelaw’s (2015) generous interfacing that emphasizes browsing as a tool for exploring relationships between nodes in archives, as well as Shneiderman’s (1996) joyous experience for interfacing with the web.	000205	000327	000459	000279	000265	000241	000457	000536	000351	000556	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000376/000376.html

In this paper, we concentrate on a specific subfield of machine learning called predictive analytics and its use in digital humanities. Predictive analytics has evolved from descriptive analytics, which creates summaries of data, while predictive analytics predicts relationships within the data that also help to explain new data. Predictive analytics uses machine learning techniques but also traditional statistical methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict another target feature in the data. Machine learning is used by predictive analytics to establish the rules that given a certain combination of features make the target more or less likely. Predictive analytics can thus be considered to be a technique to machine-read data. The paper discusses the background of predictive analytics, its use for predicting the past and finally presents a case study in predicting past gender relations in a historical dataset. Predicting the past is introduced as a method to explore relationships in past data.	000223	000346	000266	000365	000396	000457	000241	000493	000355	000548	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000377/000377.html

Taking a cue from modes of distant reading that have taken advantage of computational methods in order to pursue empirical and sociologically-influenced readings of traditional textual corpora, the liminal case of ambient literature is examined. As a form of electronic literature developed out of the field of ubiquitous computing, ambient literature presents a literature which is intimately connected to the situation of the reader, offering a text whose meaning is both variable and specific to the conditions of its engagement. Having confronted analogous issues in other domains, traditions of research in human-computer interaction offer methodological insight into how such works might be read. Developing an account of how literary texts may be read from a distance through user studies, an ethnomethodological analysis of the experience of these hybrid works of electronic literature is advanced. By drawing connections between literary studies and human-computer interaction, new methods which focus on the analysis of the experience of multiple readers as they encounter works of electronic literature establish opportunities for future research into the contextual, embodied, and computational nature of literature today.	000317	000478	000154	000171	000103	000616	000194	000457	000104	000087	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000378/000378.html

Commissioned two decades ago by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the work is just back on view to the public after a major restoration.

In the spirit of the piece, this article is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between a curator, a media art conservator, a computer scientist, and a scholar of the digital liberal arts, which brings together these different areas of expertise to offer an innovative and multi-faceted consideration of one artwork from a digital humanities perspective.	000483	000355	000241	000155	000158	000007	000140	000632	000524	000086	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000379/000379.html

In fact, starting as early as 1949, he collaborated with IBM to perform experiments using suites of punched-card machines. These punched-card data systems — with their plug-board setups, clacking machinery, and flurries of perforated rectangular cards — were developed for business accounting and tabulating, and adapted for government censuses, defense calculations, archival management, and information processing of all kinds. The first decade of humanities computing can more accurately be described as an era of humanities data processing — in the historically specific and contextually rich sense of the term.

With the project now in its third year, MuSO has reached an inflection point where it has developed a music-centered RDF schema and demonstrated the potential for federated searching across ARC nodes by crosswalking eighteenth-century music content from Europeana into ARC. The case study presented here outlines the dissemination role that MuSO proposes to play within the music research community, the history of MuSO in relation to ARC, the Europeana test case, and future steps for the continued development of MuSO. By facilitating the discovery of digital music content, and providing a virtual environment for music researchers, MuSO will promote data reuse, strengthen community standards in music representation, and create possibilities for cross-disciplinary exchange. We propose that by leveraging the connections between digital music resources and digital humanities research technologies, MuSO will facilitate new research that expands the musicological discipline.	000509	000239	000620	000163	000512	000401	000079	000241	000077	000254	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/1/000381/000381.html

Building upon the highly accumulative, various, and expandable Aesopic tradition that thrived in the Middle Ages within scholastic manuscripts, the fifteenth-century fables of Robert Henryson and William Caxton confront movements to consolidate and transform Aesop’s sprawling literary corpus into a singular printable property. At the same time that a single series of Aesop’s fables, now known as the elegiac Romulus, became increasingly standardized within printed books, woodcut illustrations and textual descriptions increasingly beautified Aesop’s body, transforming him from an inarticulate slave to an eloquent aristocrat. The simultaneous metamorphosis of Aesop’s poetic and visual corpus reveals the premodern underpinnings for current efforts by publishing industries to immunize digital work from rogue acts of appropriation, mashup, and remix, practices which had previously defined Aesopic textuality. As a response to this textual vulnerability, the collapse of Aesopic work into a singular entity reimagines the allegorical relationship between the author or publisher and the work as proprietary, not corporeal. Rather than an extension of a generative, deeply somatic, and grotesque process of multiple fabular authors and commentators, the modernized Aesop obtains value as a property, paving the way for the notion that creative corpuses can be owned, effectively stealing away corporeal features from intellectual production.	000601	000150	000503	000207	000029	000140	000071	000175	000446	000138	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000382/000382.html

The history of human-environment interaction is embedded in stone. Stones are essential components of daily life and their various usage characterize certain areas or chronological periods. The form of a stone object is the result of a long chain of interactions with distinct bodies but the intangible life story of any artefact is partially registered in its original material properties and gradual physical alteration. Digital systems can be adopted for collecting these invisible records and tracing a stone’s history. Chemical imaging and portable spectroscopy are quick and non-destructive remote sensing techniques that can be used to gather empirical data and track production and use of stone artefacts over time. This article reviews the application of Near Infrared Spectroscopy as a method for geochemical characterization of objects and as a tool for provenance studies within the Mobima project, carried out by an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists and chemists at University of Umeå, Sweden. Near Infrared Spectroscopy can be used for acquiring and processing spectral information directly in the field, modelling datasets of big assemblages and classifying objects. Making stones’ biographies visible will help understanding the entanglement of past societies and their geological landscapes.	000187	000560	000367	000467	000355	000071	000109	000246	000457	000458	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/3/000384/000384.html

The focus of digital humanists and other humanities scholars has turned to the efficient storage of information that facilitates search, comparative studies, accessibility, and consequently research. The common point of reference for the aforementioned applications is that they do not involve the need for the scholar to physically be in a virtual space. In areas, such as archaeology and epigraphy, the creation of projects that provide access to 3D models of the artifacts as well as to virtual replications of ancient sites has resulted in the opening of new areas of research and reconsideration of traditional research issues. Also, argue that digital visualizations may make the ancient world more accessible to a larger audience. One may comprehend the structure of a vase and analyze its artistic patterns by zooming and relighting it. A problem that is yet to be considered, though, is how a scholar and a student are to perceive Classical drama, the theatrical space, the distances between the actors, the chorus, and the audience, the logistics of the performance, and the cultural aspects at play. This paper discusses the importance of experiential learning and the use of virtual reality as a means of promoting traditional edification methods, virtually recreating the actuality of the stage, and presents the Magic Mirror Theater, a web application designed to facilitate the study of Classical drama.	000246	000119	000400	000514	000542	000071	000390	000262	000619	000116	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/3/000385/000385.html

This article will propose ways in which we, as educators, can harness the distractions that new technologies can pose to teaching and research towards productive models of distributed attention and collective intelligence. By reflecting on the relationship between play and pedagogy through critical theory, as well as on the benefits of hyper-connected and collaborative learning, this article hopes to expand the branch of Digital Humanities that Holly Willis terms as the cinematic humanities. Remixing, recontextualization, and the non-linear/non-sequential reconfiguration of information can provide us with new modes of distributed attention and critical making in the digital age. This article focuses on low and no-budget process-oriented collaborative projects for Cinema, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities courses (adjustable to other subject matters) that incorporate remixing, social and locative media, and augmented reality into experimental modes of connected and collaborative learning. The first assignment is a live film scoring remix, where students collectively brainstormed on picking sound clips/samples to add new soundtracks to early silent films. Remixing practices can offer new insights into cinema's legacy and challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in this case, reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image and reflecting on how our minds attempt to process the impulse of sensory synchronization in cinema. The second sample assignment proposes new ways of using easy-to-learn and accessible GIS (Geographic Information System) and AR (Augmented Reality) tools to create projects related to civic engagement and local/online activism. The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes are meant to be active disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit what digital humanities should or should not be, and other issues that often undermine the potential contributions to digital humanities that derive from the intellectual and material labor that happens in the networked, expanded and distributed classroom. The remix aesthetic, the unfinished and makeshift nature of these projects is something that I find adds value to this kind of process-oriented pedagogy because it remains in touch with the pre-institutionalized experimental ethos that prompted the formation of the digital humanities and other disciplinary cross-pollinations.	000143	000557	000118	000507	000369	000049	000439	000521	000110	000158	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000386/000386.html

Kersh | Chelsea Skalak	Dickinson College | Dickinson College	From Distracted to Recursive Reading: Facilitating Knowledge Transfer through Annotation Software	Rather than seeing hypertext as offering only distracted reading, this paper argues that annotation software provides students with the opportunity to perform recursive reading: a process that facilitates knowledge transfer and encourages intersectional critical approaches to texts. As hypertext editions and online reading communities have proliferated, scholars have theorized that these layered, interactive modes of reading produce distracted readings of texts, especially in pedagogical contexts. With annotation software, however, researchers and students have the opportunity not just to consume these distracted readings, but to produce them. Within the classroom, annotation software assignments require a deeper psychological investment from students than simply consuming a hypertext edition. By choosing how and where to annotate a particular text, students’ distributed modes of attention are re-focused on the text itself, pulling disparate threads of thought together.	000478	000394	000602	000389	000075	000369	000111	000018	000121	000356	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000387/000387.html
000388	2018	12.2	Jennifer Edmond	Trinity College Dublin	How Scholars Read Now: When the Signal Is the Noise	Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it is, in fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction facilitates knowledge creation in conversation with and between sources, bringing together disparate times and places, authors and forms of source material, frames of reference and layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as central focus to create the conditions for serendipitous discovery. This loose hold on focus results in a knowledgescape with a substantial tacit dimension, with the result that humanists most certainly know more than we can tell. This is not to say that the epistemic process of the humanist is all encompassing, however: administrative work, for example, is viewed as a true distraction, and managed accordingly. In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and organise the process of extracting information from the reading of sources (be they text, image, landscape or indeed even the self), the notetaking process of the humanist remains stubbornly multimodal, harnessing embodied, material, and spatial dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge environments humanists create around themselves resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a Prezi stack, a physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard stream of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholar’s understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex, sometimes tenuous, and largely undiscovered. This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this understanding of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future paths for using technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction, including: Technology as blurring the line between the personal and the professional, not so much as a labour practice, but as an epistemic one opening the way to the validation of epistemic emotions as a valid research input, but also to the more effective convergence of humanities research with other inputs to the identity formation process of seemingly distracted undergraduates; and research infrastructural implications for libraries (where remote storage and electronic catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded upon a new understanding of what the ideal humanistic work environment might be and how to get below the level of that work.	000369	000171	000478	000261	000167	000425	000180	000503	000399	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000388/000388.html
000389	2018	12.2	Tully Barnett	Flinders University	Distributed reading: Literary reading in diverse environments	Reading has always been a contentious and political practice, but this is heightened in the contemporary moment both because of the way the environments in which we read are changing so radically. For Katherine Hayles reading is a powerful technology for reconfiguring activity patterns in the brain , a view representative of attempts to connect the new neuroscience of reading with age old practices of literary endeavour. For Sven Birkerts, however, the Internet and the novel are opposites , a view that suggests that a hierarchy of reading that locks digital readers out of higher order thinking and literary experience. Meanwhile, Anne Mangen finds that electronic reading environments negatively aﬀect emotional aspects of reading . But these approaches tend to understand reading as something static that occurs in one space or another. However, in practice our reading is increasingly distributed. Reading can occur in multiple formats, across multiple platforms for the one text or reading experience. A novel begun in print can be read online in a born-digital format and concluded in a scanned digital format, for example. These journeys across platform require deeper investigation. If we think of the printed book as an interface between two orders of thinking, we need to consider how the experience of reading a digitized version of a formerly printed and bound book alters literary reception and student experience. How does the experience of reading across different technological platforms change the reader’s relationship to the content? As more and more electronic reading platforms take on the physical attributes of material reading experiences either by retaining material traces or by emulating them, we might question what experience How do the material traces left on digitised works impact the reading process for reading in literary studies? The lively discourse surrounding Google Books and the human breaches of the material into the immaterial, as the work crosses the borders of formats and interfaces, raises valuable questions about the future of the book, reading in the twenty-first century, and the long and formidable shadow that centuries of material text production casts over Google Books’ electronic utopia. This paper uses both book history and new media interface theory to consider the multitude of diverse experiences that is literary reading across different platforms in and out of the classroom and to consider whether distracted reading can be better understood as distributed reading. It considers critical infrastructure studies as a useful framework through which to think about reading in the digital age.	000180	000478	000197	000369	000113	000140	000317	000356	000207	000108	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000389/000389.html

They make it possible to supplement, even replace, the traditional format of lecturing and communal viewing of a single screen. On their personal screens, students can enter a searchable world of thousands of virtual images: what the radical art theorist and novelist André Malraux, more than half a century ago, called the imaginary museum. For several years, I have been experimenting with my art history classes, showing my students how to use their laptops, tablets and phones to become active viewers and collaborators. Multiple virtual images transform the content, as well as the environment, of learning art history. Rather than being restricted to the illustrations in a textbook, students can use their devices to engage with online image sources such as museum websites, image databanks, and auction houses. Portable digital technology can turn the art history classroom into a collaborative and dynamic experience inconceivable a short time ago. Malraux himself, who believed in the power of art to transcend time and space, might be amazed at what is now not only possible, but commonplace.	000494	000355	000575	000398	000158	000385	000379	000386	000546	000568	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000390/000390.html

Now that we can carry around an incredibly powerful little computer in our pockets or bring a lightweight laptop to class, boredom is a feeling that we almost never have to face anymore. We instantly alleviate the slightest hint of impatience or aimlessness with a single glance at our screens. But what introspective capacities do we neglect when we reflexively give ourselves over to the distractions of the outside world? What might dwelling within our boredom open up to students? Using my undergraduate Introduction to Digital Media course as a case study, I argue that a humanistic approach to digital media provides STEM students in particular with a means of contextualizing technical detail within larger sociopolitical systems, and that a focus on individual habits of attention can provide an important hinge between the granular and the global. Next, I reflect on the pressures produced by the very devices we studied on the classroom environment, and frame our experiences within some of the most influential writings on boredom as a historically and technologically conditioned mood. I then conclude with some speculations on planning for boredom within a laptop policy that is capable of accounting for a range of learning styles.	000049	000393	000417	000106	000191	000588	000608	000457	000386	000352	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/2/000391/000391.html

With attention to the mediation of attention itself, these courses can cultivate habits of self-reflection to aid students in any disciplinary pathway. Furthermore, digital humanities pedagogy can offer a transferable project-based model of instruction, helping students to develop metacognitive skills as well as to acculturate to different environments across campus.

We propose that new technologies may be used to engage the other senses in the act of reception, and specifically here we focus on kinaesthesia, or the sense of self-movement. This paper analyses a phase of the project Ancient Dance in Modern Dancers in which participants created performance pieces in a genre of Graeco-Roman dance for use in a motion-capture system. It was necessary for the performers to develop a range of translational strategies in order to communicate their movement to the system, entailing what we term distributed reception, in which the ultimate recipient of ancient source-material is not a human actor but rather the machine with which s/he is in collaboration.	000246	000397	000364	000521	000071	000505	000386	000511	000122	000514	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/3/000395/000395.html

While it’s tempting to think of these approaches as presenting an integral of scope, Bernstein’s work proposes the use and tuning of the human ear for understanding the sonic materiality of the phonotext, while Clement’s work, following its namesake of Moretti’s distant reading, calls for a form of surrogate listening — using the machine in place of the ear. Building on Bernstein’s work and toward Clement’s, I suggest Machine–Aided Close Listening as a methodology that uses data visualization as a prosthetic extension of the ear. This is to say that by considering three dimensions of the phonotext — 1) the textual manifestation of the poem, 2) the audio of the poet performing it, and 3) a visualization of that audio — the reader–listener can empirically confirm the ear’s impressions and expose new facets of the sonic materiality of the performed poem. In support of this methodology, I will demonstrate a new digital tool for aligning these three facets of the phonotext.	000364	000508	000246	000521	000543	000505	000395	000507	000161	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/3/000397/000397.html

Since technologies have illocutionary force, we should ask of any representation of history, In what ways are the associated technologies conveying meaning? In this article, the question will be asked of a particular kind of history, textual history, taking biblical texts as an illustrative example. The goal is to better understand how textual technologies of yesterday, today, or tomorrow capture or obscure the material history of their texts. The article proceeds in two main parts. First, two kinds of technologies commonly used are examined and compared: the non-digital book and its familiar digital counterparts. Second, we will consider ways in which augmented reality and virtual reality have been used and might be used to represent texts. It will be suggested that these new technologies may overcome some of the limitation of previous book technologies in capturing a text’s history. In conclusion, practical suggestions will be made for those who read, study, or produce digital textual objects.	000546	000140	000155	000619	000262	000457	000575	000087	000161	000257	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/3/000398/000398.html
000399	2018	12.3	Smiljana Antonijevic | Ellysa Stern Cahoy	The Pennsylvania State University | The Pennsylvania State University	Researcher as Bricoleur: Contextualizing humanists’ digital workflows	This paper presents findings from a set of contextual inquiry sessions completed in 2016 as part of the four year Digital Scholarly Workflow project (2012-2016) conducted at the Pennsylvania State University and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Studying humanists’ workflows through contextual inquiry enabled us to gain valuable empirical insights into digital scholarship from the perspective of individual scholars. This small-scale observational study (N=8) supplemented findings from our larger scale (N=196) and medium scale (N=23) studies previously completed in the project, allowing us to develop deeper qualitative understanding of how humanists’ research practices change in the encounter with digital technologies. Through close contextual analysis of information-based research activities we illustrate how humanists build rich personal collections of digital sources, which become important information resources in their work. We also examine how adoption of digital tools transforms the established methods of managing primary and secondary sources, bringing hastier digital workflows to traditionally more methodical work. Finally, we show that efficiency cannot be qualified as a neutral or inherent characteristic of digital tools, independent of scholars’ practices, since scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts determines what constitutes efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholar’s workflow. We conclude that in humanists’ workflows digital and analog tools and resources do not necessarily replace one another or vie for the dominant position. They rather supplement each other in an interconnected, hybrid workflow that comes to our respondents as an organic manifestation of their work, and as an illustration of the bricolage character of humanists’ digital workflows.	000215	000077	000322	000351	000620	000401	000213	000441	000425	000136	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/3/000399/000399.html

Isabella d’Este: Virtual Studiolo	Among the most elaborate and coherent instances of Renaissance self-fashioning and female self-determination through culture was a suite of rooms designed by Isabella d’Este in what is now the Ducal Palace museum of Mantua, Italy: a full-blown personal studiolo (study) and an adjoining smaller chamber she called the grotta (grotto). Isabella’s studiolo is a regular point of reference in the study of Renaissance history and art, yet for centuries it has been accessible only in dispersed pieces and in spaces depopulated of major works and artefacts. Digital technology offers the possibility of creating a remastered studiolo, a virtual space in which both visual and acoustic elements may be enhanced with respect to previous attempts at its representation. At the same time, historical uncertainty about numerous details in the arrangement of the objects in this collection requires a high level of flexibility in the digital remix, allowing for the programming of a customisable virtual environment. In anticipation of the project’s full construction and in order to facilitate discussion with potential users about the Virtual Studiolo’s backward design, the authors have developed a concept-demonstration video within the open-source Blender environment (www.blender.org). Among the concerns we aim to address in this phase of the project is how to combine historical accuracy, emotional power, and creative possibilities for users. This case study presents some of the opportunities, constraints and challenges we confronted during the production of our video as we strove within the Blender open environment for a result that will be historically accurate, emotionally compelling, and creatively flexible.	000385	000246	000071	000352	000457	000355	000061	000453	000608	000614	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000400/000400.html

000402	2019	12.4	Steven Braun	Northeastern University Library, Digital Scholarship Group	Critically engaging with data visualization through an information literacy framework	The proliferation of tools that enable anyone to create visualizations of their data, even with limited experience or skills, has made data visualization more accessible than ever before. This is true in its use in both teaching and learning, as data visualization has increasingly taken on an important pedagogical role in the classroom and in scholarly research. However, with this proliferation of tools there has been a concomitant awareness that visualization needs to be employed through a critical lens that acknowledges its constructedness as explanatory medium and as a product of situated knowledges. Here, I describe one approach to teaching this notion of constructedness via a framework oriented around information literacy, which encourages critical engagement with data, the tools we use to interrogate them, and the visualizations we design to represent them. I describe this approach through a collection of critical dichotomies used to evaluate the authority and value of visualizations, which are mapped to a subset of the core information literacy competencies defined in the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education. To put these dichotomies into practice, I further describe an interactive activity called Choose Your Own Adventure, with Data Visualization, in which participants are given paper and markers to create booklets in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure books and asked to consider the relationship between active choices in the design process of a visualization and how a given visualization is interpreted. In the process, I explore how this framework can encourage us all, as critical practitioners of visualization, to think about the practical relationship between data visualization and information literacy more generally.	000403	000487	000406	000547	000091	000556	000408	000569	000629	000290	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000402/000402.html

In business settings the Data Scientist has become a recognized and valued role . Journalism has re-oriented itself around data-driven storytelling as a potential saviour for an industry in peril . Governments are moving to more data-driven decision making, publishing open data portals and pondering visualization as an opportunity for citizen participation . This journal itself has numerous examples that use visualization tools and techniques within the digital humanities as a tool for exploration . This boom in attention has led large new populations of learners into the field. Formal educational settings have rushed to create new approaches and introductions to this content, but often they fall back on traditional approaches to things such as scientific charting and graphing . Many view data visualization as a new technology, which runs the risks of replicating old approaches without acknowledging the unique affordances and domains that data visualization relies upon. Data visualization is not simply another technology to integrate into education. It is visual argument and persuasion, far more closely associated with rhetoric and writing than spreadsheets . In this paper we present novel approaches to learning technologies and activities, focused on novice learners entering the field of data driven storytelling. We begin with a deeper dive into the problems we see with introducing new learners into a field characterized by inequality, continue with a discussion of approaches for introducing technologies to education, and summarize the inspirational pedagogies we build on. We then offer some design principles and three activities as examples of the concept of creative data literacy. We assert that creative approaches grounded in constructionist educational theories are necessary to empower non-technical learners to be able to tell stories and argue for change with data.	000402	000487	000091	000406	000547	000408	000569	000067	000285	000259	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000403/000403.html
000404	2019	12.4	Christina Boyles	Michigan State University	Making and Breaking: Teaching Information Ethics through Curatorial Practice	For many years, digital humanists have responded to Alan Liu’s call for critical digital humanities. Projects such as #TornApart/Seperados and #PuertoRicoMapathon and pieces like Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities? , All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave , and Beyond the Margins: Intersectionality and the Digital Humanities have paved the way for socially conscious developments in the field. At the same time, pressures from administrators, institutions, and funding agencies often discourage critical engagement in favor of tool development and/or high tech projects . As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we do ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together. So, how should teacher-scholars implement an intersectional digital humanities framework in the classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I assert that one effective strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate topics such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status through the careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing so teaches students to think more critically about the act of curation, by encouraging them to participate in knowledge construction as well as the dismantling of harmful narratives and power structures. While this approach differs from the tool-based pedagogy often utilized in the field, its emphasis on knowledge production, critical thinking, digital literacy, and social justice gives students proficiency in socially conscious methodologies that can be applied to any project. Linking curation to making and breaking, two digital humanities approaches to meaning-making, provides a method for interrogating archives of humanity and developing a pedagogy grounded in cultural critique and social justice .	000369	000633	000310	000302	000163	000636	000241	000177	000590	000632	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000404/000404.html

Those who study and work in the digital humanities are called upon to make typographic choices everyday, yet few have any training in how to effectively design with type. Over the past several years, I have been involved in several initiatives that seek to help educate digital humanities scholars, technologists and students about the value of information design, including typography.

This paper focuses on visualization aesthetics and perception by making the case for using graphic design techniques and design languages to understand and create more aesthetically pleasant and functionally effective information design and visualization. It uses cross-disciplinary reviews of background research to demonstrate the value of graphic design principles and methods in the realm of visualization education. A user-centered design framework and student projects are discussed by adapting graphic design elements into the visualization process. It shows that the practice of developing a visualization should be executed with an understanding of graphic design basics in mind, and with a balanced consideration of tangible and conditional design elements, as well as how these design elements fulfill the purpose of the objective, context, content, audience, and the knowledge of the design outcomes.	000487	000402	000091	000290	000547	000403	000569	000408	000067	000259	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000406/000406.html

Nowadays Visual Mobile Devices, smartphones, tablets, etc, contribute to a range of computer-mediated activities, which are related to specific locations and times. But for such critical reflection, we need a closer look to deeper layers of our culture to unveil the characteristics of new technologies and devices. This paper describes some emerging aspects of the teaching use of visual communication techniques in primary and secondary schooling. In particular it reviews the evidence of the efficiency of visual communication for learning both in varied curriculum disciplines and of transversal socio-ethical affective skills necessary for the promotion of health and the construction of a planetary citizenship. The paper illuminates the didactic applicability and unique potential of images for the epistemological peculiarities of different disciplines, highlighting how educational use of images in creative pedagogy can be more focused given the function they perform in the more general cognitive process of individuals. The theoretical analysis of the teaching validity of the use of visual communication, as reported in the international literature, seems to receive confirmation from a case study, which provides detailed analyses of how this technique can enhance specific projects and demonstrates its significance for wider practitioners.	000457	000608	000352	000453	000161	000452	000214	000030	000191	000369	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000407/000407.html

The implicit arguments depicted in data visualizations are the net result of many seemingly minor decisions about data and design from inception of a research project through to final publication of the visualization. Data workflow, selected visualization formats, and individual design decisions made within those formats all frame and direct the possible range of interpretation, and the potential for harm of any data visualization. Considering this, it is imperative that we take an ethical approach to the creation and use of data visualizations. Therefore, we have suggested an ethical data visualization workflow with the dual aim of minimizing harm to the subjects of our study and the audiences viewing our visualization, while also maximizing the explanatory capacity and effectiveness of the visualization itself. To explain this ethical data visualization workflow, we examine two recent digital mapping projects, Racial Terror Lynchings and Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence.	000629	000487	000547	000621	000091	000556	000534	000402	000419	000403	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/4/000408/000408.html

Many of these projects, including seminal publications such as Aphrodisias in Late Antiquity, Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania, Henry III Fine Rolls, Jonathan Swift Archive, Jane Austen Manuscripts, The Gascon Rolls, The Gough Map, and Inquisitions Post Mortem, occupy important positions in the history of digital humanities. Of the projects inherited by the lab, about half are either of exceptionally high quality or seminal in other ways but almost all of them struggled with funding and technical issues that threatened their survival. By taking a holistic approach to infrastructure, and software engineering and maintenance, the lab has resolved the majority of the issues and secured the short to medium term future of the projects in its care.

Yet, unfortunately, medievalists have not had as much success with using OCR software on handwritten manuscripts as scholars using printed books as their sources. While some projects to ameliorate this situation have emerged in recent years, using software to create machine-readable results from medieval manuscripts is still in its infancy. This article presents the results of a series of successful experiments with open-source neural network OCR software on medieval manuscripts. Results over the course of these experiments yielded character and word accuracy rates over 90%, reaching 94% and 97% accuracy in some instances. Such results are not only viable for creating machine-readable texts but also pose new avenues for bringing together manuscript studies and digital humanities in ways previously unrealized. A closer examination of the experiments indicates regular patterns among the OCR results that could potentially allow for use cases beyond pure text recognition, such as for paleographic classifications of script types.	000581	000288	000451	000268	000577	000589	000187	000168	000220	000560	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/1/000412/000412.html

One major outcome of our iterative research and design process is Narrelations, a novel visualization technique specifically suited for analyzing and interpreting narrative levels of a story and temporal aspects of its narrative representation. The visualization provides an overview of the nesting and distribution of narrative levels, integrates the representation of temporal phenomena, and facilitates the examination of correlations between these aspects. With this research we explore how collaboratively designed visual encodings and interaction techniques may allow for an insightful analysis at a high level coupled with a close inspection of text passages. We discuss prior work relevant to our research objectives and explain the specific characteristics of narrative levels and temporal aspects of narrative representation. After describing the research process and design principles, we apply the visualization on a test corpus of eight annotated German short stories and demonstrate its heuristic value for literary analyses and interpretations. In particular, we explore the intricate connections between the literary content of the novellas and their narrative form.	000548	000547	000190	000569	000487	000262	000228	000486	000500	000259	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/3/000414/000414.html

This research utilises as a case study the Battle of Mount Street Bridge of the Irish Easter 1916 Rising, in which the number of British casualties has been fiercely debated. The research is framed within the theory and practice of digital scholarly editions, which provides a new paradigm for approaching virtual worlds in a contextualized and annotated environment. This paper also discusses the challenges of creating virtual worlds for online environments in which there is rapid obsolescence of software and platforms and an absence of standards.	000258	000355	000607	000352	000457	000413	000547	000119	000505	000183	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/1/000415/000415.html

More specifically, the author discusses a key moment in the semester where students needed to move between university and non-university technology infrastructures in order to create multiplayer gamespaces that were accessible to their peers. In narrating this experience, the author will demonstrate how a discourse of access can be used to examine the oft-invisible policies, procedures, and restrictions that shape the way we compose, circulate and make visible digitally-native work. Furthermore, the author will discuss how a critical emphasis on access can help teachers and students better mediate the relationship between internal or university-supplied technological infrastructures and external platforms when creating interactive digital projects. The underlying motivation of this essay is not to lambaste universities for lack of institutional support nor is it to champion commercial organizations as saviors for helping teachers successfully use digital platforms in the classroom. Instead, the goal of this brief essay is to spur discussions surrounding the following questions: how might we use issues regarding access to better examine and navigate the hard-to-define boundaries that separate university-sanction technology use from non-university sanctioned technology use? How might calling students' attention to access refine the larger learning objectives for Digital Humanities or DH-related courses?	000304	000310	000191	000177	000311	000200	000330	000241	000106	000421	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/2/000417/000417.html

This opinion essay by three librarian-scholar-digital practitioners explores invisible work and life on the hyphen — between the academy and the library and between the human and the digital. In this essay, we illustrate how librarian-scholar-digital practitioners can feel overworked and underappreciated, working in and with multiple fields and communities who have different and sometimes competing methodologies. Through two examples, we look at how living on the hyphen takes its toll for librarian-scholar-digital practitioners.

For us, the answer to these questions lies in privileging the pedagogical affordances of data construction by crafting a workflow that included undergraduates as intellectual partners, and using DH methods to visualize and make public this collaborative labor. By drawing on our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes federal New Deal documentary projects including photography and life histories, we highlight three strategies for making labor visible in the digital humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as a tool for teaching undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them experience with conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this way, we explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we argue that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects visible. We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside the traditional About page to make visible all participants in the project. Third, we turn to an open discussion of the challenges faced in the politics of attribution when working with university, governmental and private historical organizations, including domain names and the use of organizational logos.	000302	000411	000174	000632	000425	000116	000465	000163	000239	000241	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/2/000419/000419.html

Librarians at Stony Brook University Libraries host Open Mic events for digital humanities researchers, teachers, and students on campus.  Inspired by a desire to better serve digital humanists with existing projects, this event was initially organized to increase the visibility of scholars and students with nascent projects and connect these digital humanists to library supported resources and to one another. For the Libraries, the Open Mic was an opportunity to understand the scope and practices of the digital humanities community at Stony Brook, and to identify ways to make meaningful interventions.   An open mic is a uniquely suitable event format in that it embodies a dynamic, permissive, multidisciplinary presentation space that is as much for exercising new and ongoing research (and technologies) as it is for making discoveries and connections.  The success of these events can be measured in the establishment of the University Libraries as a nexus for digital humanities work, consultations, instruction, workshops, and community on a campus without a designated digital humanities center.   The digital humanities Open Mic event at Stony Brook University locates the digital humanities within the library’s repertoire, while signaling that the library is — in a number of essential ways — open.	000077	000643	000213	000418	000215	000441	000080	000480	000241	000425	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/2/000420/000420.html

We argue that while the digital humanities lab as an institutional economic model does not necessarily promote a focus on graduate student professionalization, it uniquely has the capacity to push back against competing discourses of neoliberal vocationalism, funding and labor precarity on one hand, and technological utopianism and tool fetishization on the other, to train students agile, contextual, and rhetorical mindsets with which to enter technologically-mediated workplaces and lives. To begin, we review the discussion of digital humanities labs in the literature: digital humanities institutional models, how these models are practiced, lab funding, and the resultant position of labs as sites of training for graduate students. From there, we offer a teaching case from the Lab’s fall 2015 “Stories from Data” workshop in order to render visible a set of principles to guide professionalization of graduate students in the digital humanities lab. We conclude with reflections on how these principles might alter current discussions of the success or failure of the Mellon Foundation and NEH ODH digital humanities funding initiatives in the United States.	000311	000465	000077	000590	000466	000315	000233	000177	000303	000570	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/2/000421/000421.html

It exists as a support and collaboration structure that challenges traditional hierarchies through distributed power and collective creation. In an examination of hidden labor and archival silences, this research addresses how ideological underpinnings shaped the process of envisioning an institutional archive of FemTechNet records, how principles held by FemTechNet reverberated through the archival process, and how FemTechNet members conceptualized the imagined institutionally-held archive. The research reveals that the collective navigated institutional requirements and resources, the risks inherent in the tensions between the personal and the collective, and affective presence as part of the creation of the records that form the archive.	000209	000527	000156	000217	000483	000465	000610	000416	000642	000632	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/2/000422/000422.html

Using DIAS and DENDRON, computer applications designed for the study of infectious fungi and cancer cells, we forge a connection in color, composition, and theme between Paolo Veronese’s Les Noces de Cana and Paul Cézanne’s Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux. From this connection, we bring to light a hidden compositional structure, heretofore unidentified, in Cézanne’s Bathers as a series. Using computer-assisted systems such as DIAS and DENDRON allowed us to detect relatedness in these paintings not necessarily visible to the human eye. With DIAS and DENDRON, we generated dendrograms that clustered paintings related in brightness, saturation, complexity, and color. After studying color, we applied DIAS to the study of Cézanne’s composition. Because Cézanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding paintings in his conversations and letters, we programmed DIAS to compute axial lines and golden sections according to the dimensions of the square or rectangular painting under scrutiny. Using DIAS we identified the golden rectangle for Veronese’s Les Noces de Cana, Cézanne’s Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux and Ingres’ La Source (another likely model for Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux). From the similarities and differences between the three paintings we identified, regarding their use of axial symmetry and the golden section, we have formulated a new approach to seeing Cézanne’s composition in his Bather series.   Cézanne’s noumenal bodies, formerly perceived as awkward and composed with baffling imbalance, we can now see as golden.	000244	000346	000604	000061	000534	000022	000030	000467	000355	000560	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/3/000423/000423.html

Thousands of volunteers are using LibriVox to collaboratively produce free audiobook versions of texts in the US public domain. The work of finding, selecting, and preparing texts to be digitized and published in audio form is complex and slow, and not all of this labor is ultimately visible, valued, or rewarded. Drawing on an ethnographic study of 12 years of archived discourse and documentation, I interrogate digital traces of the processes by which several LibriVox versions of Anne of Green Gables have come into being, watching for ways in which policies and infrastructure have been influenced by variously visible and invisible forms of work. Making visible the intricate, unique, archived experiences of the crowdsourcing community of LibriVox volunteers and their tools adds to still-emerging discussions about how to value extra-institutional, public, distributed digital humanities work.	000480	000509	000536	000215	000420	000620	000411	000077	000399	000136	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/2/000425/000425.html

The author examines how we define digital humanities activism and how we frame its histories. Relying primarily on examples from Caribbean-oriented digital work, the author argues for a broad definition of DH activism that allows for a variety of projects and intended audiences. In particular, the essay responds to the tendency to focus on DH in the moment (projects that can be done quickly and yield a high social impact) as the primary form of activism, arguing that alongside such projects we include as activist projects that have a more cumulative and less immediate effect. Recently, we have begun to ask not just what the digital humanities does, but what the digital humanities does for others.

This article articulates a digital adaptation of enumerative bibliography and argues for its recuperative potential in feminist literary history. Digital enumerative bibliography uses bibliographical structures within a relational database that allows researchers to track more relevant metadata such as geographical location of subject matter, language, and time period. Whereas traditional enumerative bibliographies use a hierarchy of textual data, a relational database creates a nexus that facilitates new kinds of research queries. As an example, we offer our digital project the Women in Book History Bibliography and use its 1,550 citations as a dataset to trace what is women’s book history. We then advocate for digital enumerative bibliography as a form of feminist recovery efforts that recovers not only primary texts but scholarship about them.	000528	000156	000448	000595	000194	000527	000321	000003	000140	000483	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/3/000428/000428.html

000430	2019	13.3	Desmond Schmidt	Charles Harpur Critical Archive	A Model of Versions and Layers	Our libraries are full of manuscripts, many of them modern. However, the digitisation of these unique documents is currently very expensive. How can we reduce the cost of encoding them in a way that will facilitate their study, annotation, searching, sharing, editing, comparison and reading over the Web? Unlike new documents prepared for the Web, historical manuscripts frequently contain internal variation in the form of erasures, insertions, substitutions and transpositions. Variation is also often expressed externally between copies of one work: in successive print editions, in manuscript copies or successive drafts. Current practice is to prepare separate transcriptions of each physical document and to embed internal variation directly into the transcribed text using complex markup codes. This makes the transcriptions expensive to produce and hard to edit, limits text reuse and requires that transcriptions be first disentangled via customised software for reading, searching, or comparison. An alternative approach, described here, is to separate out the internal variation of each document into notional layers. This is done primarily in order to facilitate the recording of revisions at any one point. The move is, of course, counter-intuitive since these document-wide layers were not intended by the author as texts to be read. But it proves itself in practice by radically simplifying the tasks of editing, searching and comparison. Versions, on the other hand, are higher-level constructs that do represent the state of a text as it was left at some point in time by an author or scribe. By employing layers to record complex revisions, the task of computing differences among intra-document layers and against versions of the same work in multiple documents may be delegated to the machine rather than having to be recorded laboriously by hand. The ensuing simplification of markup reduces transcription and editing costs, boosts text reuse and searching, and, by removing the need for customised software, increases the longevity of digital transcriptions.	000455	000192	000583	000457	000459	000199	000021	000030	000050	000181	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/3/000430/000430.html

With the availability of vast amounts of (online) texts, performing full scale literary analysis using a close reading approach is not practically feasible. The set of alternatives proposed by Franco Moretti (2000) under the umbrella term of distant reading aims to show broad patterns that can be found throughout the entire text collection. After a survey of literary-critical practices that combine close and distant reading methods, we use manual annotations of a thread on Reddit, both to evaluate an LDA model, and to provide information that topic modeling lacks. We also make a case for applying these reading techniques that originate in literary reading more broadly to online, non-literary contexts. Given a large collection of posts from a Reddit thread, we compare a manual, close reading analysis against an automatic, computational distant reading approach based on topic modeling using LDA. For each text in the collection, we label the contents, effectively clustering related texts. Next, we evaluate the similarity of the respective outcomes of the two approaches. Our results show that the computational content/topic-based labeling partially overlaps with the manual annotation. However, the close reading approach not only identifies texts with similar content, but also those with similar function. The differences in annotation approaches require rethinking the purpose of computational techniques in reading analysis. Thus, we present a model that could be valuable for scholars who have a small amount of manual annotation that could be used to tune an unsupervised model of a larger dataset.	000434	000346	000111	000313	000461	000489	000565	000171	000365	000481	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/3/000431/000431.html

Our focus is on the Quan Tang shi 全唐詩 (Complete Tang poetry), the massive comprehensive anthology of Tang poetry that was produced at the height of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). The sheer quantity of Tang poetry preserved in the Quan Tang shi (over 50,000 poems and poem fragments) exceeds the human-scale perspectives of close reading. To make sense of the corpus as a whole, we will show how two related forms of distant reading — topic modeling and divergence measures — allow us to reframe and rethink these literary historical questions and provide a new perspective on what it means to read Tang poetry.	000313	000431	000346	000266	000565	000171	000203	000229	000341	000237	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/4/000434/000434.html

Network analysis, bibliometrics, and stylometrics, essentially leave out the fundamental humanistic skill of charitable argument interpretation because they touch very little on the meanings embedded in texts.

With The Library of Digital Latin Texts (LDLT), the Digital Latin Library (DLL) is set to publish critical editions as sets of data independent of a presentational format. These datasets are meant to be reused for a variety of purposes and in a variety of presentational formats, including the DLL’s own user edition viewer and data visualization applications. It is thus vital to have a way of certifying the data as published in accordance with the DLL’s policies and procedures, central to which are its provisions for peer review. Accordingly, to facilitate the use of an edition’s data in different settings, and to promote a high degree of confidence in the quality of the data, we have introduced the DLL Review Registry Service.

Rieder’s Suasive Iterations: Rhetoric, Writing, & Physical Computing	Suasive Iterations seeks to expand the repertoire of physical computing, rhetoric, and digital humanities research in an age of pervasive technology and virtual reality. The book provides a collection of theoretical frameworks with which digital humanists can craft projects to evert the virtual and the real towards suasive ends. Rieder argues that digital rhetors and authors should seek to use the affordances of technology to bring the virtual and the real together to create reality altering experiences that are persuasive and transductive. This book is an invaluable tool for those new to the digital humanities as well as experienced scholars as it provides strong theoretical guidance as well as project ideas to promote research in the field.	000232	000267	000226	000158	000143	000457	000619	000087	000557	000118	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/4/000439/000439.html

I have found the number of songs that reached the Hot 100 per year more than halved between 1966 and 2002, which indicates a loss in diversity. I have also found that the variation of valence (or level of pleasantness) in the songs’ lyrics and the variation of a sampled Type Token ratio (an indicator for lexical complexity) decreases over time. This indicates that lyrics of popular songs become more similar and again signify a loss of diversity.	000170	000364	000346	000146	000229	000579	000341	000648	000499	000365	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/4/000440/000440.html

While other scholarly literature has considered collaborations between these groups via surveys or interviews with small project teams, the present study will provide a large-scale analysis of collaborations using survey responses from more than 500 scholars, librarians, and archivists. Questions sought to determine the extent to which these groups collaborate with one another on project teams; how these collaborations unfold and who initiates them; whether IPs have begun to adjust and adapt their work to support specific DH projects, or to make their content more appealing and easy for potential future DH projects; and what administrative hurdles are faced during the collaboration. The survey also address how information professionals and DH scholars view the success of the collaboration after completing their work, and whether they intend to collaborate in future. To conclude, the article will consider what these responses tell us about how best to support all members of these collaborations.	000213	000464	000420	000418	000174	000322	000399	000077	000136	000351	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/13/4/000441/000441.html

A new multi-dimensional ontology-based approach was applied to explore the geographic, temporal, actor- and subject-based distribution of censorship events. We adopted an ontology-based approach to apply statistical analysis on the metadata of censored Hebrew manuscripts for estimating the scope and quantifying the extent of the known facts on the censorship activity and its various characteristics over the years. In addition, we revealed some previously unknown phenomena and trends. Particularly, we analysed the relationship of censorship on other types of events in manuscripts’ lifecycle and compared the distribution of censored vs. non-censored manuscripts in different dimensions. We also devised a set of rules to complete the missing locations of over 50% of censorship events, which has substantially changed the big picture of spatial distribution of censorship activity. From the temporal perspective our findings demonstrate that censorship was conducted in waves and there was a decrease in the creation of new manuscripts in periods of high censorship activity. Certain subjects, such as Kabbalah and Philosophy were censored significantly more than others, and the locations and script types’ distribution in censored manuscripts differs from the non-censored manuscripts.	000449	000411	000298	000460	000346	000262	000457	000365	000163	000576	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000442/000442.html

Lacking explicit previous training in DH, faculty drew on second language (L2) pedagogy, new literacies, and DH pedagogy to develop an inclusive approach to course design and implementation. The approach focused on students’ development of agency and authority as rising scholars while underscoring conceptions of labor and professional development in the humanities. There is limited scholarship addressing implementing DH in a L2 classroom. However, implementing a combined approach where one pedagogy influenced the other afforded the opportunity to critically consider the role of multilingualism and multiculturalism in a global, open DH context. We adopted this approach in concert with lessons drawn from theories of information literacy and new literacies. This transdisciplinary method encouraged careful consideration of design and implementation given that how information is processed, acquired, and communicated are key concerns in both L2 classrooms and new literacies.	000287	000274	000302	000315	000177	000310	000570	000404	000303	000591	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000443/000443.html

Since the traveling theater was contingent (context-based) and extemporaneous, the associated playtexts, collaborative adaptations and translations of English works, present unique challenges for editors and scholars. In fact, their printed form often misrepresents the kind of theater practiced. I raise the question of how the textual remnants of this theater shaped critical attitudes regarding the travelers, and I suggest that capabilities of digital publication can illuminate the episodic and modular characteristics of early modern performance.	000572	000183	000171	000178	000446	000240	000175	000595	000207	000157	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000444/000444.html

One of their main concerns centered on the question of agency. Were advertisements a reflection of historical events and societal debates, or were ad makers instrumental in shaping society and the ways people interacted with consumer goods? Using techniques from econometrics (Granger causality test) and complexity science (Adaptive Fractal Analysis), this paper analyzes to what extent advertisements shaped or reflected society. We found evidence that indicates a fundamental difference between the dynamic behavior of word use in articles and advertisements published in a century of Dutch newspapers. Articles exhibit persistent trends. Contrary to this, advertisements have a more irregular behavior characterized by short bursts and fast decay, which, in part, mirrors the dynamic through which advertisers introduced terms into public discourse. On the issue of whether advertisements shaped or reflected society, we found particular product types that seemed to be collectively driven by a Granger causality going from advertisements to articles. Generally, we found support for a complex interaction pattern, analogous to Cowan’s concept of the consumption junction. Finally, we discovered noteworthy patterns in terms of Granger causality and long-range dependencies for specific product groups. All in, this study shows how methods from econometrics and complexity science can be applied to humanities data to improve our understanding of complex cultural-historical phenomena such as the role of advertising in society.	000338	000550	000346	000271	000263	000598	000582	000457	000353	000347	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000445/000445.html

In particular, our project aims to further develop this edition of the PA, thereby demonstrating the philological, editorial and pedagogic challenges involved in compiling the diverse fragments of this collection of Greek epigrams. Since its discovery in 1606 by Claude Saumaise in the Palatina Library of Heidelberg in Germany , the PA manuscript (Codex Palatinus 23) has considerably influenced literature and art. As we know it today, the Anthology is the result of successive compilations, modifications, additions, and rearrangements by the compilers. Meleager's collection is a collection of epigrams compiled in the first century B.C., which represents the original source of what is known today as the Greek Anthology . This collection, called The Garland, was not randomly arranged, but according to a series of particular organizational principles . The PA challenges the concept of an oeuvre – as a unified and cohesive body of work –, insofar as it brings together 4 000 epigrams written by more than one hundred different authors from over sixteen centuries of literary production (from the Byzantine empire to the 10th century AD). If we cannot consider the Anthology as a unified and cohesive work, how do we account for it in an edition? To these questions, the digital environment presents tools and possibilities allowing us to organize our research, and ultimately work towards finding some answers. In an attempt to provide tangible solutions to the difficulty of assembling such a fragmented body of work the PA Project harnesses digital tools. We have created an open database searchable via an API that allows one to transcribe the manuscript, propose translations, align translations, transcribe scholia, and link epigrams both to each other and to external literary and artistic references. We aim to demonstrate the importance of philological approaches to texts; redefine the boundaries between scholarly and amateur practices; connect contemporary readers and scholars with Classical texts; supplement the Perseus project; and harness the potential of semantic web technologies. We aim to shed light on the many ways to engage with textual objects, to conceive of a multiple reception of the anthological imaginary . The interface of our digital platform does intend for users to propose such reading pathways and weak ties , because it enables them to associate an epigram with a reference (textual, iconographic, musical, cinematographic, and others) and thereby demonstrate a collective engagement with the epigram . This demonstrates how collective imaginaries are able to enrich our understanding of the anthological material. By enabling the users to engage with this otherwise elusive literary object, the Greek epigrams, and with a cultural object, our project enables contemporary readers to engage with the digital possibilities in order to visualize a collective imaginary or topoï , and to contribute to philological research on the origins and influences of the PA .	000029	000346	000313	000245	000025	000323	000457	000348	000152	000247	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000447/000447.html

Using insights developed by critical algorithm and critical archival studies, it analyzes how JSTOR’s topics repeatedly misrepresent and erase work in women’s, African diasporic/African American, and Native American and settler colonial histories. The article discusses concerns over the power of metadata, the need for transparent and domain-expert-involved indexing processes, and digital providers’ responsibilities to accurately categorize scholars’ work. It particularly focuses on the potentially disproportionate harm done to traditionally marginalized fields of study through seemingly racist or sexist topical labeling that impedes knowledge discovery.	000428	000631	000003	000148	000595	000324	000202	000644	000527	000640	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000448/000448.html

Thanks to their nature, Semantic Web technologies have produced insights into the challenges associated with standardizing metadata for manuscripts. Scholars depend on highly specific catalogue records in order to understand a manuscript and raise research questions which take into account either its physicality or its nature of evidence for all aspects of life in the medieval period. However, the heterogeneity of codicological-paleographical records in terms of metadata and terminology is weakening the integration and interoperability within the community. Ontologies in particular have been evaluated as a clever approach towards a better communication. The employment of knowledge representation in the field of medieval manuscript descriptions is still narrow, though. Against the state of the art, this paper attempts to add some evidence: it analyses the impact of a top-level ontology designed for modelling cultural objects, namely CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, on a set of fifteen Italian manuscript descriptions encoded in TEI standard using the online platform ManusOnLine. In this case study, the semantics underlying the selected TEI XML-encoded manuscript descriptions were visually explored according to a subset of CIDOC CRM’s classes and properties. In doing so, the process of the creation of a manuscript was split and analysed in its internal phases in accordance with the CIDOC CRM event-modelling principle. Within the dataset, tags as <date> and <name> are used sporadically to encode factual information; however, this case study shows that events and relations can be generally deduced from the XML structure of a manuscript description, although they are not expressively identified. Overall, the analysis demonstrates that CIDOC CRM can represent a valuable aid to overcome manuscripts-related issues — i.e. granularity, contradictory knowledge and terminology — and potentially create an interlinked data platform which could greatly enhance the study of human culture.	000605	000475	000354	000538	000370	000549	000316	000442	000593	000298	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/1/000449/000449.html

Especially historical prints require book specific trained OCR models to achieve applicable results . To reduce the human effort for manually annotating ground truth (GT) various techniques such as voting and pretraining have shown to be very efficient . Calamari is a new open source OCR line recognition software that both uses state-of-the art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented in Tensorflow and giving native support for techniques such as pretraining and voting. The customizable network architectures constructed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers are trained by the so-called Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) algorithm of Graves et al. (2006). Optional usage of a GPU drastically reduces the computation times for both training and prediction. We use two different datasets to compare the performance of Calamari to OCRopy, OCRopus3, and Tesseract 4. Calamari reaches a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.11% on the UW3 dataset written in modern English and 0.18% on the DTA19 dataset written in German Fraktur, which considerably outperforms the results of the existing softwares.	000288	000412	000581	000577	000537	000220	000560	000268	000034	000500	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000451/000451.html

This contrasts with the wealth of potential opportunities that could arise from closer collaborations. We argue that more efforts are needed to make NLP tools work for DH datasets so that that NLP research applied to humanities data receives more attention, leading to the development of evaluation approaches tailored towards relevant research questions. This has the potential to bring methodological advances to NLP, while at the same time confronting DH datasets with powerful state-of-the-art techniques.	000068	000365	000167	000008	000222	000450	000298	000261	000279	000007	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000454/000454.html

Broyles	North Carolina State University	Digital Editions and Version Numbering	Digital editions are easily modified after they are first published — a state of affairs that poses challenges both for long-term scholarly reference and for various forms of electronic distribution and analysis. This article argues that producers of digital editions should assign meaningful version numbers to their editions and update those version numbers with each change, allowing both humans and computers to know when resources have been modified and how significant the changes are. As an examination of versioning practices in the software industry reveals, version numbers are not neutral descriptors but social products intended for use in specific contexts, and the producers of digital editions must consider how version numbers will be used in developing numbering schemes. It may be beneficial to version different parts of an edition separately, and in particular to version the data objects or content of an edition independently from the environment in which it is displayed. The article concludes with a case study of the development of a versioning policy for the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and includes an appendix surveying how a selection of digital editions handle the problem of recording and communicating changes.	000430	000192	000039	000181	000459	000411	000021	000438	000457	000053	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000455/000455.html

We propose that Busa and the IBM engineer Paul Tasman introduced two major innovations that allowed computers to process unstructured text. The first innovation was figuring out how represent unstructured text on punched cards, the way data was encoded and handled at that time. The second innovation was figuring out how to tokenize unstructured phrases on cards into words for further counting, sorting and concording. We think-through these innovations using replication as a form of media archaeology practice that can help us understand the innovations as they were thought through at the time. All this is framed by a letter found in the Busa archives criticizing the project as a tremendous mechanical labour ... of no great utility. We use this criticism to draw attention to the very different meshing of human and mechanical labour developed at Busa’s concording factory.	000362	000380	000457	000587	000027	000109	000588	000346	000589	000069	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000456/000456.html

Na raiz dessa transformação está uma nova materialidade do texto, que, como já discutiram Pédauque (2004, 2006, 2007), Crane et al. (2008), Gradmann & Meister (2008), Chaudiron et al.

Nesse sentido, sendo tarefas das Humanidades a interpretação do texto e a organização da sua transmissão social, essa nova materialidade interpela diretamente os métodos, os horizontes epistemológicos, e a conformação discursiva do campo. Neste artigo discutirei alguns dos efeitos desse processo, fundada em uma abordagem conceitual da materialidade do texto digital já proposta em Paixão de Sousa (2013), e inspirada na reflexão de Pêcheux (1992[1982]) sobre a leitura do arquivo e nas ideias de Unsworth (2006) sobre as formas de atenção.	000453	000459	000352	000608	000460	000347	000109	000355	000458	000346	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000457/000457.html

Aplicando os SIGH para estudar a história da arquitetura	Pesquisas recentes estão demonstrando a potencialidade da aplicação dos Sistemas de Informação Geográfica (SIG) nos estudos culturais e históricos. Esses estudos comprovaram os benefícios, a flexibilidade e, também, as dificuldades que o uso dessa tecnologia da informação traz para a área de humanidades. Nas pesquisas desenvolvidas no campo da documentação do patrimônio, observou-se que grande parte delas defendem e afirmam as vantagens para realizar análises com os SIG mas não conseguem alcançá-las porque ficam restringidas a usar a tecnologia apenas para geolocalizar uma determinada informação. Esse problema merece especial atenção porque limita a geração do conhecimento a partir dos dados coletados e tratados. O presente artigo propõe um exemplo de estudo que contempla a fase de digitalização e análise de uma importante fonte documental, cartográfica e literária da Espanha: o Repertório de todos os caminhos de Espanha no ano de graça de 1546. A rede de caminhos existente no século XVI na Península Ibérica foi um dos principais fatores que favoreceram a consolidação das atividades comerciais, o fluxo do conhecimento e das inovações técnicas construtivas nos novos centros urbanos criados. Propomos uma análise do impacto dessas redes de comunicação, através de mapas temáticos, visualização por justaposição, cálculo de densidades e cálculo do caminho de menor custo para estudar as conexões terrestres na Península. O resultado é a criação de um modelo de dados espacial histórico capaz de inter-relacionar dados alfanuméricos e/ou físico-geográficos que possibilita uma nova perspectiva e fonte de informação para os pesquisadores e profissionais de diversas áreas.	000352	000457	000453	000347	000459	000460	000355	000353	000608	000452	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000458/000458.html

Objetivos – Pretende-se conhecer o pensamento existente referente aos custos da curadoria digital e desenvolver uma proposta de modelo de enquadramento para a análise de custos em curadoria digital, inclusivamente projetos de carácter mais prático. Tal implica abordar a definição deste conceito e a problemática dos custos, baseando-nos nos estudos referentes a modelos de custos. Metodologia - Procedeu-se a uma revisão da literatura, contextualizando a questão dos custos no seio da curadoria digital, delimitada pelos dados recolhidos nas fontes de pesquisa, a Biblioteca do Conhecimento Online (B-On) e o Repositórios Científicos de Acesso Aberto de Portugal (RCAAP). Em seguida, desenvolveu-se um modelo de enquadramento esquematizado com base nas categorias identificadas por via do Método da Comparação Constante, algumas relacionadas com o Modelo de Referência Open Archival Information System (OAIS) e o ciclo de vida Digital Curation Centre (DCC). Tal permitiu desenvolver uma análise de conteúdo das perceções recolhidas em diversos autores, resultando em memorandos, de que este texto é um resumo. Resultados/Conclusão – Propõe-se um esquema de sistematização das problemáticas da curadoria digital, que constitui um modelo de enquadramento que se considera pertinente para a análise de custos em curadoria digital, inclusivamente projetos de carácter mais prático, e que interliga a visão do ciclo de vida da curadoria do objeto digital do DCC e a abordagem do modelo de referência OAIS, numa lógica transversal apreendida pelos Modelos de Custos e Plano/Políticas de gestão dos dados. Conclui-se que se deteta uma mudança de paradigma, de uma visão de black-box para uma abordagem de identificação dos custos e de tentativa de sistematização de modelos de previsão para utilização institucional, como forma de incentivar a transparência e a accountability e de captar o interesse de potenciais financiadores.	000457	000453	000608	000352	000347	000458	000460	000366	000241	000007	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000459/000459.html

Treating collections in cultural institutions as data encourages novel approaches to the use of historic collections. To reframe collections as data is to focus on how digitized collection material, collection metadata, and transcriptions can be used and reused for various types of computational analysis. Scholars active in the field of digital humanities have long taken advantage of computational data. This paper focuses on the work of cultural heritage institutions, which are increasingly offering collections as data. This paper outlines the collections as data project and examines specific examples of cultural institutions active in this space. The paper then details the practices of data brokers, and explores how the data broker model can frame the use of data in cultural heritage institutions. In closing a number of experiments are described that might help mitigate the harm that data in cultural institutions might cause. As we create and share data, can we be sure we are better than data brokers?	000163	000536	000411	000509	000070	000206	000620	000321	000578	000425	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000462/000462.html

It is based on the assumption that the manner in which the knowledge-transfer activities of DH communities are facilitated affects the knowledge they produce. Following an analysis of eight semi-structured interviews of directors, researchers, and administrators, the article considers how DH professionals describe the facilitation of the interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in DH centers. It demonstrates that the transfer of knowledge in DH centers is based on overlapping layers of organic networks and stable organizational structures that support various kinds of knowledge-sharing practices. The transfer of knowledge in DH centers combines the exchange of ideas in the same physical space with online communication at various levels, ranging from outside academia to the internal communication of a research group. Further, the factors that enable information flow also have the capability to restrict potentially meaningful information from entering into the field. As a result, this article suggests that it is important to continue the discussion on the boundaries for the transfer of knowledge in DH.	000351	000441	000241	000466	000077	000485	000620	000213	000401	000477	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000464/000464.html

Teboul | Hined Rafeh	Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute | Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute | Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute	Digital Humanities as Epistemic Cultures: How DH Labs Make Knowledge, Objects, and Subjects	This essay develops a conceptual framework for examining and practicing digital humanities (DH) and DH labs from the perspective of science and technology studies and laboratory studies. We argue that the situatedness of DH labs extends beyond physical/institutional space and includes also epistemic, political, sociological, and disciplinary issues. To explore this, we first outline the constructivist model of laboratory knowledge practices developed through feminist laboratory studies, and how that model’s focus on the laboratory as a producer of research subjects, rather than a container for them, runs counter to narratives about laboratories in DH. We then show how DH labs produce research objects, research subjects, epistemic context, and disciplinary legitimacy. Finally, we present the case of the Tactical Humanities Lab (THL) at Rensselaer, a DH lab situated through Science & Technology Studies and housed within an engineering-centered institute. Through the highlighting of two student-led projects, we show how THL knowledge workers navigate issues of our own identity, the boundaries of STS and DH, the practice of social justice through DH, and the social construction of the boundaries of laboratory work.	000466	000485	000421	000351	000302	000315	000480	000077	000464	000233	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000465/000465.html

The first section investigates three discourses that gave rise to the emergence of a laboratory in the humanities: the transformation of the humanities infrastructure within the university, paradigm shifts in the social sciences, and the expansion of cultural categories of innovation, the maker movement (the proliferation of makerspaces), and the idea of community. Next, the author presents a history of the laboratory in the humanities and determines the shift from a laboratory as a physical place to conceptual laboratory. The last section analyses five models for humanities labs based on laboratories’ statements and operations: the center-type lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab. The research shows that the laboratory turn has emerged in the humanities as a part of a wider process of the laboratorization of social life, which has been occurring since the 1980s. Next, the study indicates the role of digital humanities as the driving force behind building a laboratory space, which supports situated practices, the collaborative, and technology-based projects. The paper shows that the humanities lab does not simply imitate the science lab but adapts this new infrastructure for its own purposes and needs.	000465	000485	000464	000077	000351	000421	000241	000080	000470	000302	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000466/000466.html

A riqueza natural da Califórnia aliada com empreendedorismo, levaram a que a conservação da natureza tenha estado, desde muito cedo, enraizada na legislação e na forma de agir do governo do estado e dos seus habitantes. No entanto, estas ideias têm sido desafiadas por processos intrinsecamente associados ao progresso, especialmente o crescimento exponencial da população e do tecido urbano, e a necessidade cada vez maior da implementação de outros usos do território e de utilização de recursos naturais. A ideia por detrás do projeto é realçar a história da conservação da natureza no estado, visualizar o seu progresso através do tempo, e analisar os fatores socio-económicos e ambientais determinantes para o seu desenrolar durante os últimos 160 anos. A relevância do artigo está em contribuir para o aprofundamento da discussão decorrente do desafio posto pelo crescimento demográfico e urbano. Nesse sentido, a plataforma digital proposta, ao coletar, armazenar e distribuir dados, bem como explorá-los de modo inovador, tem o mérito de estimular a atividade intelectual e levantar novas hipóteses para enriquecer o nosso conhecimento multi-disciplinar sobre a intersecção da história com muitas outras disciplinas.	000367	000608	000352	000355	000453	000353	000347	000458	000452	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000467/000467.html

Building on media archaeology and critical infrastructure studies, I stress the significance of the research infrastructure in the analog humanities and I show how the LAS was organized around the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), a vast ethnographical pre-electronic repository produced at Yale. The paper looks into how the Files were mobilized to secure funding and space for Lévi-Strauss’s lab and gain infrastructural advantage (boosted by the Files’ paper-ness), helping it then to establish its position as richly endowed. As I suggest, it might be due to these pragmatic considerations – not recognized as epistemically valid – that the Laboratory has not had any important place in the readings of Lévi-Strauss’s work. The paper also highlights care work – taking care of resources and relocations – undertaken by Lévi-Strauss and his collaborators. Finally, examining the rationale and history of the HRAF and looking at its use at the LAS, I demonstrate how the tool was refitted to serve the particular needs and ambitions of the Parisian lab.	000460	000321	000411	000472	000465	000485	000351	000312	000479	000308	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000468/000468.html

An application of this software is then detailed and evaluated through a case study where it was deployed within Amazon Mechanical Turk to extract and annotate faces from the archives of Time magazine. Annotation labels included categories such as age, gender, and race that were subsequently used to train machine learning models. The systemization of our crowdsourced data collection and worker quality verification procedures are detailed within this case study. We outline a data verification methodology that used validation images and required only two annotations per image to produce high-fidelity data that has comparable results to methods using five annotations per image. Finally, we provide instructions for customizing our software to meet the needs for other studies, with the goal of offering this resource to researchers undertaking the analysis of objects within other image-heavy archives.	000435	000515	000204	000410	000500	000125	000578	000038	000034	000518	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000469/000469.html

After a previously unsuccessful attempt at creating a digital scholarship center in the late 2000s, our second attempt was rooted in skepticism. Why would this version be any more successful than the last? This paper chronicles how, learning from our mistakes, the Digital Matters Lab negotiated between a loose community of scholars and administrative stakeholders to navigate complex institutional legacies and bear a formal center with a cross-campus partnership, mission, and identity. The Lab’s focus on environmental, financial, and technological sustainability emerged in response to the situated environment of Utah where water rights, public lands, and air quality are critical concerns. As a second iteration digital humanities/scholarship center, the Digital Matters Lab’s emphasis on sustainability also reflects awareness of its vulnerability to the vicissitudes of administrative temperament or shifts in budgetary priorities. This case study concludes by looking to the future of the Digital Matters Lab in terms of scalability and permanence.	000302	000466	000420	000411	000465	000421	000241	000077	000632	000174	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000470/000470.html

Subsequently, few public and private universities, non-academic organisations and individual scholars are actively involved in digital humanities projects: digital library, digital archive and digital databases. Though these digital establishments underpin Indian humanities scholars to engage in digital humanities research practices, the challenges in infrastructure impede them from leveraging the computational techniques and resources. In this paper, we will study the specific challenges of physical infrastructure such as digital humanities lab, digital humanities pedagogy, digital tools and software, and institution and government support. We will also discuss the brief survey report and few interviews which we conducted from the Indian DH community to reinforce our arguments.	000485	000241	000401	000007	000477	000460	000065	000080	000546	000167	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000471/000471.html

The DTU is designed as interdisciplinary trading zone that applies the method of thinkering – the tinkering with technology combined with the critical reflection on the practice of doing digital history.

How to connect a lab’s output to the communities it serves? This essay is a case study of Ooligan Press, a student-run trade press housed within a R-2, teaching-intensive university. Two elements make Ooligan Press distinctive as a DH lab. First, Ooligan is a not-for-profit business folded into a Master’s program in Book Publishing. Profits from sale of Ooligan Press books sustain the lab, which would collapse if its books were steadily unprofitable. Second, the essay uses the DH feminism M.E.A.L.S. framework to explain how Ooligan's horizontal management structure and student ownership of the press manifest in an ethic of care. Unlike most R-1 DH labs, where priorities are set by senior scholars and directors, graduate students decide which projects the lab will develop, and which skills they want to master in exchange for their labor. Because Ooligan is self-sustaining, it can also be self-directing.	000421	000465	000311	000302	000315	000418	000305	000202	000590	000217	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000473/000473.html

Yet the OBNS Slack does not simply facilitate scholarly communication: it also serves as a powerful affective network, bringing together scholars in new and sometimes unexpected configurations. The affective language of emoji is fundamental to the growth of this community. Lab members coin new emoji that are taken up by the community eagerly, many of which are meaningful only within the OBNS environment. It is common to reference Slack emoji in in-person conversation; equally, the OBNS Slack is often home to advising sessions or meetings that in another workplace would take place face-to-face. In this way, the online environment of Slack and the in-person environment of the lab are mutually constitutive. Such usage of Slack may, however, also have a dark side: by celebrating affective community in the workspace, what happens to the distinction between home and office, and consequent erosion of leisure time? We consider whether the affective practices of the OBNS Slack might allow personal and professional boundaries to be blurred in such a way as to prioritize the personal.	000241	000478	000360	000118	000369	000243	000457	000158	000554	000527	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000474/000474.html

As a part of this work the materials that were produced by the project have been made available as Linked Open Data (LOD): translated into RDF, and served through an RDF Server. This article explains what it means to present the material as Linked Open Data by means of working, interactive examples. DPRR didn't do some of the work which has been conventionally associated with Linked Open Data. However, by considering the two conceptions of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data as proposed by Tim Berners-Lee one can see how DPRR's RDF Server fits best into the LOD picture, including how it might serve to facilitate new ways to explore its material. The article gives several examples of ways of exploiting DPRR's RDF dataset, and other similarly structured materials, to enable new research approaches.	000354	000449	000538	000031	000245	000257	000605	000460	000457	000353	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000475/000475.html

What methodologies can be proposed to make them talk? The specificity of these traces leads to specific methodological responses, especially as the aim here is to interpret the traces in both directions of understanding and replayability. It is as much a question of advancing a reflection on the conditions for the recovery of work, as it is of analyzing an artistic approach based on its digital traces. Starting from these epistemological issues, I present the development of two softwares, Rekall and MemoRekall. These tools are part of a larger trend which I call theatre analytics. Theatre analytics is based on data from the traces of the performing arts. Unlike the general approach of big data in the social sciences and humanities, where we seek to determine general, average, profile categories or repeatable (or even predictable) patterns, our primary concern remains to capture the singular, the detail, the difference, the anomaly, in a constant round trip between the micro and the macro dimensions. The ambition of theatre analytics is to offer a different way of looking at big data, more oriented towards complexity than the quantity of data.	000496	000541	000183	000521	000239	000511	000262	000628	000076	000227	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000476/000476.html

The protocol is intended to help researchers in conducting meta-research and adopting this methodology for different purposes, disciplines and approaches. As many of the issues raised here are already covered in manuals for social research, our focus is the specificity of meta-research in the DH environment. The specificity of DH in this respect relies on an intrinsic challenge of bringing together generally undertheorised approaches of the humanities with very formal and process-driven ICT approaches. The main assumption behind this research is that a meaningful change in scholarly practices is taking place and is worth investigating. Moreover, a full assessment of this transformation should not focus exclusively on pioneering research, but rather on the selective uptake of digital practices and methods by researchers in the humanities: those who do not necessarily affiliate themselves with DH but simply use digital tools to explore particular problems. Hence, this paper should be of interest not only to researchers willing to conduct meta analysis, but to all DH practitioners willing to gain critical perspective on their work, as well as for those working on funding, evaluation and research policy. Three pilot studies are discussed in this paper, as they served as a basis for the protocol. They focused on different units of inquiry (individual researchers, projects, research communities) and varied in methodological directions: (a) individual interviews with Polish DH researchers; (b) mixed-methods analysis of digital practice in E-CURATORS, a multicase SSHRC Insight project focusing on archaeological research sites or projects, integrating individual interviews, document analysis and naturalistic observation; and, (c) group interviews with historians and literary scholars conducted within the framework of NEP4DISSENT COST Action. The resulting protocol is discussed in detail and some directions for further research are suggested.	000401	000620	000241	000167	000351	000485	000312	000484	000541	000375	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000477/000477.html

The real story is much more complicated: emerging through a combination of institutional risk-taking and serendipitous accident, the lab was — and remains — an example of how conventional definitions of a laboratory, and particularly the rather fraught label of humanities lab, often come short of capturing the true cross-disciplinary nature of this type of work. More than any academic or methodological template, the DHLC lab emerged through the curiosity and enthusiasm of the students who inhabit it. For that reason, this case study — a brief history of the DHLC’s development, cultural practices, and ongoing work — has been written collaboratively with multiple voices, including the lab director (Natalie Phillips) and the student researchers. Together, we describe the challenges and opportunities created by embarking on a radically interdisciplinary research effort. We report the elements that enabled the DHLC lab to find success through a willingness to abandon expectations and adapt to rapidly evolving research practices, while maintaining our core focus on the humanities. We hope this case study proves useful for those who, like us, seek to explore the vast potential of interdisciplinary lab space for DH practice, the pedagogical benefits of collaborative research, and how to prioritize humanities in a STEM-focused world.	000369	000140	000154	000171	000317	000389	000077	000167	000620	000241	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000478/000478.html

The Electronic Textual Cultures Lab in the Evolving Digital Humanities Landscape	As the scholarly landscape evolves into a more open plain, so do the shapes of institutions, labs, centres, and other places and spaces of research, including those of the digital humanities (DH). The continuing success of such research largely depends on a commitment to open access and open source philosophies that broaden opportunities for a more efficient, productive, and universal design and use of knowledge. The Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory (ETCL; etcl.uvic.ca) is a collaborative centre for digital and open scholarly practices at the University of Victoria, Canada, that engages with these transformations in knowledge creation through its umbrella organization, the Canadian Social Knowledge Institute (C-SKI), that coordinates and supports open social scholarship activities across three major initiatives: the ETCL itself, the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI; dhsi.org), and the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE; inke.ca) Partnership, including sub-projects associated with each. Open social scholarship is the practice of creating and disseminating public-facing scholarship through accessible means. Working through C-SKI, we seek ways to engage communities more widely with publicly funded humanities scholarship, such as through research creation and dissemination, mentorship, and skills training.	000077	000114	000425	000485	000351	000420	000620	000163	000401	000302	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000480/000480.html

The pipeline concept, adopted with limitations by the humanities, documents how a suite of algorithms produces a particular research result, with the goal of enabling interoperability, transparency, and iteration by future scholars who may switch out particular algorithms within the pipeline with different results. A pipeline-based application amplifies the concepts of interoperability and transparency for users by allowing the researcher to toggle on and off particular options, for example selecting and deselecting particular topics of interest from a program of visualizations based on a topic model of a large body of text. Pipelines support modular, interoperable, transparent, and documented processes of research that lend themselves to Prof. Guldi's Theory of Critical Search — the argument that critical thinking increasingly takes place at the design and research stage of digital processes. The article presents the case of how the pipeline concept influenced the development of HaToRI (Hansard Topic Relevance Identifier), an open-source pipeline-based tool for identifying a cohort of thematically-linked passages in the nineteenth-century debates of Britain's parliament. In our pipeline, a series of algorithms move through the steps of cleaning a corpus, organizing them into topics, and selecting particular topics that are used to extract a sub-corpus that matches the user’s interests. Users have the option of searching based on multiple topics rather than merely keywords or a single topic at a time, allowing iterative searches to build upon each other. As an example of the Critical Search process in action, we follow an inquiry based on matching parliamentary reports with material from the Hansard British Parliamentary Debates. Using the pipeline, the user is able to identify multiple common topics of interest, and from these topics, extract a sub-corpus specific to land use and rent in the 19th century British Empire.	000620	000196	000450	000321	000478	000167	000457	000136	000163	000425	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000481/000481.html

In part, this is due to the nature of European record keeping, which often failed to fully capture Amerindian practices. Archaeologists have long attempted to resolve these difficulties through the analysis of early colonial Caribbean materials and objects that reflect both Spanish and Amerindian influence. Through the use of computer modeling it is possible to approach this issue from a new perspective, that of discerning mainland–island or inter–island connections across the pre–Columbian and historic divide. Modeling hypothetical canoe routes based on the location of inhabited sites (between 1000 AD – 1550 AD) across Trinidad and the mainland coast of South America towards the Windward Islands can help to explore possible avenues of travel that were changed or interrupted during the early colonial period. This paper will approach this debate by looking for the location of early colonial Amerindian sites and determining if connections between them would reflect use of European influenced areas in this region.	000355	000531	000353	000283	000490	000352	000467	000625	000494	000346	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000482/000482.html

In documenting lost spaces, these projects also highlight lost or marginalized historical actors. I position these projects at the center of debates surrounding how to recover lost peoples who have been left out or erased from mainstream histories. This article will discuss the various techniques used by digital humanities projects, focusing particularly on Jan Kurth’s Lost Womyn’s Space, Greggor Mattson’s Mapping Lost Lesbian Bars, and my own project, The Feminist Restaurant Project. This article discusses the various techniques used and the value these open access history websites serve for scholars and non-scholars alike. The article finishes by exploring how lost space projects preserve what was not previously preserved, while these websites are simultaneously vulnerable to similar preservation issues that plague digital humanities projects and community archives more broadly, especially those separate from large institutions. These challenges raise the questions: is lost space doomed to be lost? Can the history of LGBTQ+ space be recuperated? What role do digital humanities have in this work? And what does it mean to be found?	000610	000644	000632	000640	000642	000209	000427	000379	000241	000411	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000483/000483.html

The challenge of sustainability in digital studies	This paper emphasizes the need to think about sustainability as a key element of digital studies and digital hermeneutics. It addresses the inherent tensions between the long-term needs of data preservation and maintenance on the one side, and the short life cycles of the data formats, platforms and infrastructures on the other side. Challenges are not limited to the technical maintenance of software, tools and data, but also apply to the wider institutional contexts, epistemic traditions and social practices in which the doing of research in social sciences and humanities are embedded. We explore these tensions at several levels, temporalities and key stages in research – namely data access and building a corpus, establishing a research framework and analysis, and finally the use/dissemination of results.	000163	000477	000411	000632	000269	000336	000620	000077	000401	000215	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000484/000484.html

Situated Research Practices in Digital Humanities - Introduction to the DHQ Special Issue.	Although the concept of digital comes with an assumption of placelessness and detachment from physical space and geographical location, these matters still play a significant role in the way the digital humanities research is practiced today, and also in the future. The location, the surroundings and infrastructure open the questions of accessibility and equality: space shapes the opportunities for doing digital humanities research, both enables and hinders collaboration, and both unifies and divides scholars. The purpose of this special issue is to examine the different aspects of situated research practices of the digital humanities covering two perspectives: physical and virtual. The physical places of research refer to the various digital humanities sites (laboratories, centers, departments) all over the world and more widely to the surroundings a location in a particular city, country, cultural sphere or continent affecting research practices. As virtual environments of digital humanities scholarship, we define the digital internet-based platforms, services, and tools that enable research and scholarly collaboration. The aspects that determine digital humanities research in both physical and virtual places are infrastructure (material and non-material), social interaction (communication and collaboration), and context (social, cultural, and political situatedness). The aspects influence each other and changes in one of them can affect the others. They have also impact on what is studied, the ways research can be done, and, in the end the results of our knowledge, what kind of knowledge digital humanities research can provide.	000401	000466	000241	000077	000465	000464	000477	000471	000351	000480	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000485/000485.html

Recent ludonarrative scholarship on games and interactive storytelling has started to account for what this interactivity means for narrative form, yet it remains difficult to assess how variable narrative is in different games, or how different players’ experiences with the same game can be. This article uses ImagePlot, software for visualizing large collections of images, to visualize playthroughs of a game and compare them. In doing so, it proposes a new method for analyzing narrative in games and digital media, and argues that games reveal how narrative form is shifting, emergent, and playful. By focusing on where and how narrative difference emerges, we can better understand how narrative constructs our current realities, and how it might contribute to different ones in the future.	000066	000190	000548	000002	000101	000414	000511	000276	000429	000331	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000486/000486.html

An expanding range of application areas, such as digital art history and literary studies, illustrates the potential of data visualization for research and education in the humanities. Coinciding with the increasing currency of data as evidence in the humanities, this research addresses a growing interest in data visualization for visual analysis and argumentation. For example, cultural collection visualizations promise a range of possibilities for visual and interactive representations of digital cultural heritage, used both for free exploration and focused research. Based on the concept of the fold, prominently advanced by Gilles Deleuze, this paper outlines a critical framework that draws attention towards the complexity of the underlying data. The fold offers a way to analyze and conceptualize visualizations through the lens of three integrated operations: explication, implication, and complication. It is an opportunity to think of interactive visualizations as portals into coherent, elastic, and ultimately infinite information spaces. Accordingly, it rejects the separation between interactivity and visual encoding and draws attention to the transitions between multiple states of a visualization. We identify design patterns of the fold in data visualizations, devise a framework for the critical interpretation of interactivity in data visualization, and demonstrate the implications for the digital humanities.	000547	000402	000290	000091	000406	000285	000408	000556	000403	000414	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000487/000487.html

The Gothenburg modular architecture for computer-assisted collation situates normalization as the second stage within a five-stage computational pipeline, where it contributes to improving the eventual alignment. In this essay we argue that normalization, in fact, contributes not only to the alignment, but also to the interpretation of the texts.

While Ruttmann’s Berlin. Die Sinfonie der Grosstadt (1927) and Vertov’s Chelovek s kinoapparatom (1929) gained canonical status and exert a considerable influence on filmmaking to this very day, the city symphony has remained a somewhat downplayed and neglected phenomenon in film history. Indeed, besides the handful of well-known titles, there have been more than eighty films made around the globe, many of which fell into oblivion and have received little or no scholarly attention at all. Moreover, even the canonical examples have never systematically and structurally been analyzed in detail in a comparative way. The result is the lack of a sophisticated and clear definition of the city symphony, based on both the canonical films and the greater city symphony corpus. My research sets in at this point, addressing the conspicuous absence of an analysis of city symphony characteristics. It does so by making use of a combined methodology of traditional film analysis methods and digital tools. This article reflects on the methodology applied and tools chosen and put into practice to study and analyze the visual material of city symphonies, which with their highly complex structure, dense imagery, and themes as well as their experimental techniques and striking editing patterns, are a perfect fit for a computational film analysis. Particularly, the digital film/video annotation software ELAN, the Cinemetrics method, a bar chart representation of shot lengths, and the grid visualizations of multiple film frames created with ImageJ play a role in this case study, which also broaches the aspect and benefits of manual digital analysis.	000276	000500	000532	000262	000548	000446	000496	000346	000515	000499	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000495/000495.html

In its temporality and multimodality we treat audiovisual media as exemplary with regard to the wider field of performative arts and their analysis in digital humanities approaches. First, we argue in favor of grounding digital methodology explicitly in scholarly, theoretical approaches to the human experience of performative arts and outline a qualitative approach to compositional patterns and dynamics of affect in audio-visual media. To demonstrate this approach, an exemplary scene analysis highlights the specifics of analyzing experiential qualities based on micro-level descriptions of compositional structures. Eventually, the main body of the article spells out three central challenges with regard to this use of computational tools: 1.) recasting common film analytical vocabulary into a machine readable semantic ontology; 2.) setting up a systematic and applicable annotation routine that is based on the developed semantic ontology and allows for the interpersonal and consistent description of larger corpora; 3.) developing visualizations and query tools that enable the identification and tracing of compositional patterns within complex sets of annotation data. The article concludes by demonstrating the benefits of visualized annotation data by taking up the exemplary analysis sketched out earlier and, ultimately, reflects upon the implications of the outlined AdA filmontology as a programmatic starting point to addressing intersubjective bases of experience in the wider field of digital humanities.	000507	000500	000541	000476	000515	000542	000497	000521	000511	000262	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000496/000496.html

As a result, access to digital archives is still governed overwhelmingly by a logic of search. In practice, this means that users not only need to know what they are looking for, but are also constrained by the interpretive frameworks informing the materials’ labelling. Arguably, this poses restrictions on what they can find, how they can interrelate collection objects, and ultimately, how they can reuse or reinterpret collections. Taking such issues as its starting point, the Sensory Moving Image Archive project (SEMIA) investigated how visual analysis tools can help enable more exploratory forms of engaging with digital archives. In doing so, it focused on sensory features, which are essential to users’ experiences of audiovisual heritage objects but inadequately captured by verbal description. In this article, we discuss the project’s rationale and its early results. First, we place SEMIA in a recent history of visual analysis for media scholarly research, specifying how it both builds on and departs from this history (also in the epistemic sense). Subsequently, we provide more details about the project’s approach to image feature extraction and discuss some analysis results. In our conclusions, we confront those results with what we had initially hoped to gain by applying computer vision methods for enabling access to collections.	000159	000586	000524	000290	000578	000496	000275	000541	000560	000262	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000497/000497.html

In fact, some of our results show that counting and comparing very frequent word lists reveals further similarities: of theme, implied audience, stylistic patternings.

A long-neglected topic in film studies, film colors have gained increasing attention over the last decade. With the development of database-driven analysis, deep-learning tools, and a large range of visualization methods the research project ERC Advanced Grant FilmColors set out to provide a more comprehensive approach to analyzing the manifold aspects of color in film. This paper focuses on a set of strong theoretical and analytical concepts of film colors — including human interpretation — that connect the stylistic, expressive, and narrative dimensions with the development and evaluation of digital methods. A corpus of more than 400 films have been analyzed with a computer-assisted workflow that has been integrated into the video annotation and analysis software VIAN since 2017. VIAN is connected to the online platform VIAN WebApp for the evaluation of results, queries, and visualizations on segment, film and corpus level. Compared to traditional, mostly language-dominated approaches to the aesthetics, technology, and narratology of film colors, the digital humanities tools turn evidence created through the mapping of results into an instantly accessible array of visual representations. By relating detailed human annotation and interpretation to these visual representations, the integrated workflow consisting of the VIAN visual analysis software in combination with the crowdsourcing portal VIAN WebApp has created a comprehensive ecosystem for the investigation of film aesthetics and narration. It thus significantly extends established methods in film studies.	000515	000496	000532	000518	000276	000547	000190	000528	000495	000524	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000500/000500.html

Current practices have some obvious problems, such as a lack of standardization even within the same journal or book series. But a more pressing problem is disguised by the field’s youth: Common citation practices depend on the play experiences and cultural knowledge of a generation of game studies scholars and readers who are largely old enough to have lived through the eras they are discussing. More sustainable and precise alternatives cannot fall back on the tools available for fixed media — such as the direct quotations and page numbers used for books or the screenshots (of images that appear to all viewers) and timecode used for video. Instead, this essay imagines an alternative approach, working in the digital humanities traditions of speculative collections and tool-based argumentation. In the speculative future we present, there are scholarly collections of software, as well as tools available for citing software states and integrating these citations into scholarly arguments. A working prototype of such a tool is presented, together with examples of scholarly use and the results of an evaluation of the concept with game scholars.	000085	000153	000089	000200	000002	000129	000192	000230	000131	000409	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000501/000501.html
000502	2020	14.4	Mercedes I. Salomón Salazar	México - Biblioteca Histórica José María Lafragua; Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla	El Catálogo Colectivo de Marcas de Fuego. Avatares para conformar su canon de autoridades	In 2010, the José María Lafragua Historical Library (Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla) and the Franciscan Library (Universidad de las Américas Puebla - Province of the Holy Gospel of Mexico) published the Catálogo Colectivo de Marcas de Fuego (CCMF). Marcas de fuego (fire brands) are burned imprints made with a heated iron instrument that capture the distinctive seal of a book’s owner on one or several of the volume’s edges. The use of marcas de fuego to claim ownership over books proliferated mainly in conventual libraries during the Colonial period in Mexico. The first priority of CCMF was to go online with an initial selection of 120 marcas de fuego from various convents, institutions, and individuals, in order to show the variety of provenance that can be found in the print and manuscript collections of colonial libraries. Arriving at this first stage of the project did not present exceptional complications since it started as a collaboration between only two institutions. As other libraries joined, however, it became necessary to work systematically to standardize provenance as well as the names of authors. The complexities of standardization and international collaboration are examined in this article, as well as our experiences trying to make the catalog a reliable instrument for other institutions that hold books that bear marcas de fuego. This article considers the inception and development of the project to date, looking in particular at the experience of coordinating the efforts of multiple institutions in different countries. We offer this essay as a case study and analysis that may serve for other similar projects, especially in Latin America.	000014	000608	000312	000346	000353	000027	000438	000491	000348	000061	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000502/000502.html

This essay draws on Walt Whitman’s poems and his material practices to model this mode by interweaving the transformative logics of poetry and code. This can help to illuminate the structural mechanics of each, as well as their mutual dependence on figurative language.

For scholars interested in studying collaboration, network analysis has proven to be a viable methodological approach. Yet, a challenge is that heterogeneous data makes it difficult to study collaboration networks across music genres, which means that there are almost only studies on individual genres. To solve this problem, we propose a generalizable approach to studying the topological properties of music collaboration networks within and between genres that relies on data from the freely available Discogs database. To illustrate the approach, we provide a comparison of the genres Jazz and Hip Hop.	000604	000347	000364	000460	000381	000613	000453	000520	000298	000346	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000504/000504.html

These developments make possible innovative, revelatory digital cultural analytics work across many sources, from historical footage to contemporary images. They are also ideally suited to provide novel insight to the study of K-pop choreography. As a specifically non-textual modality, K-pop dance performances, particularly those of corporate and government-sponsored ""idol"" groups, are a key component of K-pop’s core mission of projecting ""soft power"" into the international sphere. A related consequence of this strategy is the ready availability in online video repositories of many K-pop music videos, starting from the milieu's origins in the 1990s, including an ever-growing collection of official ""dance practice"" videos and fan-contributed dance cover videos and supercuts from live performances⁠. These latter videos are a direct consequence of the online propagation of the ""Korean wave"" by generations of tech-savvy fans on social media platforms. In this paper, we describe the considerations and choices made in the process of applying deep learning-based posed detection to a large corpus of K-pop music videos, and present the analytical methods we developed while focusing on a smaller subset of dance practice videos. A guiding principle for these efforts was to adopt techniques for characterizing, categorizing and comparing poses within and between videos, and for analyzing various qualities of motion as time-series data, that would be applicable to many kinds of movement choreography, rather than specific to K-pop dance. We conclude with case studies demonstrating how our methods contribute to the development of a typography of K-pop poses and sequences of poses (""moves"") that can facilitate a data-driven study of the constitutive interdependence of K-pop and other cultural genres. We also show how this work advances methods for ""distant"" analyses of dance performances and larger corpora, considering such criteria as repetitiveness and degree of synchronization, as well as more idiosyncratic measures such as the ""tightness"" of a group performance."	000517	000364	000510	000395	000514	000511	000476	000521	000496	000500	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000506/000506.html

In each case collaboration amongst students was not only key, but also enabled by Mediate, which allows students to work in groups to generate large amounts of data about audiovisual media. Further, the process of data generation produces quantitative and qualitative observation of the mediated interplay of sight and sound. A major outcome of these classes for the faculty teaching them has been the concept of audiovisualities: the physically and culturally interpenetrating modes of audiovisual experience and audiovisual inscription where hearing and seeing remediate one another for all of us as sensory and social subjects. Throughout the article, we chart how audiovisualities have emerged for students and ourselves out of digital annotation in Mediate.	000512	000496	000541	000586	000516	000543	000542	000254	000239	000527	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000507/000507.html

Digital Image Sonification As Synesthetic AudioVisual Digital Humanities	Computers have the capacity to transpose the pixels, shapes, and other features of visual material into sound. This act of data correlation between the visual and the audial produces a new artifact, a sonic composition created from the visual source. The new artifact, however, correlates precisely to data in the original, thus allowing for fresh ways of perceiving its form, content, and context. Seeming to distort the visual object into an aural one paradoxically allows an observer to observe the visual evidence anew, with more accuracy. A kind of generative, synesthetic criticism becomes possible by cutting across typical boundaries between the visual and the audio, the optic and the aural. Listening to as well as looking at visual artifacts by way of digital transpositions of data enables better close readings, more compelling interpretations, and deeper contextual understandings. Building on my earlier scholarship into image glitching, remixing, and sonification, this essay investigates a photograph of Joan Baez performing at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley, California, during the early 1960s. The image comes from my project on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival and the history of the folk music revival on the West Coast of the United States. Here, the use of digital image sonification becomes particularly intriguing. While we cannot magically recover the music being made in the photograph, we can more closely attend to the ghosts of sound within the silent snapshot. Digital image sonification does not recover the music itself, but it does help to amplify issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy, and performance in my perceptions of Baez making music in the photograph. Using the ear as well as the eye to scan the image for its multiple levels of meaning leads to unsuspected perceptions, which then support more revealing analysis. In digital image sonification, a cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history, and human perception emerges, activating visual materials for renewed scrutiny. In doing so, this mode of AudioVisual DH activates the scholarly imagination in promising new ways.	000521	000246	000397	000513	000543	000507	000234	000122	000161	000364	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000508/000508.html

It will then present original research from the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), in conjunction with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin Historical Society, on a project entitled Unlocking the Airwaves: Revitalizing an Early Public Radio Collection.

During the annotation process the researcher typically defines the precise time slot in which a sign occurs and then enters the appropriate gloss for the sign. The aim of this project is to develop a set of tools to assist the annotation of the signs and their formal features in a video irrespectively of its content and quality. Recent advances in the field of deep learning have led to the development of accurate and fast pose estimation frameworks. In this study, such a framework (namely OpenPose) has been used to develop three different methods and tools to facilitate the annotation process. The first tool estimates the span of a sign sequence and creates empty slots in an annotation file. The second tool detects whether a sign is one- or two-handed. The last tool recognizes the different handshapes presented in a video sample. All tools can be easily re-trained to fit the needs of the researcher.	000506	000309	000364	000397	000362	000517	000457	000453	000357	000522	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000510/000510.html

Like the work of videographic practitioners who communicate their findings through the audiovisual medium, rather than the written medium, this work seeks to engage with what Catherine Grant and Brad Haseman have called performative research by applying a practice-led approach to moving image analysis. Through a physical and virtual embodiment of film and dance form, we seek to better understand the formal implications of dance’s integration into cinematic space and the material conditions that affected filmmakers’ narrative and stylistic choices. The Movement Visualization Tool (mv tool) is a virtual research environment that generates live feedback of multiple agents’ movement. Accessible motion capture technology renders an abstracted skeleton of the moving agents, providing information about movement pathways through space using color-based and historical traceform filters. The tool can also replicate a mobile frame aesthetic, allowing for a constructed mover and a virtually constructed camera to engage in performative dialogue. We use the mv tool and videographic methods to recreate and disseminate two cases: movement scales from Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies and dance sequences from narrative cinema. Rather than working from existing audiovisual content, we posit that the act of recreating the movement phrases leads to a deeper understanding of the choreography and, in the case of the filmic examples, of the formal practices that led to their creation.	000514	000276	000496	000521	000166	000500	000486	000476	000386	000444	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000511/000511.html

Clement | Liz Fischer	University of Texas at Austin | University of Texas at Austin	Audiated Annotation from the Middle Ages to the Open Web	Current theories about the significance of annotations in literary studies are based primarily on assumptions developed in print culture about verbal texts. In these textual theories, the text is typically present, authorized, and centralized as the ideal text for an ideal reader, and to annotate is to add authorized comments in a sociotechnical system that includes publication, dissemination, and reception. To audiate is to imagine a song that's not playing. In music learning theory, audiation is based on the concept that the musician learns to play music by developing their own musical aptitude, her individual interpretation of a musical score based on her particular experience of the music. This short article introduces audiation as an alternate theoretical framing for articulating the significance of personal literary annotations. Comparing commentary on psalms in the Middle Ages to IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) web annotations, we use the concept of audiation to situate annotations within literary study in terms of a more capacious understanding of the individual's interpretation of text and of the reading experience as part of an unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized system. By bringing together theories and technologies of annotation with sound, we offer the concept of audiated annotations as a means to re-evaluate modes of access, discovery, and analysis of cultural objects in digital sound studies.	000507	000173	000254	000586	000121	000457	000239	000527	000154	000542	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000512/000512.html

I utilize Kaleidoscope Pro, a software suite built to visualize and cluster bioacoustic recordings (typically birds and bats) to cluster points of tension in the soundscape of Shaw, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in DC. Clustering and visualizing these sounds (which include car horns, sirens, public transportation, and music) makes audible the sonic markers of gentrification in Shaw. Furthermore, listening to gentrification is a call to engage with the sonic right to the city, histories of legislating sound, and sonorities of memory and nostalgia. This work contributes to the burgeoning black digital humanities canon by thinking through how computational methods can help us to hear black life. Although the digital humanities have turned to embrace the sonic in recent years, there is still much to be done in considering how to embrace the aural in DH work. This project invites us to listen closely to a changing neighborhood, and emphasizes sound as a valid mode of knowledge production, questioning how a sonic rendering of gentrifying space through the digital might move us toward more equitable soundscapes.	000543	000521	000239	000246	000507	000157	000541	000557	000508	000386	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000513/000513.html

One specific example would be the presentation of illness narratives. To illustrate this situation, I examine the concept of illness narratives, particularly those created by dance artists, and use my movement history, Lithium Hindsight 360, as a case study.

The intellectual mixtape uses jazz and hip hop as a framework to create an audio compilation and “conversation” that samples literary-audio texts (such as SunRa speeches, Octavia Butler interviews, Tracy K. Smith’s poetry readings, etc.). Each track of the intellectual mixtape has three audios: 1) the literary-audio texts from the syllabus, 2) the students’ voice in their own words, and 3) an audio of the students’ choice. As a companion to each track, students write 500 words of liner notes that must include the title of their track and their curation and mixing decisions.Students then publish their entire intellectual mixtape (three or more tracks) with original or remixed cover art on an online platform. The first part of the study will discuss the structure of the intellectual mixtape assignments. In these assignments, students are provided with literary-audio texts, required to complete and submit audio homework assignments, and taught the basics of audio editing. This method of teaching and analyzing literature shifts the practice of literary analysis from top down approaches that privileges the authority of the text and instead encourages the student to converse with the text to create new knowledge. This methods also reflects the artistic practice of Afrofuturist artists and theorist who improvise, remix, and sample to create their work. The second part of the study will discuss a performance and midterm adaptation of the Intellectual Mixtape Project entitled Sound of Space: An Interactive Afrofuturist Experience. Sound of Space was an immersive performance with four-sensory stations that featured Afrofuturist themes. The midterm adaptation was showcased in the Cube, a four-story high, state-of-the-art multimedia black box theater at Virginia Tech. In preparation for the performance, students merged sound engineering, 360 degree-video-projection, improvisational performance, and light design. Sound of Space introduced students and audiences’ to an immersive Afrofuturist-audio experience and pushed the boundaries of literary analysis. The third part of the study will address challenges with the Intellectual Mixtape Project. Challenges include finding relevant literary-audio texts and dealing with the many limitations imposed by U.S. copyright law. Some ways to address the challenges imposed by U.S. copyright law might be to 1) reclassify sampling audio as a form of quotation, 2) use databases of copyright-free music, 3) find culturally significant works from lesser-known artists who will license their tracks, and/or 4) pay royalties.	000507	000527	000239	000254	000542	000541	000543	000314	000358	000173	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000516/000516.html

However, software solutions for the scholarly study of film that utilise video analysis algorithms are still relatively rare. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of related work in this field, review current developments in computer vision, compare machine and human performance for some visual recognition tasks, and outline the requirements for video analysis software that would optimally support scholars of film studies.	000532	000500	000523	000515	000276	000560	000497	000496	000524	000190	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000518/000518.html

This article argues that podcasting’s unique technical affordances — particularly RSS feeds and user-entered metadata — open up productive methods for exploring the cultural practices and meanings of the medium. We share three different methods for studying RSS feeds and podcast metadata: 1) visualizing how topics and keywords trend over time; 2) visualizing networks of commonly associated keywords entered by podcasters; and 3) analyzing norms and common practices for the duration of podcasts (as a time-based media format, podcasting is unusual in that it is not bound by the programming schedules and technical limitations that provide strict parameters for most audiovisual forms). The methods and preliminary results reveal how metadata can function as a surrogate for studying large collections of time-based media objects. Yet our study also shows that, when it comes to born digital media, the metadata are never fully separate from the objects they describe. We argue that future work in AV in DH needs to delineate between methods best suited for digitized media collections compared to those most appropriate for born digital media collections.	000541	000239	000509	000554	000527	000507	000241	000353	000110	000543	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000519/000519.html

This paper aims to find more effective links between music-related big data and artificial intelligence algorithms by incorporating principles with a strong grounding in music theory. We show that it is possible to increase the accuracy of two common algorithms (mode prediction and key prediction) by using music-theory based techniques during the data preparation process. We offer methods to alter often-used Krumhansl Kessler profiles , and the manner in which they are employed during preprocessing, to aid the connection of musical big data and mode or key predicting algorithms.	000364	000517	000146	000504	000188	000522	000373	000170	000521	000397	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000520/000520.html

Following upon the strain of digital humanities practice that Mark Sample terms the deformed humanities, this essay subjects a single film to a series of deformations: the classic musical Singin' in the Rain. Accompanying more than twenty original audiovisual deformations in still image, GIF, and video formats, the essay considers both what each new version reveals about the film (and cinema more broadly) and how we might engage with the emergent derivative aesthetic object created by algorithmic practice as a product of the deformed humanities.	000276	000508	000507	000496	000543	000239	000511	000513	000364	000246	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000521/000521.html
000522	2021	15.1	Iben Have | Kenneth Enevoldsen	Aarhus University | Aarhus University	From close listening to distant listening: Developing tools for Speech-Music discrimination of Danish music radio	Digitization has changed flow music radio. Competition from music streaming services like Spotify and iTunes has to a large extend outperformed traditional playlist radio, and the global dissemination of software generated playlists in public service radio stations in the 1990s has superseded the passionate music radio host. But digitization has also changed the way we can do research in radio. In Denmark digitization of almost all radio programming back to 1989, have made it possible to actually listen to the archive to investigate how radio content has changed historically. This article investigates the research question: How has the distribution of music and talk on the Danish Broadcasting Corporation’s radio channel P3 developed 1989-2019 by comparing a qualitative case study with a new large-scale study. Methodologically this shift from a close listening to a few programs to large-scale distant listening to more than 65,000 hours of radio enables us to discuss and critically compare the methods, results, strengths and shortcomings of the two analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image recognition of spectograms of the audio outperforms alternative approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The large-scale study presented shows that the CNN-based approach generalizes well, even without fine-tuning, to speech and music classification in Danish radio, with an overall accuracy of 98%.	000364	000543	000507	000373	000608	000517	000457	000453	000542	000346	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000522/000522.html

Founded during the liberation of France, this state-owned company filmed more than 20,000 news reports shown in French cinemas and throughout the world over its 24 years of activity. The project brings together research organizations with a dual historical and technological perspective. ANTRACT's goal is to study the production process, the film content, the way historical events are represented and the audience reception of Les Actualités Françaises newsreels using innovative AI-based data processing tools developed by partners specialized in image, audio, and text analysis. This article focuses on the data processing apparatus and tools of the project. Automatic content analysis is used to select data, to segment video units and typescript images, and to align them with their archival description. Automatic speech recognition provides a textual representation and natural language processing can extract named entities from the voice-over recording; automatic visual analysis is applied to detect and recognize faces of well-known characters in videos. These multifaceted data can then be queried and explored with the TXM text-mining platform. The results of these automatic analysis processes are feeding the Okapi platform, a client-server software that integrates documentation, information retrieval, and hypermedia capabilities within a single environment based on the Semantic Web standards. The complete corpus of Les Actualités Françaises, enriched with data and metadata, will be made available to the scientific community by the end of the project.	000518	000532	000515	000291	000346	000457	000364	000500	000365	000044	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000523/000523.html

The virtuous cycle of access, research, and preservation that MEP realizes is built upon a foundation of technological advance (software development) plus large-scale partnership networks with scholars, students, and institutions of historical memory such as moving image archives. The development of our Onomy vocabulary tool and NEH-funded Semantic Annotation Tool (SAT) are detailed, including their application in two advancement grants from the NEH regarding 1) early cinema history, and 2) television newsfilm that covered the civil rights movement in the U.S. MEP is fundamentally 1) a sustainability project that 2) develops literacies of moving image and visual culture history, and 3) functions as a collaborative incubator that fosters new research questions and methods ranging from traditional Arts and Humanities close-textual analysis to computational distant reading. New research questions in relation to these workflows will literally transform the value of media archives and support the development of interdisciplinary research and pedagogy/curricular goals (e.g., media literacy) regarding the study of visual culture history and its legacies in the 21st century.	000515	000541	000275	000509	000478	000542	000497	000239	000375	000578	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000524/000524.html

A Philosophical Approach to a Debate in Text Encoding	"Is hierarchical XML apt for the encoding of complex manuscript materials? Some scholars have argued that texts are non-hierarchical entities and that XML therefore is inadequate. This paper argues that the nature of text is such that it supports both hierarchical and non-hierarchical representations. The paper distinguishes (1) texts from documents and document carriers, (2) writing from ""texting"", (3) actions that can be performed by one agent only from actions that require at least two agents to come about (shared actions), (4) finite actions from potentially infinitely ongoing actions. Texts are described as potentially infinitely ongoing shared actions which are co-produced by author and reader agents. This makes texts into entities that are more akin to events than to objects or properties, and shows, moreover, that texts are dependent on human understanding and thus mind-dependent entities. One consequence from this is that text encoding needs to be recognized as an act participating in texting which in turn makes hierarchical XML as apt a markup for text representation, or rather: for texting, as non-hierarchical markup. The encoding practices of the Bergen Wittgenstein Archives (WAB) serve as the main touchstone for my discussion."	000082	000199	000457	000362	000051	000254	000356	000050	000087	000117	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000525/000525.html

In this paper we show that symmetric compacted directed acyclic word graphs (SCDAWGs) - a refinement of suffix trees - offer an ideal basis for corpus exploration, helping to answer many of the questions raised in DH research in an elegant way. From a simplified point of view, the advantages of SCDAWGs rely on two properties. First, needing linear computation time, the index offers a joint view on the similarities (in terms of common substrings) and differences between all text. Second, structural regularities of the index help to mine interesting portions of texts (such as phrases and concept names) and their relationship in a language independent way without using prior linguistic knowledge. As a demonstration of the power of these principles we look at text alignment, text reuse in distinct texts or between distinct authors, automated detection of concepts, temporal distribution of phrases in diachronic corpora, and related problems.	000222	000050	000454	000255	000235	000041	000434	000196	000346	000033	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000526/000526.html

In this case study, we situate the podcast Books Aren’t Dead (BAD), an affiliate of the Fembot Collective, within a broader context of digital humanities scholarship and the field's potential to utilize audio technology to realize feminist approaches. BAD, as a podcast, serves as an open-access medium that brings authors and reviewers together in a collaborative context. Audiobook reviews allow for a conversation between author and interviewer, whereby the author can place the work in a broader scholastic and contemporary context for listeners as well as actively engage with constructive critique and questions. The result is a dynamic scholarly communication rather than the static textual product of a book review. We discuss the unique role of audio technology within the knowledge production process from a performance studies and archival point of view. Additionally, in the spirit of the project BAD, we also provide an addendum to our textual discussion by including a podcast where we discuss these themes as co-producers, graduate students, and young academics, exploring how audio technology can break down barriers to publication and authorship.	000156	000541	000239	000202	000509	000554	000516	000543	000425	000254	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000527/000527.html

In order to understand how they affect film and media studies, this article reflects on databases in the context of feminist film historiography. Focusing on the collaborative Women Film Pioneers Project (WFPP) (https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/), it considers the methodological matters when presenting and accessing research results online. One of the biggest challenges for film and media historians today is not only to retrieve and preserve historic sources but also to make both historical records and research outcomes accessible, while taking into account the unknowability of history. How can we identify and include the many blind spots when trying to reconstruct the past? In this article, it is made the case that due to their openness and variable use, digital databases, such as the Women Film Pioneers Project, seem to be perfectly suited to respond to this challenge.	000428	000515	000240	000524	000527	000156	000541	000216	000500	000171	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000528/000528.html

Today, however, Zapotec speakers are generally unable to read these texts, due to lack of access to the texts and an unfamiliarity with the orthographic practices. Moreover, significant changes have taken place in the grammar in the intervening centuries. This results in a situation where Zapotec people may not have access to history in their own language. Ticha is an online digital text explorer that provides access to images, transcriptions, analysis, and translations of the Colonial Zapotec texts. The Ticha project includes in-person workshops with Zapotec community members as part of an iterative development process. Feedback from these interactions inform design decisions for the project. Here we reflect on transnational collaboration with stakeholders in building a digital scholarship project that seeks to use the power of digital humanities to democratize access to materials and resources which were previously the exclusive domain of a few experts. When community members have access to important documents from their own history, archiving, scholarship, and community engagement can be brought together in a powerful synthesis.	000355	000546	000312	000494	000287	000031	000591	000631	000524	000491	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/4/000529/000529.html

Samples of gameplay illustrate AID’s remarkable linguistic competence and domain knowledge, as well as its capacity for what can only be described as wackiness. More striking are AID’s innovative gameplay mechanics, which reimagine how we interact with large language models. Game play entails a procedural and incremental process of engaging with GPT-2 that opens up the possibility of developing a holistic and interdisciplinary framework for meaningful qualitative evaluation of language models that does not have commercial use as its necessary endgame. With respect to both evaluation and writing itself, AID situates human players inextricably in the loop as necessary partners with autonomous systems.

Data visualization tools are one type of middleware that can be all but forgotten when one is presented with final products such as papers and presentations containing visualizations . Since the output of various software packages is sometimes similar, it is easy to forget the assumptions that went into the diagram, the dataset, and the software when looking at the final product — or even while using the tool if one becomes sufficiently accustomed to the interface. In this review, I revisit the visualization suite Palladio – which Miriam Posner has called a Swiss Army knife for humanities data – and the many projects that have made use of Palladio’s core features in the years since its launch. I examine the strengths and limitations of Palladio, as a network and map-making tool for exploring data and for rapidly prototyping diagrams, designed with an iterative process in mind. I contrast this iterative mentality with the analytic sensibility of tools like Gephi and Cytoscape, and review the primary features of Palladio with one primary case study (my own visualizations of the French Enlightenment network) and examples of how the features have been used in other digital humanities projects. Palladio is very useful for qualitative studies of data that include geospatial and chronological dimensions, especially when the data are tagged with different types of qualitative metadata, but it also tends to impose a historical geographical view on the data by foregrounding geospatial relationships, time, and other historical considerations.	000629	000487	000285	000091	000547	000548	000604	000289	000621	000244	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000534/000534.html

It begins with an explanation of the rationale behind choosing the Morellian practice of attribution, continues with a survey of another effort at computationally implementing Morelli’s method, and then presents our own computational techniques and results. The article concludes with what we have come to understand about the roles of responsibility, trust, and expertise in the social practice of art attribution, and the dangers in assuming that such human entailments are native to digital computers.	000634	000022	000560	000105	000457	000555	000069	000352	000109	000165	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000540/000540.html

Spurred by recent advances in computing alongside disciplinary expansions of what counts as evidence, audio and visual ways of knowing are enjoying a more prominent place in the field. Whether the creation, analysis, and sharing of audiovisual data or audiovisual ways of communicating scholarly knowledge, scholars are building compelling avenues of inquiry that are changing how we know, what we know, and why we know in the digital humanities (DH). These epistemological shifts not only challenge existing methodological and theoretical pathways within the field of audiovisual studies, but most importantly defy existing knowledge hierarchies within the entire field of DH.	000239	000542	000543	000509	000527	000507	000254	000275	000477	000620	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000541/000541.html

This is a small but important part of modelling historians’ analysis of such sources, as they extract a lot of information from the names in text, and this information constrain their search. The task of parsing proper names seems to be easy, but it is a hard problem even for the modern languages, and even more challenging for the languages of historical sources. The test case used for the research was from the middle 19th century census for the old town centre of Zagreb. In order to evaluate and compare the fitness of the probabilistic and rule-based models for the task of inferring standard name form, both conditional random field (CRF) and rule-based models based on stable model semantics (Answer Set Programming Rules) were developed. Our results indicated that the rule-based approach is more suitable for inferring standard name forms from historical texts than the more widespread statistical approach.	000357	000574	000223	000333	000627	000346	000606	000354	000365	000449	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/1/000544/000544.html

The article examines a scene in which the daughter confronts her mother's trauma-inducing behavior on her as a young girl, and the boyfriend confronts the mother-in-law's animosity toward him. The article delves into the background for the transactional, belligerent, and obligational thinking behind the family relationship of the German couple compared to the more affectionate and conciliatory relationship in all other versions. The investigation postulates that the family relationships in the German context must be seen within the context of the Inability to Mourn, a major psychological study by Margarete and Alexander Mitscherlich in the 1960s of politically salient post World War 2 trauma among a large variety of social groups in West (and East) Germany. The emotional repression as a result of various forms of guilt, which never explicitly surfaced in the confrontations, was passed down from generation to generation, while this same, or similar social psychological contexts was seemingly not a factor in other countries, many of which had also experienced repressive dictatorships during World War 2 and afterwards, in which adaptations of these series were produced.

Hermeneutic approaches in the digital humanities have been rather agnostic about the epistemological premises of hermeneutic theory. These can be summarized as (1) differentiation author/text, (2) hermeneutic circle and (3) dependency text/recipient. In this article, we present the concept of hermeneutic visualization as a means of bridging the gap between classic literary hermeneutics and the emerging practice of digital literary hermeneutics. Since data visualization is based on epistemological premises stemming from the natural or social sciences, it is not well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. In this article, we argue that the digital humanities can meet hermeneutic demands through a critical interface and visualization concept. We discuss four postulates that can be used as guidelines and help transform more traditional data visualization into hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the epistemological foundations of hermeneutic theory. We demonstrate the usefulness of the postulates with an interactive prototype Stereoscope designed to support them.In our article, we refer to the discussions and results of the three-year research project Three-Dimensional Dynamic Data Visualisation and Exploration for Digital Humanities Research (3DH) at the University of Hamburg (04/2016–12/2018). The considerations on hermeneutic visualizations presented here are therefore the result of a very productive collaboration. Therefore we cannot claim the presented ideas as our own.	000487	000556	000091	000285	000290	000569	000414	000408	000337	000228	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/2/000547/000547.html

Its goal is to create a comprehensive database of all the locations, characters, and events in Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha fictions with the aim of visualizing the data through a series of deep atlases and other displays. This paper traces the development cycle of a supplementary narrative structure analysis dashboard that allows users to explore the chronology, narrative status, and date range of all of the texts set in his mythic county.

The approach we here propose is based on Semantic Web technologies in order to guarantee interoperability and reuse across scientific communities of diachronic terminological resources that can be thus easily accessed, interconnected and mutually enriched. More specifically, the representation of dynamic evolution of terms and concepts was performed in OWL using the N-ary relations mechanisms. In addition, a set of SWRL rules was set up, in order to automatically identify the evolution of the concepts evoked within a text, as well as the terms representing these concepts. Our model was adopted to formally represent diachronic aspects of Saussure’s terminology as they emerge from his works. An example will be provided to highlight the potential of such a knowledge structuration for gaining a wider understanding of the profound terminological and conceptual changes brought about by the paradigmatic and epistemological revolutions in sciences.	000449	000044	000538	000354	000348	000457	000362	000655	000349	000022	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/3/000549/000549.html

The significant contribution this article presents is to demonstrate how word vector models can be used to explore the way concepts have shifted in meaning over time, as they migrated across space, by comparing newspapers from different countries published between 1840 and 1914. We define a concept, rather pragmatically, as a key term or core idea that has been used in historical discourse: an abstraction or mental representation that has served as a building block for thoughts and beliefs. We use historical newspapers in English, Finnish, German and Swedish from collections in the UK, US, Germany, and Finland, as well as the Europeana collection. As use cases, we analyze how the different conceptual constructs of “nation” and “illness” emerged and changed between 1840 and 1920. Conceptual change over time is simulated by creating a series of overlapping word vector models, each spanning ten years. Historical vocabularies are retrieved on the basis of vector space proximity. Conceptual change across space is simulated by comparing the historical change of vocabularies in newspaper collections from different nations in several languages. This computational approach to conceptual history opens up new ways to identify patterns in public discourse over longer periods of time and across borders.	000598	000648	000338	000346	000445	000353	000244	000096	000457	000176	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000550/000550.html

On the one hand, they help understand the construction of text. On the other hand, topics that are being considered sensitive at the time of the manuscript gain coherence and contextuality when taking alterations into account, especially in the case of deletions. The analysis of alterations in manuscripts, though, is a traditionally very tedious work. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to help categorize alterations in documents. In particular, we present a new probabilistic model (Alteration Latent Dirichlet Allocation, alterLDA in the following) that categorizes content-related alterations. The method proposed here is developed based on experiments carried out on the digital scholarly edition Berlin Intellectuals, for which alterLDA achieves high performance in the recognition of alterations on labelled data. On unlabelled data, applying alterLDA leads to interesting new insights into the alteration behavior of authors, editors and other manuscript contributors, as well as insights into sensitive topics in the correspondence of Berlin intellectuals around 1800. In addition to the findings based on the digital scholarly edition Berlin Intellectuals, we present a general framework for the analysis of text genesis that can be used in the context of other digital resources representing document variants. To that end, we present in detail the methodological steps that are to be followed in order to achieve such results, giving thereby a prime example of a Machine Learning application in the Digital Humanities.	000576	000579	000489	000442	000346	000313	000220	000583	000168	000412	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/2/000553/000553.html

Circulating Spaces: Literary and Language Worlds in a Global Age, a podcast series created, produced, and published by the authors, acts as our case study. The podcast models a complex network of relations by highlighting topics and featuring guests who co-exist within academic and public (often understood as non-academic) spaces. These networks help to reshape our understanding of the publics of academia by breaking down the binary between the public and academic. They point toward ways in which more nuanced networks of affinity between the academy and the public may be constructed and negotiated by embracing the digital and the open.

Greater attention needs to be given to the format and presentation of the underlying data and the interpretation of any data-derived results. Visually appealing graphic renderings of data, high classification accuracy and confidence scores, and impressive summary statistics can be rhetorically structured to appeal to preconceived notions and commonplace understandings. While making arguments from the summary of significant features might be permissible in some applications of what is now commonly called data science, humanistic uses of computation put forward in the service of academic arguments require much greater access to and grounding in interpretable digital objects. When features are derived from text, these underlying features need to be shown and interpreted. This essay argues that claims made on behalf of computational models need to be evaluated and warranted by a set of shared assumptions and the ability to test and verify that the data are indeed comprehensible according to the norms of the shared interpretative community.	000091	000067	000656	000457	000578	000362	000109	000188	000436	000034	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/2/000555/000555.html

This essay describes how the application of these computational methods to digital art data transforms information inherent in images into new knowledge. We support this claim by presenting various research examples in the field of digital art history, which utilize computational methods for art analysis. We argue that in order to create new knowledge, we must involve transformative processes — from analog to digital data and digital to computational methods. Traditional methods used in art history to access datasets, link or edit images provide suggestions and validations for current practices, but are not sufficient role models for the processing of digital data because they were developed under varying technological conditions and standards and within a different historical context. Aby Warburg’s (1866-1929) Mnemosyne Atlas, which aimed to visualize visual continuities from antiquity to the Renaissance, is one method often cited in the context of digital humanities. We argue that the characteristics of digital data, for example being reproducible or modifiable, require innovative computer methods that do not have a direct analog counterpart. Our argument is based on the success of current projects and personal experience: the authors have expertise in computer vision and art history. They have created and applied computational methods to analyze art data and are thus able to identify shortcomings of traditional approaches and suggest possible solutions. Eventually this essay presents solutions, which demonstrate the great potential of computational methods for a data analysis: approaches enable an easy and explorative access to digital image collections through visualization techniques or an automatic object search. Computational methods establish links between thousands of images, thereby identifying the adaptation of specific motifs or styles by artists over time, or enable a conspicuous editing of images, thus providing new insights for art history unobtainable with analog methods.	000578	000532	000497	000299	000537	000071	000253	000524	000608	000546	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/3/000560/000560.html
000561	2021	15.3	Roman Bleier	Centre for Information Modelling, University of Graz	How to cite this digital edition?	Citing and referencing is an important aspect of scholarship as it makes research processes retraceable and transparent. Over centuries citation practices have been optimized for print publications. However, the digital revolution and the increased scholarly output online provide new challenges. For instance, the physical form of the book which was the basis for citation styles in the past is replaces by different types of online resources of which only some resemble books. Another issue is that digital resources on the internet are not as durable as printed books that are distributed in multiple copies in libraries across the world. For scholarly citation this is a problem as a website referenced today, might not be available tomorrow or might have changed its address which is frequently used for referencing.  Editions, in print or digital, are supposed to be stable reference points for scholarly discourse as discussions the scholarly community engages today should still be reproducible in 50 or 100 years – as it is the case with printed scholarly editions from the 19th century. Consequently, assurance of long-term availability of resources and clarity of how and what to cite in a digital edition is vital. That the lack of providing this kind of assurance and information makes online resources less attractive for citation has been shown in a recently published survey using as a case study British History Online and Early English Books Online. The survey assessed if researchers prefer to cite print or digital resources and the results indicate that there is still a very strong culture of non-citation of electronic resources among students and researchers in the humanities. The authors of the study suggest that creators of web content can contribute to facilitate the citation of digital resources by providing recommendations on how to cite a resource and by having a solid permalink strategy .The following study tries to explore this topic further. After a brief introduction and discussion of the key issues of digital citation such as broken links and strategies to provide persistent identifiers for the citation and access of online content, the results of a survey of 100 digital scholarly editions will be presented. The survey focuses on citation recommendations provided and permalink strategies used by digital scholarly editions. In this context the paper will look at how permalink/PID strategies and citation recommendations can make digital editions better citable. A closer look will be taken at citation recommendations of selected editions in order to highlight possible solutions.	000282	000194	000164	000181	000192	000111	000039	000261	000270	000460	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/3/000561/000561.html

We know that the laws and customs of the age emphasized clothing that matched the outward appearances of people to their places in the social order. Network analysis allows us to analyze how characters become gendered through a non-linear, non-hierarchical lattice of social relationships. As the characters interact and social relationships change, the individual’s gendered subjectivity also transforms. We find that cross-dressing protagonists propel themselves from isolated social worlds into a complex web of relationships through cross-dressing, and that entry into sociability follows predictable patterns. By following those patterns, the characters combine roles--the broker and the heroine--that are normally separate in Shakespearean comic plots, creating a hybrid type that becomes visible through network analysis.	000289	000331	000300	000216	000158	000183	000604	000347	000566	000093	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000562/000562.html

Bode challenges the rhetoric around distant reading, arguing it recapitulates the historical oversights of New Criticism. A World of Fiction comprises a book and paired database which apply this framework to the fiction published in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers. Bode's investigation advances new ideas about the gender of Australian fiction authors, the networks of influence among provincial and metropolitan newspapers, and the national character of fiction in the period. A World of Fiction is an important intervention in conversations about computational literary-historical analysis, as well as around the construction and use of digitized historical archives.	000171	000266	000189	000595	000152	000203	000317	000228	000436	000178	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/3/000565/000565.html

Her observation remains vital to the author’s longstanding, feminist critique of essentializing discourses, but it also gives recourse to the ways our computational methods of studying literature and its history sometimes mould […] to their liking their objects. When studying style and gender, digital humanists have tended to use computational methods to trace embedded, hidden linguistic structures, showing how they can contain, conceal, and condition the gendered lives of social groups and cultural milieus. In this essay, we present a stylometric case study — Woolf’s Orlando — that reminds us why, when dealing with gender in modern literature, computational critics must pay particular care when addressing and generalizing from modernism’s experimental styles. We outline the limitations of our own and prior approaches to questions of gender and literary style, and we ask whether flawed stylometric analyses can acquaint us with ways that modernism’s stylistic innovations productively haunt the conclusions of digital literary criticism.	000171	000188	000341	000216	000223	000595	000202	000156	000152	000266	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000566/000566.html

In this approach, the paper proceeds from the assumption that museum representations in the virtual space and/or virtual museums could extend conventional or physical museum space, leading to enhanced visitor attraction and experience. The paper thus focuses on the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation from the perspective of museology and digital humanities and seeks to ascertain whether scholarly and practical impacts are achieved. It also analyses the expected impacts on practical museum work and visitor needs, especially with respect to the tasks museums are required to fulfil in times of crisis.	000413	000608	000453	000352	000458	000241	000457	000459	000269	000355	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/3/000568/000568.html

On the other hand, the rise of digital reading on the web as well as the development of dedicated e-book readers has triggered a variety of hardware and software solutions to provide new reading environments and new material engagements with textual forms. In this paper, we propose a new metaphor, In-Out-In metaphor, to support the reading of literary works in a digital medium. Our model integrates information visualization techniques with plain text reading into the reading flow. This approach differs from the well-known dichotomy between close and distant reading because its emphasis is not on supporting the analysis of the texts being read, but on providing a smooth flow between focus and digression, which naturally occurs during a reading experience. We present a solution to read and explore the Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa, an unfinished book composed of a set of modular texts that have been edited in different sequences and which can be read multi-sequentially. The research and design decisions for the visual reader of the Book of Disquiet are meant to provide an appealing, rich and interactive online reading experience through a web-based application, LdoD Visual. The implemented features apply information visualization techniques with an emphasis on exploring the modular nature of the book. Since this is a fragmentary literary work, its reading can be fragmentary as well, but providing a smooth multiple flow reading experience.	000547	000426	000414	000259	000332	000457	000406	000197	000487	000234	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/3/000569/000569.html

This article sets out to address this relative lack, by introducing the inter- and multi-disciplinary context in which many students in the UK work. We examine the phenomenon of students who are not necessarily interested in becoming DH practitioners, but have identified DH as a knowledge gap in their own disciplinary practice. Such a realisation changes the nature of the learner within DH communities of practice, requiring a different form of learning. This study therefore explores learning within a community of practice, the inter- and multi-disciplinary space in which digital humanities practitioners operate. First, drawing on the diverse disciplinary landscape, it highlights an individual's learning journey through self-determined learning (heutagogy). Second, it outlines an idea of digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research based on current frameworks of digital literacies and broader researcher development in the UK, framing research activity as learning. Third, it presents the DEAR model for learning and teaching design, which is based on four principles: Diversity; Employability; Application; and Reflection. Finally, it provides an evaluation of the DEAR model in the context of one UK Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP). It contributes to understanding of pedagogical practices for doctoral-level DH training and provides a set of recommendations for instructors to adopt and adapt these pedagogical principles in their own programmes.	000302	000311	000305	000233	000315	000465	000114	000421	000274	000597	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/3/000570/000570.html

In theory, automatic detection and recovery of named entities can provide new ways of looking up unedited information in edited sources and can allow the parsing of a massive amount of data in a short time for supporting historical hypotheses. In this paper, we detail the implementation of a model for automatic named entity recognition in medieval Latin sources and we test its robustness on different datasets. Different models were trained on a vast dataset of Burgundian diplomatic charters from the 9th to 14th centuries and validated by using general and century ad hoc models tested on short sets of Parisian, English, Italian and Spanish charters. We present the results of cross-validation in each case and we discuss the implications of these results for the history of medieval place-names and personal names.	000544	000490	000044	000333	000298	000449	000027	000059	000502	000454	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000574/000574.html

On the one hand, they help understand the construction of text. On the other hand, topics that are being considered sensitive at the time of the manuscript gain coherence and contextuality when taking alterations into account, especially in the case of deletions. The analysis of alterations in manuscripts, though, is a traditionally very tedious work. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to help categorize alterations in documents. In particular, we present a new probabilistic model (Alteration Latent Dirichlet Allocation, alterLDA in the following) that categorizes content-related alterations. The method proposed here is developed based on experiments carried out on the digital scholarly edition Berlin Intellectuals, for which alterLDA achieves high performance in the recognition of alterations on labelled data. On unlabelled data, applying alterLDA leads to interesting new insights into the alteration behavior of authors, editors and other manuscript contributors, as well as insights into sensitive topics in the correspondence of Berlin intellectuals around 1800. In addition to the findings based on the digital scholarly edition Berlin Intellectuals, we present a general framework for the analysis of text genesis that can be used in the context of other digital resources representing document variants. To that end, we present in detail the methodological steps that are to be followed in order to achieve such results, giving thereby a prime example of an Machine Learning application the Digital Humanities.	000553	000579	000442	000489	000346	000313	000220	000168	000583	000298	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000576/000576.html

We situate OT text collections within a larger history of digitization of periodicals, underscoring special challenges faced by Arabic script languages. Our paper approaches the question of automated transcription of non-Latin script languages, such as OT, from the broader perspective of debates surrounding OCR use for historical archives. In our study with OT, we have opted for training handwritten text recognition (HTR) models that generate transcriptions in the left-to-right, Latin writing system familiar to contemporary readers of Turkish, and not, as some scholars may expect, in right-to-left Arabic script text. As a one-to-one correspondence between the writing systems of OT and modern Turkish does not exist, we also discuss approaches to transcription and the creation of ground truth and argue that the challenges faced in the training of HTR models also draw into question straightforward notions of transcription, especially where divergent writing systems are involved. Finally, we reflect on potential domain bias of HTR models in other historical languages exhibiting spatio-temporal variance as well as the significance of working between writing systems for language communities that also have experienced language reform and script change.	000268	000593	000412	000288	000581	000027	000247	000491	000627	000168	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000577/000577.html
000578	2021	15.4	Benjamin Lee	The Library of Congress & The University of Washington	Compounded Mediation: A Data Archaeology of the Newspaper Navigator Dataset	The increasing roles of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the construction of cultural heritage and humanities datasets necessitate critical examination of the myriad biases introduced by machines, algorithms, and the humans who build and deploy them. From image classification to optical character recognition, the effects of decisions ostensibly made by machines compound through the digitization pipeline and redouble in each step, mediating our interactions with digitally-rendered artifacts through the search and discovery process. As a result, scholars within the digital humanities community have begun advocating for the proper contextualization of cultural heritage datasets within the socio-technical systems in which they are created and utilized. One such approach to this contextualization is the data archaeology, a form of humanistic excavation of a dataset that Paul Fyfe defines as recover[ing] and reconstitut[ing] media objects within their changing ecologies . Within critical data studies, this excavation of a dataset - including its construction and mediation via machine learning - has proven to be a capacious approach. However, the data archaeology has yet to be adopted as standard practice among cultural heritage practitioners who produce such datasets with machine learning. In this article, I present a data archaeology of the Library of Congress’s Newspaper Navigator dataset, which I created as part of the Library of Congress’s Innovator in Residence program . The dataset consists of visual content extracted from 16 million historic newspaper pages in the Chronicling America database using machine learning techniques. In this case study, I examine the manifold ways in which a Chronicling America newspaper page is transmuted and decontextualized during its journey from a physical artifact to a series of probabilistic photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, cartoons, headlines, and advertisements in the Newspaper Navigator dataset . Accordingly, I draw from fields of scholarship including media archaeology, critical data studies, science and technology studies, and the autoethnography throughout. To excavate the Newspaper Navigator dataset, I consider the digitization journeys of four different pages in Black newspapers included in Chronicling America, all of which reproduce the same photograph of W.E.B. Du Bois in an article announcing the launch of The Crisis, the official magazine of the NAACP. In tracing the newspaper pages’ journeys, I unpack how each step in the Chronicling America and Newspaper Navigator pipelines, such as the imaging process and the construction of training data, not only imprints bias on the resulting Newspaper Navigator dataset but also propagates the bias through the pipeline via the machine learning algorithms employed. Along the way, I investigate the limitations of the Newspaper Navigator dataset and machine learning techniques more generally as they relate to cultural heritage, with a particular focus on marginalization and erasure via algorithmic bias, which implicitly rewrites the archive itself. In presenting this case study, I argue for the value of the data archaeology as a mechanism for contextualizing and critically examining cultural heritage datasets within the communities that create, release, and utilize them. I offer this autoethnographic investigation of the Newspaper Navigator dataset in the hope that it will be considered not only by users of this dataset in particular but also by digital humanities practitioners and end users of cultural heritage datasets writ large.	000497	000560	000524	000462	000299	000509	000380	000321	000163	000275	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000578/000578.html

Historical documents written in cursive are even more challenging as characters have unique and varying shapes. Frequently, words are linked by lines and ornamental doodles. When historical documents are digitized, the images contain various types of noise and degradation, which further complicates the recognition of characters. In this paper, we present an empirical study of how well state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification perform for the task of recognizing handwritten characters in seventeenth-century Spanish American notarial scripts. Professional historians, paleography experts and trained labelers were involved in preparing the labeled dataset of Spanish characters for training the CNNs. The labeled dataset used in this experiment was created from the manuscripts written by one of the multiple scribes that contributed to the collection of approximately 220,000 digitized images of notary records housed at the Archivo General de la Nación Argentina (National Archives). We removed the noise in these images by applying standard image processing techniques. After training different CNNs, we computed the classification accuracy for all the characters. We observed that ResNet-50 achieved a promising accuracy of 97.08% compared to InceptionResnet-V2, Inception-V3, and VGG-16, which achieved 96.66%, 96.33% and 70.91%, respectively.	000412	000451	000288	000577	000537	000268	000560	000027	000168	000574	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/15/4/000581/000581.html

In this work, we investigate two internal aspects of issue types related to the attribute of duration. First, we address whether news stories belonging to different issue types can be identified and represented using a set of quantifiable temporal dimensions (i.e. lifespan, intensity, and burstiness). Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis to investigate whether news stories of different issue types have different narrative patterns, regardless of their specific topic. We use a corpus of 50,385 political news articles in Spanish from 2018 as a case study, and propose a novel system to aggregate the articles into stories. Our results show that stories belonging to different issue types do have distinguishing behaviours, especially along the intensity dimension. At the same time, the qualitative analysis indicates a tendency to associate narrative patterns to issue types. This analysis shows the potential of using news stories as research units to study framing strategies. 	000598	000445	000271	000649	000414	000346	000353	000262	000291	000365	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/15/000582/000582.html

Libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs) often hold physical audio artifacts that are unmarked and lacking important identifiable information such as title, date, location, subject, participants, or context. Annotating is only one of a list of scholarly primitives including discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing . IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is one standardized solution that LAMs have adopted for giving users the ability to perform these primitives with images held in cultural heritage institutions. The AudiAnnotate project builds on the new IIIF standards for AV to address the gaps in engaging with audio by developing a solution to bring together free audio annotation tools and the Web as a standardized collaboration and presentation platform. The AudiAnnotate use case presented here includes a presentation by Tanya Clement titled Zora Neale Hurston's WPA field recordings in Jacksonville, FL (1939) which provides context to three recordings of Hurston created during the Works Project Administration Federal Writers Project from 1937-1942 and made available online at the Library of Congress as part of the Florida Folklife Collections Florida Memory (FM) project. 	000507	000512	000497	000509	000173	000524	000275	000541	000239	000254	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000586/000586.html
000587	2022	16.2	Martin Paul Eve	Birkbeck College, University of London	Lessons from the Library: Extreme Minimalist Scaling at Pirate Ebook Platforms	At 33TB of data in its main collection, the highly illegal Library Genesis project is one of the largest repositories of copyright-violating educational ebooks ever created. Established over a decade ago in 2008, the goal of Library Genesis is nothing short of a modern Library of Alexandria, albeit without anyone’s legal sanction. As one of its administrators wrote: within decades, generations of people everywhere in the world will grow up with access to the best scientific texts of all time. [...] [T]he quality and accessibility of education to the poor will grow dramatically too. Frankly, I see this as the only way to naturally improve mankind: we need to make all the information available to them at any time . Rooted in its homeland’s Russian communist principles and particularly the Soviet isolationist copyright policies of the twentieth century, Library Genesis is a formidable resource and threat to conventional academic publishers. The Library Genesis database had just short of 1.2m records (books) in 2014 . As of January 2020, this capacity has doubled to 2.5m books. In this article, I examine the minimal computational design choices taken by this maximal-in-intent, illicit archive of epistemological dissent and how such decisions have shaped the scalability and growth of the platform. This includes Library Genesis’s numerical subdivision of record identifiers into buckets to work around directory file limitations in the GNU/Linux operating system; its use of md5 hashing of filenames within directories capped at 1,000 files to avoid future hashing collisions while allowing for on-disk integrity checking; and its use of the MySQL socket/network server as opposed to SQLite or similar disk-based database. Beyond these computational details, though, the theoretical tension that this article highlights is the path dependencies that are set in (illegal) computational projects that have goals of absolute abundance and maximalist capacity, and the minimalist design principles that they must instigate at the outset to ensure a degree of scalability. I also query the ways in which the project’s contested mission statements target an economic (geographic) audience demographic with only minimalist access to high-capacity computing resources. I finally examine the limits on scalability of the distribution of the Library Genesis through its torrent archive and other distributed networking technologies such as IPFS, which despite their promise of peer-to-peer redundancy fall down on an archive of this size.	000411	000588	000608	000109	000095	000591	000459	000194	000366	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000587/000587.html
000588	2022	16.2	Nabeel Siddiqui	Susquehanna University	Hidden in Plain-TeX: Investigating Minimal Computing Workflows	Drawing on software studies, data feminism, digital rhetoric studies, information science, and the history of computing, this paper foregrounds Markdown as a cultural object to analyze the social, cultural, and political pressures surrounding the digital humanities. Rather than beginning with contemporary discourse, it draws parallels between Markdown and Donald Knuth's TeX. From the 1970s to 1990s, academic researchers used TeX to construct plain-text scholarship in mathematics and the hard sciences to enhance typography. Most academics saw these concerns as holding marginal importance and quickly abandoned the approach for WYSIWYG word processors. Drawing on queer theorist Michael Warner, I argue that the community surrounding TeX responded reactionarily to these transformations by forming a counterpublic constituted through a circulation of texts bemoaning word processors . This counterpublic persisted well into the 2000s but only made headway amongst niche users. This plain-text focused counterpublic mutated in response to the neoliberalization of higher ed. Rather than viewing plain-text as sustainable scholarship, academic lifehacking and minimal computing embraced what David Golumbia calls computationalism, an ideological construct postulating social, political, economic, and cultural ills as cybernetic systems to be optimized — or hacked. Minimal computing’s fetishization and casting of plain-text as transformative mirrors similar discourses amongst older lifehacking enthusiasts. Although plain-text scholarship is not representative of minimal computing as a totality, minimal computing's emphasis on workflows leads to few of the supposed benefits advocates profess, and in many cases, worsens inequalities.	000591	000634	000590	000587	000600	000503	000087	000369	000215	000329	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000588/000588.html

It focuses on our workflow designed to produce multilingual, annotated digital critical editions of Indian-language poetry, and to model, explicate, and visualize their poetics. In the absence of digital scholarly corpora, resources developed by citizen scholars working outside of academia are essential; for our team and audience, this includes free and open source solutions — including optical character recognition tools — developed in other contexts. Modeling formal, metrical, thematic, and rhythmic structures opens up the possibility for computer-assisted scholarly analysis across the variously related languages and literary histories of India, which are usually treated in isolation.

Doing so pushes us to reconsider the question What do we need? to center not only technological tangibles but also human(e) requirements for effective and ethical engagement. While this piece focuses on Makers by Mail, we hope our experience can bring attention to the ways in which precarity operates and is operationalized by individuals and institutions to reinforce traditional notions of power, limiting opportunities for marginalized peoples and groups. We hope that our experiences offer insight into the lives of precarious digital humanists, and that they continue pushing our field to reconsider when and how we support digital scholars and their projects. There are many ways to push against precarity in digital humanities — providing better contracts, paying higher wages, offering funding opportunities, developing mentorship networks, giving appropriate credit, supporting career growth, and promoting structural change. Any of the above can help shift our work away from precarity and toward praxis — working with and supporting communities. While minimal computing methodologies can help us alleviate some of the structural inequalities within higher education, we cannot achieve maximum justice until we address the problem of precarity within our own communities.	000421	000077	000600	000636	000233	000416	000215	000633	000465	000632	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000590/000590.html

The project began with a Designer Residency Program and was developed to answer three crucial questions: (1) How could we bridge the gap between enthusiastic outsiders and little-known creators of intangible cultural heritage? (2) How could we help students understand and participate in craftwork? and (3) How could we facilitate sustainable knowledge production about intangible cultural heritage among the audiences, students, and craftsmen so everyone benefits and contributes? The ZHI project uses minimal computing strategies to encourage craftspeople to pass their skills and knowledge onto others, particularly younger generations, through digitization and online exhibitions that use minimal computing practices. The project provides user-friendly, accessible information to researchers and craftspeople who do not possess expensive digital equipment or high-level technical skills. This offers them opportunities to virtually present their craft and research, share knowledge, and tell their own stories to audiences unfamiliar with craftsmanship.	000608	000352	000158	000596	000413	000379	000355	000453	000241	000632	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000592/000592.html

It confronts hyperbolic promises of mass digitization and computational methods for the exploration of digitized cultural heritage as a hegemonic episteme rooted in 20th-century, English-speaking, neoliberal capitalism from the margins. OpenArabicPE is a framework for open, collaborative, and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. It addresses the specific affordances of a historical multilingual society, whose material heritage continues to be looted, destroyed, and neglected; whose material heritage resists digitization efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars; and whose contemporary heirs cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North. Centered around generosity and minimal computing, OpenArabicPE is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words, without any funding, by re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.	000591	000247	000457	000071	000546	000608	000459	000411	000460	000353	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000593/000593.html

It addresses the amount of technically-oriented detail-work required to configure the complex set of components that underpin widely-used platforms for static site generation. When going minimal requires a great deal of technical labor, what implications does that have for its adoption by scholars without ongoing technical support, or the money or connections to delegate that work? What is the added emotional labor for technical collaborators who are only allowed to consult with scholars, when they attempt to coach scholars through implementing a minimal computing site on their own? What opportunities are lost when a web development methodology cannot reasonably be taught in a hands-on way in a short workshop? After describing these challenges, this paper proposes that an infrastructural intervention — encompassing everything from writing better documentation, tutorials, and templates, to developing interfaces that mediate between users and technical complexity — is necessary to realize the potential of minimal computing as a framework for sustainable websites.	000584	000585	000600	000459	000591	000352	000596	000588	000608	000453	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000594/000594.html

000596	2022	16.2	Grant Wythoff	Princeton University	Ensuring Minimal Computing Serves Maximal Connection	Originally devised as an insult by Richard Wollheim, the term minimalism described a 1960s movement that foregrounded the relationship between an art object and its museum viewer. Today, minimalism is the guiding ethos for a surprising variety of pop cultural phenomena, from belongings that spark joy to contemplative practice that increases mindfulness. This article first takes a broader view of minimalism to register several problematic echoes of minimal computing among digital detoxers and disaster survivalists in intensities ranging from Luddism to asceticism. Attention needs to be given to these echoes, especially when valorizing DIY infrastructures built out of necessity by Indigenous, poor, or coastal communities and out of privilege by doomsday preppers. Second, this article asks what becomes of minimal computing now that we have seen the vital importance of maximal connection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Do arguments for minimalism still hold in a socially-distant, unevenly-connected world? I argue that it will be important to reframe the digital minimalist conversations of the 2010s for the demands of digital equity in the 2020s. Going forward, we should ask: which of these competing claims to minimalism — as a form of attention, mindfulness, and agency — are compatible with maximal connection, with maximal choice, with maximal investment in communities and infrastructures? And when we hold up minimalism as a virtue, is that virtue a property of particular tools or specific techniques for using them? Finally, this article profiles the ways that academic conversations on minimal computing have independently taken root outside universities through grassroots organizing and activism under the banner of community technology. I close by suggesting ways that minimal computing can be led by community input, while also playing a role in public scholarship and community partnerships that extend existing academic research.	000158	000590	000608	000632	000453	000437	000413	000600	000457	000352	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000596/000596.html

The project team conducted semi-structured interviews between fall 2015 through spring 2016 with twenty-eight researchers who participated in projects funded by the first round of HWW Global Midwest awards. Participants were asked about the aims of their collaborative projects, the processes for developing their collaborations, the types of resources used to support collaboration and project management (and whether additional resources are required), the challenges they encountered, data sharing practices, and how their research approaches and methodologies were influenced by engaging in collaborative research. What emerges from these interviews is a rich portrait of the ongoing evolution of collaborative humanities research and its social and intellectual benefits, both actual and still potential, as well as indications of the institutional and cross-institutional support and development needed to realize that potential.	000351	000480	000302	000322	000477	000163	000620	000464	000416	000077	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/15/000597/000597.html

From the perspective of political communication, New Year’s speeches fulfil a triple function in the intersection of the past, the present and the future. First, they summarise the past year from the perspective of the political leadership and, hence, recall, reconstruct and remind the most important events of the year. Second, New Year’s speeches describe the present and, thus, can be understood and analysed as reality constructions, as windows to the current state of affairs. And third, New Year’s speeches serve as road maps to the future, into the new year. In this sense, a New Year’s speeches summarises the most important future challenges, expectations and opportunities.  This article stems from the assumption that a nonlinear analysis of textual data based on network analysis could provide us with new ontological understanding about structural coherence and holes within a document corpora. It adopts a different viewpoint to discourse analysis based on social network analysis. The paper introduces a nonlinear way to analyse texts as networks in order to visualise and analyse how concepts are connected and to explore structural closeness and holes within a corpus of unstructured textual documents. The results indicate a discursive turn in Germany, Austria and Switzerland after the breakout of the global financial crisis in 2008. But at the same time, the results evidence similarities across the three countries how the crisis and its impact was framed to discourses. In all countries, the use of concepts related to crisis and insecurity has increased dramatically since 2008. However, this vocabulary is not solely limited to the financial crisis. The insecurity and crisis frame referred both to the financial crisis, the armed conflict in Ukraine and to the refugee crisis.	000346	000298	000499	000176	000457	000096	000353	000613	000550	000604	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/1/000598/000598.html

We begin this essay with a case study of one such system, called Vault, in the University of Victoria Libraries, and the work required to migrate from a Software as a Service (SAAS) model (called ContentDM) to a free and open-source software (FOSS) model (a customized instance of Samvera). Vault illustrates what we call minimal computing from the labor perspective, which seeks to reduce the opacity of software through low-tech practices such as pseudocode, thereby reducing the alienation of practitioners from their projects. Drawing from feminist ecological work on capitalism, affective labor, and care, we advocate for the degrowth of digital projects by resisting tendencies to reinvest surplus labor and value into increased productivity. Instead, degrowth as minimal computing prompts practitioners to articulate a project’s needs and desires; what work is required and from whom; and how or whether to sustain this labor for the future.	000590	000215	000591	000421	000594	000470	000596	000588	000425	000174	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000600/000600.html

This article examines the notion of the archive as revealed through a process of infrastructural inversion, with an emphasis on understanding the working information practices of archivists as a prerequisite to any discussion of humanities infrastructure initiatives. Situating the archive as a form of infrastructure and archival labor as a form of maintenance work generates descriptions of archival systems and practices that shine a spotlight on key negotiations and tensions that adhere in a profession that exists in service of others.

The debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more relevant then ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data. The underlying algorithms, although powerful in revealing hidden patterns, do not retain meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. In this article, we question the foreign aspect of this structure that force-directed layout create in historical datasets. We explore the importance of hierarchy in social networks, and investigate whether hierarchies  - strongly present within our models of social structure - affect our perception of social network data. Results from our user evaluation indicate that hierarchical network representations reduce cognitive load and leads to more frequent and deeper insights into historical social networks.

LIFT’s goal is to walk users through the transformation process from TEI to linked data step by step, as well as to promote a better understanding of the theoretical and methodological aspects that underpin the transformation. LIFT was created in the context of the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge as a teaching tool for students encountering linked open data for the first time as a method of organizing and publishing cultural knowledge and, specifically, digital scholarly editions on the web in a perspective of data integration.	000163	000449	000350	000620	000370	000336	000354	000475	000459	000401	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000605/000605.html

Recent work has suggested that an approach using combinations of shallow and deep morpho-syntactic information can be quite successful. But because the data in that study were taken from hand annotated dependency treebanks, the wider applicability of such an approach remains in question. The present paper seeks to answer this question by using machine-generated morphological and syntactic annotations as the basis for a closed-set classification experiment. Texts were parsed according to the Universal Dependency schema using the udpipe package for R. Experiments were carried out on data from several languages covering a range of morphological complexity. To limit confounders, consideration of vocabulary was excluded. Results were quite promising, and, not surprisingly, a more complex morphology correlates with better accuracy (e.g., 100-token texts in Polish: 88% correct; 100-token texts in English: 74%).The method presented here has particular advantages for stylometrics as practiced in literary analysis and other fields in the humanities. The Universal Dependency annotation categories are generally similar to those used in traditional grammars. Thus, the variables which serve to distinguish the style of a given author are relatively easier to interpret and understand than, for example, are character n-grams or function words. This fact, combined with the availability of easy-to-use dependency parsers, opens up the study of a syntax-centered stylometrics to persons with a wide range of expertise. Even students at the early stages of their studies can identify and investigate the morpho-syntactic signature of a particular author. Therefore, the characterization of texts based on computational annotation of this type deserves a place in classification studies because of its combination of good results and good interpretability.	000539	000627	000033	000341	000544	000313	000357	000489	000295	000349	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000606/000606.html

As a structurally distributed organisation, the DARIAH European Research Infrastructure as event host was able to bring its experience of virtual interaction to the recosideration of these challenges, but also the sensitivity to research processes and practices that is central to our positioning in the digital humanities. As such, the resulting model for a virtual event, realised in May 2020 and described in this paper, was built upon a very self-conscious set of considerations, meta-reflection, and goals regarding what we might tacitly and could expect from a virtual event. The instruments designed to deliver this, as well as their performance in practice, is documented alongside consideration of what lessons the experience delivers about both virtual meetings and more generally about the interactions of scholarly communities.	000643	000351	000477	000302	000401	000241	000485	000326	000554	000465	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000607/000607.html

E. B. Du Bois’ 1899 study of the everyday lives of Black residents of Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. It does so by juxtaposing the way Du Bois conducted his research with our contemporary efforts to recover, recreate, and preserve The Philadelphia Negro using digital and geospatial technologies to document historical and contemporary patterns relating to race and class. Beginning with an exploration of primary source documents that provide new details about how Du Bois went about his original research, we focus on the humanities and social science research methods that he employed. Of note is the color-coded parcel-level map Du Bois created to illustrate Black social class status, which reflected both the influence of the Social Survey Movement and Du Bois’ efforts to present a new understanding of the color line. His findings were groundbreaking, considering that most white scientists of his time assumed Black people to be biologically inferior and socially homogeneous. Instead, he documented the variability and social stratification within Philadelphia’s Black population and the systematic exclusion they faced because of anti-Black racism. Our ongoing project — The WARD: Race and Class in Du Bois’ Seventh Ward, which seeks to recreate Du Bois’ study — includes new technologies and participatory research methods that engage high school and college students. In-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted with students also add a new dimension to this work and complement our high school curriculum, which incorporates online mapping, documentaries, a board game, a walking tour, and a mural to engage others to create their own primary sources. This research provides a historical context for today’s racial tensions as we seek new ways to address the 21st century color line.	000640	000642	000644	000513	000633	000645	000148	000641	000635	000632	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000609/000609.html

This collaboration between ten intergenerational scholars and two community organizations produced three digital exhibitions, focusing on post-1945 Toronto-based queer and trans activist history: Not a Place on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project, an oral history project about the queer South Asian diasporic arts and culture festival Desh Pardesh (1988 - 2001); the Foolscap Gay Oral History Project, a 1980s community-based oral history project of Toronto gay life pre Stonewall; and gendertrash from hell, an early 1990s zine published by transsexual artists, sex workers, and activists Mirha-Soleil Ross and Xanthra Phillipa McKay. In analyzing our work within the context of radical pedagogy and critical DH practice, we focus on how we mapped spaces, (dis)inherited metadata, and designed interfaces that would offer tactile, affective engagements with these histories. We analyze our work through the lens of trans(affective)mediation, an approach that understands the conversion of analog to digital objects for online archives in relationship to anti-racist trans studies, affect, and the collaborative potential of community-engaged DH.

Syuzhet is a work in progress with the potential to become an invaluable tool for the sentiment analysis of literary texts. However, there have been doubts about sentiment analysis in the digital humanities field, especially after Swafford’s impactful critique of Syuzhet. Since it is impossible to achieve 100% accuracy in sentiment analysis, we should embrace the imperfection and continue to use Syuzhet while also making efforts to fully understand its limits and abilities. In addition, we should continuously provide feedback for the tool, since the duty of improving digital tools belongs to all digital humanists who employ digital tools. This article explores the limits of and improvements made upon Syuzhet by examining and testing its code and functions with 19th century British novels; the subjectivity of its lexicons; and the validity of Swafford’s critique.	000346	000365	000457	000323	000050	000203	000266	000608	000341	000593	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000612/000612.html

The origin and nature of these factionalized struggles have been discussed for a long time among scholars. In this paper, we discuss the issue based on the literary and political relationships among people in the era of the reform. First, two matrices are respectively constructed of the literary and political relations among these people based on the data collected from CBDB (China Biographical Database). Then a Poission-Gamma factorization model is adopted to obtain the key factors of the matrices, and the Louvain Modularity algorithm is used for community detection. The results show that people engaging in similar literary pursuits were more likely to share political interests and people belonging to the same literary groups were more likely to join in the same political groups, suggesting. Ensuing discussions illustrate that people’s differing academic views indeed played a shaping role in the formation and exacerbation of factionalized struggle, for which the mechanism unfolded herein of “literati politics” was highly responsible.	000608	000365	000346	000460	000241	000450	000353	000598	000453	000271	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000613/000613.html

And they are relied upon by many humanities researchers, and increasingly those looking to analyse collection holdings at scale. However, far from being a neutral record of collection holdings, catalogues are the products of cataloguing labour, often spanning many decades, and so are subject to various biases and inequities. Understanding how collection catalogues are shaped by their histories is then crucial for addressing many of the contemporary challenges faced by cataloguing professionals and for enhancing their use in humanities research, as well as for opening up new directions for historical research. This paper contributes a computationally-based approach for generating new and important knowledge about catalogues, in particular for investigating how a catalogue is shaped by an earlier one. We contend that understanding at scale the transmission of records and style from one catalogue to another requires the use of computational techniques to detect and analyse the various ways in which transmission manifests across a catalogue. Our case study concerns the transmission of Mary Dorothy George’s voice through time, across space, and between mediums, from the 1930s to the late-twentieth century and beyond, from the British Museum in London to the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington, Connecticut, from printed volumes to networked digital data. It aims to show how transmission happens, how it can be found, and how it can be characterised. Detecting and characterising transmission is important because cataloguers like George are the interlocuters between us and the pasts they described, legacy voices that refuse to stay in their historical place, and whose raced, sexed, and classed influence on the future should not go unchecked. Our contributions are relevant both for historical research into catalogues and cataloguing, knowledge organisation and infrastructure, and cultural organisations, and for cataloguing practitioners seeking to rationalise/review their catalogues to improve user experience, address systemic inequalities in object representation, and develop best practice for future work. Furthermore, in broad terms, by contributing to the generation of new knowledge about the biases/inequities of catalogues our work will enable new and better research into the collections that catalogues describe.	000321	000240	000307	000462	000298	000261	000509	000348	000194	000308	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000615/000615.html

This article maps interdisciplinary exchanges between computer scientists, media scholars and information scientists to explicate how interdisciplinary brokering affects knowledge and tool production in the digital humanities. The analysis of qualitative data collected during a 17 month-long digital humanities research pilot - set to collaboratively test a digital Linked Open Data (LOD) search tool - provides insights into the exploratory search behaviour of a total of 122 (digital) humanities scholars, and how these insights informed brokering work within an interdisciplinary research team. The article argues that interdisciplinary collaboration first and foremost requires disciplinary recognition in order to succeed, and demonstrates how practical, empirical research insights - in this case about user research - mobilize interdisciplinary decision-making processes. Conclusions indicate in what ways computational tools and collaboration affect knowledge production, and suggest that understanding the stakes of digital humanities research with digital audio-visual sources requires an integrated perspective characterized by both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical, practical application.

This project subverts the typical data visualization strategy of working with extant data by encouraging users to produce data, demonstrating how data visualization techniques can constitute a way of thinking and creating rather than just analyzing and representing. However, this tool and its affordances are primarily a case study for a sociological approach to critical design in the Digital Humanities: By critically examining the tool itself (as well as the process that created it), I am able to pose the broader questions of (1) how does the creation of digital tools and projects reflect a theoretical interpretation of the social world and its processes, and (2) how can these interpretations constitute the data of sociological studies? In resolving these questions, I suggest that critical design can be viewed as theory, experiment, and data: designs constitute a social theory, data can be experimentally produced within this social theory, and encouraging reflective design can turn the social theories of design themselves into data.	000408	000556	000632	000487	000413	000629	000547	000241	000419	000404	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000621/000621.html

However, producing evidence based insights into victims' behavior is challenging. Perpetrators frequently destroyed camp documentations; victims' perspective remains dispersed in thousands of oral history interviews with survivors. Listening to, watching, or reading these thousands of interviews is not viable, and there is no established computational approach to gather systematic evidence from a large number of interviews. In this study, by applying methods and concepts of molecular physics, we developed a conceptual framework and computational approach to study thousands of human stories and we investigated 6628 interviews by survivors of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. We applied the concept of state space and the Markov State Model to model the ensemble of 6628 testimonies. The Markov State Model along with the Transition Path Theory allowed us to compare the way women and men remember their time in the camp. We found that acts of solidarity and social bonds are the most important topics in their testimonies. However, we found that women are much more likely to address these topics. We provide systematic evidence that not only were women more likely to recall solidarity and social relations in their belated testimonies but they were also more likely to perform acts of solidarity and form social bonds in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors constitute an important digital cultural heritage that documents one of the darkest moments in human history; generally, oral history collections are ubiquitous sources of modern history and significant assets of libraries and archives. We anticipate that our conceptual and computational framework will contribute not only to the understanding of gender behavior but also to the exploration of oral history as a cultural heritage, as well as to the computational study of narratives. This paper presents novel synergies between history, computer science, and physics, and it aims to stimulate further collaborations between these fields.	000365	000355	000048	000334	000130	000022	000109	000346	000036	000457	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000622/000622.html

Using a set of text analysis methods to identify, classify, and visualize semantic triplets, we show how attention to agency complements and extends conventional approaches to indexing. Our examples come from two corpora of Holocaust oral histories: the first were conducted in Displaced Persons camps in 1946 by an interviewer named David Boder; the second were conducted by the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive in the 1990s. We focus on two salient testimonies from each corpus in order to describe the methodology and what the analysis of agency can contribute to the writing of microhistories of the Holocaust. Building on semantic web analyses, the methods provide a groundwork for the development of a graph database to search testimonies by agency and thereby provide historical insights about what people report they did and what was done to them.	000548	000346	000262	000298	000279	000604	000289	000497	000355	000515	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000623/000623.html

The promise was to make diverse sets of data interoperable through subscription to an array of standardizations while leaving the original data intact. These operational requirements enable interoperability at the expense of specificity, and require considerable resources for implementation. While LD supports connection and access across disparate data sets, it is not focused on the intellectual issues that have to do with enabling the correlation and comparison of diverse ontologies, or preserving and exploring their epistemic and cultural specificity — issues essential to humanistic study. In addition, LD is exclusively concerned with linguistic data, and can hence not be applied to information that is expressed in graphical form. Contrastingly, the Heterochronologies project regards temporality as a concept expressed epistemically through various culturally-specific, authoritative ontologies, which are instantiated by graphical representations such as chronologies and timelines. The project concentrates on extracting computationally tractable structured data from historical images so that the underlying ontologies may be compared without subsuming them into a hegemonic data model. In this sense, the Heterochronologies project is an exercise in comparative ontology. In this paper we describe the factors that motivated the project; its various epistemological underpinnings, as well as the methodological approach that guided its development; the phases of our work; and the contributions that emerged from the project. Though currently still in development, its culmination is a digital platform — the Time Capsule — that supports comparative pedagogy, and in so doing demonstrates both validity and relevance of a few fundamental notions: a) structured data can be systematically extracted from graphical structures with a logical approach; b) comparisons of temporal schemes can be supported by a digital platform that considers them as instantiations of ontologies that need not be reconciled to a single standard; c) the historical and cultural specificity of these ontologies can be exposed and analyzed using digital means.	000290	000524	000534	000497	000299	000355	000548	000240	000353	000262	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000624/000624.html

Though De León and Luiselli have participated in human rights work while identifying migrant corpses and collecting detainees’ testimonies, both use counter-mapping to interrogate the dominant humanitarian move of restoring visibility and voice, or sight and sound, to human victims. After investigating the ways in which De León and Luiselli privilege visual and sonic counter-mapping, respectively, I model a more multi-sensory counter-mapping practice. Though this practice remains far from perfect, I argue that such digital counter-mapping crosses sight and sound in ways that defy historical divisions among humans and nonhumans. Accordingly, it decenters humans as the sole victims of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis.	000157	000324	000642	000509	000541	000483	000355	000524	000514	000148	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000626/000626.html

These workflows can benefit from the application of natural language processing (NLP) pipelines that offer support for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization, and dependency parsing. However, the application of these tools is not trivial as off-the-shelf, or pre-trained, tools are prone to error when given historical text as input and training data development can be expensive to carry out in terms of time and expertise needed. This paper introduces a rule-based workflow that can produce improved annotations encoded in Universal Dependencies (UD) targeted for modern historical Japanese corpora using only a pre-trained UD tool as a starting point. The proposed workflow reduces the amount of manual review time needed for training data development and brings improvements over pre-trained tools on a word segmentation task. Moreover, the workflow has the potential to pave the path toward adapting advanced NLP technologies to historical corpora under study.	000606	000544	000333	000490	000655	000577	000268	000313	000563	000489	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/4/000627/000627.html

The sector has naturally evolved into clusters involving actors as diverse as the BBC, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and freelance game designers. It collaborates and competes with multinational powerhouses including Google, Microsoft, and Pixar. The imbrication of academic researchers in the sector makes it a good example of the extension of academia to industry, raising ethical but also methodological and practical questions. This article describes a project that embedded a research software engineer (RSE) from a digital humanities (DH) laboratory into a small technology start-up engaged in high risk R&D of an immersive narrative story-telling platform. The platform is enabled by artificial intelligence and has the capacity to remember user input and modify narrative options and character mood accordingly. The team included a researcher specialising in narrative theory and digital production.

In this paper, we present a framework for ethical and effective visualization of knowledge networks, which we developed while building a knowledge map of climate communication research. Using the climate communication knowledge map as an example, we highlight the practical and ethical challenges encountered in creating such visualizations and show how they can be navigated in ways that produce more trustworthy and more useful products. Our recommendations balance tensions between qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective aspects of knowledge mapping. They demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the development of knowledge maps, illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results in such projects, and emphasize the constructedness of the resulting visualization. We argue that the only way to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires attention to the ways trust and accountability can be produced at every step of analysis and production. This extends the literature on ethical visualization in digital humanities projects by offering a clear example of the utility of a critical approach for a traditional, science-oriented knowledge mapping project.	000408	000534	000621	000091	000419	000487	000402	000547	000285	000030	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000629/000629.html

What will happen if we succeed in empowering and centering individuals, collections, and community concerns that have long been marginalized?

As Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Jessica Marie Johnson have argued elsewhere, Black DH should be simultaneously experimental, analytical, computational, speculative, and have unique design capabilities as a series of practices and speculative exercises. This paper proposes guidelines or principles to assist this and makes clear that the process of scholarly inquiry with Black knowledge-making, and discovery takes precedent over final product. This praxis is possible if we promote collaborative co-creation models of teaching, research, and service for the humanities in an interdisciplinary framework that centers and helps prioritize Black women and queer voices and perspectives in Black DH work.	000645	000642	000644	000636	000632	000209	000315	000404	000302	000640	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000633/000633.html

At the same time elite academic institutions and massive tech firms have been adaptively adept at the capture and depoliticizing of its critics [Whittaker 2021]. Calls for a fundamental reckoning with the logics and violences of computation have been largely disciplined into niche new industries of expertise which Phan, Goldenfein, Mann, and Kuch refer to as economies of virtue. In response, this essay explores Black Computational Thought as a critical intervention into the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought mapped onto and subtending contemporary computational logics. By placing computation within such genealogical bounds, we are free to ask the question, what other proximal places might we look to to recover computational practices that challenge colonial logics of coercion? What other genres lay in wait? Black Computational Thought holds open these proximal possibilities and directs our attention to the quotidian, social, opaque, woven, and fugitive practices of computation born from Black diasporic movement.	000588	000590	000587	000160	000109	000540	000095	000329	000069	000325	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/3/000634/000634.html

The people of Greenville have not been forgotten, however, because of the memory-work undertaken by each generation of Black women whose power and agency connects their past with their future descendants. This article draws on “descendant archival practices” as a method to understand the importance of Greenville’s Black women in the preservation of rural Black community heritage and in the writing of Black women’s histories in the antebellum Midwest. Descendant archival practices connect Black digital humanities practices to the Longtown-Greenville descendant community's digitization of artifacts and oral histories and supports a community-owned version of their active Facebook group.

A front row look at the organization of the annual academic conference for the Digital Humanities	Academic conferences are considered central to the dissemination of research and play a key role in the prestige systems of academia. And yet the organization of these, and the power systems they maintain, have been little discussed. What is a conference supposed to achieve? Who and what is it for? The annual Alliance of Digital Humanities Organization (ADHO)’s Digital Humanities conference is a central occasion in the digital humanities academic calendar, and, as an international, interdisciplinary, regular, long-standing, large-scale event, it provides an ideal locus to consider various aspects of contemporary academic conference organization, and how this impacts the shape and definition of a scholarly field. Examining this annual event allows us to clarify ADHO’s policies and procedures to consider how they frame the digital humanities at large. This paper approaches the annual Digital Humanities conference via a Reflection-in-Action and Reflection-on-Action approach encompassing the experiences of various people formally involved in organizing the conference over the past decade. Considering the last seven years of the conference as well as its broader history, we argue that conferences are central mechanisms for agenda setting and fostering a community of digital humanities practitioners. Through analyses of the selection of Program Committees, the choosing of conference themes, the preparation of calls for papers, the peer review process, and the selection of keynotes, we contend that existing structures and processes inadequately address concerns around representation, diversity, multilingualism, and labor. Our recommendations, including aligning the conference budget with its priorities, fostering fair labor practices, and creating accountability structures will be useful to those organizing future Digital Humanities events, and conference organizers throughout academia interested in making academic conferences more inclusive, welcoming environments that encourage a plurality of voices to fully partake in academic discourse.	000420	000241	000607	000077	000464	000174	000007	000302	000123	000322	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/4/000643/000643.html

Teaching DH from the inside out — to computer scientists rather than humanists — has allowed us to see more clearly neglected areas of DH pedagogy that are in need of greater attention. Our experiences have shown us that if DH is to thrive as a field beyond traditional humanities departments in the U.S. and Europe, we need to better articulate and theorize the connections between humanities and computer scientific epistemologies. When teaching non-humanities students, in particular, we have found it necessary to pay more attention to humanities research methods and projects grounded in humanities research questions. In developing a curriculum that reflects our Singaporean context too, we have found that diversity in global DH should go beyond simply broadening DH’s cultural scope but must involve a more open and global engagement with computational, cultural research that may not identify disciplinarily as DH.	000077	000303	000315	000079	000311	000241	000570	000127	000119	000274	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/4/000647/000647.html

The words that are literally close to it in the texts in which it is written should tell us something about what the word means. In practice, we will look at meaning being measured by a method called Pointwise Mutual Information or PMI for short. However, even granting that we use PMI, this description is still quite vague and allows for multiple different ways to interpret 'the company a word keeps' in the practice of coding an actual algorithm to discern this company. In this paper we will look specifically at the choice to 1. use all words close to another or 2. use merely the ones that are most disproportionately present. Using work from contemporary philosophers of language Mark Wilson and Sally Haslanger, we argue that both capture an aspect of meaning, 2 capturing the most salient way to understand a word, and 1 capturing the subtle, not so salient, but nonetheless important ways in which words are used overall. Then we will look to measure the overall stability in word meaning, the degree to which it is used similarly in different texts within a corpus. Having characterized PMI, salience and stability we will introduce Salience Differentiated Stability or SDS, a value indicating both the salient and less salient stability of a word, which will help identify words that are simpler or more shifty than they at first appear. Lastly we will test the use of this new value by doing a case study of the salience differentiated stability of common terms in early modern physics text books.	000346	000457	000096	000341	000550	000188	000146	000362	000109	000598	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/4/000648/000648.html

The execution occurred in June 1867, but it received global attention only at the beginning of July when the news started to spread over the borders, via telegraph, and rapidly through the network of newspapers. The article concentrates on international news on Maximilian's execution between 5 and 20 July 1867. The aim of the study is both empirical and methodological. It explores the sentiments underlying the news about the execution and the regional differences in these sentiments on an empirical level. On a methodological level, the article investigates the strategies to analyze sentiments via newspaper corpora in a multilingual research setting. The study is based on optically recognized historical newspapers in three languages (German, Spanish and English), and four regions (Austria, Germany, Mexico, and the United States). Our analysis shows content variations in the corpora, mainly that news was framed differently in each studied region, indicating that the local perception of the event and political interests shaped the news. In our corpus, the Mexican press –published in the middle of a political crisis– tended towards a neutral stance, the Austrian and German papers mainly were negative, and the United States showed mixed sentiments on the incident.	000346	000353	000502	000582	000598	000490	000365	000608	000145	000263	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/4/000649/000649.html

A Review of Nantke and Schlupkothen (2020)	The volume Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization, edited by Julia Nantke and Frederik Schlupkothen, assembles research papers that are united in their focus on annotation, but display a broad variety of possible understandings of and approaches to annotation.	000121	000349	000181	000457	000489	000164	000459	000354	000348	000512	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/4/000655/000655.html
000656	2022	16.4	Amanda Furiasse	Nova Southeastern University	The Banality of Big Data: A Review of Discriminating Data	This review critically interrogates Wendy Chun’s book Discriminating Data: Correlation, Neighborhoods, and the New Politics of Recognition (MIT Press, 2021) from the perspective of the digital medical or health humanities. The monograph’s exploration of predictive machine learning and big data’s propensity to encode segregation through their default assumptions about correlation raises important questions about machine learning’s growing uses in fields, such as medicine and pharmacology, where the stakes of such digital experimentation are particularly high. Chun’s exploration of the predictive processes by which data analytics replicates 20th-century eugenics discourses makes an important contribution to the field of digital medical ethics and also offers unique insight into the mechanisms by which digital humanities scholars can disrupt and challenge the use and application of such predictive programs.	000163	000555	000636	000109	000590	000365	000618	000188	000380	000608	digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/4/000656/000656.html
