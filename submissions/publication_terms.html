        <h1>Terms of Publication for DHQ</h1>
        
        <p>The following are the terms of publication for all DHQ material:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The author warrants that the work being published is their original work, and
                that they have secured any necessary permission to publish, quote, or include
                any images or other materials that come from sources outside the article</li>
            <li> The author grants Digital Humanities Quarterly permission to publish and use their name, institutional affiliation, email address, and the biographical details they have sent us, in connection with the publication of the work.</li>
            <li> The author grants Digital Humanities Quarterly a perpetual, non-exclusive right to
                publish the work as part of the DHQ digital journal, in any form that we choose:
                i.e. in its current form or in derived forms resulting from transformations,
                summaries, abstracts, excerpts, and the like. Some of these (for instance, word
                frequency reports and other aggregated data) may not include direct citation of the
                author.</li>
            <li>The author retains copyright over the work and is free to publish it in any other
                venue or format they choose, including pre-publication release and inclusion in an institutional or disciplinary repository.</li>
            <li>All materials are published by DHQ under an open-access model, and all of DHQ's content will always be freely available to all via the DHQ  web site. However, the author gives DHQ the right to permit the work to be aggregated or indexed by third parties, who may place restrictions on access to their sites and may compensate DHQ for access to DHQ content.</li>
            <li>Unless the author chooses a more permissive license, all materials published on the DHQ site are offered under a Creative Commons
                Attribution-No Derivatives license.</li>
            <li>DHQ does not impose any article submission charges, article processing charges, or costs of any kind upon authors.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The use of the Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivatives license means
            that readers are free to copy, distribute and transmit the work, under the following
            conditions: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attribution</strong>. Readers must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author
                or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that the author endorses them or their
                use of the work).</li>
            <li><strong>No Derivative Works</strong>. Readers may not alter, transform, or build upon this work.
                However, terms of fair use apply and DHQ interprets these terms liberally. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> For any reuse or distribution, readers must make clear to others the license terms of
            this work. Any of the above conditions can be waived if the reader gets permission from
            the author as the copyright holder. Nothing in this license impairs or restricts the
            author's moral rights. For more information about the Creative Commons license, please
