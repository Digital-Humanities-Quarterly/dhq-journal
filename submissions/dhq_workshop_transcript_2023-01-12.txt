[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:02:26
Well in the interest of time. I wonder Mara and Anke, what do you think? Shall we?

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:02:30
Shall we get started with the preliminaries and figure?

[Mara Oliva] 08:02:32
Yeah.

[anke] 08:02:32
Sure.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:02:33
People will filter in

[Mara Oliva] 08:02:33
If you we can look after the waiting room. Julia, you can introduce

[anke] 08:02:39
Yeah, go ahead and walk. Oh, invite people.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:02:39
Super. Okay, wonderful. Thank you. So welcome everybody. And thank you so much for coming.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:02:47
This is a big adventure for us. A first ever mentoring workshop for digital humanities quarterly.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:02:53
And we're really excited to to see you all, and looking forward to learning your questions and and helping as much as we can, I'll briefly introduce us just to say who we are, and I'll let Anka and Mara introduce themselves in more detail when they are doing their

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:11
Portion so that you have a sense of like where we're each coming from.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:14
Just a quick note to say that this event is being recorded and also closed, captioned, and will be sharing the recordings and the transcripts.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:23
Over at the at the end, so that people can access it who weren't able to be here.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:28
So our general plan. As so actually yes, introductions. So I'm Julia Flanders.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:33
I'm the editor-in-chief of Digital Humanities Quarterly and I work at Northeastern University, and I have a background in digital humanities.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:42
Broadly speaking, but with specializations in text encoding digital editions, data, modeling things like that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:50
So that's my my sort of frame of reference, and I've been working with the journal since it's inception in 2005.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:03:59
I'm also joined by Mara Oliva, who's at the University of Reading, and is one of our inaugural peer Review editors, and also by Anke Finger, who's at the University of Connecticut, who is our other

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:04:12
Inaugural Peer Review editor and their presence here, I think, is is really one of the one of the signals of the revitalization of the journal that we've been.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:04:23
We've been doing over the past year or so, and are going to be continuing in the coming years.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:04:28
Where we're adding a lot more editorial roles that are specifically aimed at supporting authors and cultivating the Journal's readership and making the journal a more vital and responsive kind of institution and publication.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:04:45
So I'm so excited to be working with this. Our general plan for today.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:04:51
What we're gonna cover is try to give a general orientation in Dhq's practices, aiming particularly at people who are new to the field.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:05:00
So if you have been in digital humanities, I know we have some some folks in the group who have been working in digital humanities for a long time.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:05:08
So you may have this may all be old hat to you, but we're delighted to see you, nonetheless.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:05:12
But we're going to try to cover things that people were asking in the sign-up sheet, coming from a more of a perspective of people new to the field people new to digital humanities and new to Dd.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:05:25
What we're also going to cover, but probably not in the next hour is we're going to answer all of your questions there was a tremendous variety of questions, and we know we'll be able to cover many of them in this session.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:05:39
But anything that we don't cover today we will.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:05:42
We will follow up with an email, with a full, full reply to everything that we see in the chat, plus questions that we're asked in the in the sign-up sheet.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:05:52
And what we're not going to cover at all is we're not going to start talking about like digital humanities, methods, other digital humanities, publications.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:06:02
We, we don't have time or scope to really say this is an introduction to digital humanities.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:06:07
There are lots of places where you can get that, one of them being just read the journal, we we welcome your readership, and there are plenty of other journals as well that are doing a great job.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:06:18
In various sectors of the field. So that there are lots of places, and we can recommend in the chat places where you could go to get more oriented and to to learn more about sort of getting your feet wet in digital humanities.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:06:32
I'm gonna start with a general orientation on Dhq's mission and policies, and then Anke will provide some more detail on the kinds of materials and genres.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:06:43
The Dhq. Publishes, and then Mara will talk about the kinds of editing and revision that will help to turn a draft into a successful Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:06:53
Submission, and we invite you to put all questions into the chat.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:06:58
We'll answer any simple questions, you know. Right there, here and now, anything that we can.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:07:04
And then, during the question and answer period, which we hope will be sort of the second half of the session, we'll do our best to answer some of the bigger and more complex questions and again, we'll come back via email with anything that we can't cover today and because of the big

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:07:18
Group, we won't be able to answer questions, probably about specific submissions.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:07:23
I know some people that indicated that they had a particular idea that they wanted to workshop, which is great we're very excited to help with that, but we can field those queries via email after the event.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:07:33
So we'll we'll be looking forward to hearing from you with paper ideas or questions about specifics, submissions.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:07:39
And we're extending the January submission deadline for participants in these workshops to give you just a little more lead time in case you've been holding on to a a paper that's just almost ready to go. But you really want to find

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:07:53
So with that preliminary stuff, said, Let me send a few words about Dhq's mission and scope and priorities.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:08:04
As you probably do already know, Dhq. Is the major open access journal of the Association of Computers and the Humanities, and also of the alliance of digital humanities organizations so Ach and AD ho!

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:08:18
Which are 2 of the 2 of the digital humanities, professional organizations, and they they co-publish the journal and as a public facing journal, the Hq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:08:29
Addresses, deliberately a very wide audience, not only in digital humanities, but also in adjacent fields, with widely varying degrees of digital expertise.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:08:41
So Dhq. Seeks to be the kind of open public face of digital humanities to a very, very wide readership, and the journal seeks to create a meeting place in which authors from different subfields and regions of digital humanities can encounter each other's work so our goal is

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:09:01
To encourage people to transfer and learn from ideas that are nearby, not necessarily directly in their subject area, rather than becoming more and more narrowly specialized in their knowledge.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:09:15
And this was important early on, because, you know, the various areas of digital humanities represent people trying out many different things which turn out to be relevant in places that are unexpected and in ways that are unexpected but it's especially important now that the field has gotten very large.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:09:35
And is really at risk for over specialization right? The folks who work on networks or the folks who work on markup, or the folks who work on digital editions are at risk for becoming separated from one another, and so Dhq really wants to encourage that sense of everything we do can be useful to all of

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:09:55
Us, so our editorial policies focus very strongly on mutual legibility and on teaching each other.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:10:06
And we ask all authors to explain, and contextualize their work in a way that is accessible to a motivated non specialist.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:10:15
So we're not asking anybody to, you know, to to simplify or dumb down their arguments, but rather to explain how those arguments work, and also to provide enough context that people can make sense can see why something is important and interesting.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:10:34
And finally, because digital methods are now so widely and routinely, honestly used across the humanities, digital humanities, quarterly really doesn't.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:10:45
Prioritize articles that are describing this kind of routine.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:10:49
Use. So you know, I did text analysis on this novel, because you know, there are journals.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:10:58
Now you know ordinary regular honest to gosh! Humanities, journals that will that will welcome that material.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:11:05
Now instead, we focus on articles that are offering a new or critical perspective on digital tools and methods that propose innovative approaches, or that create bridges between different areas, or that report on how the use of particular digital methods or tools in a particular locale or in a particular context, may affect how we

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:11:35
Understand that tool or that method. So we're trying to prioritize articles that will really help increase our understanding of digital humanities or move the field forward

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:11:49
And I'll put some links into the chat when I'm done speaking.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:11:52
That will maybe be helpful for it. Points of reference to things like our submissions, page and stuff like that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:11:58
So with that, said, I'll I'll talk a little bit about our peer review process.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:12:04
Our peer review process is essentially the same as the of many traditional journals.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:12:10
All articles are first reviewed internally to determine their suitability for the journal so do they meet the criteria that I that I mentioned above, and articles that are declined at this stage, would receive a detailed and constructive feedback letter from the editorial and this internal

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:12:26
Review is important in ensuring that we make the best use of our external peer reviewers.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:12:31
Capacity, which is very limited. So we want to make sure that we're sending on to them articles that have that that meet the journals, fundamental criteria in our external peer review process.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:12:43
We typically try to get 2, or, if possible, 3 peer reviews.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:12:49
The process is blind, so they authors are not aware of the identity of the reviewers, but it's not double blind unless the author chooses to anonymize their work, and authors are welcome to do that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:00
But we do not do that anonymization ourselves. We treat the Peer review as advisory rather than as serving a kind of gatekeeping role.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:08
So the editorial team takes the period reviews into account when deciding whether to accept or decline a submission, and it draws on.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:16
The peer reviews in providing feedback to the author about how to improve the article, and the most common outcome is some form of Please revise, and all submissions receive a detailed and constructive feedback letter from the editorial team as well as comments from the peer

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:31
Reviewers to help guide the revision, regardless of whether the article ends up being suitable for Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:37
Or not, and the most common revisions need are contextualize your arguments.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:44
You know, site prior work explained. It's relevant relevance.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:47
Explain your terms. Don't write for other specialists. Make a clear and interesting argument.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:52
Don't just was what you did. But say, why, it's important.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:13:56
Explain how others could build on your work or use your work.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:00
And Anke and Mara will have more to say on this subject in a moment.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:04
So I'll just make a few couple more points as I as I wrap myself up here first of all, Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:10
Is fully open access, so all articles are published under a Creative Commons license, and no fees are charged to authors or readers at any time.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:20
Authors, retain all rights to copyright, so Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:23
Does not own the article. The author owns the article Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:28
Uses the text encoding initiative guidelines as the underlying data format.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:31
And our website is published using open source Xml tools.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:36
And it's maintained in. We are working on building, mentoring more strongly into our submission and review process so if you're interested in joining our mentoring team, please email us.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:14:47
And if you are interested in receiving mentoring also, please email us and we'll have more information on our mentoring page fairly soon, and I'll drop a link in the chat in just a moment, and we're working on expanding our handling of languages other than English.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:15:02
So we can already publish translations in any language alongside an English language.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:15:09
Submission. But we're limited in our ability to review in languages other than English.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:15:14
So if you're interested in joining our peer review team and can review in other languages, please email us.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:15:20
So with that I'm going to pass it on to Anke.

[anke] 08:15:25
Thank you so much, Julia, and welcome everybody again to this.

[anke] 08:15:30
To this first mentoring workshop. Good afternoon. Good morning.

[anke] 08:15:35
Wherever you are. My name is Anke Finger.

[anke] 08:15:38
I'm at the University of Connecticut, and I am working in the areas of digital humanities and digital dissertations.

[anke] 08:15:47
I co-edited a book with Virginia Coon on shaping the digital dissertation.

[anke] 08:15:53
I'm very interested in assessing and evaluating digital scholarship and advising, dissitating and graded students and colleagues about how to enter the field, and I primarily practice in the areas of media aesthetic and visualization when it comes to

[anke] 08:16:12
Translating between medialities, that's something I'm very interested in, and I'm excited to be offering some pointers and expanding on what Julia has already talked about primarily about what are the key genres in Dhq and what qualities do we seek to

[anke] 08:16:33
publish, and as Julie already emphasized, we really are looking for articles and products that have a mutual legibility and that is teaching each other.

[anke] 08:16:47
So while legibility really is very important in keeping with the journal's mission, such that we learn from each other that we introduce each other to new territories, of thinking of epistemologies and the age and of practice, and I think the wider the journal is growing demographically and and

[anke] 08:17:09
Internationally, the more it becomes interesting to see where people in different locals are coming from, and that means that the wide legibility really has to apply linguistically such that the experts can quickly explain what their expert in.

[anke] 08:17:29
So that we understand their particular fields Toulia has talked about how dh is not just diversifying, but it's also deepening in its various expert fields.

[anke] 08:17:40
So if somebody's not an expert in network analysis those readers who are not familiar with it would benefit from a short explanation of how this author, or how this author team is approaching this particular field with the methodologies and approaches that they are subscribing to and legibility also in regard to what kind

[anke] 08:18:02
Of stylistics and language you're using. And I speak specifically as a non-native speaker of English who also had to learn how to familiarize herself with particular stylistic practices and approaches in journal writing in the English wider English speaking world in professionalizing myself communicating my

[anke] 08:18:27
Research. So this is something that we're also very happy to help with, because Englishes are different all over the world.

[anke] 08:18:35
And of course, non-native speakers have a particular hurdle to to to manage in order to find out.

[anke] 08:18:43
Okay, how do I bring my research across in a particular English language professionalization.

[anke] 08:18:51
So why, let'sibility has several layers that we're happy to work with.

[anke] 08:18:57
Then the other aspect that's important is to make an argument that is relevant to Dhq.

[anke] 08:19:04
Readers, and of course you can justifiably ask who are Dhq.

[anke] 08:19:09
Readers. We'll talk about that if you have specific questions that Dhq.

[anke] 08:19:14
Readers are at this point, of course, as the Dhq.

[anke] 08:19:18
Is widely established and internationally recognized a readership that's all over the world.

[anke] 08:19:23
So keep in mind that you are speaking to non experts in a particular special field.

[anke] 08:19:30
So that you are also working to explicit not just what you argument is to make a strong argument, but also, where is it coming from?

[anke] 08:19:42
Contextualize. Look at, perhaps, what articles have been already published in Dhq.

[anke] 08:19:51
In that particular arena. So maybe you want to connect to that or connect to a network of practitioners that is active in your field around the world.

[anke] 08:20:03
So the argument relevant to Dhq. Readers is as Julia has already explained, one of positioning the innovativeness of your work.

[anke] 08:20:14
Positioning the bridge, building, perhaps, and specifying how creative, how specific this argument is to pushing the field further, to pushing your work further, to connecting with people who are interested in learning more about what it is you you are presenting, then the we're also interested in engaging with Dh research pedagogy

[anke] 08:20:42
Theorization and critical practice. So wherever it is, your article is, is is positioning its argument.

[anke] 08:20:53
Make sure that within the fields of research, pedagogy, theorization, critical practice, you anchor yourself as one of the participants in this particular dialogue.

[anke] 08:21:06
Are you pushing? Dh theory further in a particular locale?

[anke] 08:21:12
In a particular tradition of theorization. Are you pushing pedagogy further?

[anke] 08:21:16
And know everybody is now talking about chat, gpt, and the all kinds of articles coming out.

[anke] 08:21:23
Is there a new approach to that from a Dh program?

[anke] 08:21:27
For example, and when it comes to writing style, we accommodate a range of stylistic approaches, and the one you choose should be appropriate to the type of argument, and this is something we can talk about a little bit further, because the type of argument of course is very specific to your particular approach, of your

[anke] 08:21:49
Particular project, and writing styles again very greatly, not just within Englishes, but also in other languages, and in other professional writing traditions.

[anke] 08:22:01
When it comes to specific genres. We are looking probably for 4 particular genres.

[anke] 08:22:10
One is the 3, traditional article, more or less traditional.

[anke] 08:22:12
We can talk about what that means to terms of length in terms of structuring.

[anke] 08:22:17
Then a case study, which is an emphasis on criticality and analysis and comparison.

[anke] 08:22:25
So a purely descriptive case. Study may not work for Dhq.

[anke] 08:22:31
Because again, we're looking for a critical approach, a particular argument, positioning, pushing the boundaries in terms of bringing us into more innovative into bridge, building territory and and analysis and or comparison really work best in that particular genre.

[anke] 08:22:52
We're also looking for field reports by which we mean from or of a particular locale.

[anke] 08:22:59
Circumstances are cultural practices, and I really want to emphasize the cultural practice because, speaking from particular international locals, speaking from a particular cultural position where certain dh practices, methods, tools, have particular valences work with particular medialities.

[anke] 08:23:25
This is all very culturally imprinted and and valued and validated, and some of that may be intrinsic.

[anke] 08:23:34
Some of it may be habituated, but for those who are not from that particular cultural locale.

[anke] 08:23:40
With these particular balances and contacts. We don't know about that.

[anke] 08:23:45
So the more you can explain that the more you can speak from that particular position that is culturally infused, the field report will help us to understand how Dh is done in a particular language context in the particular cultural context in a particular from a particular speaking from a particular identity. Position.

[anke] 08:24:08
So the field report becomes very important to help us see international perspectives and and really merge that in a in a diversifying kind of to diversify the readership, but also to diversify the author positions, and then finally, there also is the review the review of a book, or tool and this is

[anke] 08:24:36
Different from some of you may know, may know Roppy Garcians project on Dh.

[anke] 08:24:46
Reviews. This is different from project Review. So we're looking for reviews on books that have appeared online OA, or in print.

[anke] 08:24:56
And on tools that maybe new or or revised, I will close with a particular point on multimodality, and encourage you to think about the how particular modalities and tech options may feature into your project and into your article or case, study or field report so we routinely support

[anke] 08:25:24
Audio, video embedding. So, for instance, of maps and visualizations that are hosted elsewhere, we also have worked with authors and more specialized kinds of motivate multimodality, for instance, embedding specialized code provided by the author so these are all tech opportunities and

[anke] 08:25:43
Possibilities. We're always happy to consider interesting possibilities, but we are limited by our own available technical efforts.

[anke] 08:25:52
So talk to us. If you have a particular tech projected immediately in our in the journal.

[anke] 08:26:07
Given the tech possibilities. So we can work on. Perhaps integrating it, embedding it, hosting it elsewhere, so that the article is fully represented in all its medialities that contribute to the argument, and we place a high value on sustainability on and longevity so all experimental

[anke] 08:26:26
Formats, need to have adorable fall back option.

[anke] 08:26:31
So work with us, so that you know, when people from you know, 5 years from now you publish an article next year and 5 years from now, you want to make sure that the interconnectedness of the various tools and and platforms that contribute to your argument in that article or field report really still works so people get

[anke] 08:26:52
the full benefit of your work. With that I will hand things over to Mara, and please send you a questions in the chat. Thank you.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:02
Thank you so much. Anke. Good morning. Good afternoon.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:08
Good evening. It's so uplifting to see so many people from all over the world which really reflects what we're trying to do here at each queue, to to make these a global semi.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:20
My name is Matt Oiva, and as Julie, sitting in introduction, I'm based in the Uk.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:24
At the University, of Writing. I'm a historian of my training.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:27
I work on us foreign policy, and I got into the H.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:32
Via using the H methodology in in my research and then re plane into a digital humanist.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:40
Somebody got it interested in Gis social network analysis.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:46
A 3 dealing construction. Some and other forms of visualization.

[Mara Oliva] 08:27:52
Now in my last, I mean, if you mean it's in last session of these introductory apart, and what I would like to do is to pick on some points that Julia and and Anke, I've raised in their section and just develop some of these before that I'm

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:11
Gonna, focus on on how to successfully turn a draft in a into a submission, a good submission.

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:22
Looking at at publication. Now, I'm sure we all have work in progress.

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:26
If I look at my desk, right now, I can see what I call my pile of potentially one day.

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:34
Eventually will turn into into a finish product well, don't lose faith.

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:41
It will happen, and and sometimes it takes less than the than what we think.

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:47
So this is what we're gonna look at. In the last few minutes of the introduction.

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:50
So let's say for example, that you have a rough draft, probably potential a manuscript to a journal manuscript article manuscript.

[Mara Oliva] 08:28:59
Looking at the article as he was mentioned. Both Julia and Anke, in the revising your your manuscript, looking at submission, one of the key things we're looking at is in engagement with the existing literature.

[Mara Oliva] 08:29:16
First of all. So we do invite you to to think about your research questions and the and how these engage with existing research here as a wedding debates in the different fields.

[Mara Oliva] 08:29:32
So please do identify others, scholars, other practitioners work and do engage in a discussion in in your manuscript with these areas and will do bring them in your discussion, contextualize your work in relation to preview work that I might have been done or work that speaks to what you're

[Mara Oliva] 08:29:57
Trying to do also, as it was mentioned. We are, and I am quoting Julia here.

[Mara Oliva] 08:30:02
Really like this definition, the multitude. No experts. We do talk to a motivating, no experts.

[Mara Oliva] 08:30:10
So do make sure the while you engage with the practitioners and experts in your field.

[Mara Oliva] 08:30:16
You also make these accessible to to the broader digital humanities audience.

[Mara Oliva] 08:30:22
And as Anke as said, making a very mind-wide legibility, so that people who are interested but are still not experts in this field can develop a new knowledge, and interests are not actually put off by not being able to to access your the argument.

[Mara Oliva] 08:30:45
You're pulling forward. We mentioned on on summer location team importance of the argument.

[Mara Oliva] 08:30:51
What contribution are you making to these fields? What is the original contribution that you're making to the existing literature?

[Mara Oliva] 08:30:59
How are you pushing at the bound? That is what new knowledge, new understanding, or new Zealand questions and issues are you raising that can help the whole community make progress in our understanding and development?

[Mara Oliva] 08:31:12
Of the digital humanity. So so these are really the key issues.

[Mara Oliva] 08:31:18
We're looking in in in a rough draft to turning into a successful manuscript.

[Mara Oliva] 08:31:26
Similar advice is for for those of us who have maybe a dissertation chapter, I want to turn the desertation chapter into an article.

[Mara Oliva] 08:31:37
Now at the citation chapter needs to stand alone. So you need to to make sure that you bring it together in your manuscript.

[Mara Oliva] 08:31:47
Those threads that you can find, you know, spread throughout your diseases.

[Mara Oliva] 08:31:53
So, for example, usually the discussion of the existing literature is in a dissertation, is is placed in the introduction, or in the first chapter of of a fees.

[Mara Oliva] 08:32:07
These needs to be extracted from there, and being included in a meaningful discussion of your manuscript, together with the content of the chapter, the chapter needs to be engaged with the field, and we'd have with the areas that you're making a contribution to and again, it needs to

[Mara Oliva] 08:32:31
Put forward an original argument. Very similarly, a confidence paper.

[Mara Oliva] 08:32:38
Now we all go to conferences, and these are great venues where we get valuable feedback, and and we have good and interesting discussions to develop our ideas.

[Mara Oliva] 08:32:51
But while we're happy to discuss potentials ideas, we wouldn't welcome a confidence paper straight from the conference right into the submission box.

[Mara Oliva] 08:33:03
You will need to do a bit more of work on your confidence.

[Mara Oliva] 08:33:07
The paper for sure include all the feedback that you have receive in during the conference.

[Mara Oliva] 08:33:13
So you are discussions, and so on. But again, you're looking and and presenting a more comprehensive type of paper, and expand on on issues.

[Mara Oliva] 08:33:25
Usually you don't have time during 20 min.

[Mara Oliva] 08:33:29
Say conference paper. So again, in engage with existing literature, do make sure that you place your eyes.

[Mara Oliva] 08:33:36
Argument within the different fields that you're touching on, and to make sure you tell us what is it that you are changing understanding of one or what you knowledge you are creating in specific fields, and how you relate specific fields?

[Mara Oliva] 08:33:55
No, we have received a in the past submissions of a grand proposal of final reports of grand coming from grand proposals and and project.

[Mara Oliva] 08:34:08
Reports. So I think we all

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:34:19
Hmm! Or might be frozen

[anke] 08:34:31
Let's see.

[anke] 08:34:37
I think we have couple more points to make about conference papers, case studies.

[anke] 08:34:44
But we can also, as Mara and freezes, perhaps, take initial questions already in the chat, so that we can start the Q.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:34:54
Yes, I think that's a good idea.

[anke] 08:34:54
A.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:35:00
Oh, yeah, tomorrow. Definitively frozen. Yeah, exactly.

[anke] 08:35:01
Yes, restart the computer please feel free to put your questions in the chat, because we can certainly transition into the Q.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:35:11
Yeah, and I think while we're letting the the questions come into the chat, we could start by addressing some of the high priority questions that were completely in the in the sign up form, I think one that was particularly interesting Mara, that you and I had flagged was the advice we

[anke] 08:35:11
A.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:35:31
Can offer on making arguments that are both, that balance the technical with the humanistic and that was something that you touched on in your comments.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:35:41
But I wonder if there's sort of more more rhetorical advice we can offer about that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:35:47
I know I have some thoughts, but I'd be really interested in hearing what you have to say

[Mara Oliva] 08:35:51
Sorry I'm back. I don't know what I don't know what I but I don't know how much you missed.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:35:52
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

[Mara Oliva] 08:35:59
Wish it was bound to happen

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:36:01
You were talking about conference papers. I think

[anke] 08:36:03
Yeah, you are at conference papers.

[Mara Oliva] 08:36:05
Okay. Shall I go on

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:36:08
Sure, yeah, and we and we had started in in case you weren't coming back.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:36:11
We had started segue to the question and answer period.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:36:14
So we can go ahead and we

[Mara Oliva] 08:36:15
Blessed! Well, I always come back. So the first time but it happened so, since the pandemic could get on to happen.

[Mara Oliva] 08:36:25
I'm really sorry everybody, that it happened. We have awful weather in the Uk.

[Mara Oliva] 08:36:28
And I think that's where my connection was so sorry.

[Mara Oliva] 08:36:32
I don't want to take too much time, so I was trying of a grand proposal

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:36:37
Oh no!

[anke] 08:36:38
Oh no!

[anke] 08:36:43
Alright. We do have a question in the chat from guessing.

[anke] 08:36:49
I hope I pronounce that name correctly. So on the submission page you mentioned issues in dh submissions.

[anke] 08:36:56
This wasn't mentioned by Anke. Please, could you tell us about these?

[anke] 08:37:02
Yes, issues in the age really is a very broad concept.

[anke] 08:37:06
And I'm sorry I didn't mention that, because it can really apply very widely to any meta or direct issues to what's going on in D age.

[anke] 08:37:20
And Julia, please and come in to sort of see what that means for the context of Dhq.

[anke] 08:37:24
But any any sort of new issues like I just mentioned Chat, Gp.

[anke] 08:37:29
T that might be an issue for the age when it comes to pedagogy, it might be an issue for the age when it comes to visualization.

[anke] 08:37:36
I have a project right now where I'm looking at.

[anke] 08:37:39
Gp, chat Gpt for experimentation with visualizations of of a particular text.

[anke] 08:37:46
But this is a very wide, you know. Issues obviously is not, is not, is not a genre, but it could be.

[anke] 08:37:53
It could be anything that also has a meta application to the whole field. Julia, what is your interpretation?

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:37:58
Well, I I was gonna just add, I think your your your interpretation of what we what we mean by it is exactly right.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:07
But we are transitioning that, or deprecating that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:11
Section of the journal. In others. We're we're not going to be continuing.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:15
We're did. We're discontinuing that's the word I'm looking.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:18
We're discontinuing that sector. That section of the journal in favor of a different and more dialogic way of handling those kinds of opinion pieces and sort of issue-based discussions.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:33
So I haven't. This is a recent decision. So I haven't updated the the submissions page yet to remove issues in.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:42
Dh, but it's a section that we are going to be.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:47
Rethinking, I guess, is the way of putting it so that we have more of a a conversation based space for discussing kind of very timely issues like Chat Gpt, for example.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:38:59
So, yeah, watch the space

[anke] 08:39:05
Other questions, and feel free to just open your mic and engage in the conversation

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:39:13
Now we're a smaller group than we'd expected, so we can.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:39:16
We can take oral questions as well

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:39:27
So Gilad is asking a question which we saw repeated several times in the in the the sign up the sign, up sheet.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:39:39
The information people gave, and I I think it's a really interesting one.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:39:42
I might start with just a few thoughts, but I'd really love to hear from Anke and Mara as well concerning technical explanations of the development of new digital humanities, tools, and also the role of sort of technical explanation in dh in general in dhq in general I

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:40:00
Think what Dhq. Is always trying to achieve is sense of the relevance.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:40:08
And the critical framing for any technical discussion. In other words, there there are no technical topics that are solely important because they are technical.

[Mara Oliva] 08:40:09
No.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:40:19
It's rather that we want people to be framing an argument, or, you know, exploring a method in a way that is technically lucid, technically responsible, that that that explains how the digital methods and tools that we use have an impact on the critical questions the interpretive questions the

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:40:41
Humanities, outcomes. There's that that bllending of of the technical and the scholarly that is really important.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:40:50
So it'll vary a lot from from submission to submission.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:40:54
How much of the technology is relevant. So if you're if you're describing, if you're making a an argument about, you know the importance of server configurations or something like that, you might need to go into quite a lot of technical detail to make to make that point, if

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:41:12
you're talking in broad terms about mapping tools, and how the geospatial, imaginary functions in literary criticism.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:41:21
It might not be necessary to talk about exactly how each mapping tool handles its, you know, shape, files, because that might be relevant that might not be relevant to your to your argument.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:41:32
So I think it's it's somewhat situational Anke and, Mara, what?

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:41:36
What's your perspective?

[anke] 08:41:38
Mara! Go ahead!

[Mara Oliva] 08:41:39
Yes. So while I'm here, let's most of again. I'm just gonna give one final apology.

[Mara Oliva] 08:41:47
I'm really sorry. Yeah, I mean, I completely get with Julia, said I.

[Mara Oliva] 08:41:53
You know, from my point of view, when I you know as audience myself, when I look at a review of a new, The age tool what I'm looking for is also, how is these 2?

[Mara Oliva] 08:42:06
Allowing me to do something different that I wasn't able to do before, or with the other tools or methods. How is this tool?

[Mara Oliva] 08:42:16
Allowing me to ask a different research questions, maybe more complex, more ambitious research questions.

[Mara Oliva] 08:42:25
So can. The first team says this is really what I'm looking for before I get so much into the technical, into into learning how i. E.

[Mara Oliva] 08:42:33
It works, and then, as Julia said, absolutely depending on from what angle you come from, you will need more or less technical details.

[Mara Oliva] 08:42:45
But again, the first thing I will be looking for is, how is this?

[Mara Oliva] 08:42:47
Allowing me to do my research in a new innovative way, and ask a new research question.

[anke] 08:42:56
Yeah, I wanna I wanna I wanna emphasize that as well.

[anke] 08:42:59
One of my favorite articles in Dhq. Is Joanna Druckers and Patrick Fenson's article on Middleware, and I think it's a wonderful example and display of looking at the technicalities of platforms, but also asking deep epistemological questions about how does

[Mara Oliva] 08:43:05
Hmm.

[anke] 08:43:22
It make us think? What does it make us do? How is our thinking in our analysis, framed by the tools themselves?

[anke] 08:43:30
For example. So this is, this is a wonderful example to 2 to think about, not just the tool itself, but also what it does for us with us, and despite us in a way.

[anke] 08:43:46
And how we then develop our thinking and and project development from that

[Mara Oliva] 08:43:58
Yeah, and I agree with you, due to the point. Julius put a few points on on the chat.

[Mara Oliva] 08:44:04
How they development process was undertaken. I think that's very important in in understanding how the tool you know how it was born, and now it was developed in in and how we got here absolutely

[anke] 08:44:22
We have a question from Isabella strata for case studies.

[anke] 08:44:27
How might the editorial Board evaluate the creativity of the course design visa?

[anke] 08:44:32
The article's contribution to the field

[Mara Oliva] 08:44:34
Yeah. And that's something that I wanted to say before that we welcome very much a case of studies.

[Mara Oliva] 08:44:45
We we welcome discussion of any pedagogy aspects of of the D age what we're not looking for is a list of activities is a narrative, a play, not a team of you know.

[Mara Oliva] 08:45:00
I've done a the class, responded B. And then this is what we came up.

[Mara Oliva] 08:45:06
See, we're not looking for a plane description of A, of of how events evolve throughout the classic activity. We're looking for a critical analysis of what happened

[Mara Oliva] 08:45:27
Activity contributed to the understanding and and knowledge and and development of the age.

[Mara Oliva] 08:45:35
So a case study should provide also a critical context of objectivity, teaching activity that you've done should have some more.

[Mara Oliva] 08:45:43
Some points of comparison as well. So, for example, other pedagogical case studies again engage with the literature that already exists, and while other people have share in about their good practice, and and and offer a critical announcement of what happened in class from a biological point of view, not

[Mara Oliva] 08:46:08
just a narrative of events, so creativity is absolutely welcome

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:46:18
I think that creativity of the case of the of the course design, or the the pedagogical experiment, would contribute strongly to the potential value of the case.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:46:31
Study. Yeah, there is. It, would it would be the thing that entices readers.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:46:37
But the quality of the article as an article would be as as Mar says, more dependent on the handling.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:46:46
So even a really poorly designed course could make an excellent case study if if handled in a spirit of self criticism and and contextualization.

[anke] 08:46:57
I'm adding in the Chat a another journal on critical pedagogy that might also give pointers as to how to write about critical pedagogy in the Dh arena

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:47:08
Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, I will say one of the things that Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:47:14
Has struggled with is the genre of the pedagogical case.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:47:17
Study because we do get submissions which are reporting on, you know, a single course, and you know they they the course was taught once and that in itself is not a not a problem. You know.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:47:32
You could. You could do a great case study of a course that was taught once to a small number of students, but I find that there often is a tendency to draw very broad conclusions about you know I I made this change.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:47:46
You know, I I I designed the course in this way, and it went well.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:47:51
Therefore this thing that I am designed that this feature, that I designed in is responsible for why the course went well.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:47:58
Without taking into account the fact that you know, maybe you're just a really good teacher.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:48:02
Maybe you just had really good students. Maybe you got lucky like, and you know, it's understandable.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:48:09
There's there's not an easy way to do a comparison.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:48:12
The first time you teach a course, but it is. It would be useful to as much as possible.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:48:19
Try to take those factors into account, and and and think if you know, if you're if you're designing a new course, you think oh, I'm gonna want to write this up for Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:48:27
Think about ways that you could build in some element of comparison, or I mean not like to control groups or something like that, but but something that gives you a basis for stronger claims, because what you're doing implicitly is asking other people.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:48:47
You're claiming, you know, to other potential teachers. If you do this it will go well for you as well, and that's, you know, not necessarily the case, but to the extent that you can think about that aspect I think it would be really helpful.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:49:00
Okay.

[anke] 08:49:16
Any other questions, concerns projects that you have. As Mara puts it, you know, in the potential pipeline.

[anke] 08:49:27
And you might wanna workshop here very quickly

[anke] 08:49:45
The mentoring scheme involves. What does the mentoring scheme involve?

[anke] 08:49:51
We're at the very beginning of this, Julia.

[anke] 08:49:54
We are trying to find ways to communicate and build bridges with you, to help you in that intersecting interfacing of

[anke] 08:50:09
Building our community and learning together. And I think the mentoring scheme is going to be very individualized, such that you get in touch with us and ask for help, and then we try to facilitate as best as possible to really help you in that process of bringing the conference paper the individual book chapter or

[anke] 08:50:37
Dissertation, chapter or project, or course, or tool into fruition for publication. Mara and Julia is that summary

[Mara Oliva] 08:50:48
Yeah, I think you know, yeah, it's perfect. And you know, one of the reasons why we you had feeling a survey to to look a place for.

[Mara Oliva] 08:50:59
This workshop is goes. As a. As I said, we at the very beginning of this, so was one way of collecting information.

[Mara Oliva] 08:51:05
So that we can, you know, make progress in our mentoring program.

[Mara Oliva] 08:51:12
So we have an idea of our community. And we can, you know, start making some decision and develop these far. There

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:51:23
I will, that's I agree completely with what's been said.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:51:27
I will also just add, on a practical note a lot of the a lot of the details of the mentoring scheme will depend on how well we're able to build a team of potential mentors in the past.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:51:41
Dhq. Had a very small group of people who had generously said, You know I'm willing to help provide more detailed assistance with the revision process for authors who want it, but it was such a small group that we weren't really able to offer it as a service more broadly it was

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:52:00
More kind of okay by case. But what I would really like to do is have a group of people who are thoughtful about writing and are interested in in in working with people on writing in this funny hybrid digital humanities.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:52:19
Space, and then, when submissions come in, they seem to have a lot of potential, but are still in a very unformed state by scholars new to the field, or scholars coming from other language traditions that we would be able to offer to pair the author with a mentor who could work

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:52:41
With them in detail, and, as Anke said, as you know, if an author requested it, obviously we'd like to be able to to offer that support as well.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:52:50
But we're going to be working over the next few months on building that mentoring team and thinking about how to make that process more visible and accessible, so that people can will know that it can be requested.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:53:02
So, if you have thoughts about what would be helpful or if you're interested in either serving as a mentor, or, you know, experimenting with us as someone who wants mentorship, please do be in touch, and I'm going to put the the contact address.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:53:19
I mean, you can just contact the regular Dhq email

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:53:24
But this one will go to Anke, and Julia and Mya Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:53:29
Info@digitalhumanities.org

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:53:39
Other questions. I know we're we're coming up on time

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:53:51
When we first sent out the invitation and announced it, we got a huge flood of of interest.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:54:02
I think we were expecting something like 50 or 60 people and we knew that we were gonna get fewer than that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:54:08
In the in this event, and we're delighted with the group that we we have had.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:54:13
This is, I think, the perfect size group, but we had. We had been a little afraid that there would be like this flood of questions, so we had sort of in the in the welcome email sent out a bit of like, we'll be taking questions in the chat but I think we can be more more

[Mara Oliva] 08:54:13
Hmm.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:54:27
Flexible. If people wanna just speak up or

[anke] 08:54:34
Any particular mentoring you're looking for, are there? Are there issues that may not have been put in the survey that you've struggled with, or that you would journal, you know, if the journal like ours will be particularly helpful to bring you along anything that is is a hurdle

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:02
I'm going to just quickly respond to Geffen's question about the extended deadline.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:07
So we can be flexible in other words, if you contact us and say I, you know I am on fire with ideas, but I you know, need a bit of time.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:19
I. And it's really important to me to to get this into this cycle.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:23
Can I submit it by, you know. February first.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:27
We can. We can. We can work with you. We were thinking initially of, like a two-week extension.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:32
So extension till February the first, which would be very easy for us.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:35
But if you needed, like another couple of weeks beyond that, we're happy to.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:40
We're happy to discuss. And of course, you know, there's going to be another deadline just around the corner in April.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:55:45
So.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:56:01
Alright! I saw one person coming in just a few minutes ago, and I hope this wasn't a a time zone.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:56:08
Confusion, we're we're just wrapping up as you as you may have picked up.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:56:15
But anybody who wants to come to the the next one.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:56:19
We welcome folks to be repeats or to. If if someone missed miss this event wants to come tomorrow, I'm gonna send out an email to to everybody who was on the original invitation list, I'm just letting them know that it's fine to find to come tomorrow, if they if they

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:56:34
Want, so you'll you'll all be receiving that email

[anke] 08:56:37
Tomorrow, one pm. Eastern Standard time

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:56:40
Yes.

[anke] 08:56:44
Please feel free to send us emails. You have the email address.

[anke] 08:56:50
If something pops up that we didn't address, and you know, as you take your next couple of coffee or tea, you're like website, completely forgot to ask that.

[anke] 08:57:01
So please go ahead and email us, could you cite a pedagogy case study that works really well?

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:57:12
I was gonna say, I'll get back to you on that one.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:57:16
I'm gonna have to gonna have to think about it.

There's a good one. There's one that I really like which isn't so much a pedagogy case study.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:57:30
But it is pedagogically focused, and it's an early article about the silk road, so if I now go to Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:57:41
And search for that. Let me see if I can bring it up

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:57:48
Traveling the silk road on a virtual globe.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:57:52
So here's the link. I'm not sure it really counts as a case study, but it's an exploration of I mean, maybe for that reason it's one of the ones that I that I really like because it talks about the teaching of spatial thinking and it it it it

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:58:10
Describes the pedagogical experiment, but it puts it into a really nice context in terms of sort of broader pedagogical goals, institutional mission, that kind of thing so I would I definitely would point people towards that one I wonder mara and Anke whether there are any that you

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:58:24
Might have

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:58:27
On your radar.

[anke] 08:58:30
I would have to look sorry

[Mara Oliva] 08:58:31
Okay, yeah, I need to check. Oh, yeah, that will definitely get back to you.

[Mara Oliva] 08:58:37
Rainy.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:58:38
Yeah.

[anke] 08:58:39
Would it be helpful to to isolate? I don't know.

[anke] 08:58:44
I mean, this is this is just a suggestion, but I to isolate a certain set of articles that speak to each genre

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:58:52
Hmm sort of sample articles. That's a great idea.

[Mara Oliva] 08:58:53
Hmm.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:58:57
Yeah, let's do that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:59:09
And if if people have other ideas about materials, that would be useful where you know we have the the author support page that I plopped into the chat earlier, which I'll I'll put in again.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:59:23
But that's still a very kind of rudimentary page. And if there are other resources that we could add that would be useful to authors new to the field or authors new to the journal please please, suggest, and we will we will respond

[anke] 08:59:42
Bernie. Thank you. We'll we'll work on that

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:59:48
Yeah, one of the things that I had in mind to say, but then was sort of rushing myself a little bit.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 08:59:54
At the beginning, about Dhq from a perspective of you know, authorial goals, tone.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:00:04
That kind of thing is that I know people used Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:00:06
A lot in teaching. I know I use it a lot, but I'm maybe a special case, but because it's open access you know, it's a it's a free resource for people teaching, introduction to digital humanities or similar courses.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:00:23
So for authorship we also really encourage people to think about that aspect of the journal.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:00:29
The fact that it has a kind of pedagogical role in mission, and not just for students, but also for for people who are trying to learn more about the field.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:00:38
So.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:00:40
All right. Well, I see it's 90'clock, and I think at this point people are free to we're free to displace for those who might just have joined I hope it wasn't a time zone issue.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:00:58
We're we're wrapping up now, but if you are available tomorrow at at 10'clock we would look forward to seeing you again, or seeing you for the first time, and if folks have other questions, please email us at the Dhq.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:01:10
Info email address and thanks to all for coming. And thank you.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:01:16
Anke and Mara, and just general thanks all around.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:01:19
I feel like we we we managed this first one

[Mara Oliva] 09:01:23
You know. Thank you. Thank you so much, and apologies again from my part

[anke] 09:01:23
Thank you very much for joining us

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 09:01:29
