   <h1><a name="DHQEncodingDocumentation"></a>DHQ Encoding Documentation</h1>

<p>This document provides an introduction to using the DHQ markup language.  Because DHQ is a customization of TEI, most of the elements in DHQ  markup are fully documented as part of the TEI Guidelines. This guide is  intended to provide an overview of the DHQ document structure and  information about good practice; it also documents the DHQ-specific  elements and usages that may depart from standard TEI usage.</p>

<p>To suggest new tags or to ask for more information, please email us at <a href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">editors@digitalhumanities.org</a>.</p>

<p>For guidance on ensuring that your encoding is complete, see the <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/view/DHquarterly/EncodingChecklist">Encoding Checklist</a>.</p>

<p>For guidance on getting started, see the <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/view/DHquarterly/DHQQuickStart">DHQ Quick Start</a> page.</p>


<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

        <p>DHQauthor markup is fairly intuitive, particularly if you are already  familiar with the TEI Guidelines. A simple DHQ document consists of a &lt;teiHeader&gt; containing document metadata, followed by a &lt;text&gt; that contains the content of the article. The body of the text can be subdivided into sections represented as &lt;div&gt; elements, and each of these is composed of components such as  paragraphs, lists, figures, examples, notes, and the like. Within paragraph-level  components, there are smaller elements available to encode names,  emphasis, quotations, bibliographic references, foreign-language words,  terminology, and other aspects of the verbal texture. Appendices and acknowledgements are encoded as separate divisions at the end of the body. At the end of the  article the back matter contains a bibliography of works cited. As a shortcut, we  provide a <a href="dhq_author_template.xml">template</a> with all required metadata elements and guidance on encoding.</p>

<h2><a name="structure"></a>Large structural elements</h2>
<h3><a name="text"></a>&lt;text&gt;</h3>

<p>The main content of a DHQ article is contained within the &lt;text&gt; element. Within &lt;text&gt;, there are three major components. The &lt;front&gt; contains a teaser and abstract, both of which are supplied by the author (either upon submission or after the article has been accepted for publication). The &lt;body&gt; element contains the article proper, including any appendices. The &lt;back&gt; element contains the bibliography of works cited, encoded as &lt;listBibl&gt;.</p>

<h3><a name="body"></a>&lt;body&gt;</h3>

<p>In a short article with no internal subdivisions, the body element may simply contain paragraphs and paragraph-level things. In  longer articles containing multiple sections, the individual sections  are encoded with &lt;div&gt;. The &lt;div&gt; element should not be used if there are no internal subdivisions.</p>

<p><b>Appendices</b> should be encoded with &lt;div&gt;, with a heading of "Appendix".<br/>
<b>Acknowledgements</b> should be encoded as the final &lt;div&gt; within &lt;body&gt;, with a heading of "Acknowledgements".</p>


<h3><a name="floatingText"></a>&lt;floatingText&gt;</h3>

<p>To embed a complete embedded text within a DHQ article (for instance, a letter, a  game, a poem that does not originate outside the text), use the &lt;floatingText&gt; element. Its structure is essentially the same as that of &lt;text&gt;. The &lt;floatingText&gt; element may go anywhere within &lt;body&gt; or &lt;div&gt;.</p>


<h3><a name="div"></a>&lt;div&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;div&gt; element is used to represent subdivisions of the  text. This element may nest inside itself as necessary to represent nesting subdivisions. A division should begin with a &lt;head&gt; and includes one or more paragraphs and other paragraph-level  structures (e.g. quotes, lists, figures, examples), or further subdivisions. DHQ does not use any @type or @n  attributes on &lt;div&gt;. It is also unnecessary to assign IDs to &lt;div&gt; elements unless they are the target of a cross-reference.</p>

<p>Division headings should not consist simply of a  number, but should give the reader some idea of the section's topical focus and where the argument is going.</p>

<p>Divisions may also include <b>epigraphs</b> (short quotation with accompanying citation) following the division heading.</p>

<p><b>Appendices</b> should be encoded with &lt;div&gt;, with a heading of "Appendix".<br/>
<b>Acknowledgements</b> should be encoded as the final &lt;div&gt; within &lt;body&gt;, with a heading of "Acknowledgements".</p>
        
<h3>Bibliography</h3>
<p>A bibliography of works cited should be encoded at the end of the document, in a &lt;listBibl&gt; within the &lt;back&gt;.</p>


<h2><a name="chunk"></a>Chunk-level elements</h2>

<h3><a name="head"></a>&lt;head&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;head&gt; element is used for all headings (of articles, sections, tables, figures, examples, etc.). The &lt;text&gt; and &lt;div&gt; elements will typically start with a &lt;head&gt; element. In the case of &lt;text&gt; this is the title of the article. In the case of &lt;div&gt; it is the heading for the section. The &lt;head&gt; element may contain basic  inline elements (see below). While the &lt;head&gt; element is optional, in a long article it is good practice to include  headings for the divisions. Headings should not consist simply of a  number, but should give the reader some idea of where the argument is going.</p>

<h3><a name="epigraph"></a>&lt;epigraph&gt;</h3>

<p>The&nbsp; &lt;epigraph&gt; element is used to encode short quoted passages at the start of a division. Epigraphs may appear at the top of a &lt;text&gt; or &lt;div&gt;, following the &lt;head&gt;. Epigraphs will typically contain a <a href="#cit">&lt;cit&gt;</a> element, which consists of a quotation (encoded with &lt;quote&gt;) followed by a citation (typically encoded with &lt;ptr&gt; or &lt;ref&gt;, but see below for special cases). A graphic or example may be used in place of &lt;cit&gt;.</p>

<h3><a name="lg"></a>&lt;lg&gt;</h3>

<p>Verse is encoded using the &lt;lg&gt; element, which represents a "line group" of one or more poetic lines.</p>

<h3><a name="l"></a>&lt;l&gt;</h3>

<p>Within &lt;lg&gt;, individual lines of poetry are encoded with &lt;l&gt;. A "line" in this context does not make significant semantic claims to being verse, but simply represents a line of text that operates as a unit that cannot be arbitrarily broken or relineated.</p>

<h3><a name="said"></a>&lt;said&gt;</h3>

<p>Direct speech should be represented with &lt;said&gt;. However, most cases of direct speech in DHQ articles will also be quotations, and should be encoded simply with &lt;quote&gt; rather than with &lt;quote&gt; and &nbsp;&lt;said&gt;. The use of &lt;said&gt; should be confined to cases where direct speech is being uttered within the context of the article (e.g. It's as if one were to say "Hello" without really meaning it...)</p>

<h3><a name="sp"></a>&lt;sp&gt;</h3>

<p>Within dramatic dialogue, individual speeches or utterances are encoded using the &lt;sp&gt; element. This element may contain one or more &lt;p&gt;, &lt;lg&gt;, or &lt;stage&gt; elements in any order.</p>

<h3><a name="stage"></a>&lt;stage&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;stage&gt; element is used to represent stage directions.</p>



<h3><a name="phrase"></a>Phrase-level elements</h3>

<h3><a name="emph"></a>&lt;emph&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;emph&gt; element is used to encode words and phrases that  are intended to be rhetorically emphatic. It will typically display in  italics.</p>


<h3><a name="foreign"></a>&lt;foreign&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;foreign&gt; element is used to encode words and phrases  that  are in a language other than that of the surrounding text. It  carries  an @xml:lang attribute which should always be used to indicate  what  language its contents are in. The values for the @xml:lang  attribute  are two-letter language codes as follows:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wwp.brown.edu/encoding/training/ISO/iso639.html#2letter">comprehensive list</a></p>


<h3><a name="hi"></a>&lt;hi&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;hi&gt; element is a fall-back element used to apply  necessary formatting that is not driven by one of the more semantically  distinctive elements provided in the schema. For instance, it might be  used to represent superscripts or subscripts, or to highlight a portion  of a code sample to bring it to the reader's attention. Its @rend  attribute takes the following values:</p>

<ul>
	<li>bold</li>
	<li>italic</li>
	<li>monospace</li>
	<li>quotes</li>
	<li>smcaps</li>
	<li>subscript</li>
	<li>superscript</li>
</ul>


<p>No other values have any processing attached to them at this time.</p>


<h3><a name="name"></a>&lt;name&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;name&gt; element is used to encode names in the text:  typically the names of persons, but also place names and the names of  organizations as well. At present this element is not processed in any  special way, but in the future we may provide a more detailed rationale  for encoding certain types of names (e.g. the names of significant  figures in digital humanities) to support analysis. Authors wishing to  encode names are free to do so.</p>


<h3><a name="q"></a>&lt;q&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;q&gt; element is used to represent words or phrases (other than technical terms, quotations and direct speech) that should be presented in quotation marks for some reason. It encompasses the   following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ironic usage or "scare quotes": the "experts" tell us not to worry...</li>
	<li>drawing attention to specific usages: the "dungeon" in this case is intended metaphorically...</li>
	<li>identification of words as words: when we consider the word "phthisis" we are immediately struck...</li>
</ul>


<p>The &lt;q&gt; element should only be used in cases where neither &lt;quote&gt;, &lt;said&gt;, or &nbsp;&lt;term&gt; is appropriate.</p>

<h3><a name="term"></a>&lt;term&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;term&gt; element is used for technical terms, which will  typically be displayed with italics. In the future this element may serve as the basis for a  DHQ glossary. Authors wishing to encode terms are free to do so.</p>


<h3><a name="title"></a>&lt;title&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;title&gt; element is used to encode the titles of works discussed or cited in a DHQ article. Within the &lt;bibl&gt; element it represents the title of the work being cited. In running prose, it should be used for any title mentioned.</p>

<p>The @rend attribute on title may take one of three values:</p>

<ul>
	<li>italic (for books, journals, and other standalone works such as works of e-literature</li>
	<li>quotes (for journal articles, individual chapters or sections of larger works)</li>
	<li>none (for conferences, interviews, book series, and other titles that require no formatting)</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition, for articles that are discussing markup or programming, the following additional elements may be useful:</p>

<h3><a name="tag"></a>&lt;tag&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;tag&gt; element is used to encode a complete XML tag  (possibly including attributes). Content should be entered without the  surrounding angle brackets.</p>

<h3><a name="att"></a>&lt;att&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;att&gt; element is used to encode the name of an XML  attribute. It will typically be formatted in a way that signals this  fact: e.g. using the conventional @ prefix.</p>


<h3><a name="val"></a>&lt;val&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;val&gt; element is used to encode an XML attribute value.  It will typically be formatted in a way that signals this fact: e.g. by  enclosing it within quotation marks.</p>

<h3><a name="eg"></a>&lt;eg&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;eg&gt; element is used to encode a code sample to be  displayed as a block. By default its contents will be displayed in a  manner similar to the HTML &lt;pre&gt; element, with white space and  line breaks preserved, and in a fixed-width font. Within &lt;eg&gt;, the &lt;hi&gt; element is permitted to allow for highlighting of significant sections.</p>

<h3><a name="code"></a>&lt;code&gt;</h3>

<p>The code element is used to encode a short snippet of  computer code, to be displayed inline. By default, its contents will  typically be displayed in a fixed-width font.</p>

<h3><a name="gi"></a>&lt;gi&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;gi&gt; element is used to encode the name of an XML element  (without attributes). It will typically be formatted in a way that  signals this fact: e.g. by enclosing it within angle brackets.</p>


<h3><a name="quote"></a>&lt;quote&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;quote&gt; element is used for quotations of material from outside the text (e.g. other articles, books, aphorisms, etc.).</p>
<ul>
	<li>The @rend attribute takes values "inline" and "block"; inline  quotations will be formatted with quotation marks; block quotations will  be set off as blocks.</li>
	<li>When accompanied by a bibliographic citation (encoded as &lt;ptr&gt; or &lt;ref&gt;), a quote should be enclosed within a &lt;cit&gt; element to associate the quote and the citation.</li>
</ul>




<h3><a name="cit"></a>&lt;cit&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;cit&gt; element is used to represent complete citation: a quotation and the source from which it is taken. It groups together a &lt;quote&gt; element and some form of bibliographic reference.</p>

<ul>
	<li>In simple cases, the bibliographic reference should be encoded with &lt;ptr&gt;</li>
	<li>If the wording of the reference is distinctive and needs to be preserved, it should be encoded with &lt;ref&gt;.</li>
	<li>If the wording of the reference includes material that should not be included in the link, it should be encoded with &lt;dhq:citRef&gt; (see below), which contains a &lt;ref&gt; or &lt;ptr&gt; plus text content.</li>
</ul>


<p>In all cases, the @target attribute of &lt;ref&gt; or &lt;ptr&gt; points to the @xml:id of a &lt;bibl&gt; element in the &lt;listBibl&gt; at the end of the document. In rare cases, a &lt;ref&gt; may simply contain a brief citation without pointing to a &lt;bibl&gt; (for instance, if the quotation is from a famous speech or other non-bibliographic source), in which case &lt;ref&gt; should carry a @type attribute with the value "offline".</p>

<h3><a name="citRef"></a>&lt;dhq:citRef&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;dhq:citRef&gt; element is used to handle cases where there is material in the citation that is not appropriate to include within &lt;ref&gt; (since the contents of &lt;ref&gt; are a link to an item in the article's bibliography). The &lt;dhq:citRef&gt; element contains a &lt;ref&gt; or &lt;ptr&gt; element, plus whatever text content is present:</p>


<pre class="code-java">
&lt;cit&gt;
    &lt;quote rend=<span class="code-quote">"block"</span>&gt;the physical world is generally modelled as
    a series of discrete locations known as &lt;term&gt;rooms&lt;/term&gt;. The totality of rooms in a
    given work of IF is often referred to as the &lt;term&gt;map&lt;/term&gt;. Such rooms could
    correspond to rooms in a building, but they need not and frequently <span class="code-keyword">do</span> not[...].
    Conceptually, a room is that segment of physical space that is immediately accessible
     to the player character.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;dhq:citRef&gt;&lt;ptr target=<span class="code-quote">"#eve2007"</span> loc=<span class="code-quote">"para. 7"</span>/&gt;(emphasis in original)&lt;/dhq:citRef&gt;
&lt;/cit&gt;

&lt;cit&gt;
    &lt;quote rend=<span class="code-quote">"inline"</span>&gt;Only once in my life have I seen a wonderful medium effectively wiped
           out by <span class="code-keyword">new</span> technology&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;dhq:citRef&gt;qtd. in &lt;ptr target=<span class="code-quote">"#douglass2007"</span> loc=<span class="code-quote">"21-22"</span>/&gt;&lt;/dhq:citRef&gt;
&lt;/cit&gt;
</pre>


<h3><a name="said"></a>&lt;said&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;said&gt; element is used to represent direct speech or thought.</p>
        
        
        
        
        <h2><a name="examples"></a>Examples, Figures, and Tables</h2>

<h3><a name="eg"></a>&lt;eg&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;eg&gt; element is used to encode literal examples, which  may be sample code or other material that needs to be presented with its  formatting and line breaks intact. If it contains an XML sample, its  contents should be escaped, either by containing them inside a CDATA  section, or by escaping the individual characters (we prefer the  former). The &lt;eg&gt; element is treated as a block-level element for display purposes, so it will be set off from the surrounding text and all internal white space and lineation will be preserved.</p>

<p>The  distinction between examples and quotations may in some cases be hard to  draw; in cases where the example is significant for being quoted from  some specific piece of code, the &lt;eg&gt; element may be nested inside a &lt;quote&gt; element.</p>

<h3><a name="example"></a>&lt;dhq:example&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;dhq:example&gt; element is used for examples that are not sample code and do not require exact preservation  of white space (for instance, a sample text that will be discussed in  the article). This is a DHQ-specific element; it contains an optional &lt;head&gt; followed by the sample text (which may be encoded with &lt;floatingText&gt; or with other structural elements such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;sp&gt;, etc. as needed).</p>

<h3><a name="code"></a>&lt;code&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;code&gt; element is used for short snippets of code (such as XML or programming languages). It is treated as an inline element for display purposes, so it will wrap with the text that surrounds it. It is formatted in a monospace font.</p>

<h3><a name="figure"></a>&lt;figure&gt;</h3>

<p>Figures are encoded with the &lt;figure&gt; element. It contains several child elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>an optional &lt;head&gt; (a heading with the figure number will be automatically generated and any author-supplied heading will be appended to this)</li>
	<li>a required &lt;figDesc&gt; containing a brief description of the figure, to be used when the figure itself cannot be viewed</li>
	<li>a required &lt;graphic&gt; element contains a @url attribute which points to the relevant image file</li>
	<li>an optional &lt;dhq:caption&gt; element contains a brief descriptive caption which will be displayed below the figure; any credit information would be included here.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each &lt;figure&gt; element should carry a unique identifier (@xml:id) to  permit cross-referencing. The value of the identifier should be  "figure01", "figure02", etc. for ease of proofreading.</p>

<p>Image files should be named figure01.jpg (etc.).</p>

<h3><a name="figDesc"></a>&lt;figDesc&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;figDesc&gt; element contains a short description of the accompanying figure, to be used when the image itself cannot be viewed or displayed. DHQ typically supplies the contents of &lt;figDesc&gt; but in cases where specialized knowledge is required the author should supply a description.</p>


<h3><a name="graphic"></a>&lt;graphic&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;graphic&gt; element is an empty element; it carries a @url attribute that points to the relevant image file. It should use a relative path and point to the resources directory for the article, as in the following example:</p>


<pre class="code-java">
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;graphic url=<span class="code-quote">"resources/images/figure01.jpg"</span>/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>


<h3><a name="caption"></a>&lt;dhq:caption&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;dhq:caption&gt; element is a DHQ-specific element used to encode captions (of figures, tables, and examples). It may contain plain text with phrase-level elements, or a series of paragraphs. The content is supplied by the author; if none is supplied, the element is not needed.</p>

<h3><a name="list"></a>&lt;list&gt;, &lt;item&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;list&gt; element is used to encode lists of all kinds. It contains one or more &lt;item&gt; elements. Its @type attribute takes the following values:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"ordered": generates numbered labels</li>
	<li>"unordered": generates bullet labels</li>
	<li>"gloss": formats the contents of label</li>
	<li>"simple": no labels at all</li>
</ul>



<h3><a name="table"></a>&lt;table&gt;, &lt;row&gt;, &lt;cell&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;table&gt; element is used to encode tables. It contains a series of &lt;row&gt; elements, each of which contains one or more &lt;cell&gt; elements. It may also contain an optional heading and an optional &lt;dhq:caption&gt; (as with &lt;figure&gt;).</p>

<p>To identify a given row or cell as a label, use the @role attribute, with the value "label":</p>


<pre class="code-java">
&lt;row role=<span class="code-quote">"label"</span>&gt;

&lt;cell role=<span class="code-quote">"label"</span>&gt;
</pre>
        
        
<h2><a name="notes"></a>Elements for Annotation, Citation and Pointing</h2>

<h3><a name="bibl"></a>&lt;bibl&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;bibl&gt; element is used to encode individual items in the bibliography for the article.  In the future, most bibliographic items will be stored in a  comprehensive bibliographic database and their data will be extracted  and imported automatically into DHQ articles. However, all items will be  represented by a "stub" &lt;bibl&gt; element, typically carrying an attribute that will point to the full bibliographic record in the database. Some items may be  unsuitable for inclusion in Biblio, either because they are too odd or  because they are too article-specific (e.g. "Personal interview with the  author, June 2008"). These should receive a full bibliographic entry in  the article itself.</p>

<p>The &lt;bibl&gt; element carries two attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>@xml:id, which provides a unique identifier so that references in the text can point to their bibliographic item</li>
	<li>@label, which provides a string that can be automatically printed in the text as a reference (e.g. "Liu 2008")</li>
</ul>


<p>The value of @xml:id should take the form lastnameYYYY, where YYYY is  the four-digit year of publication. If there is more than one item by  the same author in the same year, then letters may be used for  disambiguation: smith2008a, smith2008b, etc. ID values should always be  all lower case and should not contain diacritics or punctuation. For  multi-author items, use the last name of the first author only.</p>

<p>The value of the @label attribute should be the label that will be  displayed in the text when the item is cited, e.g. Smith 2008. The label  should be the last name(s) of the authors plus the four-digit year of  publication, separated by a space, without a comma. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Smith 2008</li>
	<li>Smith and Jones 2008</li>

<h3><a name="note"></a>&lt;note&gt;</h3>
        <p>The &lt;note&gt; element is used for all notes. It is placed at the location where the note should appear; there is no need for explicit linking with the text. Notes should not be used for citation; all citations should be encoded with <a href="ptr">&lt;ptr&gt;</a> or <a href="ref">&lt;ref&gt;</a> and linked to the appropriate bibliographic reference in the Works Cited.</p>
        

<h3><a name="ptr"></a>&lt;ptr&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;ptr&gt; element is an empty element, used for internal  bibliographic references and certain external URIs. Its @loc attribute  can be used to provide a page number or page range (for printed sources)  or a section or paragraph number (for online sources).</p>

<p>The &lt;ptr&gt; element is used in two cases:</p>

<ol>
	<li>For simple internal references to bibliographic items, in cases  where the link text can be automatically generated from the @label  attribute on &lt;bibl&gt; and the @loc attribute on &lt;ptr&gt; (e.g. "Smith 2008, 19"). The @target attribute on &lt;ref&gt; contains the @xml:id of the targeted bibl,  preceded by a hash mark (#): e.g. &lt;ptr target="#smith2008"/&gt;. In  cases where the author wants to supply some additional text for the link  (e.g. "see Smith's excellent introduction, especially page 19") the &lt;ref&gt; element should be used instead of &lt;ptr&gt;.</li>
	<li>For simple references to external URIs from within the bibliography. In these cases, the @target attribute on ref carries the full URI (including the protocol: "http://", etc.).</li>
</ol>


<p>For display purposes, the information encoded with &lt;ptr&gt; will  be presented either as a URL (in the case of external targets) or as  the formatted label of a bibliographic reference (in the case of  internal pointers to the bibliography). If there is a value for @loc,  the display will include that information as well; for instance:</p>

<p>&lt;ptr target="jones1999" loc="4"/&gt;would display as [Jones 1999, 4]. &lt;ptr target="http://www.digitalhumanities.org"/&gt;will be presented as <b>&lt;</b><b><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org">http://www.digitalhumanities.org</a></b><b>&gt;</b>.</p>

<p>For values of @loc that are not simple page numbers, a prefix should be  included that indicates what kind of reference number is being used: for  instance, "para. 1" or "section 3.2" or "item 6". The value of @loc  will be displayed exactly as encoded.</p>


<h3><a name="ref"></a>&lt;ref&gt;</h3>

<p>The &lt;ref&gt; element is very similar to &lt;ptr&gt;, but it must contain content. It is used for several purposes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>cases where the wording of a bibliographic reference is significant and needs to be preserved. For instance, "McGann 2006, 16 (emphasis in original)". In these cases, page number information needs to be represented in the content of &lt;ref&gt; as well as on @loc, so that it is accessible to readers and for processing.</li>
	<li>references to external URIs in the body of the article. In some of these cases, the URI should appear both in the content and in the value  of @target. In other cases, it may be more appropriate to put the name of  the site or page instead of a URI in the content of &lt;ref&gt;; see stylistic note below.</li>
	<li>internal cross-references to other sections, notes, etc. in  the DHQ article or in other DHQ articles. In these cases, the @target  attribute should contain the @xml:id of the element being pointed to  (e.g. &lt;ref target="#figure01"&gt;Figure 1, below&lt;/ref&gt;).</li>
</ol>


<p>The &lt;ref&gt; element also carries a @loc attribute, which should always be used when applicable; although  this is not used for display, it can be used for analysis and to ensure that the page reference is captured in a formal manner.</p>

<p>For example: &lt;ref target="jones1999" loc="note 14"&gt;See Jones 1999, note 14&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref target="http://www.wikipedia.org"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>For references to external URIs, &lt;ref&gt; works just like an  HTML link; the author provides the text that will be inserted into the  anchor of the resulting hyperlink. DHQ house style stipulates that where  the URL is unfamiliar or difficult to discover, or where the reference  is to a very specific page on a site, the URL should be included as the content  of &lt;ref&gt; so that it remains visible if the reader prints the  DHQ page; for URLs that are very familiar or easy to discover (e.g. the  New York Times, major funding agencies, etc.) the name of the site be  used instead to reduce clutter on the page.</p>

<p>The &lt;ref&gt; element may also be used without a target at all.  In this case, no link will be generated. This is appropriate for  references that are not to specific published items but to works that  have conventionalized citation systems (e.g. Homer and most classical  texts, the Bible and other scriptural texts), or that are not available  in published form at all (e.g. private communications to the author,  keynote lectures, etc.). In these cases, &lt;ref&gt; is used with a  @type attribute whose value is "offline", indicating that there is  neither a bibliographic citation nor a URL available.</p>

<p>Where a citation accompanies an epigraph, it may be desirable for  aesthetic reasons to give the bibliographic information in a more  extended form (i.e. not the abbreviated "Emerson 1971" but the more  extensive "Emerson, The American Scholar". In these cases, the desired  display text should be encoded as the content of &lt;ref&gt;, and the target attribute should point to the &lt;bibl&gt; element in the usual way.</p>


<h3><a name="specialCharacters"></a>Special characters</h3>

<p>Any Unicode character may be included directly in the data for a DHQ  file. If the character can be typed directly, that is ideal. If not,  then it can be represented as a numeric character reference, using the  Unicode code point for the character being represented.</p>

<p>Accented characters should not be used in @xml:id values.</p>

<p>For punctuational dashes, use a spaced em-dash.</p>

<p>For dashes within number ranges, use an en-dash.</p>
