    	<h2>Citation Style</h2>
    	<p>Reference format: Please use the version of the Harvard system described below.
            References should be cited in the text using the author's name and year of publication,
            e.g. (Bloggs, 1990; Bloggs et al., 1991). (Again, authors using DHQ XML will find
            guidance on these issues in the DHQauthor Schema documentation.)</p>

    	        <h2>Notes and References</h2>
        <p>Notes should be used only for comments, not for simple bibliographic citations. Notes
            should be numbered consecutively throughout the text, and their anchor point in the text
            should be clearly identifiable. If you are not submitting in DHQauthor format (or
            another DHQ ML format in consultation with us), all notes should be gathered together at
            the end of the article. (If you are submitting in DHQauthor format, you may encode notes
            inline, and they will be extracted by a stylesheet.)</p>
        <p>Bibliographic references should be made inline and the works cited should be listed in a
            section at the end of the article headed &quot;References&quot;. The list should
            be in alphabetical order by reference label (the citation string). Where an author has
            more than one publication, they should be arranged in chronological order, and if there
            is more than one publication within a year, they should be alphabetically ordered by
            title and labelled a, b, etc. (e.g. 1989a, 1989b). Note that reference labels may
            contain spaces (e.g. [Sperberg-McQueen 1995]). Single-author works precede co-authored
            works. Please follow the examples given below for bibliographic layout.</p>
        <p>If you are submitting in DHQauthor format, full bibliographic references may be encoded
            in line (where they are cited). These will be extracted by a stylesheet and collected
            into a References section automatically.</p>
