		<h1>DHQ Citation Style Guidelines</h1>

				Guidelines</a>
		</p>
		<p>DHQ uses the Harvard Referencing system. Please format your in-text references and
			reference list as outlined below. </p>
		<h2>In-Text References</h2>
		<h3>Reference Elements</h3>
		<p>To create an in-text reference in the Harvard style, there are two required elements: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Author&rsquo;s surname or, in the case of works of film or television, title. If
				there are more than three authors, in-text references should be abbreviated as the
				first author&rsquo;s surname followed by &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>Year, in four-digit format (YYYY).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is also an optional third element: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Location, such as page number(s), paragraph, or section number. These are noted as:
				&ldquo;p. XX&rdquo; or &ldquo;pp. XX–XX&rdquo;. Page ranges are delimited with an en
				dash (–) rather than a hyphen. Paragraph numbers are noted with a pilcrow (&para;)
				and section numbers with a section sign (&sect;): &ldquo;&para;XX&rdquo; or
				&ldquo;&sect;X&rdquo;, with no space between the symbol and the number.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Stylistic notes or additions are never part of in-text parenthetical references.
			Clarifications such as &ldquo;emphasis added&rdquo; should be made in a footnote rather
			than in the context of the reference.</p>
		<h3>Reference Forms</h3>
		<p>In-text references may take one of two forms within the Harvard style and DHQ articles
			support both options. Either the surname should remain part of the prose of the article,
			with supporting information in parentheses, or the entire reference should be enclosed
			in parentheses. See these brief examples below for how to employ the guidelines:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>&hellip; as Mendez Garcia (2007) writes &hellip;</li>
			<li>&hellip; in their report, Campbell and Murray (2013, p. 426) note &hellip;</li>
			<li>&hellip; building on that research, Elliott et al. (2022, &sect;5.1) illustrate
				&hellip;</li>
			<li>&hellip; as we had proven (Fletcher et al, 2010), therefore, &hellip;</li>
			<li>&hellip; shown previously (Phillips, 2016, pp. 4–9).</li>
			<li>&hellip; based upon prior studies (Chandler, Li, and Osborne, 2018, &para;15), I
				expected &hellip;</li>
		</ul>
		<p>DHQ in-text references differ from the standard Harvard style in only one significant
			way. Multiple references, whether they be from the same author in different years,
			multiple works, or different editions of the same text, should never be combined. Please
			provide each reference as a unique entity.</p>
		<h2>Reference List</h2>
		<p>Most entries in the reference list begin in a similar fashion: with the author&rsquo;s
			name followed by the date of publication. The list should be organized alphabetically
			(single-authored works first), and then chronologically if necessary. As is the case
			across most citation styles, the reference for a printed book is the simplest and the
			basis for all other formats. A quick guide to some of the most referenced materials is
			below. Not every element is required for each type of reference. Items which are only
			necessary in certain circumstances are enclosed in curly braces &ldquo;{}&rdquo;. Please
			note the following particulars:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Author names should be given with a surname first, followed by a comma, and then
				either a full first name or initials (use whichever form is provided by the
				reference&rsquo;s published record</li>
			<li>Articles with two authors should be separated by &lsquo;and&rsquo; (e.g., Campbell,
				James and Murray, Elizabeth.)</li>
			<li>Articles with three authors should be first separated by comma and then
				&lsquo;and&rsquo; (e.g., Chandler, W., Li, S., and Osborne, T.)</li>
			<li>Articles with four or more authors should list the first author, followed by
				&lsquo;et al.&rsquo; (e.g., Fletcher, Sarah et al.)</li>
			<li>Initials should be followed by a full point and a space (e.g., an entry for John
				Edward Doe in the reference list would be &ldquo;Doe, J. E.&rdquo;)</li>
			<li>&ldquo;X&rdquo; is used to represent numerals</li>
			<li>&ldquo;DD Month YYYY&rdquo; is a two-digit date, the month spelled out completely,
				and a four-digit year</li>
			<li>All italics and parentheses should remain and are required</li>
			<li>Places of publication should be only the name of the municipality unless further
				specification is required</li>
			<li>Page ranges are delimited with an en dash (–), not a hyphen</li>
			<li>Volumes and issues are written as numerals (without &ldquo;vol.&rdquo; or
				&ldquo;iss.&rdquo;)</li>
		</ul>
