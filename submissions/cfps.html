	<h2>Call for Proposals: Artificial Intelligence for Digital Humanities: Research problems and critical approaches</h2>
		<p>August 1, 2025</p>
		<p><em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> invites authors to submit abstracts for a special
			issue devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence (AI). Though AI-based approaches
			to the digital humanities have been a part of the field for decades, recent years have
			seen an explosion of methodologies utilizing AI. Some methods show great promise,
			providing new modes of discoverability and analysis. Many raise questions and concerns
			along ethical and sociotechnical dimensions. There are also conceptual challenges and
			areas of application that are distinctive to the digital humanities. Given the volume of
			submissions and inquiries surrounding AI and the digital humanities, the DHQ editors
			have decided to devote a special issue to this topic in particular. </p>
		<p> We are interested in a wide-ranging view of AI in the digital humanities context,
			including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Different methodologies and applications, including those that look beyond
				generative AI</li>
			<li>Critical perspectives on AI, including ethical, political, and cultural
				critiques</li>
			<li>Responsible and transparent AI practices and frameworks in DH contexts</li>
			<li>Specific use cases that open the door for new DH-relevant possibilities</li>
			<li>Case studies within the digital humanities and in GLAM institutions, such as
				responsible AI frameworks used to operationalize AI</li>
			<li>Specific and grounded applications including but not limited to: translation,
				transcription, OCR correction, summarization, captioning, text to speech, and
				multi-modal approaches.</li>
			<li>Experimental pieces that make use of AI in their creation (These should also
				include an author’s statement/contextual material commenting on the experiment and
				why the selected form is essential to the submission.) </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Submissions should meet the following requirements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The submission must have a direct connection to the digital humanities.</li>
			<li>The submission should focus on research, rather than pedagogy (a second CFP
				centered on AI and pedagogy will be forthcoming).</li>
			<li>Except for experimental submissions, the submission must be human-authored (AI may
				only be used for grammar and spell-checking within the writing process). </li>
			<li>We are particularly interested in articles that will have continued value for
				readers over time, rather than those focused on specific technologies that may
				quickly become dated. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> We ask that prospective authors submit 500-word abstracts for review by September 15,
			2025. Please send the following to <a
				href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">editors@digitalhumanities.org</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An abstract of no more than 500 words</li>
			<li>The name(s) and affiliations of the author(s)</li>
			<li>Email address for the corresponding author</li>
		</ul>
		
			<p>Authors will be notified in January 2026 and invited to submit full papers by
			April 2026, which will be peer reviewed. A full timeline will be provided to authors
			upon the invitation to contribute a full paper. </p>
		<p> For questions related to this call, please contact the DHQ editors at: <a
				href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">editors@digitalhumanities.org</a>
			(please use the subject header: “DHQ AI Special Issue”).</p></div>
