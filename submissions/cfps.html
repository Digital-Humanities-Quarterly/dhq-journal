<h2>Digital Sankofa: Understanding Black Digital Humanities  past and futures</h2>
<p>Guest Editors: Rebecca Y.  Bayeck, Ph.D and  Kevin Winstead, Ph.D</p>
<p>Abstracts due: March 28, 2022</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Black lives and experiences have been captured, investigated, interpreted, and analyzed from different perspectives and reasons in various ways and different fields/disciplines. The digital world presents new opportunities and challenges for understanding, analyzing, presenting,  and making  sense of Black lives and experiences. Understanding that Black digital humanities is the intersection of  Blackness with technology (Gallon, 2016), we are calling for papers that highlight how emerging  technology (ies) has been used and could be employed to a) explore Blackness; b) how technology has been used and could be a tool/space to present, define, and study Black people, culture and history in a digital world and with digital tools. This call is also captured in Sankofa, a concept of the  Akan people of Ghana, which calls to remember the past to make positive progress in the future.</p>
        <p>We situate Blackness in its globality, and do not limit Blackness to Blacks in the western world, but include Blacks on the African continent.  Furthermore, building on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie' s “The Danger of a Single Story” Ted Talk, we situate Black digital humanities in its globality. In doing so, we intend to avoid the creation of a “single story”; avoid presenting Blackness “as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again” in a digital world. With Digital Sankofa, we consider how Blackness and Blacks have been constructed in digital spaces; we think of Blackness and Black people's past and future intersection with technology.</p>
        <p>Whether we have consistently engaged in this work, or are brand new to these considerations, now is an opportune time to reflect on the role of technology in: shaping, defining, presenting, and/or constructing Black lives, Blackness, and Black experiences. In this special issue, we therefore invite scholars in various fields to submit manuscripts (3000-8000 words) that address any of the following areas:
