        <h2>Digital Humanities Quarterly Special Issue on Critical Code Studies</h2>
        <p>Guest editors: Mark Marino and Jeremy Douglass</p>
        <p>Abstracts due November 15, 2020</p>
        <h3>Special Issue Description</h3>
        <p>This special issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly will bring together essays and case
            studies on the promises and limitations of critical code studies from historical,
            practical, and theoretical perspectives, as well as within the context of specific
            research projects and their environments, professional contexts, and arts practice. </p>
        <p> Critical code studies is the application of hermeneutics from the humanities to the
            interpretation of the extra-functional significance of computer source code. “Extra”
            means “growing out from” rather than “outside of.” Critical code studies readings
            explore technosocial culture through the entry point of computer source code. </p>
        <p> In this issue we will strive for equity in gender, race and ethnicity both in the
            authorship of articles and the authorship of the code being examined. </p>
        <h3> Suggested Topics</h3>
        <p>Theoretical lenses and approaches can include but are not limited to:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Accessibility</li>
            <li> Algorithmic Accountability</li>
            <li> Critical algorithm studies</li>
            <li> Critical race theory</li>
            <li> Ecological impact</li>
            <li> Electronic literature</li>
            <li> Ethics</li>
            <li> Ethnoprogramming</li>
            <li> Feminisms</li>
            <li> Game studies</li>
            <li> Indigenous programming</li>
            <li> Media archaeology</li>
            <li> Natural language processing</li>
            <li> Platform studies</li>
            <li> Postcolonialism</li>
            <li> Queer theory</li>
            <li> Rhetorical code studies</li>
            <li> Software studies</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Intersectional applications of multiple approaches will be encouraged. Objects of study
            may be code snippets, codework, or larger software but also programming paradigms,
            languages, and communities. </p>
        <h3> Submission Formats</h3>
        <p> Articles are welcome in two forms: theoretical approaches (4000-8000 words) and case
            studies (~2500 words). </p>
        <p> Theoretical approaches will look broadly at critical approaches to code using various
            critical theories. These may articles may make their case using various code examples
            but will focus more on the overall approach. </p>
        <p> Case studies will feature close readings of particular snippets of code. Based on the
            code critiques model of the Critical Code Studies Working Groups, these code readings
            should begin with the code they will analyze, followed by a brief description of the
            code’s functioning, before the interpretation of the overall code. </p>
        <h3> Submission Details</h3>
        <p> Please submit abstracts (max. 500 words) to markcmarino@gmail.com and
            jeremydouglass@gmail.com by Nov. 15, 2020 for a first round of review. Early inquiries
            are encouraged. If you are invited to submit a full-length article (~4,000-8,000 words)
            or a case study (~2500 words), we ask that they be submitted by March 1, 2021. </p>
