		<h1>Author Support</h1>
		<p>DHQ seeks to create a supportive and inclusive environment for authors, including authors new to the field and early-career contributors. We are developing mentoring programs to provide guidance to authors including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>orientation workshops for those new to DHQ or new to digital humanities</li>
			<li>reading draft abstracts and articles and providing initial feedback</li>
			<li>assistance with English-language editing, for accepted submissions</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Starting in January 2023, DHQ's peer review team is holding a series of online workshops to provide information for potential authors about DHQ's submission, review and publication process. The workshops are aimed at authors new to digital humanities, as part of our larger goal to expand DHQ's mentoring of authors even prior to submitting an article. Please see our <a href="../news/news.html">news page</a> for announcements and event details. Recordings of our first two events are now available:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Orientation workshop, 12 January 2023: <a href="https://vimeo.com/788667945">Video</a>, <a href="dhq_workshop_transcript_2022-01-12.txt">transcript</a>, <a href="dhq_workshop_chat_2023-01-12.txt">chat</a></li>

		</ul>
		<p>Weâ€™re also starting to build a team of volunteer mentors who can help us provide support to authors. The activities of this team will include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>read and provide feedback on drafts from authors new to the field</li>
			<li>provide copyediting assistance on accepted articles if needed, for authors who would like support with English as a language for research publishing</li>
		</ul>
<p>If you are interested in joining us as a mentor, <a href="mailto:dhqinfo@digitalhumanities.org">please email us</a>.
