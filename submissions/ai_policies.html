                Guidelines</a></p>
        
       <p>DHQ's policy on the use of artificial intelligence tools is evolving as those tools and our understanding of them change. DHQ follows the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/cope-position/authorship-and-ai-tools">guidelines of the Committee on Publication Ethics</a> concerning authorship and AI tools, with some additional requirements that are specific to DHQ. Please contact the editors if you have questions.
</p>
    	<h2>Broad Principles</h2>
    	<p>The mission of DHQ as a journal is focused on human scholarly interaction: </p>
    	<ul>
			<li>to foster communication between digital humanities scholars and practitioners on topics of common interest</li>
    		<li>to preserve and disseminate a record of the work of the digital humanities research community</li>
    		<li>to enable researchers and practitioners to discover and interact with others in their areas of interest
</li></ul>
    	<p>While we welcome the use of AI tools when they support those goals, we strongly deprecate the use of AI tools (especially generative AI) in the following circumstances:</p>
    	<ul>
			<li>when they create content in which the human author does not have direct agency. We want our readers to be interacting with other humans, not with AI systems.</li>
    		<li>when they create a misleading impression of the author's actual level of expertise in the subject area. We want our readers to participate in a network of genuine researchers who are capable of doing the work represented.</li>
    		<li>when they create a burden of effort for DHQ as a journal, in reviewing submissions that are not genuine contributions to the scholarly research interaction. As a diamond open-access journal, DHQ operates on very limited resources; submissions that violate our community guidelines make it harder for us to serve our authors and readers.</li>
</ul>
    	<h2>DHQ Requirements</h2>
    	<p><strong>DHQ requires authors to observe the following rules for use of AI in their DHQ submissions:</strong></p>
    	<ul>

<li><strong>Authorship: </strong> Authors of DHQ submissions take full intellectual and ethical responsibility for the integrity and accuracy of the submission. Artificial intelligence systems are not considered by DHQ to be authors and should not be listed as authors.</li> 

<li><strong>Content: </strong> Authors of DHQ submissions may not use AI tools to generate the content of their submission. Submission of an article to DHQ constitutes an assertion that the ideas and their expression in writing are the work of the author.  We recognize that many modern tools for research and authoring include AI assistance for things like identifying sources, creating diagrams, translating or clarifying language, etc. These are all permitted, but as noted above, the author has final responsibility for the accuracy and quality of the content. Authors may use AI tools to generate portions of an article, if the use of AI is thematically relevant to the article's topic and the use of AI tools is disclosed.
</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgement: </strong> Authors of DHQ submissions must acknowledge any substantive use of AI tools in their research and writing process (taking into account the guiding principles articulated above), that goes beyond the use of routine utilities such as grammar checking. This acknowledgement should be included in the body of the article, either as part of the discussion of methods, or as an appendix. 
</li></ul>
    	<p>Submissions which are found to violate these guidelines will be declined.</p>
