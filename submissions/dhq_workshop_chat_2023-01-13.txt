13:33:07 From Elizabeth Schwartz to Everyone:
	When would it make sense to write a case study vs. a journal article? I’m working on a DH project now that’s in its beginning phases, so I’m not sure which of these makes the most sense.
13:37:52 From Mariana Ziku to Everyone:
	Thank you so much! Did you mention a discontinuation of a section of the DHQ, can you provide more details on this? Are there any type of submission types that didn’t work in the context of DH-related publishing within DHQ?
13:47:23 From Akshika to Everyone:
	Hi, thank you for the session. Could you please elaborate a bit more on the mentorship programme? I am an undergrad trained in 'traditional' literary studies. DH is something I plan to grow into, which it still extremely new to me. Curious and eager to know and learn! Would want to know the foundations as I plan on beginning.
