      <h2>Digital Humanities Quarterly Special Issue on AudioVisual DH: Challenges and
            Possibilities</h2>
        <p>Co-Editors: Taylor Arnold, Stefania Scagliola, Lauren Tilton, Jasmijn van Gorp</p>
        <p> The Digital Humanities Quarterly Special Issue on AudioVisual DH invites contributions
            that address digital humanities approaches to audio and/or visual data. DH scholars
            engaged in fields such as art history, history, film studies, media studies, musicology,
            oral history, and sound studies have long understood the historical and contemporary
            centrality of audio and/or visual (AV) to knowledge production. The issue will
            demonstrate how inquiry into AV materials is shaping DH and how DH is reshaping AV
            scholarship. It is guided by three questions: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are digital and computational approaches to sound, images, and time-based
                media?</li>
            <li>How do these methods and approaches produce new knowledge and shift scholarship in a
                particular scholarly domain?</li>
            <li>What are the challenges and possible futures for AV in DH?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We invite multimedia articles as well as written articles (short articles between 1,500 -
            3,000 and long articles between 3,000 - 8,000 words), reviews, software, and case
            studies. Abstracts (500 words with a short bibliography) are due September 20th, 2019. Full
            contribution will be due November 30th, 2019. Questions and abstract submissions should be
            sent to <a href="mailto:AVinDHSpecialIssue@gmail.com"
            >AVinDHSpecialIssue@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>The Special Issue is endorsed by the ADHO AVinDH Special Interest Group. For more

        <h2>Call for Papers: Special Issue on Tools Criticism</h2>
        <p>Guest editors: Adriaan van der Weel and Peter Verhaar</p>
        
        
        <p>Scholarly research increasingly relies on digital tools which can create and analyse
            data. In evaluating the results emerging from scholarly work based on tools, it is
            important to recognise that tools have typically been developed for a particular
            scholarly purpose and/or within a particular methodological framework. Human software
            engineers consciously or unconsciously take decisions on the types of results that can
            be produced by tools, and as research instruments they therefore almost inevitably
            introduce a certain theoretical, practical or methodological bias. Tools criticism
            assumes that all scholarly resources are artefacts that implicitly express an argument,
            about methodological issues, about the outcomes desired, or about the social or
            political contexts in which the tool may be applied. Research in tools criticism aims to
            recognize such bias, to give an explicit expression to the various assumptions on which
            software tools are based, and to evaluate the potential impact of these assumption on
            research outcomes. </p>
        <p> In recent decades, the number of publicly available digital research tools has
            proliferated. Tools criticism stimulates a greater awareness of the implications of the
            use of particular tools, enabling scholars, for example, to make a reasoned choice.
            Tools criticism can also be relevant for scholars actively involved in the development
            of research instruments, because it draws attention to the inevitable theoretical,
            practical or methodological bias involved in the process. By examining and analysing the
            scholarly work necessary for tool development, tools criticism may also help scholars to
            receive academic recognition for this type of work, which is more than merely practical.
             </p>
        <p> The Special Issue for Digital Humanities Quarterly about Tools Criticism aims to clarify
            the goals and the methodology of Tools criticism in general as well as to illustrate how
            tools criticism may illuminate the bias introduced by digital research instruments. The
            editors invite contributions on the following five aspects of tools criticism.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rationale of tools criticism: </strong> Why do we need tools criticism? Is
                it possible and desirable to trace the social or political implications of tools?
                What are or should be the aims of tools criticism? How may digital humanities
                research benefit from tools criticism?</li>
            <li><strong>Data criticism: </strong> What does data criticism entail? How does it
                differ from tools criticism? What are or should be the aims of data criticism?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Methodologies in tools criticism: </strong> Is it possible to evaluate the
                degree to which tools affect the outcomes of scholarly research? Can the bias that
                is introduced by tools be demonstrated or even quantified? Assuming that tools
                mostly make implicit statements, is it possible to make these statements explicit?
                Which methods can we use to make these statements explicit? </li>
            <li><strong>Responsibility: </strong> What type of skills are necessary to critique data
                and tools? Is it necessary to be proficient in programming and in statistics? Does
                tools criticism demand an understanding of the inner workings of the tools, or can a
                tool also be criticized if it is treated as a black box? Is it necessary for full
                open access to be provided to the code in which the logic of the tool is
                implemented?</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical implications: </strong> Can tools criticism lead to a fair and
                impartial comparison of tools? What are the practical implications of tools
                criticism? If it is found that a tool displays a heavy bias, for instance, should a
                use of this tool be discouraged?   </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p><strong>Invisible Work in the Digital Humanities</strong><br /> Special Issue of Digital
            Humanities Quarterly (2018)</p>
        <p>Guest editors: Tarez Samra Graban, Paul F. Marty, Allen Romano, and Micah
            Vandegrift<br /> Florida State University </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p> At a recent symposium at Florida State University, digital humanists, librarians, and
            technology specialists explored the challenges of diverging expectations, unequal labor,
            and invisible work in the digital humanities -- http://iwdh.cci.fsu.edu/. The symposium
            provided an opportunity for participants to address questions such as the following: In
            intellectual and economic climates that prioritize external over internal validation,
            how do we define and defend the value of the digital humanities work? Whom do our
            projects and conversations include and exclude? How can we make the invisible work of
            digital humanities workers more visible? and What is the epistemic potential for
            questioning agency, access, participation, and use in digital humanities projects? </p>
        <p>To further explore these questions, the symposium organizers are pleased to announce a
            special issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ) to be published in late 2018. For
            this special issue, we seek contributions that theorize, highlight, and illustrate the
            challenges facing researchers and practitioners in the digital humanities when their
            work is invisible to a wide range of audiences and stakeholders. Questions to be
            addressed in this issue include, but are not limited to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the nature of invisible work in the digital humanities, to whom is this work
                invisible, and why might they not see it? </li>
            <li>What problems arise when invisible work in the digital humanities remains invisible,
                and how can we address those problems? </li>
            <li>To whom should we strive to make invisible work in the digital humanities visible,
                and why should we focus our efforts on those entities or individuals? </li>
            <li>Conversely, should "visibility" be an unquestioned value in the digital humanities,
                within or without of the academic institution, or is there an inherent value to work
                being invisible? </li>
            <li>How might we write a counter-narrative to the kinds of external validation that
                often drive (and often kill) most digital humanities initiatives? What would that
                counter-narrative look like? </li>
            <li>How might we argue for making invisible work in the digital humanities more visible
                internally (to ourselves) rather than externally (to outside observers), and what
                might the consequences of such a decision be? </li>
            <li>How can a focus on the internal or external validation of invisible work in the
                digital humanities heighten the unique methodologies of practitioners in certain
                disciplines, or bring their fields' critical questions into deeper relief? </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
        <p> For this special issue, we seek contributions of two principal types: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Article-length pieces describing original research (~8000 words in length); and </li>
            <li>Substantive, provocative, opinion-driven short essays (~1500 words in length). </li>
        </ul>
        <p> If you wish, you may submit an optional abstract for feedback from the editors by
            emailing your abstract (max. 500 words) to Tarez Samra Graban (tgraban@fsu.edu) by June
            1, 2017. </p>

        <h2 id="infovis">DHQ Special Issue: Creative Pedagogical Approaches in Information
            Design</h2>
        <h3>9 June 2016; extended submission deadline 15 November 2016</h3>
        <p>Digital Humanities Quarterly invites submissions for a special issue on creative
            pedagogical approaches in the instruction of information visualization. Contributions
            are invited on methodologies, tools, and resources that practitioners have used to teach
            any facet of information visualization, which may include (but is not limited to) best
            practices in design, the use of specific tools, or data literacy. These approaches may
            include any resources, workshops, activities, or other materials that translate
            principles of information visualization both widely across as well as within specific
            disciplines, cultures of scholarship, and technical backgrounds. Alternatively,
            contributions may be submitted about theoretical and philosophical perspectives on
            information visualization that inform the ways in which visualization is taught, where
            “teaching” may encompass engagement with audiences at any level of academe (e.g.,
            students, faculty, administrators, or staff). </p>
        <p> Following guidelines provided by DHQ, submissions may include research articles, case
            studies, opinion pieces, or reviews, such as ones written about digital materials that
            have been used in teaching information visualization. Individuals who wish to submit
            pieces that are more experimental in form beyond the DHQ guidelines above should contact
            the editor (below) in advance to discuss feasibility and other options for execution. </p>
        <p> The deadline for submitting pieces is October 1, 2016. Full submissions should follow
            the author guidelines provided by DHQ and should be 10 - 20 pages in length, with the
            possibility of longer pieces approved in exceptional instances. (For more details about
            DHQ submission guidelines, please refer to the <a href="index.html">DHQ submission
                guidelines</a>. Please send all completed submissions to the guest editor of this
            issue, Steven Braun (s.braun@neu.edu), with the subject line "DHQ Special Issue
            Infovis." Please submit any questions or concerns about submissions to this address as
            well. </p>
        <p> Submissions will undergo anonymous peer review through standard DHQ review processes,
            and the editor(s) will work with submission authors to ensure that final submissions
            follow appropriate guidelines for publication in DHQ. </p>
