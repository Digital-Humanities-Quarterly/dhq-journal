<h2>Digital Sankofa: Understanding Black Digital Humanities  past and futures</h2>
<p>Guest Editors: Rebecca Y.  Bayeck, Ph.D and  Kevin Winstead, Ph.D</p>
<p>Abstracts due: March 28, 2022</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Black lives and experiences have been captured, investigated, interpreted, and analyzed from different perspectives and reasons in various ways and different fields/disciplines. The digital world presents new opportunities and challenges for understanding, analyzing, presenting,  and making  sense of Black lives and experiences. Understanding that Black digital humanities is the intersection of  Blackness with technology (Gallon, 2016), we are calling for papers that highlight how emerging  technology (ies) has been used and could be employed to a) explore Blackness; b) how technology has been used and could be a tool/space to present, define, and study Black people, culture and history in a digital world and with digital tools. This call is also captured in Sankofa, a concept of the  Akan people of Ghana, which calls to remember the past to make positive progress in the future.</p>
        <p>We situate Blackness in its globality, and do not limit Blackness to Blacks in the western world, but include Blacks on the African continent.  Furthermore, building on Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie' s “The Danger of a Single Story” Ted Talk, we situate Black digital humanities in its globality. In doing so, we intend to avoid the creation of a “single story”; avoid presenting Blackness “as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again” in a digital world. With Digital Sankofa, we consider how Blackness and Blacks have been constructed in digital spaces; we think of Blackness and Black people's past and future intersection with technology.</p>
        <p>Whether we have consistently engaged in this work, or are brand new to these considerations, now is an opportune time to reflect on the role of technology in: shaping, defining, presenting, and/or constructing Black lives, Blackness, and Black experiences. In this special issue, we therefore invite scholars in various fields to submit manuscripts (3000-8000 words) that address any of the following areas:
</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The field of Black digital Humanities (DH), past and future possibilities: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Relationship between Black data curation and Black DH</li><li>

                    <li>Intellectual History and Future Possibilities of Black DH</li>
                    <li>Algorithmic explorations of Black history and culture</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Privacy and ethics in Black DH
                <ul>
                    <li>Researching Black experiences in a digital world</li>
                    <li>Principles for Black Data curation in a digital world</li>
                    <li>Privacy  and ethical approaches  for Black Digital Humanities</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Interdisciplinary interpretation/framing of Black lives/experiences. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Black DH and CRT</li>
                    <li>Building a Black DH: Bridging social sciences and Humanities</li>

        <h2>Digital Humanities Quarterly Special Issue on Critical Code Studies</h2>
        <p>Guest editors: Mark Marino and Jeremy Douglass</p>
        <p>Abstracts due November 15, 2020</p>
        <h3>Special Issue Description</h3>
        <p>This special issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly will bring together essays and case
            studies on the promises and limitations of critical code studies from historical,
            practical, and theoretical perspectives, as well as within the context of specific
            research projects and their environments, professional contexts, and arts practice. </p>
        <p> Critical code studies is the application of hermeneutics from the humanities to the
            interpretation of the extra-functional significance of computer source code. “Extra”
            means “growing out from” rather than “outside of.” Critical code studies readings
            explore technosocial culture through the entry point of computer source code. </p>
        <p> In this issue we will strive for equity in gender, race and ethnicity both in the
            authorship of articles and the authorship of the code being examined. </p>
        <h3> Suggested Topics</h3>
        <p>Theoretical lenses and approaches can include but are not limited to:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Accessibility</li>
            <li> Algorithmic Accountability</li>
            <li> Critical algorithm studies</li>
            <li> Critical race theory</li>
            <li> Ecological impact</li>
            <li> Electronic literature</li>
            <li> Ethics</li>
            <li> Ethnoprogramming</li>
            <li> Feminisms</li>
            <li> Game studies</li>
            <li> Indigenous programming</li>
            <li> Media archaeology</li>
            <li> Natural language processing</li>
            <li> Platform studies</li>
            <li> Postcolonialism</li>
            <li> Queer theory</li>
            <li> Rhetorical code studies</li>
            <li> Software studies</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Intersectional applications of multiple approaches will be encouraged. Objects of study
            may be code snippets, codework, or larger software but also programming paradigms,
            languages, and communities. </p>
        <h3> Submission Formats</h3>
        <p> Articles are welcome in two forms: theoretical approaches (4000-8000 words) and case
            studies (~2500 words). </p>
        <p> Theoretical approaches will look broadly at critical approaches to code using various
            critical theories. These may articles may make their case using various code examples
            but will focus more on the overall approach. </p>
        <p> Case studies will feature close readings of particular snippets of code. Based on the
            code critiques model of the Critical Code Studies Working Groups, these code readings
            should begin with the code they will analyze, followed by a brief description of the
            code’s functioning, before the interpretation of the overall code. </p>
        <h3> Submission Details</h3>
        <p> Please submit abstracts (max. 500 words) to markcmarino@gmail.com and
            jeremydouglass@gmail.com by Nov. 15, 2020 for a first round of review. Early inquiries
            are encouraged. If you are invited to submit a full-length article (~4,000-8,000 words)
            or a case study (~2500 words), we ask that they be submitted by March 1, 2021. </p>

      <h2>Digital Humanities Quarterly Special Issue on Minimal Computing</h2>
        <p>Guest editors: Alex Gil (Columbia University Libraries) and Roopika Risam (Salem State University)
</p>
        <p>Abstracts due January 30, 2020</p>
        <h3>Special Issue Description</h3>
        <p> This special issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly will bring together essays and case studies on the promises and limitations of minimal computing from historical, practical, and theoretical perspectives, as well as within the context of specific research projects and their environments. </p>
        <p>Minimal computing can be defined as any form of digital or computational praxis done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, agency or other factors. Within the context of digital humanities scholarship, minimal computing refers to such computing practices used for teaching, research, and the construction and maintenance of a hybrid -- digital and analog -- scholarly and cultural record. </p>
        <p>Broadly construed, our scope is not limited to digital scholarship within the confines of universities and thus includes work undertaken in galleries, archives (institution and community-based), and libraries, as well as in collaboration with communities.
In this issue, we strive for equity in gender and particularly encourage submission by women and gender minorities. We further actively seek to include at least one contribution from each of the following geographical areas: Latin America, Africa, and Asia. We are able to accept submissions in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.
</p>
        <h3>Suggested Topics</h3>
<p>Topics can include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Minimal hardware: aged machines, USBs, arduinos, simple circuits, etc.</li>
    <li>Minimal computation: simple scripts, bash, tranductions, etc.</li>
    <li>Static site generation</li>
    <li>Teaching fundamentals of computing tied to subjects in the humanities and the humanistic social sciences</li>
    <li>Forms of making-do in relation to computation: jugaad, hacktivism, DIY</li>
    <li>Technological disobedience, i.e. using technologies in a way they were not intended</li>
    <li>Marginal forms of knowledge and memory production involving computation</li>
    <li>A critique of minimal or minimalist approaches undertaken by choice, rather than by necessity</li>
    <li>Genealogies of minimalist forms of computation</li>
    <li>Case studies on projects that address a multiplicity of costs (environment, bandwidth, access, maintenance, etc) and needs (publishing, remembrance, resistance, etc) with an overall reduction in complexity</li>
    <li>Implications of minimal computing practices for universities, libraries and archives.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Formats</h3>
<p>The special issue will consist of two sections: The first section will be reserved for scholarly arguments grounded in history or well argued theoretical work on minimal computing, and the second section will include case studies in the form of specific projects or deep descriptions of environments that pose particular challenges or constraints for digital scholarship and strategic responses to them that incorporate minimal computing practices. </p><p>
In the first section, we welcome historical perspectives on minimal computing that place contemporary practices in dialogue with multiple documented genealogies; theoretical or strategic pieces that examine socio-technical implications of these practices at scale today; and critical or skeptical voices who are familiar with the implications of minimal computing and the informal discussions and practices that have taken place in the recent past. </p><p>
For the second section we welcome deep descriptions of projects and environments that include, extend, and complicate minimal computing practices, prompting meditations on difference and imperfect similarity between multiple projects or environments. These case studies should help mainstream audiences understand the granular thinking behind design decisions that respond to specific constraints and challenges.</p>
<h3>Submission Details</h3>
        <p>We ask that you send your abstracts (max. 500 words) to <a href="mailto:rrisam@salemstate.edu">rrisam@salemstate.edu</a> and <a href="mailto:agil@columbia.edu">agil@columbia.edu</a> by January 30, 2020 for a first round of review. Early inquiries are encouraged. We will notify all submitters of the status of their submission in late February. If you are invited to submit a full-length article (~4,000-8,000 words) or a case study (~2500 words), we ask that they be submitted by June 30, 2020.

      <h2>Digital Humanities Quarterly Special Issue on AudioVisual DH: Challenges and
            Possibilities</h2>
        <p>Co-Editors: Taylor Arnold, Stefania Scagliola, Lauren Tilton, Jasmijn van Gorp</p>
        <p> The Digital Humanities Quarterly Special Issue on AudioVisual DH invites contributions
            that address digital humanities approaches to audio and/or visual data. DH scholars
            engaged in fields such as art history, history, film studies, media studies, musicology,
            oral history, and sound studies have long understood the historical and contemporary
            centrality of audio and/or visual (AV) to knowledge production. The issue will
            demonstrate how inquiry into AV materials is shaping DH and how DH is reshaping AV
            scholarship. It is guided by three questions: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are digital and computational approaches to sound, images, and time-based
                media?</li>
            <li>How do these methods and approaches produce new knowledge and shift scholarship in a
                particular scholarly domain?</li>
            <li>What are the challenges and possible futures for AV in DH?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We invite multimedia articles as well as written articles (short articles between 1,500 -
            3,000 and long articles between 3,000 - 8,000 words), reviews, software, and case
            studies. Abstracts (500 words with a short bibliography) are due September 20th, 2019. Full
            contribution will be due November 30th, 2019. Questions and abstract submissions should be
            sent to <a href="mailto:AVinDHSpecialIssue@gmail.com"
            >AVinDHSpecialIssue@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>The Special Issue is endorsed by the ADHO AVinDH Special Interest Group. For more

        <h2>Call for Papers: Special Issue on Tools Criticism</h2>
        <p>Guest editors: Adriaan van der Weel and Peter Verhaar</p>
        
        
        <p>Scholarly research increasingly relies on digital tools which can create and analyse
            data. In evaluating the results emerging from scholarly work based on tools, it is
            important to recognise that tools have typically been developed for a particular
            scholarly purpose and/or within a particular methodological framework. Human software
            engineers consciously or unconsciously take decisions on the types of results that can
            be produced by tools, and as research instruments they therefore almost inevitably
            introduce a certain theoretical, practical or methodological bias. Tools criticism
            assumes that all scholarly resources are artefacts that implicitly express an argument,
            about methodological issues, about the outcomes desired, or about the social or
            political contexts in which the tool may be applied. Research in tools criticism aims to
            recognize such bias, to give an explicit expression to the various assumptions on which
            software tools are based, and to evaluate the potential impact of these assumption on
            research outcomes. </p>
        <p> In recent decades, the number of publicly available digital research tools has
            proliferated. Tools criticism stimulates a greater awareness of the implications of the
            use of particular tools, enabling scholars, for example, to make a reasoned choice.
            Tools criticism can also be relevant for scholars actively involved in the development
            of research instruments, because it draws attention to the inevitable theoretical,
            practical or methodological bias involved in the process. By examining and analysing the
            scholarly work necessary for tool development, tools criticism may also help scholars to
            receive academic recognition for this type of work, which is more than merely practical.
             </p>
        <p> The Special Issue for Digital Humanities Quarterly about Tools Criticism aims to clarify
            the goals and the methodology of Tools criticism in general as well as to illustrate how
            tools criticism may illuminate the bias introduced by digital research instruments. The
            editors invite contributions on the following five aspects of tools criticism.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rationale of tools criticism: </strong> Why do we need tools criticism? Is
                it possible and desirable to trace the social or political implications of tools?
                What are or should be the aims of tools criticism? How may digital humanities
                research benefit from tools criticism?</li>
            <li><strong>Data criticism: </strong> What does data criticism entail? How does it
                differ from tools criticism? What are or should be the aims of data criticism?</li>
            
            <li><strong>Methodologies in tools criticism: </strong> Is it possible to evaluate the
                degree to which tools affect the outcomes of scholarly research? Can the bias that
                is introduced by tools be demonstrated or even quantified? Assuming that tools
                mostly make implicit statements, is it possible to make these statements explicit?
                Which methods can we use to make these statements explicit? </li>
            <li><strong>Responsibility: </strong> What type of skills are necessary to critique data
                and tools? Is it necessary to be proficient in programming and in statistics? Does
                tools criticism demand an understanding of the inner workings of the tools, or can a
                tool also be criticized if it is treated as a black box? Is it necessary for full
                open access to be provided to the code in which the logic of the tool is
                implemented?</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical implications: </strong> Can tools criticism lead to a fair and
                impartial comparison of tools? What are the practical implications of tools
                criticism? If it is found that a tool displays a heavy bias, for instance, should a
                use of this tool be discouraged?   </li>

        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p><strong>Invisible Work in the Digital Humanities</strong><br /> Special Issue of Digital
            Humanities Quarterly (2018)</p>
        <p>Guest editors: Tarez Samra Graban, Paul F. Marty, Allen Romano, and Micah
            Vandegrift<br /> Florida State University </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p> At a recent symposium at Florida State University, digital humanists, librarians, and
            technology specialists explored the challenges of diverging expectations, unequal labor,
            and invisible work in the digital humanities -- http://iwdh.cci.fsu.edu/. The symposium
            provided an opportunity for participants to address questions such as the following: In
            intellectual and economic climates that prioritize external over internal validation,
            how do we define and defend the value of the digital humanities work? Whom do our
            projects and conversations include and exclude? How can we make the invisible work of
            digital humanities workers more visible? and What is the epistemic potential for
            questioning agency, access, participation, and use in digital humanities projects? </p>
        <p>To further explore these questions, the symposium organizers are pleased to announce a
            special issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ) to be published in late 2018. For
            this special issue, we seek contributions that theorize, highlight, and illustrate the
            challenges facing researchers and practitioners in the digital humanities when their
            work is invisible to a wide range of audiences and stakeholders. Questions to be
            addressed in this issue include, but are not limited to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the nature of invisible work in the digital humanities, to whom is this work
                invisible, and why might they not see it? </li>
            <li>What problems arise when invisible work in the digital humanities remains invisible,
                and how can we address those problems? </li>
            <li>To whom should we strive to make invisible work in the digital humanities visible,
                and why should we focus our efforts on those entities or individuals? </li>
            <li>Conversely, should "visibility" be an unquestioned value in the digital humanities,
                within or without of the academic institution, or is there an inherent value to work
                being invisible? </li>
            <li>How might we write a counter-narrative to the kinds of external validation that
                often drive (and often kill) most digital humanities initiatives? What would that
                counter-narrative look like? </li>
            <li>How might we argue for making invisible work in the digital humanities more visible
                internally (to ourselves) rather than externally (to outside observers), and what
                might the consequences of such a decision be? </li>
            <li>How can a focus on the internal or external validation of invisible work in the
                digital humanities heighten the unique methodologies of practitioners in certain
                disciplines, or bring their fields' critical questions into deeper relief? </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
        <p> For this special issue, we seek contributions of two principal types: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Article-length pieces describing original research (~8000 words in length); and </li>
            <li>Substantive, provocative, opinion-driven short essays (~1500 words in length). </li>
        </ul>
        <p> If you wish, you may submit an optional abstract for feedback from the editors by
            emailing your abstract (max. 500 words) to Tarez Samra Graban (tgraban@fsu.edu) by June
            1, 2017. </p>
        <p> Please follow Digital Humanities Quarterly's guidelines for preparation, content,
            formatting, and submission: http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/submissions/. All
            submissions should be marked as intended for the special issue on "Invisible Work in the

        <h2 id="infovis">DHQ Special Issue: Creative Pedagogical Approaches in Information
            Design</h2>
        <h3>9 June 2016; extended submission deadline 15 November 2016</h3>
        <p>Digital Humanities Quarterly invites submissions for a special issue on creative
            pedagogical approaches in the instruction of information visualization. Contributions
            are invited on methodologies, tools, and resources that practitioners have used to teach
            any facet of information visualization, which may include (but is not limited to) best
            practices in design, the use of specific tools, or data literacy. These approaches may
            include any resources, workshops, activities, or other materials that translate
            principles of information visualization both widely across as well as within specific
            disciplines, cultures of scholarship, and technical backgrounds. Alternatively,
            contributions may be submitted about theoretical and philosophical perspectives on
            information visualization that inform the ways in which visualization is taught, where
            “teaching” may encompass engagement with audiences at any level of academe (e.g.,
            students, faculty, administrators, or staff). </p>
        <p> Following guidelines provided by DHQ, submissions may include research articles, case
            studies, opinion pieces, or reviews, such as ones written about digital materials that
            have been used in teaching information visualization. Individuals who wish to submit
            pieces that are more experimental in form beyond the DHQ guidelines above should contact
            the editor (below) in advance to discuss feasibility and other options for execution. </p>
        <p> The deadline for submitting pieces is October 1, 2016. Full submissions should follow
            the author guidelines provided by DHQ and should be 10 - 20 pages in length, with the
            possibility of longer pieces approved in exceptional instances. (For more details about
            DHQ submission guidelines, please refer to the <a href="index.html">DHQ submission
                guidelines</a>. Please send all completed submissions to the guest editor of this
            issue, Steven Braun (s.braun@neu.edu), with the subject line "DHQ Special Issue
            Infovis." Please submit any questions or concerns about submissions to this address as
            well. </p>
        <p> Submissions will undergo anonymous peer review through standard DHQ review processes,
            and the editor(s) will work with submission authors to ensure that final submissions
            follow appropriate guidelines for publication in DHQ. </p>
