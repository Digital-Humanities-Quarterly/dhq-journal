                Guidelines</a></p>
        <p>All formatting and presentational details will be governed by the DHQ publication
            stylesheets and are not typically under the control of the author. The formatting of
            non-XML submissions should be internally consistent, to allow for ease of encoding.
            However, if your submission contains idiosyncratic formatting which is textually
            significant, please indicate this in your submission, and we will be happy to discuss it
            with you.</p>
        <p>If you would like to prepare your submission in XML using the DHQ schema (a TEI customization), please use the 
            <a href="dhq_author_template.xml">DHQ author template</a>. The <a
                href="http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/common/schema/DHQauthor-TEI.rng">DHQ schema</a> and <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/common/schema/DHQauthor-TEI.xml">ODD file</a> are also available.
            </p>
        <h2>Spelling</h2>
        <p>Use the system which you are most accustomed to using, but be consistent.</p>
        <h2>Minutiae</h2>
        <p>Initials should be followed by a full point and a space, e.g. E. M. Forster, W. H. Auden.</p>
        <p>&amp; should be written out as 'and'.</p>
        <p>Use a % sign for 5%, 25%, etc.</p>
        <p>No apostrophe in 1920s, 1950s, etc.</p>
        <p>Decimal point should be on the line: 5.2, 3.9, etc.</p>
        <p>Common abbreviations such as et al., viz., and similar should not be italicized.</p>
        <p>Numbers below 100 and vaguely expressed numbers should be spelled out.</p>
        <p>Precise numbers, units of measurement, and numbers above 100 should be in figures.</p>
        <p>Abbreviations should be spelled out the first time they are used.</p>
        <h2>Cross-references</h2>
        <p>Cross-references in the text should be represented as follows, using capitalized names
            written in full:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>see Section 2.5 </li>
            <li>see Appendix 1 </li>
            <li>see Figure 1 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do not abbreviate &quot;sec.&quot; for Section, &quot;fig.&quot; for
            Figure etc.</p>
        <p>Note: if you encode your paper using DHQ ML, such cross-references (with their formatting
            and numbering) can be auto-generated from tagging, just as we will do it (saving all of
            us work).</p>
        <p>We will support cross-referencing to the following: sections (div elements), figures,
            examples (which may have labels and captions) including code examples, tables,
            bibliographic listings, inset texts (xtext) and appendices. Cross-references will be
            normalized, but may reference by title or label as well as by number. Numbering will be
            auto-generated from implicit links in the document source, so try to get your
            cross-references right (because errors here may survive document conversion).</p>
        <h2>Figures</h2>
        <p>This includes illustrations, artwork, tables. We will accept figures in any of a number
            of web-ready formats, including PNG, JPG, GIF, PDF and SVG.</p>
        <p>Whenever possible we would like versions of figures and illustrations suitable for
            reproduction in print as well as on screen. A high-resolution version can always be
            downsampled, and provides better long-term possibilities. In special instances we may be
            able to accept illustrations in non-digital form, for digital conversion, but this must
            be individually arranged.</p>
        <p>Note that according to the DHQ Author document model, certain elements such as tables,
            figures (which can include graphs and graphics), and examples, can appear either in or
            out of line. Be as clear as possible indicating both the preferred location of one of
            these elements in the text, and whether they may &quot;float&quot;. (Note that
            editorial discretion with respect to such matters may be applied in any case.)</p>
        <p>Figures may have labels and descriptive captions, both of which should have the first
            word capitalized. References by head to a figure, table or example will be generated for
            you (e.g. &quot;Table 1: Proper nouns and syntactic organization&quot;), so feel
            free to use these constructs.</p>
        <p>Do not type a label or caption on a graphic, but include it in the main body of your
            text. To ensure correct matching up of tables/figures to captions, include a reference
            to the filename of the graphic in the text where the graphic should be included.</p>
        <h2>Mathematical expressions and formulas</h2>
        <p>DHQ represents mathematical expressions and formulas using TeX or MathML. Simple mathematical expressions and formulas can usually be converted automatically as part of our initial conversion routine using OxGarage. More complex formulas may cause problems for conversion. For the initial submission, it is fine to include formulas directly in the article. If the article is accepted, we will ask you to submit a finalized version in which the formulas are indicated in the text with a label (e.g. "formula 1"), and with the actual formulas submitted in TeX or valid MathML in a separate document, so that they can be inserted into the XML at the appropriate places.</p>
        <h2>Labeled examples</h2>
        <p>Like figures, examples (which may include code samples) may have labels and descriptive
            captions, both of which should have the first word capitalized. They may also be
            cross-referenced.</p>
        <p>Not all quotes or block quotes have to be formally presented as examples, however; this
            is an authorial decision.</p>
        <h2>Notes and references</h2>
        <p>Notes should be used only for comments, not for simple bibliographic citations. Notes
            should be numbered consecutively throughout the text, and their anchor point in the text
            should be clearly identifiable. If you are not submitting in DHQauthor format (or
            another DHQ ML format in consultation with us), all notes should be gathered together at
            the end of the article. (If you are submitting in DHQauthor format, you may encode notes
            inline, and they will be extracted by a stylesheet.)</p>
        <p>Bibliographic references should be made inline and the works cited should be listed in a
            section at the end of the article headed &quot;References&quot;. The list should
            be in alphabetical order by reference label (the citation string). Where an author has
            more than one publication, they should be arranged in chronological order, and if there
            is more than one publication within a year, they should be alphabetically ordered by
            title and labelled a, b, etc. (e.g. 1989a, 1989b). Note that reference labels may
            contain spaces (e.g. [Sperberg-McQueen 1995]). Single-author works precede co-authored
            works. Please follow the examples given below for bibliographic layout.</p>
        <p>If you are submitting in DHQauthor format, full bibliographic references may be encoded
            in line (where they are cited). These will be extracted by a stylesheet and collected
            into a References section automatically.</p>
        <p>Reference format: Please use the version of the Harvard system described below.
            References should be cited in the text using the author's name and year of publication,
            e.g. (Bloggs, 1990; Bloggs et al., 1991). (Again, authors using DHQ XML will find
            guidance on these issues in the DHQauthor Schema documentation.)</p>
