[anke] 13:02:18
Julia, if you want to go ahead and start, I'll keep admitting people

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:02:22
I think that is a great idea. So welcome, everybody, and thank you so much for coming.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:02:28
We're excited to have this opening series of orientation events for authors new to digital humanities, quarterly and perhaps new to digital humanities.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:02:39
And our hope is that this initial orientation will give people a lot of stuff to think about.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:02:45
Some guidance, some answers to common questions, and an opportunity to ask us questions, and we look forward to very much to seeing submissions and other things that might might come of this.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:02:58
So thank you very much for attending. I'm Julia Flanders. I'm the editor-in-chief of DHQ.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:03:04
And I'm joined here by Mara Oliva, who's at the University of Reading, one of our inaugural Peer Review editors and Anke Finger, who's at the University of Connecticut.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:03:13
The other inaugural Peer review editor, and I'll let them both say a little bit more about their background when they come up in the agenda, and I'll just say, about myself that I work at Northeastern University directing the Digital Scholarship Group, and my sort of digital humanities area of focus comes from areas of text markup, digital editing, at the moment community led archiving, things like that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:03:41
So that you have a sense of of what the answers we might give to questions are coming from. A quick note to say that the event is being recorded, and also closed captioned.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:03:54
So if you would like to see the closed captions, you can use the controls down at the bottom of your screen, and we will be putting the recording on Vimeo and linking it from the DHQ website so that it will be available to people who weren't able to attend the workshop, and we'll also be sharing the chat transcripts, (minus personal private messages), and also the closed caption transcript to 

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:04:18
help with accessibility. What we're going to cover today, I'll just give a little bit of a a tour.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:04:26
We're gonna give a general orientation in DHQ's practices, aiming particularly at people who are new to the field of digital humanities or new to the Journal.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:04:35
And we're going to try to cover as many of your questions as we possibly can.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:04:39
It will depend on on how many there are, but any questions that we can't get to during the Q and A portion we will follow up with email answers which we'll share with everybody.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:04:51
So please do put all your questions in the chat, and we will look forward to tackling those as quickly as we can.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:04:56
We're not going to try to offer a broader introduction to digital humanities as a field.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:05:03
There are lots of places that one can go to learn more about that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:05:09
One of them being the virtual pages of Digital Humanities Quarterly itself.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:05:12
But feel free to post questions about that in the chat as well, and perhaps we can crowdsource answers and it'll be great to know what people are interested in in any case.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:05:24
So I'm gonna start with a general orientation on DHQ mission and policies, things like that, and then Anke will provide some more detail on the kinds of materials and genres that DHQ

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:05:36
publishes, and Mara will talk about the kinds of editing and revision that may help turn a draft into a successful submission.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:05:45
So between us we hope to anticipate a lot of the questions that you may have, and we'll also be happy to follow up with those of you who may want to workshop specific ideas for papers, or get feedback on a submission.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:01
We will be extending the January submission deadline for people who attended this workshop.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:07
So if you have work in progress, and you want to get some feedback from us, and then you need a little time to process that feedback,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:14
you can submit articles in any case, up through February the first.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:19
But if you contact us and say you need a bit more time, and you don't want to wait until the April deadline, we can work with you on that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:25
So let us know. So to to start things off speaking about DHQ's mission and scope and general priorities.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:36
DHQ is the major open access journal of the Association of Computers in the Humanities and the lliance of Digital Humanities

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:45
Organizations. So they jointly publish the the journal, and as a public facing journal which was founded really at the point of inception for the field of digital humanities,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:06:58
DHQ Addresses a very wide audience, and it really, it's fundamental to its mission,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:07:05
is the idea that it is a public facing open access journal that anybody can read.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:07:09
And so it has a responsibility to represent the field of digital humanities in a way that speaks not only to those working directly in the field, but also to people in adjacent fields of humanities, computational social science.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:07:26
You name it, and also it has a responsibility to address people coming with widely varying degrees of digital expertise and familiarity with the field.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:07:39
So we seek really to create a kind of meeting place where authors from different subfields, and different regions of the digital humanities world can encounter each other's work, and our goal really is to encourage people to learn from adjacent ideas and to offer their work towards adjacent

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:08:02
readerships, rather than becoming more and more narrowly specialized in the ways that we approach our research on our authoring.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:08:09
So our editorial policies, following from that mission, focus on mutual legibility and on teaching each other.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:08:20
We ask all authors to explain and contextualize their work in a way that is really accessible to what I'm going to call the motivated non-specialist:

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:08:30
somebody who's willing to learn, willing to think, willing to look things up, but needs to be given the tools and the hooks for doing that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:08:41
And finally, because digital methods are now so widely and so routinely used across the traditional humanities. Excuse me.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:08:52
Digital Humanities Quarterly does not really prioritize artists that are describing this kind of routine

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:09:00
use, you know a similar application of an existing tool to an existing text or or body of work, and we try instead to focus on articles that offer new or critical perspectives on digital tools and methods, or that propose innovative approaches, or that create bridges between different areas so articles

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:09:25
that are more what we might think of as humanities research done digitally, we really encourage authors to submit those to the disciplinary journals, because that's where a lot of the readership for that

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:09:40
material is most vibrant. I'm gonna when I'm done I will drop some links into the chat so that you have links to things like that

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:09:48
submissions page and various other policies that will be helpful in contextualizing these notes.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:09:54
So a few words on our peer review process. So to start off, our peer review process is very much, very similar to that of many other journals, including many traditional journals, traditional in in quotation marks, let's say. All articles are first reviewed internally to determine their

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:10:14
suitability for the journal, do they meet the criteria that I mentioned above, and articles that are declined at this stage will receive a detailed and constructive feedback letter from the editorial team, so that you have a sense of you know where you might offer the article elsewhere or

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:10:30
how you might alter it to to better meet DHQ's

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:10:35
scope. In our external review process for the articles that that get to that stage,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:10:41
we try to get 2 or ideally 3 reviews, and the process is blind.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:10:48
So authors are not aware of the identity of the reviewers but they're not double blind unless the author chooses to anonymize their work, and many authors do.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:10:57
But we do not anonymize the work ourselves.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:11:00
So, if you if you wanted to submit an article and have it be reviewed double blind, you're free to anonymize it yourself.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:11:05
We treat the Peer Review as really advisory rather than as an exercise in gatekeeping.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:11:13
The editorial team takes the peer reviews very seriously into account when deciding whether to accept or decline the submission, and we get perspectives from both specialists and non-specialists as much as possible, and we draw on the peer reviews to provide feedback to authors on

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:11:29
how to improve the article, and again, from both a perspective of deep expertise, and also from the perspective of a more general reader who might need more contextualization or more glossing of terms,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:11:43
things like that, the most common outcome is really some form of "please revise" and all submissions will receive detailed and constructive feedback letter from the editorial team as well as comments from the peer reviewers with the goal of helping everyone improve their work.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:00
You know, taking it to that next increment. The most common revisions needed honestly are, contextualize your argument, cite prior work, explain its relevance, explain your terms.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:12
Don't write for specialists. Don't write for people who are only working in your field.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:18
Explain how others could use or build on your work, explained how,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:23
explain what the next steps might be, and I think Anke and Mara will both have more to say on that subject in a moment.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:29
I'll wrap up with just a few notes just briefly on a few issues that came up in the questions people asked with.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:39
With the sign up sheet. First of all, DHQ

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:42
is fully open access, so all articles are published under a Creative Commons license.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:12:47
No fees are charged to authors or to readers at any time, and that is largely owing to the generous support that we receive from our publishers, and also from Northeastern University and from Indiana University, and from the universities that our editors are are located

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:03
at. DHQ uses the text encoding initiative guidelines as the underlying data format.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:10
And our website is published using open source Xml tools and maintained in Github.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:16
And we are working on building mentoring more and more strongly into our submission and review process.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:23
So if you're interested in joining our mentoring team, please email us, and I will drop the email on link in the chat.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:30
And if you're interested in receiving mentoring, please, email us, same email address.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:36
And finally, we're working on expanding our handling of languages other than English. We already publish translations in any language alongside an English language submission.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:47
But we're limited in our ability to review in languages other than English.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:13:52
So if you are interested in joining our peer review team and can review in languages other than English, we would love to hear from you. So please contact us, and with that I will hand it off to Anke

[anke] 13:14:04
Thank you so much, Julia, and thank you, everybody for joining us today.

[anke] 13:14:09
Good morning, good afternoon good evening. Wherever it is you are.

[anke] 13:14:13
My name is Anke Finger. I'm a professor of German media studies and comparative literature at the University of Connecticut, and my DH

[anke] 13:14:22
specific work is concerned with visualization and multimodalities.

[anke] 13:14:27
I'm very interested in navigating different formats of media intermediality, and also I'm very interested in integrating particular dh processes into programs both undergraduate and graduate.

[anke] 13:14:43
I created a DH certificate for University of Connecticut, for example, and an entire program, and also in merging DH with media studies.

[anke] 13:14:53
I think that is an interface that is still under studied and sort of looking at DH as another interface for media studies

[anke] 13:15:03
research, medialities and so forth. In this particular instance, I'm going to talk about the particular genres that DHQ

[anke] 13:15:14
publishes and that we're looking for, and the qualities we seek in those particular genres. I'll be short because I want to give Mara a little bit more time,

[anke] 13:15:24
who was tuned out by the weather yesterday in the connection, and we'll just refer to the majority of genres

[anke] 13:15:31
we're interested in, and in terms of also serving a wide readership that Julia already talked about,

[anke] 13:15:40
genres that are widely legible. We have an audience around the world, and we also want to make sure that these genres communicate the DH research that is cutting edge critical and really pushes the field forward.

[anke] 13:15:57
So when we talk about wide legibility, we took about different stylistics of English

[anke] 13:16:03
for example, we talk about an increasing amount of literature in translation,

[anke] 13:16:08
sorry--articles in translation, and also articles and non English languages, that, I think, is very important, and we also very much want to emphasize that the any, any genre should make an argument relevant to the DHQ

[anke] 13:16:24
readers we've built over the last 15 years, so that we really cater to an engaged audience that may or may not be conversant already in a different DH terminologies,

[anke] 13:16:42
methodologies, approaches, may be familiar with the canon of theory or not.

[anke] 13:16:48
So we really want to reach out to everyone and invite and be open.

[anke] 13:16:51
And for those who are experts among you, please make sure that whatever corner you are an expert in,

[anke] 13:16:58
for example, please explain what that expertise is, so that those who may not be familiar with that particular corner of the age that that you know very well that they have access to that. The work is to be engaged with Dh research with pedagogy, with theorization or with critical practice, so we can talk

[anke] 13:17:19
about what that may be in your particular case, and I already refer to the writing style because we do want to accommodate a range of stylistic approaches, because we're very aware that around the world they're different stylistics of professionalization in the various disciplines that you may find yourself in.

[anke] 13:17:40
With regard to specific genres, we publish articles.

[anke] 13:17:46
We publish case studies, we publish field reports, and we also are looking forward to receiving reviews both on books and on tools.

[anke] 13:17:55
We are discontinuing the Issues section and Julia will talk a little bit more about that.

[anke] 13:18:02
If you have particular questions about the issues tool, the issues genre when it comes to the case, studies into the field, reports the emphasis, is on criticality and analysis and commercial, so we don't look for descriptive case studies,

[anke] 13:18:20
where you walk us through what happened, when, to whom, and what the outcome was. We really would like to have a critical approach to the kinds of case studies you're presenting so that again, you're pushing the envelope, you're bringing in new viewpoints whether they're cultural,

[anke] 13:18:40
technical, disciplinary, or interdisciplinary, and in the field report I want to emphasize that they are of a particular locale or circumstances, or cultural practice.

[anke] 13:18:54
So field report is not necessarily an ethnographic concept in the old fashioned sense, but it may really open up different viewpoints and give us bridges to different practices,

[anke] 13:19:08
theorizations, approaches of DH being done in different corners of the world and in areas that the global north or the English-speaking colleagues are not necessarily familiar with.

[anke] 13:19:23
So it really is an invitation to open up the worldwide practice,

[anke] 13:19:28
theorization and criticality of Dh as a research field.

[anke] 13:19:33
I'm going to close with a few notes on multimodality and tech options.

[anke] 13:19:39
Some of you may work beyond script and and linear

[anke] 13:19:43
language. So there is of course feasibility of audio, video, embedding of maps and visualizations that are hosted elsewhere.

[anke] 13:19:54
For example, we also have worked with authors on more specialized kinds of multimodalities.

[anke] 13:20:00
For instance, embedding specialized code provided by you,

[anke] 13:20:04
the author. That's an option. We're always happy to consider interesting possibilities.

[anke] 13:20:09
But we're limited by our own available tech efforts.

[anke] 13:20:13
So please, if there's something outside of the usual tech supports or tech linkages, just talk to us and let us know what specifically. We'll support your argument.

[anke] 13:20:26
We'll bolster your pushing the envelope in the field so that we can hopefully make that possible.

[anke] 13:20:33
And we also want to emphasize that we place a high value on sustainability and longevity.

[anke] 13:20:39
So all experimental formats need to have adorable fallback option, because obviously, DHQ

[anke] 13:20:47
has been in operation since the mid 2000's, and we wanna keep it

[anke] 13:20:51
that way, but hopefully your work will also be legible to readers 5 years down the road.

[anke] 13:20:57
We don't want things, to turn into web rot, or worse.

[anke] 13:21:00
Thank you very much, and I'll hand it on to Mara.

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:05
Thank you so much. Good evening. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody.

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:10
It's so lovely to see so many people from

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:11
all over the world. It's it's dark for me.

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:15
It's evening it's been back for a few hours, actually in the UK.

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:19
My name is Mara Oliva, and I'm an associate professor in US

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:23
History at the University of Reading in in the Uk. I'm by training a

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:30
historian converted to digital humanist. My interest in digital humanities very much are what I use in my research in my historical research and mainly focus on a different types of visualizations.

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:46
GIS, Mapping, Social network analysis, and so on.

[Mara Oliva] 13:21:53
Now, my job today is to talk you through some of our of the key points in order to turn your draft,

[Mara Oliva] 13:22:05
your work in progress into a successful DHQ. Submission.

[Mara Oliva] 13:22:09
Now, the short version of these is 4 key points, one to engage with existing literature to make clear what your original your original contribution to this literature is.

[Mara Oliva] 13:22:21
3: include an argument. 4: define your terms for a broad digital humanities audience.

[Mara Oliva] 13:22:29
And now I'm going to elaborate on these.

[Mara Oliva] 13:22:31
Now, what do we mean by engaging with the existing literature? What we would like to see is for you to discuss some works written by other colleagues, and  scholars and practitioners in the field engaged with this work, and with this scholarship and tell us

[Mara Oliva] 13:22:54
how your work relates to these existing debates.

[Mara Oliva] 13:23:00
More importantly, tell us what original contribution you're making to these debates.

[Mara Oliva] 13:23:05
How are you pushing the boundaries? Are you bringing something new to the table? Are you

[Mara Oliva] 13:23:10
maybe offering a new in interpretation to an old concept or an old

[Mara Oliva] 13:23:17
theory? Do refer, contextualize your work and do refer to a prior work, existing work, even in neighboring fields, and how these speak to your work, and how your work speaks to them.

[Mara Oliva] 13:23:37
Point 2: make clear what your original contribution is to to the field is is essential as I said, and it was mentioned by Julia and Anke.

[Mara Oliva] 13:23:53
We're not looking for, you know, "Look how I've implemented this

[Mara Oliva] 13:23:59
well established DH tool"-- we're looking for breaking the boundaries and and and push the debates and push new creative thinking and and analysis.

[Mara Oliva] 13:24:13
So it is key also to include point 3: an argument.

[Mara Oliva] 13:24:19
So do make an argument. We're not looking for for narratives.

[Mara Oliva] 13:24:24
We're looking for critical thinking and and analysis. At the same time, we ask you to juggle your expertise and your knowledge with a language that is accessible to all.

[Mara Oliva] 13:24:43
And I always like Julia's definition of the motivated

[Mara Oliva] 13:24:45
non expert, I think it's perfect: make it accessible, make it inclusive.

[Mara Oliva] 13:24:52
So the other people who want to learn are not put off, because I think Oh, my God, I'm never going to understand this, but actually are invited in a new conversation, and can make their own contribution to this conversation.

[Mara Oliva] 13:25:10
I think it's very clear from what Julia and Anke said, that we care a lot about

[Mara Oliva] 13:25:13
the core mission of the journal to make DH

[Mara Oliva] 13:25:17
as accessible as possible from from all points of view.

[Mara Oliva] 13:25:22
So these are the, you know, the key pearls of wisdom

[Mara Oliva] 13:25:29
you need to to include

[Mara Oliva] 13:25:33
if you want to, as you're working on your draft for a journal article, for a manuscript. You might have other pieces of work that you're thinking of turning into a journal article, for example, a dissertation chapter, and that's absolutely

[Mara Oliva] 13:25:54
great. What we are looking for however is for this chapter to be a standalone piece. In your desertation

[Mara Oliva] 13:26:03
you're probably have several threads that are introduced in the introduction of your dissertation, and then follow through in in the core chapters, and then conclusion.

[Mara Oliva] 13:26:14
So you need to, you know. Use your editing skill to bring all these threads together in a standalone independent piece

[Mara Oliva] 13:26:26
that, as I mentioned earlier, is engaged with the existing literature, and makes an original contribution to the field.

[Mara Oliva] 13:26:34
So you see, for example, in history, usually the discussion of the existing literature is all placed in the introduction, so we'll need to extract this from your introduction and includ it in your manuscript, together with the original

[Mara Oliva] 13:26:49
aspect accounts, maybe from from the chapter, and make one coherent manuscript.

[Mara Oliva] 13:26:55
Very similar advice for a conference paper: Conference papers are valuable tools to get feedback,

[Mara Oliva] 13:27:06
brainstorming, try new ideas with colleagues, but they're not a finished product.

[Mara Oliva] 13:27:10
So we will ask you to, first of all, include the the, the feedback that you receive from colleagues at a at the conference where you presented, but then also to expand on on your conference paper, and include the 4 points I mentioned, again: a discussion on the literature, clear contribution.

[Mara Oliva] 13:27:31
your clear contribution to the field and argument, and and define your terms for wide legibility.

[Mara Oliva] 13:27:37
Now in the past we've also received a grant proposals, field reports and and project reports, and we do welcome these because they are a good way to keep the conversation going, to look at issues in different ways and and different angles.

[Mara Oliva] 13:27:56
It allows you to think differently about your research rather than the traditional article

[Mara Oliva] 13:28:03
manuscript. However, what we're not looking for is a list of objectives, and whether you are, you know, looking at fulfilling these objectives in a grant proposal, proposal, or whether you've already achieved these objectives in your final report. Again, we're

[Mara Oliva] 13:28:26
not looking for a narrative. We're not looking for a descriptive documents.

[Mara Oliva] 13:28:30
If you want to discuss, you know, include material from your grant proposal or project report,

[Mara Oliva] 13:28:36
this needs to be situated in relation to the scholarship, and that your grant proposal is addressing needs to have an argument needs to have a meaningful discussion and contribution to the field and aspect of DH you are you're

[Mara Oliva] 13:28:57
touching on. We've also received in the past case studies, especially about teaching experiences and pedagogy and and different ways of teaching, using DH in the classroom. We very much welcome

[Mara Oliva] 13:29:16
these, but again, we're not looking for a narrative.

[Mara Oliva] 13:29:22
So a document, a manuscript that tells a I did the class answer very positively, and so we all from now onwards, we're all gonna use

[Mara Oliva] 13:29:35
this wonderful DH tool is not sorry, put in very basic terms, is not what we're looking for.

[Mara Oliva] 13:29:41
We're not looking for descriptions of what happened in class, but we're looking for a reflection, for a critical thinking and analysis of how your pedagogy might have facilitated or not, an understanding of the certain DH concepts theories or or tools. And it

[Mara Oliva] 13:30:03
doesn't always have to be a positive case study. I know it.

[Mara Oliva] 13:30:07
It could also be a negative experience. You know, it didn't work, and so we share it for the sake of good practice, and also because, frankly, I have this personal mission:

[Mara Oliva] 13:30:19
not everything is perfect in academia. We should share our failures to, because we're human beings.

[Mara Oliva] 13:30:26
Now as as Anke, mentioned as Julia and this is part of our developing a mentoring program we're here to support with the writing and with the English, especially, we're not looking--

[Mara Oliva] 13:30:45
we're looking for an international English, an English that is understandable to

[Mara Oliva] 13:30:51
all, so don't put yourself under unnecessary pressure that you wanna achieve,

[Mara Oliva] 13:30:57
you know, some kind of perfect idiomatic English. This is not what we're looking for.

[Mara Oliva] 13:31:02
We're looking at our many types of English around the world.

[Mara Oliva] 13:31:06
And we're looking for is let's call it an international English that is legible.

[Mara Oliva] 13:31:11
and easy to access to to everybody. And and we're here to help these as we with these, as we develop our mentoring program. I think I covered everything.

[Mara Oliva] 13:31:24
So we can open up for a discussion. Thank you so much.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:31:28
Absolutely. Thank you so much. Yeah.

[anke] 13:31:32
Yeah, please, feel free to just ask. I think we're 37 minus 3.

[anke] 13:31:42
You can open up and ask or put your questions in the chat.

[anke] 13:31:44
We will try and follow through consecutively.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:31:50
And while we give people a few minutes to collect their thoughts and write their questions, there were some interesting questions that came up in the the sign up sheet, which we might just pick up one or 2 of. One that I particularly took note of was the question about making arguments that bound the technical and the humanistic

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:32:12
and how to handle that, and what kind, what kind of relative balance is is appropriate.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:32:18
And I wonder Anke, I know that you've thought a lot about this and it it falls

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:32:22
maybe into your sort of genre rubric. I wonder if you might want to try picking that one up.

[anke] 13:32:27
The the technical versus the humanities, or in combination

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:32:30
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure we all 3 have have some thoughts to contribute. But if you'd like to start

[anke] 13:32:34
Yeah, well, well, to me it's very much a process.

[anke] 13:32:38
I think it starts. And I remind students of that as well as faculty as well as colleagues as well as myself.

[anke] 13:32:46
It starts with the research question. I often get the question, well, do I need to learn?

[anke] 13:32:51
learn R, or any kind of tool, Tableau and so forth, and the technicalities, of course, skill sets as well as epistemologies, because they're built.

[anke] 13:33:06
they're humanly constructed. And there's thinking in that.

[anke] 13:33:09
And there's failures in that, to pick up on on Mara's point.

[anke] 13:33:12
But we still need to combine that with our humanistic or or adjacent humanistic argument, whether you are in the social sciences, in the arts or or the traditional humanities field.

[anke] 13:33:23
So I think, going back to the core of your argument. What is it you're after?

[anke] 13:33:29
What are the epistemological, the covenant, the critical, the analytical, the social, focused questions that you are after really come first,

[anke] 13:33:42
and the technology, of course, is is not just adjacent to that, but interfacing, and interlaced with that.

[anke] 13:33:47
And it's your job, or your team's job to figure out how precisely that happens and how you want to engage with that, so that it really is a process within which you engage that, then hopefully, is built up by an argument and you contribute to the dialogue of knowledge creation in that

[anke] 13:34:12
particular field, or sub field or interdisciplinary interface, that you find yourself in.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:34:17
Yeah, that's a wonderful answer. There's a great question in the chat:

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:34:24
When would it make sense to write a case study versus a journal article?

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:34:27
And I think that's a really interesting question. We often get submissions that are offered as journal articles which we then recommend might be better as a case study, and I think for me at least, the boundary

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:34:43
there has to do with whether you're focusing whether you're focusing primarily on how a thing was done, how a thing was made, a particular project or a particular course, or a particular research scenario,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:35:02
let's say, and where the focus is really on that one instance. Whereas the article version of the narrative, would, as Mara suggested, would provide much more in terms of context, much more in terms of theorization, much more in terms of comparing instances, so a case study might legitimately

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:35:27
say, we're gonna tell you how we built this digital archive.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:35:31
And we will, you know, provide critical reflection on that process.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:35:35
There might be things we can compare it to, but our focus is really on that one, whereas the article version might say, there's a big issue in digital Archiving that we're interested in exploring here.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:35:45
And here are the the scholars who have written about this, and we can learn from this project and we can learn from this other project. Any time

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:35:53
you're really focused on one thing, particularly if it's something you did, that starts to feel a bit more like a case study.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:36:00
But the handling of it, I think also can tip the balance in one way or another.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:36:05
Mara and Anke, do you have intuitions to add to that?

[Mara Oliva] 13:36:07
Yeah, I wouldn't I wanted to add also, because it is a big question also say I'm working on a dh project now.

[Mara Oliva] 13:36:17
So Elizabeth, sorry I'm not trying to tell you how to do your work, but one thought is, if if you're a leaning towards the case study, and you want to write a report on the project you're working on from personal experience, I will say that a case study you should start

[Mara Oliva] 13:36:36
documenting, now, as you're working on it, rather than leaving it to the end.

[Mara Oliva] 13:36:43
You know it's like a be when you're trying to work on in your research impact.

[Mara Oliva] 13:36:47
And then leaving it on the end. If you're developing a case study, it will make your life easier to, you know

[Mara Oliva] 13:36:54
reflect and record and and start drafting, now, whereas you know, a journal article, maybe you do more reading, more thinking, more more research before you write a manuscript.

[Mara Oliva] 13:37:06
But a case study: everything in terms of time, management, and practicalities,

[Mara Oliva] 13:37:11
I always find that if you work, you know, if you record it as you go on, it will make your life easier at the end to bring the document together.

[anke] 13:37:21
Yeah, I would definitely support that. I think I think you will know best when you have a case study.

[anke] 13:37:29
Because are you already finding questions? Are you coming up with questions?

[anke] 13:37:34
Are you stomping into blind spots?

[anke] 13:37:39
Are you wondering why hasn't this been done where you are realizing what I'm doing here is already posing a lot of questions that I can make a case study before it might be turned into a journal article.

[anke] 13:37:53
So you know best, but I can only emphasize the documentation of really the very earliest brainstorms that you have with the team or by yourself, because 2 years down the road you'll have forgotten everything if you don't document it

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:38:09
There's another great question in the chat about the discontinuation of the Issues section which I would love to pick up on following an Uncas prompt and then also asking whether there are any other kinds of submission types that didn't work which is a fascinating question so on

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:38:27
the issues. First, the issues in Digital Humanities Section was originally envisioned as a kind of space for opinion

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:38:35
pieces, and OP-eds, and we found that it was very difficult to arrive at a satisfactory set of standards for what would constitute a good issues, paper and it made us very uncomfortable for DHQ

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:38:54
to serve as a kind of platform for somebody who had a strong opinion about something without providing a context for response.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:03
And we didn't have an editor editorial role to manage that process.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:10
So we kind of, you know it. It has. It has been around for a while.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:15
We have published a few, particularly for special issues where the special issue editors often have pieces which for one reason or another, feel more like issues papers than like articles.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:26
But recently, we've decided 2 things. One is we are going to discontinue the issues

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:31
section because it just isn't working. But we are instead going to explore a more dialogic version of that idea which will not be sent through the regular DHQ

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:47
peer review and encoding process which involves a lot of work,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:51
a lot of overhead, but are instead thinking about. And this is very early.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:39:55
So this is, this is not been field tested or agreed upon.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:00
It's just a kind of an initial discussion in some meetings so far, but the idea is that we would host in Github clusters of pieces.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:09
You know the other words we would invite authors or groups of authors to propose something like a round table or position topic which then could have a moment of circulation like a call for participation, and people could contribute to it.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:30
We need to think about, you know how selection would happen, and that kind of thing.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:35
But the ideas that they would be contributed in Markdown from the authors themselves.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:41
So the effort of production would be very small, and as a result the timeliness would be much greater.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:49
We'd be able to turn them around much more quickly, because we wouldn't be expecting that they have to join the kind of the big corpus of articles that DHQ

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:56
publishes. So anyway, that's a an initial idea.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:40:59
We'll see how it goes. If anyone here has a kind of thumbs up or thumbs down, or suggestions, we'd love to hear them, and then, as far as submission types that didn't work one that I think we've had a lot of difficulty with but that also has

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:41:15
not really materialized is the idea of an article that has a profoundly different rhetoric from what you might think of as the standard article.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:41:29
The standard scholarly article we, when we founded the journal we first imagined that there might be lots of people who want to experiment rhetorically, and we were actually worried that the TEI schema wouldn't accommodate those kinds of experiments and we thought all sorts of

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:41:44
big ideas about how we might modify, and, you know, make things more flexible.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:41:50
We talked about like a crayon box schema, where you kind of mix and match things, and that scenario never materialized; the closest

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:41:56
we've come is, for example, the materials in the comics as scholarship special issue.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:42:02
But there the the articles were expressed as comics, and so they had their own quite consistent generic expectations.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:42:15
In other words, they weren't inventing something new.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:42:16
They were hybridizing. So so, yeah, by and large it it seems that researchers in digital humanities want to write things that are recognizable as journal articles, and they may interpret that genre very differently.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:42:32
But but by and large there's been a fair amount of convergence

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:42:38
Other questions, and it's not considered on. Please feel free to unmute and ask your question directly, or if there's just something you'd like to hear more about, we are, we are at your disposal.

[anke] 13:42:52
If you have a project that you're working on currently and just wanna do a micro workshop here or a Nano workshop

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:43:01
Yeah, we were also very interested to see that some of the participants indicated they were here, partly because they're supporting faculty in digital humanities and would like to be able to speak to the questions that those faculty might have so if there are things you anticipate your colleagues might

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:43:19
want to know that we could talk more about by all means.

[Lisa Rhody] 13:43:28
Can I jump in and ask a quick question? So Hi!

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:43:30
Please.

[Lisa Rhody] 13:43:31
I'm Lisa Rhody from CUNY 

[Lisa Rhody] 13:43:33
Graduate Center. I'm wondering, since the journal is sort of TEI encoded, and it has this sort of Xml markup scheme.

[Lisa Rhody] 13:43:43
Are there things that authors should keep in mind or try to lean into, given the affordances of the way in which the journal is produced?

[Lisa Rhody] 13:43:52
Maybe things that people don't typically do. But you would love to see something like that

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:43:57
Yes, and thank you for asking the the biggest and this is gonna be.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:44:05
So this is just so dumb, practical, but one of the biggest pieces of time investment, of course, is the text encoding, and we use OxGarage, or rather TEIGarage as an initial conversion step, which takes things like word documents or RTF and converts them

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:44:22
to TEI, and then we come along afterwards and do some initial tidying up and and encoding and adding of details.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:44:29
The accuracy of that conversion process is enormously affected by the consistency of formatting, and also by the use of styles, formal styles in a tool like Microsoft word.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:44:43
So if you write an article, and your headings are you selected the text, and you applied italics, and then you made the text bigger, and maybe this one is 13 point, and maybe the one down below is 15 point,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:44:57
it just makes everything a lot harder. So if you know how to use Word styles, and you can use formal heading styles,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:45:04
thank you! And if you can be consistent in your formatting, it doesn't matter what specific formatting I know some journals have a very formal style sheet like you must use times, Roman, all caps for your level one headings.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:45:18
We don't we don't do that, but but if you can be consistent in the formatting, and be clear about the relationship between you know, major sections and then subsections so that we don't have to kind of figure out what's nested within what that is something

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:45:32
That. But the tei, you know, enables us to represent, but also right us to represent other than that.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:45:40
I think we try very much to not to let the schema drive authors writing.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:45:46
So we certainly we would be appalled if people were like editing themselves into a sort of Ti confirmity, because we we are still interested in the kinds of rhetorical experimentation that authors in digital humanities might engage in does that address. The spirit. Of your question. Lisa it's it's

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:46:05
A wonderful. It's a wonderful question.

[Lisa Rhody] 13:46:07
Absolutely.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:46:09
At some point we may provide a stronger authoring template for people who want to use it.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:46:17
If it enabled us to to really automate the the conversion process into TEI.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:46:22
But we haven't really explored that yet.

[anke] 13:46:36
Any other thoughts, suggestions?

[anke] 13:46:42
Don't be shy. We're very happy to entertain any ideas, including project thoughts that you have

[anke] 13:46:55
Is anybody working, for example, on a dissertation digital dissertation, that where you might extract an article or case study team work, any questions about teamwork collaboration

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:47:17
I think we were just so thorough. No further questions, or even imagine exactly

[Mara Oliva] 13:47:22
We stunned them into silence!

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:47:27
Oh! Here's a question: could you please elaborate a little more on the mentorship program?

[Mara Oliva] 13:47:29
Oh, yeah, well, I was about to say, you know, to say no one is a question I wanted to say.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:47:34
Absolutely absolutely. Who would like to go first--Anke, Mara?

[Mara Oliva] 13:47:44
A few words about the mentorship program, mostly to ask you guys for for your help, because we're just developing this.

[Mara Oliva] 13:47:54
We've been having lots of brainstorming sessions, making lots of progress.

[Mara Oliva] 13:47:57
But it's working working progress. So. Mmm, and also I mean, the mentoring program is to support you.

[Mara Oliva] 13:48:06
So we're very much welcome for first of all, any suggestion, specific request of things that you would like to see the the might help you.

[Mara Oliva] 13:48:16
I think it's fair to say that in developing our mentoring program we're looking for an AD hoc mentoring program, not just one template that will never suit everybody, because it's impossible.

[Mara Oliva] 13:48:27
So we very much welcome your specific request to so that we can help you.

[Mara Oliva] 13:48:34
Each individual, in, in in becoming a successful author for DHQ.

[Mara Oliva] 13:48:40
And any other DH-related publications or or issues, and as an as Julius, at the very beginning, we welcome your specific request.

[Mara Oliva] 13:48:52
So we also welcome anyone who wants to volunteer for for the mentoring program.

[Mara Oliva] 13:48:59
We all know that academia can be very demanding.

[Mara Oliva] 13:49:03
So we appreciate the people's time and generosity in in sharing their knowledge and expertise.

[anke] 13:49:10
Yeah, I, I just wanna follow up with responding to your training literary studies.

[Mara Oliva] 13:49:10
Okay. Mate.

[anke] 13:49:19
Traditional literary studies, and DH is something I plan to grow into actually (I hope I pronounce your name correctly).

[anke] 13:49:26
I've provided a link for the DH Debates in our Debates in Digital Humanities.

[anke] 13:49:32
That's a series of books that started in, I think.

[anke] 13:49:36
2016, and they really provide a wonderful introduction to the various approaches, ideas, tools, criticalities that are part and parcel of the age.

[anke] 13:49:51
There are a lot of literary scholars participating in that one who first comes to mind is Ellen Lou, for example, at the University of Santa Barbara.

[anke] 13:50:00
This is American-based, US-based, and he also has a wonderful link, a web page for tools in the age.

[anke] 13:50:10
I think it's called toy box, or dh toolbox, or something.

[anke] 13:50:14
I can send the link of that, too. But I think starting somewhere with Dh online to sort of see.

[anke] 13:50:22
Okay, what does it mean for literary studies? There's a lot of material online.

[anke] 13:50:26
And then you can see what people are doing, whether it's text mining, whether it's quantitative or qualitative.

[anke] 13:50:32
So there's a lot of a large playground to put it that way to explore.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:50:37
Yeah, I will also add, Yeah, I will also just add to what's been said, that there are mentoring resources for those eager to join the field in a broad sense.

[anke] 13:50:38
So it's it should be fun. Thank you.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:50:53
So the Association for Computers and the Humanities, for example, I believe still has a mentoring program, or a newcomers

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:50:59
welcome event at the conference. Things like that, where you can be in touch with with people in the field and learn more.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:51:07
DHQ's mentoring program is going to focus, I think in the first instance, on helping authors who are either new to the field or who would like help with the way that they're developing their argument, whether because of language issues or because of you know the prior training that they've had

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:51:33
but who would like to be able to work more on their paper with somebody who can provide some guidance rather than just getting the peer-review feedback, and then having to go away and figure out what to do. So we have we haven't launched the program yet,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:51:51
except that these workshops are, are the first step. But what we're hoping to do is recruit a team of mentors who would be willing to, you know, a few times a year be paired with an author or a prospective author, who would work with that author to help shape their argument, help them with language issues

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:52:13
if that's needed, and really give them some guidance and support.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:52:19
And I think, depending on the size of the team, you know, we might start with mentoring people whose articles have been accepted or accepted with revisions, but it would be wonderful if we had a enough mentors to also extend that work to prospective authors--in other words, authors who haven't yet

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:52:39
submitted their article, but they, you know, we can identify them as people whose work is in the right direction

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:52:46
but it just needs some, some support. So I think we'd also be very interested in hearing from you

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:52:54
about what kinds of mentoring would be helpful for someone in your situation, and hearing from others who may be at different stages of their professional development, about what kind of mentoring would be helpful to them.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:53:12
And you know we'll be trying to serve as many people as possible, probably with not a huge team.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:53:20
So any way that we can create resources that might be useful and share those via the DHQ website. That would be that would be very, very good, as well as having more sort of one on one.

[anke] 13:53:34
Yeah, I just think, sorry. I just linked resources that I put together as the inaugural director of DH and Media Studies at UConn, which includes all kinds of where to start,

[anke] 13:53:48
journals like DHQ and so forth.

[Mara Oliva] 13:53:53
Now I was gonna say, I'm loving the love

[Mara Oliva] 13:53:55
going around in the chat. It's very good that people are sharing resources.

[Mara Oliva] 13:54:02
It's absolutely great that you are forming in the Smi,

[Mara Oliva] 13:54:05
It's exactly what we're looking for, global resources for a global community.

[Mara Oliva] 13:54:12
So it's great to see your field view, as you say, it's a it's up absolutely great, and thank you all for sharing.

[Mara Oliva] 13:54:21
That's that's the spirit we're looking for.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:54:28
So we're coming up on the top of the hour.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:54:31
Are there any other questions that people have on their on their minds or things that we could, that we could address

[anke] 13:54:39
Any suggestions for a particular topics, because we plan to continue webinars under the auspices of fostering and and helping with peer review

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:55:03
And we see articles on DH pedagogy in the future.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:55:07
We. We have already, I mean, DH pedagogy is one of the major areas where we receive articles, and we do publish in that area.

[Mara Oliva] 13:55:12
Okay.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:55:16
And I think that it's likely to continue and to continue to increase.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:55:21
I know. I remember a memorable talk by, I think by Amanda LiCastro making the point that digital humanities, pedagogy was at that time an understudy and super important area, and I credit that talk to a certain extent with really giving a kind of on validation and 

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:55:43
stature to the field of digital humanities pedagogy, and DHQ

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:55:46
has really benefited from that. So the question about a game study special issue is a good opportunity for me to talk very briefly about how special issues happen.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:55:58
DHQ does not typically commission them, but they come to us as proposals.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:56:04
So we twice a year in January and in July we have deadlines for proposals for special issues.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:56:10
So if somebody wanted to put together a special issue on game studies, you know, we would be happy to receive that proposal and to and to weigh it.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:56:21
We can only accept a few special issue proposals each year just because they require a fair amount of extra overhead.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:56:29
So depending on how many other proposals are are submitted in each cohort,

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:56:35
we may be able to accept it or not, but it sounds like a wonderful idea, and I think that it would be a fantastic topic.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:56:41
So I would encourage, I would encourage you to submit a game study, special issue.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:56:46
Our next deadline for special issue proposals is January thirtieth, and after that would be July thirtieth, and we're happy to read drafts, provide feedback

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:57:05
And there's...the DHQ website has a whole page on special issue proposals.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:57:17
So I'll drop that link into the chat. At the moment this page is one of those pages that has a accumulated information over time, and as a result, it's kind of big and crufty.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:57:27
But one of my items on my to do list immediately to my right here on my desk is to refactor that page and make it clearer.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:57:34
So apologies and watch that space. But it does have all the information that you would need at least.

[anke] 13:57:46
Thank you so much for coming, and please again contact us with suggestions for webinars, for info sessions, for items that should be on the website so that we can help you in that process of being creative finding the arguments writing field reports articles and case studies.

So this is not a mystery, because it shouldn't.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:58:21
Alright. Well, with that I think we can wrap up.

[Julia Flanders (she/her/hers)] 13:58:24
Thank you all. Thank you, Anke and Mara very much, and we will look forward to

[Mara Oliva] 13:58:27
Thank you all

[anke] 13:58:27
Okay. Well, yeah, thank you all for coming. Happy weekend wherever you are, and we hope to see your name down the road
