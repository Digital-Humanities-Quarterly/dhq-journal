        <h1>Changes to Terms of Publication for DHQ</h1>
        
       <p>Over the past year, DHQ has been approached by indexing and aggregation services such as EBSCO, who would like to include DHQ among the journals they offer to their clients. Inclusion in such services means the following for DHQ and its authors:
</p>
<ol><li>DHQ articles would be indexed (including both metadata and full text) and the indexed results would be offered to readers at institutions subscribing to these services.
</li><li>
DHQ articles would be discoverable through integrated search mechanisms and portals offered by these services.
</li><li>
DHQ would receive a royalty based on the overall value contributed by DHQ content; we anticipate that this amount will be small, especially at first, since it is based in part on the sale price of the journal which in DHQ's case is zero. However, because DHQ's only revenue is the subvention it receives from ADHO and ACH, any additional income would be very welcome and would enable us to increase our effort on essential tasks like adding new interface features, copyediting, and providing review feedback to our authors. </li></ol>
<p>
During the initial development of the journal, we assumed that a Non-Commercial Creative Commons license would be appropriate because we did not anticipate the role that these kinds of commercial use might play in disseminating DHQ articles more widely. However, after careful consideration, the DHQ editors have decided it would be in the best interests of both DHQ and its authors to alter our legal terms of publication to permit such forms of commercial use in a limited way. We are also keeping in mind arguments like those made by Bethany Nowviskie (see http://nowviskie.org/2011/why-oh-why-cc-by/) that suggest that the boundaries of "commercial" use may be fuzzier and more unpredictable in their effect than we originally thought. The revised language is intended to reflect this change of view. All DHQ content will remain freely available as usual from the DHQ site, so this change does not affect the open-access status of the journal. This change also does not alter the requirements with respect to attribution and derivative works: if anyone, commercial or non-commercial, wants to reuse an article, they must give attribution and may not alter the content without the author's consent.</p><p>

We hope these reasons make sense to our authors and readers, but we welcome questions and comments.</p><p>
</p><p>
Authors who published articles before September 2011 have been asked to indicate whether:
</p><ol><li>
They agree to the updated legal terms. Their article(s) are included in the materials we submit for indexing.
</li><li>
They do not agree to the updated legal terms. In this case, their article(s) will not be included in the materials submitted for indexing. Their status in the DHQ publication will be unaffected. 
</li></ol><p>
If an author does not respond, by default we will not include their article(s) in the materials submitted for indexing and the original legal terms will remain in effect.
</p><p>

The relevant portion of the original terms of publication read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>5. You do not give DHQ permission to sell the work or give it to another publisher for use as part of some other site or publication, but the work may be indexed or aggregated by third parties as part of DHQ.
</p><p>
6. All materials published on the DHQ site are offered under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives license. This means that:
</p><p>
Readers are free to copy, distribute and transmit the work, under the following conditions:
</p><ul>
<li>Attribution. Readers must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that the author endorses them or their use of the work).
</li><li>Noncommercial. Readers may not use this work for commercial purposes.
</li><li>No Derivative Works. Readers may not alter, transform, or build upon this work. However, terms of fair use apply and DHQ will apply these terms liberally.</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>

The new version of these clauses reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
