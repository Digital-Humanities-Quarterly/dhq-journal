                        <p>The language under discussion here is called Comic <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> Markup
                            Language in part to highlight the book-ness and bookishness of these documents, their
                            material properties and bibliographic characteristics. Graphic narratives typically
                            manifest as <soCalled>books,</soCalled> stapled or otherwise bound leaves, perhaps
                            thirty-six pages, with an interesting and complex structure, incorporating the
                            graphic narrative — the sequential art and text or <soCalled>comics</soCalled>
                            content — alongside a rich assortment of paratexts: advertisements, fan mail, and so
                            on. The emphasis on both <soCalled>comics</soCalled> and <soCalled>books</soCalled>
                            in the title of the language signals an awareness of the full range of content in the
                            material artifact and the integration of comics content with related paratextual
                            content. The material properties of the book — the codex form, the leaves and pages,
                            the physical properties of the paper — are inseparable from the structure, pacing,
                            and design of the narrative. Certainly less page-bound organizational and
                            compositional frameworks are possible, such as the newspaper strips with long-running
                            narrative arcs, in which the daily <soCalled>strip</soCalled> of three or four panels
                            is the basic structural unit.</p>
                        <p> The traditional grouping of panels into deliberately composed groups (often
                            corresponding to the physical page or the <soCalled>strip</soCalled> of a newspaper
                            daily) is being challenged by changing publishing and reading technologies. iPhones
                            and other smartphones have become popular devices for reading newly published comics
                            as well as <soCalled>reprints</soCalled> of older comics. However, a full-page grid
                            of panels is not easily readable on the smaller screen of the typical smartphone, so
                            the software interfaces on such devices focus on a single panel at a time. The
                            deliberate juxtaposition of graphic and textual elements in the original composition
                            is shattered by the interface requirements and limitations of the reading device. As
                            new comics work is increasingly targeted at such digital platforms, the traditional
                            grouping of panels into compositional units resembling pages may be abandoned for new
                            compositional strategies. Larger format devices like the iPad and other tablets are
                            better able to represent full-page compositions of panels while also allowing zooming
                            in to focus on individual panels. The isolation of a panel from its surrounding
                            context is not easily achieved in print media. While the reader's eyes and attention
                            may focus on a single panel at a time, other panels on the page remain in the
                            reader's field of vision. The migration of comics content to digital reading devices,
                            and the structural and aesthetic implications of that migration, call attention to
                            the impact of the material characteristics of the comic book document.</p>
                        <p>Comic books are often very formally self-conscious documents and express a
                            fascination with their own bibliographic identities — creators (comic book writers
                            and artists) become characters in the narrative, editorial notes refer to episodes
                            from prior issues, comic books and paratextual elements, such as advertisements, are
                            parodied within the comic book narrative, publication milestones (such as the first,
                            fiftieth, or one hundredth issue are highlighted and celebrated. These literary,
                            rhetorical, and commercial moves point to a self-awareness of the comic book as
                            document and bibliographic object.</p>
                        <p>CBML is intended primarily for representing, modeling, and analyzing twentieth- and
                            twenty-first-century comic books, daily comic strips, longer narratives or
                            <soCalled>graphic novels,</soCalled> and Web comics and other comics content
                            published on digital platforms, such as smartphones and tablets. CBML may also serve
                            as a possible solution for encoding certain documents we might not normally
                            characterize as comics or comic books, but which share many formal characteristics
                            with comics. In his influential <title>Understanding Comics</title>, Scott McCloud's

                         <note>I share with many comics creators and scholars a dissatisfaction with the term

                         language is a set of machine-readable textual codes, or <soCalled>tags,</soCalled>
                         that are used to identify structure, semantics, and other features of documents and
                         data.<note>Readers from the scholarly markup and digital humanities communities
                             will be familiar with many of the general issues about text encoding discussed
                             here. I am also hopeful that this essay will attract readers from the comics
                             scholarship community who may not be as familiar with text encoding, and so I go
                             into more detail about general issues of text encoding than I might
                             otherwise.</note> The application of these codes to a document is typically a
                         necessary stage, often the most crucial and informative stage, of editing, analyzing,
                         indexing publishing, visualizing, and otherwise studying or manipulating texts in
                         digital environments. The act of encoding a document is a form of discovery, or
                         prospecting, in which the encoder maps a document's structure, identifies semantic
                         elements of interest, and documents relationships internal and external to the
                         document. Scholarly encoding is a form of both reading and writing. The reading,
                         shaped by the constraints of a markup language, is inscribed upon and embedded within
                         the digital text. As literary scholar and digital humanist Jerome McGann has noted, <cit>
                             <quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann2001">When you mark up a text you are ipso
                                 facto reading and interpreting it. A … text marked up in TEI [a scholarly

                         </cit>. Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, and Renear assert that markup is constitutive of
                         meaning, markup is interpretive, markup is performative, markup acknowledges or
                         licenses inferences about the text: <cit>
                             <quote rend="block" source="#sperbergmcqueen2000">
                                 <p>Markup is inserted into textual material not at random, but to convey some
                                     meaning.</p>
                                 <p> An author may supply markup as part of the act of composing a text; in this
                                     case the markup expresses the author’s intentions, e.g. as to the structure
                                     or appearance of the text. The author creates a section heading, for
                                     example, by creating an appropriate element in the document; the content of
                                     that element is a section heading because the author says so, and the markup
                                     is simply the method by which the author says so. The markup, that is, has

                                     understanding of the text held by the transcriber; we say that the markup

                                     identifies a section heading in the pre-existing text by transcribing it and
                                     tagging it as a section heading; the content of that element is a section
                                     heading if the transcriber’s interpretation is correct, but other
                                     interpreters might disagree; it is plausible to imagine discussions over

                                 <p>Perhaps we need to look to the pleasure of mutability. To recuperate XML,
                                     politically and aesthetically, we should be looking not to the paradigms of
                                     XML usage that arise from librarianship and from industry-level ideas of the
                                     separability of form and content, but rather to paradigms of performance of
                                     a different kind. By shifting our view we can understand XML as a way of
                                     expressing perspectival understandings of the text: not as a way of
                                     capturing what is timeless and essential, but as a way of inscribing our own
                                     changeable will on the text — in other words, as a form of reading. Seen
                                     this way, XML's presentational flexibility derives not from a separation of
                                     presentation and content, but rather from the shifting vantage points from
                                     which the text appears to us, the shifting relationships that constrain our
                                     understanding of it, the adaptability and strategic positioning of our own
                                     readerly motivations.</p>
                                 <p> Ironically, this is a view which emerges most clearly at the margins of
                                     current digital text practice. It is not visible in the large digital
                                     library projects, whose workflow has come to resemble an industrial
                                     operation complete with offshore outsourcing, detailed division of labor,
                                     reliance on automation and robotics, and an emphasis, in the output, on
                                     uniformity and quantity (thankfully planned obsolescence has not yet become
                                     part of the strategy). But we can find it in the small projects designed by
                                     individual faculty, typically in conjunction with their teaching, to create
                                     digital versions of individual texts which serve as readings: often
                                     idiosyncratic, unscalable, representing private insight. They function more
                                     like an article than an archive, as a local, contingent expression of
                                     insight.</p>

                     <p> The development of a markup language that can support such scholarly reading and
                         interpretation necessitates a careful study and analysis of the content, structure,
                         and semantics of the class or classes of documents for which the language is designed

                             <emph>Our first recommendation would be to secure all promised support in writing.</emph>
                             Even though a current administrator is well disposed toward your innovation and understands the
                             commitment it requires of all those involved, administrators change. A written commitment will
                             ensure that new incumbents in any office understand that a commitment was made, by their
                             <emph>office</emph> and not just by the previous occupant, to your ideas, your personnel, and
                             the results you seek to achieve.</item>
                         <item>
                             <emph>Develop and articulate terms of evaluation that will enable your administration to
                                 see and measure your success.</emph> This can result in positive impacts on individual
                             applications for renewal, tenure and promotion, as well as on the innovation itself. It will
                             also provide you with material to convince new students of the value of adding your classes to
                             their timetables.</item>
                         <item>
                             <emph>Make explicit your intention to let your innovation wither on the vine if your
                                 administration is not willing to commit, in writing, to its continuation beyond an initial
                                 trial period</emph> (probably that of an initial grant). This way, you do not fail to at least
                             try to innovate, but you also do not commit yourself or your institutional
                             <q>home</q> to support that neither you nor they can afford in the absence of
                             administrative responsibility. </item>

                             <emph>Those who would get involved in innovation must know explicitly how their
                                 involvement will count toward renewal, tenure and promotion.</emph> A good model might be one
                             in which key innovators have a written statement from whoever has the authority to offer it
                             indicating that involvement in the innovation will count, for example, as the equivalent of a
                             peer reviewed publication.</item>
                         <item>We found in developing and implementing the multi-disciplinary course we placed at the
                             core of the HHC experience that <emph>through administrative and financial imagination it is
                                 possible to overcome seemingly insurmountable professional and financial problems</emph>. We
                             were able to implement our core course for less than the cost of a single replacement hire on a
                             contractually limited term basis, despite the fact that we had seven university employees from
                             six different campus units involved. </item>

                             <emph>Technical support and information literacy are now integral parts of a meaningful
                                 humanities experience</emph>. By fully integrating technical support and information literacy
                             into our courses, we have been able to offer students marketable computer skills and to incur
                             in them a healthier and more informed attitude to new forms of media production and
                             consumption.</item>
                         <item>
                             <emph>Students should be able to see that real scholarship is available to them to
                                 produce, and they can become participants in a scholarly field through the production of
                                 well-composed and thoroughly researched work</emph>. AhHa!, our data management system, made
                             it easy for us to track students’ progress through the <q>program,</q> and to let
                             them see how they compared to their peers. The perennially asked <q>but what do you
                                 want?</q> questions evaporated when students could see how others had addressed themselves
                             to assignments, and in fact the quality of student work improved as subsequent classes could
                             see what had been done before. Students were no longer working in the artificial vacuum of
                             individualistic student-scholarship, where <q>real</q> scholarship is defined as that
                             produced by unknown names followed by the three mysterious letters, PhD. Instead, students were
                             able to see that real scholarship was available to them to produce as much as to read, and that
                             they could become participants in a scholarly field not through some unexplained and occult
                             rite that their professors had undergone at some specific place definable only as <q>not
                                 here,</q> but through the production of well-composed and thoroughly researched work such
                             as that of which they were demonstrably capable.</item>

                             <p>A term that is used almost as loosely within biblical scholarship as outside

                                 <q>unveiling</q> and some scholars would wish to restrict its use to a type
                                 of literature in which heavenly secrets are revealed to the seer by a vision, a
                                 heavenly journey, or the words of an angel (or some combination of all three).
                                 All too often, however, the term is used as if it meant eschatological, and for
                                 want of a better term it is often used to describe a particular type of
                                 eschatology in which ordinary human history is expected to be interrupted by a
                                 catastrophic divine intervention in the near future (the reason being that such
                                 eschatology is frequently expressed through the medium of apocalyptic in the
                                 first sense).</p>

                                 with Interactive Fiction, to some intermediate (byte code) form that can be run
                                 by different interpreters on different operating systems.</p>

                             <p> The system of containment that determines which objects are within which other

                                 or behind. At the top of the containment hierarchy stand the rooms; rooms are
                                 regarded as not being contained by anything but as directly or indirectly
                                 containing everything else (except for objects temporarily out of play and so
                                 outside the map althogether).</p>

                                 incorporates a highly sophisticated debugger that allows the programmer to step
                                 through his code line by line to see what it is doing each step of the way (and
                                 so determine where something is going wrong if it is going wrong).</p>

                                 Christian theology eschatology traditionally deals with matters such as Heaven,
                                 Hell, the Second Coming and the Last Judgement; in a first-century context it
                                 is better thought of in terms of the coming of the kingdom of God, the age to

                             <p> The most popular language/system for authoring Interactive Fiction, written
                                 and maintained by Graham Nelson. Two versions of Inform are currently in use.
                                 Inform 6 (the older version) resembles a conventional programming language.
                                 Inform 7 adopts a more <q>natural language</q> style of programming with the
                                 aim of making the process of writing Interactive Fiction more like writing
                                 prose and less like conventional programming.</p>

                                 command the player actually typed; for example if the player types GO THROUGH
                                 RED DOOR when the red door is locked but the player has the key, a well-behaved
                                 parser would carry out implicit UNLOCK RED DOOR and OPEN RED DOOR actions
                                 rather than forcing the player to type these commands explicitly.</p>

                             <label>Interpreter:</label>
                             <p> A piece of software that (typically) implements a Virtual Machine and so
                                 allows a game compiled to byte code to be run on the player’s computer; one
                                 generally needs an interpreter to run a work of Interactive Fiction in the same
                                 way that would need a copy of MS-Word to read a Word file, or a program such as
                                 Windows Media Player to watch a DVD on a computer. The advantage is that an
                                 interpreter needs to be written only once for each operating system (Windows,
                                 MAC-OS, Linux, etc.) and can then play all the games written for that
                                 interpreter.</p>

                                 or Inform that handles most of the tasks common to most works of Interactive
                                 Fiction; a library will typically implement a parser and at least a basic world
                                 model, and will generally be written in the same language as that supplied with
                                 the authoring system to allow ready customization by game authors. </p>

                                 of Interactive Fiction apart from the Player Character; characters whose
                                 actions are not controlled by the Player Character. Usually, the term is
                                 restricted to characters who are actually implemented and can be interacted
                                 with rather than characters who are only mentioned or who never remain on stage
                                 long enough for the Player Character to interact with.</p>

                             <p> Something physical that the Player Character can interact with (or at least
                                 examine) in the course of the game, such as a table, chair, pen, or book (or,
                                 indeed, another character). Some objects may be quasi-physical (such as smoke
                                 or sunlight). In many IF authoring systems based on OOP (object-oriented
                                 programming) design, <q>object</q> may also refer to a programming object; in
                                 such systems a game object (in the first sense) will usually be represented by
                                 a programming object (the second sense), but programming objects may also be
                                 used for other purposes (if you don’t know anything about OOP, this second
                                 sense of <q>object</q> is probably irrelevant to you).</p>

                                 (or at least guided) by the player, and through whose eyes and ears the

                             <p> A (normally discrete) unit of space within the game’s map. The usual
                                 convention is that the Player Character can interact with anything that is in
                                 the same room as himself or herself (unless it is deliberately concealed), and
                                 so a room is effectively that volume of space that is immediately present to
                                 the Player Character. A room may be a room in the ordinary sense of a room
                                 within a building, but it may also be a section of space outdoors, such as a
                                 meadow, the top of a hill, or a section of street. </p>

                             <p> Roughly speaking, the set of objects with which the Player Character can
                                 currently interact, given the nature of the action he or she is meant to be
                                 carrying out. Normally this will be restricted to the objects the PC can see or
                                 touch, but this is not always the case. If the action is conversational, e.g.
                                 ASK ACTOR ABOUT TOPIC, then any object (or topic) is potentially in scope. If
                                 the author has implemented a GO TO ROOM command to take the Player Character to
                                 anywhere on the map, then any (known) room will be in scope.</p>

                             <label>Scarcity</label>: Some video games are produced in limited quantities, and
                             are subject to the dangers of media decay.<note>A quantitative study of the
                                 scarcity of videogames was conducted in the UK in 2008. The study took a sample
                                 of videogame consoles, as well as 50 video game cartridges for the Atari 2600,
                                 and examined their availability in archives, on internet sale sites, and as
                                 illegal ROMs for download and play on emulators. The study determined that
                                 pirated ROMs present the most available resource for games, and that all of the
                                 archives found to contain the selected games were located in the United States.
                                 The recent opening of the UK National Videogame Archive may change this
                                 dispersal problem, but the rarity of authentic, original game copies represents
                                 a challenge to those who seek to preserve them. Paul Gooding and Melissa

                             <label>3rd party software dependence</label>: Once a game platform becomes
                             obsolete, emulation may be the best method of providing access. Currently,
                             however, most emulators are developed by the game community and are of
                             questionable legality. They are also typically created without the benefit of the
                             original specifications, and are themselves at risk of becoming obsolete.</item>
                         <item>
                             <label>Complex, proprietary code and an associated lack of documentation</label>:
                             Videogames are generally released as compiled binaries with no documentation of
                             the compiling process, or even the programming languages used. Not having access
                             to the source code or language specifications makes migrating or emulating
                             software far more difficult. It’s a magnification of the format identification
                             issue for stand-alone, static files.</item>

                             <label>Authenticity</label>: The elephant in the digital preservation room —
                             proving that a digital object is what it claims to be, free from tampering or
                             corruption. Video games enjoy many versions between the first prototype, the
                             official release (on multiple platforms), and cracked or otherwise altered
                             unauthorized editions. Especially for older games, the only extant copy may exist
                             in a fan-run web repository, making the authenticity impossible to
                             establish.<note>In this paper we propose alternate conceptions of
                                 <q>authenticity</q> for video games that may align better with their complex

                             <label>Intellectual property rights</label>: The game development industry is
                             highly creative and competitive, leading developers to be very jealous of their
                             intellectual property. Most have instituted extremely draconian shrink-wrap
                             licenses reflecting this. And yet, once a game is no longer actively marketable,
                             they are unlikely to respond to inquiries about licensing for it.<note>For a

                             game that must be maintained with each transformation/preservation action? How
                             important are font size and color palette? What about the speed of text scrolling
                             or sprite movement? How faithful must we stay to the original code? Is it enough
                             to save a video of gameplay, or must we save the interactivity? Do we need BOTH?
                             These are essential to define, as they play a major role in determining
                             authenticity.<note>For a detailed example of the essential characteristics of

                             <label>Context</label>: Although this isn’t an immediate threat to the
                             preservation of games, building contextuality is important to creating
                             understanding for future users. This is truer for video games than many other
                             record types because, as technology advances, game players who have only been
                             exposed to the latest and greatest may be apt to play an older game and say, <q>so
                                 what?</q> even though the game might have been revolutionary for its
                             time.<note> As an example, Sierra’s <title rend="italic">Mystery House</title>
                                 was not just a first for the company — it was the first text adventure to
                                 incorporate graphics. An amazing breakthrough at the time, it seems crude in
                                 comparison to today’s realistic 3D environments.</note>
