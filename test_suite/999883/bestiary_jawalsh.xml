                        <p>The language under discussion here is called Comic <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> Markup
                            Language in part to highlight the book-ness and bookishness of these documents, their
                            material properties and bibliographic characteristics. Graphic narratives typically
                            manifest as <soCalled>books,</soCalled> stapled or otherwise bound leaves, perhaps
                            thirty-six pages, with an interesting and complex structure, incorporating the
                            graphic narrative — the sequential art and text or <soCalled>comics</soCalled>
                            content — alongside a rich assortment of paratexts: advertisements, fan mail, and so
                            on. The emphasis on both <soCalled>comics</soCalled> and <soCalled>books</soCalled>
                            in the title of the language signals an awareness of the full range of content in the
                            material artifact and the integration of comics content with related paratextual
                            content. The material properties of the book — the codex form, the leaves and pages,
                            the physical properties of the paper — are inseparable from the structure, pacing,
                            and design of the narrative. Certainly less page-bound organizational and
                            compositional frameworks are possible, such as the newspaper strips with long-running
                            narrative arcs, in which the daily <soCalled>strip</soCalled> of three or four panels
                            is the basic structural unit.</p>
                        <p> The traditional grouping of panels into deliberately composed groups (often
                            corresponding to the physical page or the <soCalled>strip</soCalled> of a newspaper
                            daily) is being challenged by changing publishing and reading technologies. iPhones
                            and other smartphones have become popular devices for reading newly published comics
                            as well as <soCalled>reprints</soCalled> of older comics. However, a full-page grid
                            of panels is not easily readable on the smaller screen of the typical smartphone, so
                            the software interfaces on such devices focus on a single panel at a time. The
                            deliberate juxtaposition of graphic and textual elements in the original composition
                            is shattered by the interface requirements and limitations of the reading device. As
                            new comics work is increasingly targeted at such digital platforms, the traditional
                            grouping of panels into compositional units resembling pages may be abandoned for new
                            compositional strategies. Larger format devices like the iPad and other tablets are
                            better able to represent full-page compositions of panels while also allowing zooming
                            in to focus on individual panels. The isolation of a panel from its surrounding
                            context is not easily achieved in print media. While the reader's eyes and attention
                            may focus on a single panel at a time, other panels on the page remain in the
                            reader's field of vision. The migration of comics content to digital reading devices,
                            and the structural and aesthetic implications of that migration, call attention to
                            the impact of the material characteristics of the comic book document.</p>
                        <p>Comic books are often very formally self-conscious documents and express a
                            fascination with their own bibliographic identities — creators (comic book writers
                            and artists) become characters in the narrative, editorial notes refer to episodes
                            from prior issues, comic books and paratextual elements, such as advertisements, are
                            parodied within the comic book narrative, publication milestones (such as the first,
                            fiftieth, or one hundredth issue are highlighted and celebrated. These literary,
                            rhetorical, and commercial moves point to a self-awareness of the comic book as
                            document and bibliographic object.</p>
                        <p>CBML is intended primarily for representing, modeling, and analyzing twentieth- and
                            twenty-first-century comic books, daily comic strips, longer narratives or
                            <soCalled>graphic novels,</soCalled> and Web comics and other comics content
                            published on digital platforms, such as smartphones and tablets. CBML may also serve
                            as a possible solution for encoding certain documents we might not normally
                            characterize as comics or comic books, but which share many formal characteristics
                            with comics. In his influential <title>Understanding Comics</title>, Scott McCloud's

                         <note>I share with many comics creators and scholars a dissatisfaction with the term

                             perpetuating of a false distinction. Wikipedia's article on <ref

                         language is a set of machine-readable textual codes, or <soCalled>tags,</soCalled>
                         that are used to identify structure, semantics, and other features of documents and
                         data.<note>Readers from the scholarly markup and digital humanities communities
                             will be familiar with many of the general issues about text encoding discussed
                             here. I am also hopeful that this essay will attract readers from the comics
                             scholarship community who may not be as familiar with text encoding, and so I go
                             into more detail about general issues of text encoding than I might
                             otherwise.</note> The application of these codes to a document is typically a
                         necessary stage, often the most crucial and informative stage, of editing, analyzing,
                         indexing publishing, visualizing, and otherwise studying or manipulating texts in
                         digital environments. The act of encoding a document is a form of discovery, or
                         prospecting, in which the encoder maps a document's structure, identifies semantic
                         elements of interest, and documents relationships internal and external to the
                         document. Scholarly encoding is a form of both reading and writing. The reading,
                         shaped by the constraints of a markup language, is inscribed upon and embedded within
                         the digital text. As literary scholar and digital humanist Jerome McGann has noted, <cit>
                             <quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann2001">When you mark up a text you are ipso
                                 facto reading and interpreting it. A … text marked up in TEI [a scholarly

                         </cit>. Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, and Renear assert that markup is constitutive of
                         meaning, markup is interpretive, markup is performative, markup acknowledges or
                         licenses inferences about the text: <cit>
                             <quote rend="block" source="#sperbergmcqueen2000">
                                 <p>Markup is inserted into textual material not at random, but to convey some
                                     meaning.</p>
                                 <p> An author may supply markup as part of the act of composing a text; in this
                                     case the markup expresses the author’s intentions, e.g. as to the structure
                                     or appearance of the text. The author creates a section heading, for
                                     example, by creating an appropriate element in the document; the content of
                                     that element is a section heading because the author says so, and the markup
                                     is simply the method by which the author says so. The markup, that is, has
                                     <hi rend="italic">performative</hi> significance. </p>
                                 <p> In other cases, markup is supplied as part of the transcription in
                                     electronic form of pre-existing material. In such cases, markup reflects the
                                     understanding of the text held by the transcriber; we say that the markup
                                     <hi rend="italic">expresses a claim</hi> about the text. The transcriber
                                     identifies a section heading in the pre-existing text by transcribing it and
                                     tagging it as a section heading; the content of that element is a section
                                     heading if the transcriber’s interpretation is correct, but other
                                     interpreters might disagree; it is plausible to imagine discussions over

                                 <p>Perhaps we need to look to the pleasure of mutability. To recuperate XML,
                                     politically and aesthetically, we should be looking not to the paradigms of
                                     XML usage that arise from librarianship and from industry-level ideas of the
                                     separability of form and content, but rather to paradigms of performance of
                                     a different kind. By shifting our view we can understand XML as a way of
                                     expressing perspectival understandings of the text: not as a way of
                                     capturing what is timeless and essential, but as a way of inscribing our own
                                     changeable will on the text — in other words, as a form of reading. Seen
                                     this way, XML's presentational flexibility derives not from a separation of
                                     presentation and content, but rather from the shifting vantage points from
                                     which the text appears to us, the shifting relationships that constrain our
                                     understanding of it, the adaptability and strategic positioning of our own
                                     readerly motivations.</p>
                                 <p> Ironically, this is a view which emerges most clearly at the margins of
                                     current digital text practice. It is not visible in the large digital
                                     library projects, whose workflow has come to resemble an industrial
                                     operation complete with offshore outsourcing, detailed division of labor,
                                     reliance on automation and robotics, and an emphasis, in the output, on
                                     uniformity and quantity (thankfully planned obsolescence has not yet become
                                     part of the strategy). But we can find it in the small projects designed by
                                     individual faculty, typically in conjunction with their teaching, to create
                                     digital versions of individual texts which serve as readings: often
                                     idiosyncratic, unscalable, representing private insight. They function more
                                     like an article than an archive, as a local, contingent expression of
                                     insight.</p>

                     <p> The development of a markup language that can support such scholarly reading and
                         interpretation necessitates a careful study and analysis of the content, structure,
                         and semantics of the class or classes of documents for which the language is designed
                         — in this case, the comic book.</p>
