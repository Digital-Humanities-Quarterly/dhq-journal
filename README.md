# dhq-journal 
Digital Humanities Quarterly is an international, open-access, peer-reviewed journal of digital humanities. More information about the journal and its submission and publication policies can be found at the [DHQ site](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/about/about.html). 

DHQ articles are encoded using a customization of the [TEI Guidelines](https://tei-c.org). We are always grateful to authors who encode their own articles. You can find a [schema](https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Quarterly/dhq-journal/blob/master/common/schema/DHQauthor-TEI.rng) and [encoding templates](https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Quarterly/dhq-journal/tree/master/articles/templates) in this repository.

The DHQ journal is published using a custom publication system based on the Apache Cocoon framework, with XSLT, CSS, and JavaScript. The stylesheets and other code are available in this repository. If you have an idea for improving the DHQ interface and would be interested in contributing to the journalâ€™s development, we would love to hear from you! Please email us.
