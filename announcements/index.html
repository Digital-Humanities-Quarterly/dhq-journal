        <h2>Call for Nominations and Applications: DHQ General Editor</h2>
        <p>July 24, 2021</p>
        <p> Digital Humanities Quarterly invites nominations and applications for a new General
            Editor to join the journal’s senior editorial team. This call is the first step in a
            longer process of updating DHQ’s editorial structure and practices, and the incoming
            editor will play a key role in helping us to reshape the journal’s larger editorial
            team, review and update editorial workflows, and put the journal on a secure footing for
            its next 15 years of operation. In particular we are seeking to diversify the journal’s
            staffing and bring in new voices. Scholars of color, underrepresented minorities, and
            people from the global South are strongly encouraged to apply. The new editor would join
            the team in early 2022 for a five-year term (renewable). The deadline for nominations is
            September 1, 2021, and the deadline for applications is October 1, 2021. </p>
        <p> Founded in 2005, DHQ is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal of digital humanities,
            published by the Association of Computers and the Humanities and the Alliance of Digital
            Humanities Organizations. Editorial operations are currently hosted at Northeastern
            University and Indiana University. DHQ publishes articles, case studies, field reports,
            and reviews across the range of digital humanities domains. </p>
        <p> We seek someone who will contribute vision and energy to the journal’s long-term
            planning. Candidates should have a strong background in digital humanities, whether as a
            practitioner, faculty member, public servant, researcher, or other role. No specific
            experience is required, but applicants and nominees should have a commitment to and
            interest in open-access publishing and digital modes of publication, as well as to
            open-source development practices and open data. Experience with managing complex
            collaborative projects, developing funding proposals, or navigating the evolving waters
            of the digital humanities field would all be valuable. </p>
        <p> The time commitment is roughly one to three hours per week on average, but more at some
            times than others, and likely quite a bit more at the start. The position’s
            responsibilities and activities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meeting monthly as part of the general editor team</li>
            <li> Contributing to the management of the journal’s operations. Possibilities include
                helping to coordinate the effort of the editorial board, contributing to or coordinating work on
                large-scale projects, maintaining connections with other journals and relevant
                institutions</li>
            <li> Contributing to a specific aspect of the journal’s leadership, depending on
                expertise and interests</li>
            <li> Contributing to the development and oversight of funding proposals </li>
        </ul>
        <p> To nominate someone, submit a short nomination statement and contact information for the
            nominee via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHUmYNhXsiVbC2jZ1cjv9uk-PIV43Fx3HRlAhXPKAhaLt1Pg/viewform"
