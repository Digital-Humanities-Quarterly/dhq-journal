       <h2>Suspension of Spring 2020 submission deadline</h2>
        <p>DHQ will be suspending its April 2020 submission deadline, to give the journal an opportunity to focus its resources on essential production work during the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are currently planning to reopen submissions with our July 2020 submission deadline, but those plans depend on developments over the next few months. The journal's publication schedule will be uninterrupted. We are grateful to potential authors for their understanding!</p>
