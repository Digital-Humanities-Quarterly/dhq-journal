Modeling questions:

1. We still have no way to provide a table with label and/or caption.

Three strategies:

* Make table into (label?, row+, caption?)

* Introduce a table wrapper, with model (label?, table+, caption)
  (i.e. a specialized kind of figure)
  
* Allow figure to contain table, mark with figure/@type='table' to simplify
  numbering

2. I think <egXML> doesn't belong (judging from its documentation). That's okay,
as plain <eg> will do fine.

3. Relax authorInfo to not require affiliation and bio?
   (We can require them with a Schematron)
   Also allow for corporate, collective, anonymous authorship?

Schematron validation:

in the header:
  restrictions on title/@type

Mixing text or inline elements with block-level elements inside item, note, stage
(ie anything that refers to dhq-macro.specialPara)

Making sure quote[@rend='inline'] contains only inline elements, and
quote[@rend='block'] contains only block-level.

Glossary modeling (item must be label followed by block-level stuff, i.e.
model.inter or model.divPart)

Not allowing cit inside cit, note inside note (others?)

ID cross-referencing
