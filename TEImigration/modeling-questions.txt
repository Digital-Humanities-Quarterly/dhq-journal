Modeling questions: DHQ TEI

Why does publication_stmt allow p+ as an alternative?
(Should this be precluded by a Schematron?)


Why are dhq:abstract and dhq:teaser allowed inside body (as well as front)?

TEI uses camel case but DHQ elements have underscores (like 'author_name'): why?


Are we dropping address information from article metadata?


foreign requires xml:lang. We will have to add them by hand. Is this okay?


I have numerous cases of 'ref' being used like this:

<ref target="#cole1994">Cole 1994, 17</ref>

Shouldn't this be <ptr target="#cole1994" loc="17"/> ?

If so, we can catch these with a Schematron and fix by hand.

(I'm not sure we should automate this conversion.)


What happens to captions in figures?


I have the interesting markup:

<example>
  <label>Passage from English translation of The Treasury of Knowledge </label>
  <quote rend="block">
    <xtext>
      <head>Chapter on Madhyamaka, by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye, translated by Karl
      Brunnhölzl (Nitartha Institute, 2002).</head>
      <div>
   (... etc ...)
   
How should this be marked up?

Currently (in the DHQ-TEI schema) 'example' does not allow 'quote'.

The source data also has cases of 'lg' and 'list' inside 'example', as well as 'p' and 'quote'.
