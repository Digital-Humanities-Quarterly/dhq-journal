    	<h1>Inviting participation: DHQ author workshop, January 2023</h1>
    	<p>DHQ is happy to announce a new initiative to provide greater support for authors throughout the publication lifecycle. As part of this work, starting in January 2023, DHQ's peer review team will be holding a series of online workshops to provide information for potential authors about DHQ's submission, review and publication process. The workshop is aimed at authors new to digital humanities, as part of our larger goal to expand DHQ's mentoring of authors even prior to submitting an article. 
</p><p>
We're starting with two pilot events in mid-January 2023. We’ll be offering the same workshop in two different time slots in an effort to cover as many time zones as possible:</p>
<ul><li>January 12: 8:00 am US Eastern time</li>
	<li>January 13: 1:00 pm US Eastern time</li>
</ul>
<p>This initial event is aimed at providing some general welcome, orientation, and guidance, and answering questions that come up frequently in emails from new authors. The workshop will be recorded and the recording will be available at the DHQ site. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfow_DJNZCHaRPhOCZacTpO-Xbp0i4HXrtzOX5hL1K2ZQgy2w/viewform">sign up for a session</a> if you're interested.

</p>
    	<p>Even if you’re not able to attend one of the scheduled events, please fill out the form if you’d like to express interest in future events. We look forward to meeting you!</p>
