    	<h2>DHQ Has a New Publication System</h2>
    	<p>June 15, 2025</p>
    	<p>Digital Humanities Quarterly is very excited to announce a major milestone in the journal’s technical development, with a move to a static-site publication platform, a completely new search interface, and a new article recommendation system, at a new URL: <a href="https://dhq.digitalhumanities.org/index.html">https://dhq.digitalhumanities.org/index.html</a>. All existing URLs will redirect to this one.
</p>
    	<p>
These updates are the result of several years of intensive work by the DHQ team, with special thanks due to Syd Bauman, Ash Clark, Hoyeol Kim, Ben Lee, Joel Lee, John Walsh, and Haining Wang. We are also very grateful to Simon Wiles, the ADHO systems administrator, for his invaluable help.

The move to a static-site approach was essential because Apache Cocoon, a central element of the journal’s existing publication system, has been discontinued. The new system uses the same stylesheets and core data as the original system—established in 2005 when the journal was founded—but instead of generating the site dynamically, it runs a build process which generates the entire site as a set of self-contained HTML pages. This new approach has crucial advantages, including greater sustainability and ease of maintenance, and ease of distribution in environments with limited bandwidth and connectivity. In these respects it responds in important ways to the Endings Principles, which advocate for self-contained static-site approaches. The updated search interface also uses the Endings Project’s Static Search, and takes much greater advantage of the journal’s metadata and encoding, enabling readers to search within specific article components or date ranges.

The new article recommendation feature offers readers a way of finding articles that are closely related to an article of interest, using several different technologies for identifying similarity including document embeddings, shared keywords, and term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF). Because these methods have different ways of perceiving and comparing “aboutness”, they offer different kinds of recommendations: for instance, the shared keywords method identifies articles that share a set of broad topics identified by the DHQ editorial staff, whereas TF/IDF and document embeddings will tend to base similarity on shared language patterns. Readers are invited to compare the results and provide feedback on which they find most useful and illuminating! Article recommendations are listed at the end of each article, and there's also a link to the recommendations at the top of the article for convenience.

Although the journal’s reading interface hasn’t changed, the shift to a static-site publication system is an essential step towards further updates to the journal’s look, feel, and functionality. Static-site technologies make it much easier for DHQ’s collaborative development team (including external volunteers) to develop and test improvements. Our next step is to begin some structural updates to the organization of the DHQ site, and to begin planning an update to the DHQ interface, including improvements to accessibility and styling.
