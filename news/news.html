    	<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility Editor</h3>
    	<p>The DHQ Web Accessibility Editor is a volunteer position within the DHQ editorial team, with responsibility for leading DHQ’s efforts to make the journal’s online presence accessible. DHQ’s articles are expressed in TEI/XML and published on the web using open-source XML tools. In the coming year, DHQ will be undertaking a comprehensive accessibility audit and update. The Accessibility Editors would lead this effort, working as part of the journal’s Collaborative Development team, and would have ongoing responsibility for ensuring that the journal follows best practices for accessibility as those evolve. Training or certification in web accessibility would be welcome but are not essential; we welcome all contributions of effort. 
</p>

    	<ul>
			<li>Serve as a source of expertise on accessibility within the journal’s editorial team, and contribute to strategic DHQ’s planning in this area</li>

    	<p>The DHQ Book and Tool Reviews Editor is a volunteer position within the DHQ editorial team, with responsibility for recruiting and editing book and tool reviews to be published in DHQ. This position is part of a growing team of review editors focused on developing DHQ’s approaches to reviewing books and tools, recruiting new reviewers, and expanding DHQ’s review coverage of digital humanities books and tools.</p>

The Translation Editor works closely with the editorial team to develop the journal’s strategy on language use and translation, in ways that will help expand the journal’s discoverability, legibility, and accessibility to a global audience.</p>

    	<h2>Community Event Fall 2023 Recording</h2>
    	<p>Over the course of 2023, DHQ’s communications and outreach team has sought to begin programming to better connect readers, reviewers, and authors.</p>
    	<p>To celebrate the journal’s founding, we hosted a virtual Community Event in fall 2023 to share updates related to a Community Needs survey we enacted, reflect on the journal’s growth, and engage in Q&amp;A.</p>
