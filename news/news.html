	<h2>Call for Proposals: Artificial Intelligence for Digital Humanities: Research problems and critical approaches</h2>
		<p>August 1, 2025</p>
		<p><em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> invites authors to submit abstracts for a special
			issue devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence (AI). Though AI-based approaches
			to the digital humanities have been a part of the field for decades, recent years have
			seen an explosion of methodologies utilizing AI. Some methods show great promise,
			providing new modes of discoverability and analysis. Many raise questions and concerns
			along ethical and sociotechnical dimensions. There are also conceptual challenges and
			areas of application that are distinctive to the digital humanities. Given the volume of
			submissions and inquiries surrounding AI and the digital humanities, the DHQ editors
			have decided to devote a special issue to this topic in particular. </p>
		<p> We are interested in a wide-ranging view of AI in the digital humanities context,
			including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Different methodologies and applications, including those that look beyond
				generative AI</li>
			<li>Critical perspectives on AI, including ethical, political, and cultural
				critiques</li>
			<li>Responsible and transparent AI practices and frameworks in DH contexts</li>
			<li>Specific use cases that open the door for new DH-relevant possibilities</li>
			<li>Case studies within the digital humanities and in GLAM institutions, such as
				responsible AI frameworks used to operationalize AI</li>
			<li>Specific and grounded applications including but not limited to: translation,
				transcription, OCR correction, summarization, captioning, text to speech, and
				multi-modal approaches.</li>
			<li>Experimental pieces that make use of AI in their creation (These should also
				include an author’s statement/contextual material commenting on the experiment and
				why the selected form is essential to the submission.) </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Submissions should meet the following requirements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The submission must have a direct connection to the digital humanities.</li>
			<li>The submission should focus on research, rather than pedagogy (a second CFP
				centered on AI and pedagogy will be forthcoming later this year).</li>
			<li>Except for experimental submissions, the submission must be human-authored (AI may
				only be used for grammar and spell-checking within the writing process). </li>
			<li>We are particularly interested in articles that will have continued value for
				readers over time, rather than those focused on specific technologies that may
				quickly become dated. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> We ask that prospective authors submit 500-word abstracts for review by September 15,
			2025. Please send the following to <a
				href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">editors@digitalhumanities.org</a>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An abstract of no more than 500 words</li>
			<li>The name(s) and affiliations of the author(s)</li>
			<li>Email address for the corresponding author</li>
		</ul>
		
			<p>Authors will be notified in January 2026 and invited to submit full papers by
			April 2026, which will be peer reviewed. A full timeline will be provided to authors
			upon the invitation to contribute a full paper. </p>
		<p> For questions related to this call, please contact the DHQ editors at: <a
				href="mailto:editors@digitalhumanities.org">editors@digitalhumanities.org</a>
			(please use the subject header: “DHQ AI Special Issue”).</p></div>
<div id="new_publication">		<h2>DHQ Has a New Publication System</h2>
		<p>June 15, 2025</p>
		<p>Digital Humanities Quarterly is very excited to announce a major milestone in the
			journal’s technical development, with a move to a static-site publication platform, a
			completely new search interface, and a new article recommendation system, at a new URL:
				<a href="https://dhq.digitalhumanities.org/index.html"
				>https://dhq.digitalhumanities.org/index.html</a>. All existing URLs will redirect
			to this one. </p>
		<p> These updates are the result of several years of intensive work by the DHQ team, with
			special thanks due to Syd Bauman, Ash Clark, Hoyeol Kim, Ben Lee, Joel Lee, John Walsh,
			and Haining Wang. We are also very grateful to Simon Wiles, the ADHO systems
			administrator, for his invaluable help. </p>
		<p> The move to a static-site approach was essential because Apache Cocoon, a central
			element of the journal’s existing publication system, has been discontinued. The new
			system uses the same stylesheets and core data as the original system—established in
			2005 when the journal was founded—but instead of generating the site dynamically, it
			runs a build process which generates the entire site as a set of self-contained HTML
			pages. This new approach has crucial advantages, including greater sustainability and
			ease of maintenance, and ease of distribution in environments with limited bandwidth and
			connectivity. In these respects it responds in important ways to the Endings Principles,
			which advocate for self-contained static-site approaches. The updated search interface
			also uses the Endings Project’s Static Search, and takes much greater advantage of the
			journal’s metadata and encoding, enabling readers to search within specific article
			components or date ranges. </p>
		<p> The new article recommendation feature offers readers a way of finding articles that are
			closely related to an article of interest, using several different technologies for
			identifying similarity including document embeddings, shared keywords, and term
			frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF). Because these methods have different ways
			of perceiving and comparing “aboutness”, they offer different kinds of recommendations:
			for instance, the shared keywords method identifies articles that share a set of broad
			topics identified by the DHQ editorial staff, whereas TF/IDF and document embeddings
			will tend to base similarity on shared language patterns. Readers are invited to compare
			the results and provide feedback on which they find most useful and illuminating!
			Article recommendations are listed at the end of each article, and there's also a link
			to the recommendations at the top of the article for convenience. </p>
		<p> Although the journal’s reading interface hasn’t changed, the shift to a static-site
			publication system is an essential step towards further updates to the journal’s look,
			feel, and functionality. Static-site technologies make it much easier for DHQ’s
			collaborative development team (including external volunteers) to develop and test
			improvements. Our next step is to begin some structural updates to the organization of
			the DHQ site, and to begin planning an update to the DHQ interface, including
			improvements to accessibility and styling. </p></div>

		<div id="founder_interviews"><h2>DHQ Founder Interviews</h2>
		<p>We are pleased to share with the DHQ community a series of interviews with journal
			founders, Julia Flanders, Melissa Terras, John Walsh, and Wendell Piez, discussing the
			journal’s creation, evolution, and their insights into the field of Digital
			Humanities.</p>
