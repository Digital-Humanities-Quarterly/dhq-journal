    	<p>We're pleased to announce a call for proposals for a special issue of DHQ on data science and history (deadline for abstracts is July 15). For details see the <a href="../submissions/cfps.html">DHQ CFP page</a>. </p>

    	
<h2>Suspension of submission deadline, July 2023</h2>
    	<p>In summer 2023, we are suspending our July 15 submission deadline to allow the journal to accomplish some essential updates. Submissions will resume with the October 15 deadline.

    	<h2>Inviting participation: DHQ author workshop, January 2023</h2>
    	<p>DHQ is happy to announce a new initiative to provide greater support for authors throughout the publication lifecycle. As part of this work, starting in January 2023, DHQ's peer review team will be holding a series of online workshops to provide information for potential authors about DHQ's submission, review and publication process. The workshop is aimed at authors new to digital humanities, as part of our larger goal to expand DHQ's mentoring of authors even prior to submitting an article. 
</p><p>
We're starting with two pilot events in mid-January 2023. We’ll be offering the same workshop in two different time slots in an effort to cover as many time zones as possible:</p>
<ul><li>January 12: 8:00 am US Eastern time</li>
	<li>January 13: 1:00 pm US Eastern time</li>
</ul>
<p>This initial event is aimed at providing some general welcome, orientation, and guidance, and answering questions that come up frequently in emails from new authors. The workshop will be recorded and the recording will be available at the DHQ site. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfow_DJNZCHaRPhOCZacTpO-Xbp0i4HXrtzOX5hL1K2ZQgy2w/viewform">sign up for a session</a> if you're interested.

        <h2>Call for Nominations and Applications: DHQ General Editor</h2>
        <p>July 24, 2021</p>
        <p> Digital Humanities Quarterly invites nominations and applications for a new General
            Editor to join the journal’s senior editorial team. This call is the first step in a
            longer process of updating DHQ’s editorial structure and practices, and the incoming
            editor will play a key role in helping us to reshape the journal’s larger editorial
            team, review and update editorial workflows, and put the journal on a secure footing for
            its next 15 years of operation. In particular we are seeking to diversify the journal’s
            staffing and bring in new voices. Scholars of color, underrepresented minorities, and
            people from the global South are strongly encouraged to apply. The new editor would join
            the team in early 2022 for a five-year term (renewable). The deadline for nominations is
            September 1, 2021, and the deadline for applications is October 1, 2021. </p>

            experience is required, but applicants and nominees should have a commitment to and
            interest in open-access publishing and digital modes of publication, as well as to
            open-source development practices and open data. Experience with managing complex
            collaborative projects, developing funding proposals, or navigating the evolving waters
            of the digital humanities field would all be valuable. </p>
        <p> The time commitment is roughly one to three hours per week on average, but more at some
            times than others, and likely quite a bit more at the start. The position’s
            responsibilities and activities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meeting monthly as part of the general editor team</li>

                institutions</li>
            <li> Contributing to a specific aspect of the journal’s leadership, depending on
                expertise and interests</li>
