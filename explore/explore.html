        <h1>Explore DHQ</h1>
		<p>In 2024 DHQ implemented an article recommendation feature, designed to help readers navigate the journal and find current and past articles on particular topics. In keeping with the journal's experimental nature, we offer not one but several sets of recommendations, based on different ways of identifying similarities between articles. We encourage readers to experiment with all of them!</p>
    	
    	<h2>Document embeddings</h2>
    	<p>[explanation]</p>
    	
    	<h2>Shared keywords</h2>
    	<p>Article recommendations based on shared keywords are generated by identifying, for each article, the other DHQ articles that share the highest number of DHQ-assigned keywords. [details]</p>
    	<p>To support this feature, the DHQ editors assign multiple topic keywords to each article, which are stored in the DHQ metadata. The <a href="https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Quarterly/dhq-journal/wiki/DHQ-Topic-Keywords">topic keywords list</a> was developed by DHQ starting from keyword lists associated with ACH and ADHO conference CFPs, with consolidation and expansion to accommodate the topical range of DHQ articles. The journal also invites authors to contribute keywords for their own articles. These typically have more local (or field-specific) relevance but over time those will also yield additional journal-wide keywords. (We welcome recommendations for additional keywords that should appear on the DHQ list, and also recommendations for keywords that should be applied to specific articles.)</p>
    	<p>The DHQ topic keyword list is designed around concepts rather than specific terms, recognizing that there are often multiple terms for the same broad concept area. To better support discovery and to simplify the keywording process, DHQ uses topic keywords to identify broad concept areas for each article (e.g. "code studies", "cultural heritage") rather than trying to determine which more precise term might best apply in a specific case ("critical code studies", "software studies"). The more specific terms can be used in searching and can be updated as usage changes. This approach also lays the foundation for multilingual keywording in the future.</p>
    	
    	<h2>Term frequency/inverse document frequency</h2>
    	<p>Article recommendations based on TF/IDF are generated by analysing the DHQ article corpus and identifying articles which share a high number of "common uncommon" words: words that are uncommon in the corpus as a whole, but that are statistically overrepresented in a given document.
