        </div>General Editor: John A. Walsh, Indiana University <br />
     </div>
     <div id="Bio5" style="DISPLAY: none">
            <p class="bio">John A. Walsh is an associate professor in the <a 
                href="http://www.slis.indiana.edu/">School of Library and Information Science</a> at <a 
                href="http://www.iub.edu/">Indiana University</a>, where he teaches and conducts research
                in the areas of digital humanities and digital libraries. His research focuses on electronic
                textuality and the nature of the document in the digital age. He explores the evolution of 
                the document, the book, and the literary text--both born-digital new media texts and digital 
                representations of written and printed texts. Digital environments and tools offer possibilities 
                for new representations of texts, new readings, and new strategies and habits of reading as 
                documents evolve from more or less static and fixed texts to fluid and malleable data. As 
                part of exploring these transformational developments in textuality, Walsh studies the 
                application of metadata and semantic web technologies to facilitate new forms of close, 
                distant, and social reading and interpretation. In addition to his research activities, 
                Walsh has over ten years experience as a developer, manager, and librarian working on digital 
                scholarly projects.  Current research projects include <a href="http://www.swinburneproject.org/">
                The Swinburne Project</a>, <a href="http://www.chymistry.org/">The Chymistry of Isaac Newton
