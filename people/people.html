        <div id="Bio1" style="DISPLAY: none">
            <p class="bio">Julia Flanders was born and raised in the New Jersey suburbs, and
                attended a local public high school where computers were taught as
                &quot;Computer Math&quot;. She received her first undergraduate degree from
                Harvard in History and Literature, and her second from Cambridge University in
                English Literature. In 1989 she began a PhD in English at Brown University, but
                migrated early in her graduate studies into humanities computing. She started
                working at the Women Writers Project in 1992, first as a proofreader, then as
                Managing Editor, Textbase Editor, and Project Manager. Upon completing her doctorate
                in 2005 (on &quot; Digital Humanities and the Politics of Scholarly
                Work&quot;) she found herself with enough free time to work on the founding of a
                digital journal.</p>
            <p class="bio">Julia currently works as the Director of the Digital Scholarship Group at Northeastern University, where she is also a Professor of the Practice in the English Department and the Director of the Women Writers Project. Her research focuses on the challenges of digital text
                representation, text encoding, and scholarly communication. She also does a variety
                of freelance technology consulting. She has written and spoken on a variety of
                issues including the gender politics of scholarly digital editing, documentation,
                the history of quantitative methods of literary analysis, digital textuality and
                materiality, and various practical problems in text encoding. She has served as President and Vice
                President of ACH and Chair of the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium.</p>

      <p class="bio">A user and programmer of digital machines since the 1970s, Wendell Piez is a
        graduate of the American School in Japan and of Yale College (MC 1984), where he received a
        BA in Classics (Ancient Greek) and studied language, linguistics, philosophy and literature.
        From 1985 to 1998 he studied and taught at Rutgers University, where he specialized in
        English literature, critical theory, poetics and rhetoric. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1991
        he worked in Rutgers University Special Collections and Archives (1991-1995) and on the
        faculty at CETH (the Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities, 1995-1998). In 1998, he
        joined Mulberry Technologies, Inc., a leading consultancy in the domain of documentary text
        encoding, where he built tools, participated in design and development initiatives, and

        <div id="Bio6" style="DISPLAY: none">
            <p class="bio">John A. Walsh is an associate professor in the <a 
                href="http://www.slis.indiana.edu/">School of Library and Information Science</a> at <a 
                href="http://www.iub.edu/">Indiana University</a>, where he teaches and conducts research
                in the areas of digital humanities and digital libraries. His research focuses on electronic
                textuality and the nature of the document in the digital age. He explores the evolution of 
                the document, the book, and the literary text--both born-digital new media texts and digital 
                representations of written and printed texts. Digital environments and tools offer possibilities 
                for new representations of texts, new readings, and new strategies and habits of reading as 
                documents evolve from more or less static and fixed texts to fluid and malleable data. As 
                part of exploring these transformational developments in textuality, Walsh studies the 
                application of metadata and semantic web technologies to facilitate new forms of close, 
                distant, and social reading and interpretation. In addition to his research activities, 
                Walsh has over ten years experience as a developer, manager, and librarian working on digital 
                scholarly projects.  Current research projects include <a href="http://www.swinburneproject.org/">
