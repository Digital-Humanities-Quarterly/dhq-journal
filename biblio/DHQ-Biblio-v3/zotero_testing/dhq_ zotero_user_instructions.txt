To generate a DHQ bibliography

1. To create a library in Zotero
--create a Zotero account
--you may choose to install and use the Zotero application if you don't already have it, but it is not essential
--choose "New Collection"
--for all items that have ISBNs or DOIs, you can add them all at once using "add item(s) by identifier". To do this, simply paste the list of identifiers into the field at the prompt. This will create a record in Zotero for each one of the items.
--for items that do not have an ISBN or DOI, you can add items individually. In many cases, you can import online items using Zotero's browser plugin for Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Once you have the Zotero plug-in installed, you can visit the item you want to import, and then import it using the Zotero plug-in.
--you can also add items by hand using "create new item." You will need to enter the information for each item by hand.
--for more details, see https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero

2. From an existing Zotero library (either in a browser or using the Zotero desktop application)
--select the items you wish to include in your DHQ bibliography
--right-click or control-click on the group of items (on any one of the selected items) and choose "Export items"
--at the prompt, choose "TEI" as the export format and check the "generate XML IDs" field. Leave the other boxes unchecked.
--submit the resulting file with the final version of your DHQ submission

3. Direct to TEI
If you don't wish to use Zotero or are not able to do so, you can also create a bibliography directly in TEI. You can view sample encoding for the major bibliographic genres [link]. 

4. If you are unable to use Zotero or TEI, please send us your bibliography as follows:
--[specify format to match what Zotero can easily import using its RTF translator]
--for any item that has a DOI or ISBN, please include that identifier
--if you use EndNote or some other citation manager and can export BibTech or RIS, we can accept that
