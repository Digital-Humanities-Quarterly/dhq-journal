000002	Howard, Jeff	2007	Interpretative Quests in Theory and Pedagogy	Digital Humanities Quarterly	In this paper, I extend theoretical understandings of the gaming activity and literary form called the “quest” and its relationship to issues of interpretation, focusing primarily on game theory with concrete examples as well as some broadly applicable pedagogical uses of these ideas in literature classrooms. The argument contributes to a recent theoretical and practical discussion of “quests” by scholars of games studies such as Aarseth 2004, Juul 2005, Tosca 2003, and Tronstad 2001. I build upon and revise these theorists’ understandings by approaching a “quest” as a goal-oriented activity in which players undertake a journey in search of meaning. By demonstrating similarities between the literary traditions in which quests are central and the practice of digital game design, I argue that quests can be better understood theoretically and more productively used in the classroom if meaning and action are regarded as complementary design principles instead of conflicting impulses. A revised understanding of quests can help to mediate between games and narratives by showing strategies by which game designers have created meaningful action, often in ways that are either unconsciously similar to or inspired by the literary traditions of mythology, epic, and romance. Specifically, game designers can use level design to create labyrinthine spaces that encode thematic implications, in the tradition of literary allegory. If these symbolic spaces are coordinated with significant obstacles and challenges, the apparent conflict between meaning and action can be resolved through engaging gameplay that allows players to enact a range of thematic ideas, contributing to the ongoing replay value of a digital game. I also suggest ways in which this understanding of quests can allow literature teachers to plan assignments where students transform literary narratives into interpretative quests taking the form of digital games. As a paradigmatic example, I describe one such assignment, in which my students adapted episodes from Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 into design documents and prototypes, and I suggest some theoretical implications of its results for other instructors. By adapting works of literature into quests, students learn to discover and create meaning through the active exertion of cognitive and imaginative effort rather than absorbing it passively.	aarseth1997 | aarseth2000 | aarseth2004 | alonzo2006 | bateman2005 | bolter1999 | campbell1949 | cowart1977 | davis1998 | elder2006 | erickson1996 | eskelinen2004 | fable2005 | frasca2003 | frye1957 | kelly2004 | gee2004 | kucklich2996 | glassner2004 | jenkins2004 | juul2005 | king2003 | kimbrell2006 | losh2006 | mendelson1978 | montfort2003 | neugebauer2006 | natkin2006 | novak2005 | propp1968 | pynchon1964 | rollings2003 | ryan2001 | salen2004 | szulborski2005 | tosca2003 | tronstad2001 | ulmer2002 | vogler1998 | zimmerman2004	1	
000003	VandeCreek, Drew	2007	Webs of Significance: The Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project, New Technology, and the Democratization of History	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Lincoln/Net (http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu), a product of the Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project at Northern Illinois University Libraries, represents a new type of historically oriented digital library resource. Like many other digital libraries, it contains a large amount of searchable primary source materials. Like a number of other historically oriented online resources, project staff have organized Lincoln/Net around a specific topic, in this case Abraham Lincoln’s life and times in antebellum Illinois. In addition to Lincoln’s own papers, the project’s databases contain resources shedding light on his context, including letters, diaries, and publications prepared by his peers. Unlike most historically oriented digital libraries however, the project Web site also includes a wealth of multimedia materials, including image, sound, video, and interactive map resources. But Lincoln/Net is perhaps most unique in that it furnishes its users with an extensive set of interpretive materials. This approach suggests that historians may play an expanding role in the development of digital libraries. It can also provide them with a badly-needed means of communicating with an audience beyond their own scholarly community and students. This communication can facilitate what one digital history pioneer has described as the “democratization of history,” as defined by an expanded user group enjoying primary source materials and using them to engage in historical thinking .	about2006 | about2006a | ayers1999 | bates2003 | bass1999 | becker1932 | bender1986 | bender1994 | borgman2000 | britton1997 | brown2001 | cobb1997 | cole1994 | cox1997 | delaney1999 | friedman2005 | geertz1973 | ghapery2004 | green2001 | greenberg1998 | haskell1977 | haskell1984 | hay1894 | haywood1998 | hinton1860 | historynet2006 | hunt1997 | jessop2004 | karamanski1990 | kelley1978 | kornblith2001 | mabry | meulen2003 | minkel2003 | murray1997 | novick1988 | oed2006 | plewe1997 | public2006 | rosenzweig2003 | shiroma2000 | tenopir2004 | songster1850 | thomas1999 | west2003 | woods1995 | zhao2004	1	
000004	Patrik, Linda E.	2007	Encoding for Endangered Tibetan Texts	Digital Humanities Quarterly	For over a thousand years, Tibet has preserved and translated ancient Buddhist Sutras from India, keeping the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and meditation alive long after it died out in India by the 12th Century. Recent efforts to digitize materials from this textual tradition offer opportunities to broaden the circulation of rare materials to the exiled Tibetan scholarly community, but also suggest conceptual challenges arising from the complexity of the texts and their inherently multimodal character. This paper describes the scholarly and meditative traditions from which these texts come, and discusses possible approaches to their digitization.	anderson2003 | bia2003 | chilton2006 | dreyfus2003 | dutt1962 | hayles2002 | marvet2006 | muller1894 | rahtz2005	1	
000005	Wolff, Mark	2007	Reading Potential: The Oulipo and the Meaning of Algorithms	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Recent efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers in order to broaden the appeal of humanities computing have invoked the example of the Oulipo. Although there are similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted literary analysis, the development of tools for the express purpose of encouraging scholars to play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into potentialities. For the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question of interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are better understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some objective in mind. The procedures for making sense of texts provide for their own interpretation: they are not only instruments for discovering meaning but also reflections on making meaning.	benabou1987 | bens1980 | bergens1999 | braffort2006 | braffort1984 | khmelev2001 | mcgann2001a | oulipo1998 | motte1986 | olsen1993 | oulipo1988 | queneau1961 | queneau1964 | queneau1965 | ramsay2003 | reggiani1999 | rockwell2003 | schmid2006 | sinclair2003b | starynkevitch1990	1

000009	Jerz, Dennis G.	2007	Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original Adventure in Code and in Kentucky	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Because so little primary historical work has been done on the classic text computer game Colossal Cave Adventure, academic and popular references to it frequently perpetuate inaccuracies. Adventure was the first in a series of text-based games (interactive fiction) that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and story, typically in a fantasy setting; these games had a significant cultural impact in the late 1970s and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will Crowther based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an occasion for narrative encounters and as an aesthetic masterpiece of logic and utility ; however, previous attempts to assess the significance of Adventure remain incomplete without access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's original source cave. Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a backup of Woods's student account at Stanford, and documents an excursion to the real Colossal Cave in Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther, Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions. Real locations in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod and an axe head) correspond to their representation in Crowther's version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had expanded the game to include numerous locations that he invented, along with significant technical innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory). Sources that incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are sourced thinly if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during the 1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976. The original game employed magic, humor, simple combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly expanded. While Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real cave, his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to improve the gameplay.	aarseth1997 | aarseth2001 | adams2007c | adams2007a | adams2007b | anderson1985 | anderson1990 | au2000 | au2002 | bennahum1998 | bloom2002 | briceno2000 | brucker2005 | brucker1976 | brucker2005a | brucker2005b | buckles1985 | cadre2004 | cahill2001 | carter2002 | chaplin2007 | cordella2001 | costikyan2007 | crowther1976 | crowther2001 | crowther2007 | crowther1975b | crowther1977 | dalenberg2004 | dalenberg2006 | dibbell2002 | douglass2006 | douglass2007 | eskelinen2001 | freeman1975 | gamespy2002 | gilbert2005 | gilbert2007 | gillogly1977 | hafner1994 | hafner1996 | harrington2007 | herz1997 | howell1990 | hutcheon1988 | jerz2000 | jerz2002 | jerz2005 | juul2001 | juul2005 | keller2007 | kidder1981 | kraley2004 | knuth1998 | lawrence2002 | levy1984 | mann2003 | mann2004 | mcgonigal2008 | montfort2003 | murray1997 | nss1994 | nelson2001 | oneill1990 | park1994 | plotkin1995 | poole2000 | raymond1996 | robinett2000 | rothstein2002 | ryan2001b | selfe2007 | schwartz1999 | toomey1990 | turkle1995 | vanvleck2001 | wilcox1990 | wilcox2002 | woods2006 | woods2007	1	
000010	Eve, Eric	2007	All Hope Abandon: Biblical Text and Interactive Fiction	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Among the alternative kinds of narrative opened up by computer technology, one of earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the text adventure or adventure game), which first came into being in the 1970s. Text-based interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial success in the 1980s until it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it continues to be read and written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive fiction clearly has roots in computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of literature. Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, All Hope Abandon, explores aspects of Biblical Studies through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several examples from All Hope Abandon will be given, and instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end.	anderson2006 | bates1997 | berg2004 | brasslantern2007 | cadre1998 | coyne2003 | crowther1976 | dollahite2005 | donahue2002 | downing2000 | elliott1993 | eve2002 | eve2004 | eve2005 | firth2007 | granade2007 | hooker1991 | jasper2005 | jerz2000b | jerz2000c | jerz2001 | kopteltsev2006 | lee2006b | lott2004 | maher2005 | maher2006 | marcus1993a | marshall1989 | meier1994 | montfort2003 | montfort2003b | morgan2006 | moyise2001 | nelson1997 | nelson2001 | nelson2007b | nelson2007a | nepstad2006a | nepstad2006b | ong2002 | powell2006 | raif2007 | reed2005 | rhoads1982 | roberts2006 | roberts2007a | roberts2007b | roberts2007c | shiovitz2004a | shiovitz2004b | short2007a | short2007b | stevens2001 | vaniersel1998 | vansina1985 | watts2000 | woods2005	1	
000011	Anderson, Steve F.	2007	Aporias of the Digital Avant-Garde	Digital Humanities Quarterly	This article maps two divergent trajectories within a narrowly defined sphere of short-form, time-based digital media created between 1995 and 2005. These works are considered in relation to the historical avant-garde - particularly the Structural film movement of the 1960s and 70s - and analyzed as responses to a range of cultural concerns specific to the digital age. The analysis identifies movement toward two terminal points: first, a mode of remix-based montage inspired by open source programming communities and peer-to- peer networks; and second, the emergence of a mode of imaging termed the digital analogue, which foregrounds the material basis of digital production.	bukatman2003 | cae2001 | cae2002 | crary1990 | darley2000 | enzensberger1974 | greenwald2004 | james1989 | kittler1999 | krauss1993 | lunenfeld2000 | manovich1999 | manovich2001 | marks2000 | nichols1991 | weibel2002 | willis2005	1	
000012	Hoover, David	2007	The End of the Irrelevant Text: Electronic Texts, Linguistics, and Literary Theory	Digital Humanities Quarterly	The close study of literary texts has a long and illustrious history. But the popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just at the time that widely available electronic texts were making traditional analytic tools easier to apply and encouraging the development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without claiming any simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the dominance of Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory. Certainly both an introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic approach and literary theories deeply influenced by ideas about the sign's instability and the tendency of texts to disintegrate under critical pressure minimize the importance of the text. Using examples from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a return to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what corpora, text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship attribution can reveal about meanings and style. The recent resurgence of interest in scholarly editions, corpora, text- analysis, stylistics, and authorship suggest that the electronic text may finally reach its full potential.	addison1694 | biber1995 | bnc2001 | boswell1791 | bosworth1898 | bradford1647 | burrows2002a | burrows2002b | burrows2007 | chomsky1975 | chomsky1986 | chomsky2000 | cooper1840 | davies2007b | dickens1858 | faulkner1978 | fish1980 | goldfield2006 | golding1955 | griffith1896 | halliday1981 | hoover1999 | hoover2004a | hoover2004b | hoover2004c | hoover2006 | hoover2007a | hume1748 | louw1993 | mcgann2004b | more1914 | morris1895 | pope1715 | sampson2005 | shillingsburg2006 | sinclair2003a | sinclair2004 | stubbs1996 | swift1726 | trillin1998	1	
000049	Gordon, Eric | Bogen, David	2009	Designing Choreographies for the New Economy of Attention	Digital Humanities Quarterly	The nature of the academic lecture has changed with the introduction of wi-fi and cellular technologies. Interacting with personal screens during a lecture or other live event has become commonplace and, as a result, the economy of attention that defines these situations has changed. Is it possible to pay attention when sending a text message or surfing the web? For that matter, does distraction always detract from the learning that takes place in these environments? In this article, we ask questions concerning the texture and shape of this emerging economy of attention. We do not take a position on the efficiency of new technologies for delivering educational content or their efficacy of competing for users’ time and attention. Instead, we argue that the emerging social media provide new methods for choreographing attention in line with the performative conventions of any given situation. Rather than banning laptops and phones from the lecture hall and the classroom, we aim to ask what precisely they have on offer for these settings understood as performative sites, as well as for a culture that equates individual attentional behavior with intellectual and moral aptitude.	bauerlein2007 | benjamin1986 | billinghurst2002 | billinghurst2007 | ccs2007 | cole2007 | crary1999 | edmundson2008 | goffman1981 | harry2008 | lanham1997 | lanham2006 | liang2005 | meyrowitz1985 | munsterberg1909 | page2005 | simmel1971 | thaler2008 | thaler2008a | winner2009	1

000051	Robinson, Peter M. W.	2009	The Ends of Editing	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Many ends of editing in the digital world may be distinguished. One may speak of end as in the supersession of one model of editing (the intentionalist, definitive-text model) by another (the multiple texts, multiply-intentioned views enabled by digital methods). One may speak of end as in aim: not only the aim of the author or authors, but also the aims of the editor or editors. These questions were already complicated in the print world; the advent of digital methods has both focussed and widened the contests around these concepts. The essay reviews some of these questions, with examples drawn from (inter alia) the utterances of the two George Bushes, from editions with which the author is associated of Chaucer, Dante, and of Armenian texts, from the eColi genome, and from Barack Obama's discussion of different viewpoints on the Constitution of the United States. The essay concludes that a huge shift is indeed underway in the editing world, towards a more open and participatory model of editing and reading.	current2007 | given2005 | greetham1992 | marcus1996 | mcleod1982 | mcgann1983 | mckenzie1985 | obama2008 | robinson1996 | robinson1997 | robinson2000 | robinson2005 | shaw2006 | shillingsburg1996 | shillingsburg2006 | sperberg1996 | warren1989 | weitenberg2007 | where2004	1	
000052	Eaves, Morris	2009	Picture Problems: X-Editing Images 1992-2010	Digital Humanities Quarterly	After centuries of image deprivation, we now bathe in a sea of pictures, most of them digitized at some stage. In the 1990s, as humanists began to sense the advantages of networked computing on the web, they conceived major new editorial projects that would depend to an extraordinary degree upon the documentary power of pictures. Despite evident progress in devising sturdy and responsive standards, images, and tools, stubborn problems persist in several key areas that are explored here through an overview of issues that arise as the William Blake Archive acquires images, prepares them for reproduction, and makes them available for manipulation by its users. Editing electronic images in so unsettled and unsettling an environment generates the provisional success — weak success — that is utterly characteristic of X-editing, electronic scholarly editing in our time. Our dependence on current technology and the expertise of others is not a remediable condition. We must play the game as it presents itself, making the compromises that are necessary, and move ahead.	bielstein2006 | bindman | claburn2008 | cerf2008 | child2006 | eaves2006 | erdman1988 | fuchs | howard2006 | jaschik2008 | mihm2006 | misic2003 | misic2002a | misic2002b | preston2005 | robinson1993 | thomas2007 | waal | wikipedia | william	1	
000053	Price, Kenneth M.	2009	Edition, Project, Database, Archive, Thematic Research Collection: What's in a Name?	Digital Humanities Quarterly	What are the implications of the terms we use to describe large-scale text-based electronic scholarship, especially undertakings that share some of the ambitions and methods of the traditional multi-volume scholarly edition? And how do the conceptions inherent in these choices of language frame and perhaps limit what we attempt? How do terms such as edition, project, database, archive, and thematic research collection relate to the past, present, and future of textual studies? Kenneth M. Price considers how current terms describing digital scholarship both clarify and obscure our collective enterprise. Price argues that the terms we use have more than expressive importance. The shorthand we invoke when explaining our work to others shapes how we conceive of and also how we position digital scholarship.	allen1963 | beckett1969 | beckett1970 | emerson | folsom1982 | folsom2007 | folsom1999 | higginson1903 | hindus1955 | light2002 | macneil2005 | mcgann2007 | palmer2004 | price2007 | queneau1961 | reynolds1995 | shillingsburg2006 | stauffer2007 | whitman1978 | yakel2003	1

000063	Giglio, Katheryn | Venecek, John	2009	The Radical Historicity of Everything: Exploring Shakespearean Identity with Web 2.0	Digital Humanities Quarterly	This article presents the results of a semester-long project designed to determine how effectively interactive Web 2.0 technology can facilitate collaborative research in undergraduate learners. The study was conducted during a 2007 advanced Shakespeare course at the University of Central Florida that focused heavily on a new historicist approach to studying literature. In this paper we first establish the theoretical foundation for this particular approach to literary studies, then discuss more in-depth how the collaborative, inter-connective nature of wikis allowed students to witness first-hand some of the concealed assumptions enmeshed in the creation of historical explanation or narrative. We also discuss how, in thinking about the past, this technology allowed our students realize some of the stakes in describing history for the present. In other words, having students create wikis based on the social identities that recur in Shakespeare’s works developed an implicit awareness of motives for doing history. We also show how employing open source technology in a localized classroom setting can assuage some of the gaps we experience in trying to provide enough period coverage while also attending to theoretical apparatus and students’ experience of meaningful connections to material. On a larger scale, creating inquiry-based projects can alleviate some of the humanities’ disengagement from the real world that many have been suggesting of late.	brent1997 | calandra2005 | davidson2008 | davis2001 | davis2002 | desilets2005 | dwight2003 | farabaugh2007 | fullbrook2002 | jameson1981 | hilton2006 | lanier2006 | martin2008 | mason2007 | pennell2008 | radway2004 | read2007 | robinson2004 | schroeder2008 | schultz2001 | shakespeare2005 | stanley2005 | trimbur1989 | ulin2007 | weiner2007 | zuern2004	1	
000064	McDonough, Jerome	2009	XML, Interoperability and the Social Construction of Markup Languages: The Library Example	Digital Humanities Quarterly	The past decade has seen XML widely adopted within a variety of communities, including the digital library community. While it now plays a critical role in the infrastructure of many digital library operations, XML's promise of interoperability of data across systems and organizations has not been fully realized within digital libraries. The reasons for this are not primarily technical in origin, but social, and relate to the cultures of XML's designers and XML language implementors, and a failure on the part of the digital library community to grapple with the sociotechnical nature of XML and its implementation. Possible strategies for addressing these issues of interoperability might include reduction of the flexibility afforded by specific XML-based markup languages used by the digital library community, and an increased focus on standardizing translations between various communities of practice use of such markup languages.	akrich1992 | bosak1997 | bosak1998 | bosak1999 | dilauro2005 | goodger2001 | hillmann2005 | hurley1999 | irs2007 | keith2005 | kendall2007 | kott2006 | littmann2006 | loc2006 | loc2008 | nelson2005 | renear2001 | seaman2003 | shirky2005 | shreeves2005 | berkeley1997 | wwwc1998 | wwwc1999a | wwwc1999b	1	
000065	Svensson, Patrik	2009	Humanities Computing as Digital Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	This article presents an examination of how digital humanities is currently conceived and described, and examines the discursive shift from humanities computing to digital humanities. It is argued that this renaming of humanities computing as digital humanities carries with it a set of epistemic commitments that are not necessarily compatible with a broad and inclusive notion of the digital humanities. In particular, the author suggests that tensions arise from the instrumental, textual and methodological focus of humanities computing as well as its relative lack of engagement with the digital as a study object. This article is the first in a series of four articles attempting to describe and analyze the field of digital humanities and digital humanities as a transformative practice.	aarseth1997 | alexander2006 | balsamo2000 | blackwell2004 | burnard2002 | busa2004 | dhq2007 | drucker2004 | flanders2002 | hockey2004 | humanist60357 | humanist60362 | humanist17111 | humanist18001 | humanist18615 | humanist19052 | humanist21436 | humanist21469 | jessop2007 | juola2008 | kiernan1991 | kirschenbaum2004 | klein1996 | knorr1999 | llc232 | llc233 | llc234 | llc241 | mccarty1996 | mccarty2005 | mccarty | mcgann2001 | mcgann2004 | mcgann2006 | ratto2006 | renear2004 | rockwell2002 | rockwell2003 | rockwell2004 | schreibman2004 | desmedt2002 | sterne2006 | terras2006 | witmore2006 | zweig1998	1	
000066	Sandifer, Philip	2009	Avatari: Disruption and Imago in Video Games	Digital Humanities Quarterly	This article offers an analysis of the video game in terms of the experience of gameplay, starting with the concept of the avatar, which is central to all video games. The avatar is typically described as our second self in the virtual world of the game. The paper challenges this theory, suggesting that the avatar is better understood as a set of possible interactions, and proposes a second concept, the avatari. If the avatar is our second self, the avatari is the rebellious figure on the screen that we cannot quite control, and that jumps into the pit, gets hit by the enemy, or otherwise fails despite our best efforts to succeed. Conceptualizing video games in terms of the avatar and avatari enables thinking about video games via a more sophisticated and productive model of interactivity than many of the existing paradigms.	aarseth1997 | aarseth2004 | bolter2003 | booth1983 | breukelaar2002 | duguid1996 | evans1996 | heidegger1996 | klein1975 | kucklichs2007 | lacan2004 | lara | manovich2001 | mcluhan1994 | morabito1986 | murray1997 | norman1988 | rabinowitz1998 | rehak2003 | ryan2001 | stephenson2000 | turkle2005 | wark2004 | wark2007 | williams1997 | zizek2004	1

The trained droplets provide several functions. Their primary purpose is to encapsulate the results of the software training phase. They can be saved for future re-use against other collections or combinations of collections. They can be modified by having the user accept or reject features identified by the data mining software. Finally, they can also contain choices for how to display and organize items in the collection. The opportunity to develop a new interface object presents the designer with the challenge of effectively communicating what the tool is good for and how it is used. This paper outlines the design process we followed in creating the visual representations of these interface objects, describes the communicative strengths and weaknesses of a number of alternative designs, and discusses the importance of the study of new interface objects as the means of providing the user with new interface affordances.	bederson2001 | bumgardner2005 | dillon2001 | feldman1997 | gibson1979 | hascoët1998 | hockey2000 | horn1998 | horton | karvonen2000 | kirschenbaum | nielsen2000 | pirolli1996 | plaisant2004 | ramsay | ramsay2003 | rodden2001 | ruecker2006 | ruecker2005 | ruecker2003 | shneiderman2001 | small1996 | unsworth2005 | unsworth2004 | vicente2002 | weiss2005	1	
000068	Zöllner-Weber, Amélie	2010	Ontologies and Logic Reasoning as Tools in Humanities?	Digital Humanities Quarterly	In this article, we evaluate approaches using logic reasoning applied to an ontology for literary characters. The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario. Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce with solely logic constructs. Furthermore, information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of logic reasoning. At the moment, to the author’s knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in literature studies, have been published. Existing approaches show promising results in modelling information in humanities. Therefore, further research should be directed to make ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more popular and applicable in the humanities and literature studies.	antoniou2003 | baader2003a | baader2003b | benjamins1999 | berthold2003 | charniak1985 | cimiano2006 | farrar2002 | fisher2006 | gomez2004 | greimas1971 | gruber1993 | haarslev2004 | halpern2005 | jannidis2004 | lungen2007 | mccarty2005 | meister1999 | nardi2003 | nieragden1995 | noy1997 | noy2001 | noy2003 | pl1991 | propp1968 | puppe2000 | racer2005 | renear2006 | shirky2005 | sirin2007 | smith2007 | stevens2000 | tsarkov2006 | veltman2004 | ziegler2004 | zw2006a | zw2006b | zw2007a | zw2007b | zw2008	1	
000069	Kraus, Kari	2010	Conjectural Criticism: Computing Past and Future Texts	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology. The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. Computation is here broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression. The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the written word and the emerging field of biohumanities.	abrams1953 | aitchison2003 | bell1999 | bentley1732 | berg2001 | borgman2007 | bottero2001 | cameron | carroll | ceruzzi2000 | darwin1871 | fishbane1989 | franklin2001 | goodman1976 | greg1924 | grier2005 | grivelet1956 | gross2001 | hall1913 | hoenigswald1963 | hoenigswald1987 | housman1921 | johnson1765 | jones1948 | kac1999 | kay2000 | kenney1974 | kirschenbaum2008 | kraus2002 | lanham1991 | mahood1957 | manetti1993 | mcgann1991 | mcleod1983 | nisbet1991 | ohara1993 | ohara1996 | oppenheim1964 | poole2002 | ramsay2003 | ramsay2007 | rye2003 | salemans1996 | searls2001 | steiner1998 | sewell1952 | spolsky2002 | stoppard1997 | tarrant | tedlock2000 | thacker2004 | thomas2007 | welsford1966 | woolfson2005	1	
000070	Terras, Melissa M.	2010	The Potential and Problems in using High Performance Computing in the Arts and Humanities: the Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH) Project.	Digital Humanities Quarterly	e-Science and high performance computing (HPC) have the potential to allow large datasets to be searched and analysed quickly, efficiently, and in complex and novel ways. Little application has been made of the processing power of grid technologies to humanities data, due to lack of available large-scale datasets, and little understanding of or access to e-Science technologies. The Researching e-Science Analysis of Census Holdings (ReACH) scoping study, an AHRC-funded e-science workshop series, was established to investigate the potential application of grid computing to a large dataset of interest to historians, humanists, digital consumers, and the general public: historical census records. Consisting of three one-day workshops held at UCL in Summer 2006, the workshop series brought together expertise across different domains to ascertain how useful, possible, or feasible it would be to analyse datasets from Ancestry and The National Archives using the HPC facilities available at UCL. This article details the academic, technical, managerial, and legal issues highlighted in the project when attempting to apply HPC to historical data sets. Additionally, generic issues facing humanities researchers attempting to utilise HPC technologies in their research are presented.	adams1995 | anderson2001 | ahds2004 | ahds2005 | ahds2006 | ahrc2006 | bbc2004 | blaikie2005 | brodlie2004 | burnett1980 | campop2006 | crocket2006 | davies2005 | davies2006 | dillon2001 | dunn1946 | dunn2009 | ep1996 | fleury1956 | fure2000 | garrett2006 | garrett2003 | gutmann1977 | higgs2005 | hc1992 | hc1994 | hc2006 | holmes2006 | huntington2007 | impedovo1993 | inman2002 | itic2003 | iso2005 | katz1972 | kingston2006 | lloyd2004 | mansfield2006 | mcgraw1989 | mcgraw1990 | mills1989 | newcombe1988 | nitsch2006 | nicholas2006 | perkyns1991 | perkyns1993 | prdh2000 | reid2006 | riedel2007 | robey2006 | sauleau2005 | schurer2002 | shadbolt1990 | stallings2005 | stallings2008 | terras2006 | tilley2003a | tilley2003b | tillot1972 | ucl2006a | ucl2006b | warwick2008 | winchester1970 | winkler2001 | woollard1997	1	
000071	Ainsworth, Peter | Meredith, Michael	2010	e-Science for Medievalists: Options, Challenges, Solutions and Opportunities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Medievalists typically resort to parchment for primary research and when editing their sources. Not always accurately catalogued, manuscripts copied onto animal skins may have started life in the same workshop but over the centuries have become dispersed, coming to rest in libraries all over the world; bringing these together entails travel, microfilm purchases and reassembly and collation of the data within reach of a microfilm reader. These unwieldy machines afford only moderate scope for exploring single manuscripts at close quarters. High-resolution digitisation yields not just better surrogates in full colour; it allows for the development of additional research tools using image compression and manipulation, and new modes of representation, e.g. juxtaposed display of several related witnesses. This paper outlines research questions underpinning the development of an electronic tool for viewing, transcribing and manipulating manuscripts; it moves on to show how the viewer can be adapted for access from remote sites, to compare and annotation one or more witnesses (interactively and in real time), and for use as an integral part of an online edition. Finally, it explores how it can be deployed for use on projects taking knowledge outside the academy: in museums, galleries and other public spaces.	ainsworth | kiernan1997	1	
000072	Gold, Nicolas	2010	Service-Oriented Software in the Humanities: A Software Engineering Perspective	Digital Humanities Quarterly	Software Engineering, as a sub-discipline of the broader field of computer science, is concerned with the production, use, and maintenance of large, complex software systems. On first inspection, the set of managerial and technical activities involved in software engineering appears to be somewhat orthogonal to core research activity in the humanities, being concerned more with the production of research-enabling software systems than the research itself. However, as the scale of software used in digital humanities has increased, it is becoming clear that there are ways in which software engineering can inform, inspire, and aid in the management of the larger-scale software systems now being constructed in these disciplines. In particular, the development of service technology to aid in the production of flexible software systems for business now offers opportunities, not only for collaborative data sharing, but also the modelling, capture, provenancing, and replay of the research (and possibly creative) process itself. This paper examines, from the perspective of a software engineer relatively new to the digital humanities, how the recent developments in service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new approaches to digital enquiry in the arts and humanities. The first part of the paper presents a brief history of software engineering, with particular reference to the aspects that have led to service-oriented architectures. In the second part, the paper offers some thoughts on how certain aspects of service-oriented architectures could be used to enable new kinds of computer-based research and practice in the arts and humanities. It also introduces important national initiatives in this area, such as the JISC e-Framework programme for Higher Education.	bennett2001a | bennett2001b | brereton1999 | brooks1987 | deroure2008 | dunn2007 | ieee1990 | iso2002 | jisc2007 | kernighan1988 | kotsiopoulos2003 | krafzig2004 | lientz1980 | naur1969 | oasis2007 | parnas1972 | peltz2003 | swanson1976 | syed2006 | szyperski2002 | cnmat2007 | w3c2005 | whitbread2007	1

This essay discusses the purpose of doing such a thing, arguing there is a distinct method in the apparent randomness of labelling something e this or that. Far from simply denoting that it might be done with computers (and, indeed, what isn't today), Sporton argues that beyond the effect of explaining this is something to do with technology, there is an emergent e-culture that reunites the arts and sciences after two hundred years of separate development within the academy. An e-Culture emerges that reflects the values, opportunities and restrictions of Internet as a research environment. The potential of that environment requires a mindset focussed on collaboration to achieve anything of creative significance.	foucault1979 | hargreaves1982 | kuhn1962 | snow1959 | sporton2007	1

Based on the results of a study conducted by the Public Knowledge Project and introduced at Digital Humanities 2006 (Siemens, Willinsky and Blake), continued and augmented since, this paper discusses the reactions of Humanities Computing scholars and graduate students to using a set of online reading tools. The results of our study reveal both the potential strengths and perceived weaknesses of online reading environments. Understanding how users read and evaluate research materials, anticipating users’ expectations of the reading tools and resources, and addressing user concerns about the availability of online material will lead to improvements in the design and features of online publishing.	 | afflerbach1990 | alexander2003 | chen2006 | kopak2006 | pressley1995 | schreibman2004 | siemens | stanitsek2005 | tapor | twomey2007 | willinsky2003 | willinsky2007 | windschuttle1997 | wineburg1991 | wineburg1998 | wyatt1993	1	
000076	Piccini, Angela	2010	Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space: Challenging the Institutionalized Spaces of e-Science	Digital Humanities Quarterly	This paper arises out of a brief period in the early- to mid-2000s when the British funding and research climate facilitated a relationship between the technical, operational language of e-Science and the creative and performing arts. It concerns the ways in which live creative practices produce media traces that are fractured across screens and networks to produce new spatial relations between live events and their records. The split and contradictory subjectivities produced in these highly mediatized environments bring to the fore creative tensions between the live event and the recorded document. That is, the discourses, technologies and practices (if we may separate these) of e-Science not only produce new, spatial connections between events and their archives, they enact the liveness of archives as they are accessed and recombined to produce new art forms. Locating Grid Technologies: Performativity, Place, Space, a research workshop series funded by the A&H e-Science Initiative in its 2006 round, aimed to investigate how e-Science technologies might inform new understandings of space and time for distributed, creative research practices. Arts and technology researchers from the UK, US and Japan met to generate, analyze and re-use audio-visual documents of distributed practice-led research. Specifically, the project sought to combine and repurpose e-Science tools in order to investigate the spatial relationships produced between time-based, live events and their immediately mediatized traces. This paper investigates those performative fragmentations of place and space. It suggests that the potentialities and pitfalls of e-Science tools and technologies present fertile material for the arts researcher, particularly within the area of practice-based research: from the politics of surveillance to the aesthetics of video compression, from the ethics of multidisciplinary collaboration to the theoretical implications of mixing video time and space with the time and space of the performance event.	ahds2006 | ahrc2007 | bergson1912 | birringer1999 | bolter2000 | butler1990 | century2005 | connolly2002 | delahunta2002 | derrida1995 | dixon2007 | flynn2002 | galloway2008 | giannachi2007 | gibson1979 | haraway1998 | imperiale2000 | kittler1999 | leatherbarrow2002 | manovich2002 | melville1851 | phelan1993 | piccini | poindexter2002 | ricoeur1999	1	
000077	Borgman, Christine L.	2010	The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities	Digital Humanities Quarterly	The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and infrastructure — all of which are necessary for achieving academic recognition. As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are called to action with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?	ainsworth2009 | adho2009 | anderson2004 | arch2004 | arxiv2009 | arzberger2004 | atkins2007 | atkins2003 | ayres2004 | bailey2005 | baker2009 | bates1996a | bates1996b | bates1993 | bates1995 | bell2009 | bollen2008 | borgman1999 | borgman2000 | borgman2007 | borgman2009 | borgman2008 | borgmanetal2007 | buckland1991 | case2006 | cclearn2009 | choudhury2008 | choudhury2007 | crane2006 | crane2007 | crane2001 | creative2009 | cronin2005 | cyber2007 | david2003 | davidspence2003 | digging2009 | dhm2009 | doaj2009 | doar2008 | drucker2009 | duguid2007 | ebird2009 | edwards2007 | ecai2009 | eprints2010 | foster2009 | friedlander2008 | friedlander2009 | frischer2009 | galison1997 | gray2005 | gray2002 | greenstein2004 | hamma2009 | hey2009 | hoofnagle2009 | hypercities2009 | iath2009 | ivanhoe2009 | jaschik2008 | jaschik2009 | jpmc2000 | jsah2009 | kanfer2000 | king2006 | kurtz2010 | llddc2005 | lynch2002 | lynch2003 | lynch1995 | mahoney2002 | manovich2009 | marchionini1994 | mass2006 | mith2009 | monastersky2005 | nctm2009 | ninch2002 | nunberg2009 | oecd2007 | oerc2009 | olson2000 | oaip2009 | oca2009 | opencit2009 | opened2009 | panstarrs2009 | pea2003 | perseus2009 | poe2001 | presner2010 | presner2009 | pb2009 | reedijk2008 | rmoais2002 | rpe2009 | rice2008 | rome2009 | samuelson2009 | scheiner2004 | sc2009 | swaw3c2009 | save2009 | sherpa2009 | siegfried1993 | sloan2006 | smith2002 | stone1982 | src2009a | src2009b | szalay2008 | case2009 | effect2009 | facts2005 | thierstein2009 | tibbo2003 | thl2009 | ukrc2009 | ucgbs2009 | ukda2009 | ucps2009 | unsworth2006 | vanhouse2004 | vectors2009 | whalen2009 | wiberley2003 | wiberley1994 | willinsky2006 | willinsky2009	1

The field is expanding and at the same time being negotiated, and this article explores the idea of a broadly conceived landscape of digital humanities in some depth. It is argued that awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field. The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a flythrough of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails. The second part is an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool, study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue.	actlab | aoir | bell2007 | bolter2003 | boyd2009 | bradley2008 | braudy2006 | brown2009 | cch2006 | croxall2009 | daniel2007 | davidson2008 | davidson2009 | davidson2004 | dhq2010a | dhq2010b | douglass2009 | drucker2009a | drucker2009b | empyre | french2009a | french2009b | galison1997 | golden2010 | golumbia2009 | hall2008 | haylesa | haylesb | howard2009 | hunsinger2005 | iath | ihde2003 | ish2008 | ippolito2009 | janlert2000 | juhasz2009 | kagan2009 | kirschenbaum2004 | klein1990 | knorr1999 | kroker2008 | lamarre2010 | laue2004 | livingstone2003 | lovgren2004 | mactavish2006 | manovich2009a | manovich2009b | mccarty2009 | mccarty2010 | mcgann2002 | mcgonigal2008 | mcpherson2007 | mcpherson2008 | mcpherson2009a | mcpherson2009b | meloni2009 | navas2009 | parry2010 | peters2009 | pliny2006 | preemptivemedia | presner2009 | presner2010 | rabkin2006 | raley2009 | ratto2006 | rockwell2008 | schnapp2009 | schreibman2004 | shrum2005 | sinclair2002 | sinclair2002a | silver2006 | simanowski2009 | sterne2005 | stockholm1998 | stone2005 | svensson1998 | svensson2009a | svensson2009b | shanks2008 | unsworth1999 | vectors2004 | vectors2006a | vectors2006b | wiberg2005 | woodward2009 | zorich2008 | manifesto | hastac	1

HES was the world's first word processor to run on commercial equipment. It was also the first hypertext system that beginners could use, and pioneered many modern hypertext concepts for personal use. Although the idea of hypertext predates HES and FRESS, this article argues that these two systems were successful because they demonstrated hypertext to a sceptical public; they were both working prototypes.	barnet2008 | barnet2007 | barnet2006 | barnet2005 | bush1945 | carmody1967 | ceruzzi1998 | childress1998 | conklin1987 | derose1999 | engelbart1999 | nelson1999 | nyce1991 | owens1991 | vandam1987 | vandam1999 | wardrip2003 | wolf1995	1
