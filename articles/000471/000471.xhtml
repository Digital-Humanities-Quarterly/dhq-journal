                  <p>The computational tradition in India goes back to the two historic archival
                     projects Project Madurai, a digitised collection of ancient Tamil classics and
                     Bichitra, a digital variorum of Rabindranath Tagore’s works which remarked the
                     genesis of Digital Humanities in India. Subsequently, few public and private
                     universities, non-academic organisations and individual scholars are actively
                     involved in digital humanities projects: digital library, digital archive and
                     digital databases. Though these digital establishments underpin Indian
                     humanities scholars to engage in digital humanities research practices, the
                     challenges in infrastructure impede them from leveraging the computational
                     techniques and resources. In this paper, we will study the specific challenges
                     of physical infrastructure such as digital humanities lab, digital humanities
                     pedagogy, digital tools and software, and institution and government support. We
                     will also discuss the brief survey report and few interviews which we conducted
                     from the Indian DH community to reinforce our arguments.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In 2016, P.P. Sneha published a report “Mapping Digital
                     Humanities in India.” This is the first and foremost article that
                     attempts to define Digital Humanities (DH) in Indian context and highlights some
                     significant current DH projects. She records that DH is in “incipient stage” in India [<a class="ref" href="#sneha2016">Sneha 2016</a>, 16].
                     However, the several key events in the recent past indicate that DH in India is
                     steadily moving from an incipient stage to a “progressive
                     stage.” These events include the recent launch of Digital Humanities
                     Alliance of India [<a class="ref" href="#dhai2018">DHAI 2018</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e235">[1]</a>, the inaugural conference of
                     DHAI<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e239">[2]</a> and introduction of DH courses and programmes<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e244">[3]</a>. The government schemes for public
                     institutions such as Scheme for Promotion Academic and Research Collaboration
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sparc2018">SPARC 2018</a>], Impacting Research Innovation and Technology
                     [<a class="ref" href="#imprint2015">IMPRINT 2015</a>] and Impactful Policy Research in Social
                     Sciences [<a class="ref" href="#impress2019">IMPRESS 2019</a>] include DH/DH related areas as a domain
                     and subdomain. Besides these initiatives, we can also see the increase in the
                     number of DH courses, conferences, workshops, and seminars<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e253">[4]</a>
                     that are located in the India map (See Figure 1).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The map represents various DH activities of the few universities and colleges
                     from the south, north, east and west parts of the country. The
                     “blanks” in the map, reminds us that India is a
                     geographically big country and houses to a large number of public and private
                     institutions — and, by nature, DH requires sources such as funding and
                     high-technology, that is not possible for small colleges and universities that
                     have limited sources. However, this map illustrates the nascent stage of DH as
                     an emerging discipline in India. Though the term DH has begun to be noticed in
                     the academic circle in 2010 [<a class="ref" href="#sneha2016">Sneha 2016</a>, 5], the
                     computational tradition of humanities in India goes back two decades with two
                     important archival projects such as Project Madurai [<a class="ref" href="#madurai1998">Project Madurai 1998</a>]
                     a digitised collection of ancient Tamil classics and Bichitra [<a class="ref" href="#bichitra2013">Bichitra 2013</a>], a digital variorum of Rabindranath Tagore’s works
                     which remarked the genesis of DH in India. Together with this, the recent
                     mainstream attention of both central and state governments on “Digitize India” (<a href="https://www.digitizeindia.gov.in/" onclick="window.open('https://www.digitizeindia.gov.in/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.digitizeindia.gov.in/</a>) and “Digital
                     India” (<a href="https://www.digitalindia.gov.in/" onclick="window.open('https://www.digitalindia.gov.in/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.digitalindia.gov.in/</a>) facilitate many large-scale
                     investments in digitization, digital library, curation, and preservation.
                     Digitize India, Delhi Archives and National Digital Library etc. are key
                     projects of this digital establishment. One of the primary objectives of these
                     projects is to make digital content available to the wider public, researchers
                     and academics. These kinds of digital initiatives open up a new horizon in the
                     landscape of humanities to engage in DH research practice by harnessing digital
                     tools and techniques. Nevertheless, there has been little attention and
                     investment in deploying these digital contents for advanced scholarly practice
                     which entails robust infrastructure.

                     challenges in infrastructure which impedes leveraging computational resources
                     and techniques for DH research practice in India. Hence, the questions we ask:
                     what are the specific challenges of infrastructure? and how do that affect DH
                     research practice in India? We endeavor to answer these questions along with a
                     case study which includes a brief survey and a few interviews<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e297">[5]</a> conducted for our paper from academic and non-academic
                     organizations, and individual DH scholars respectively DHAI and CIS, DH group at
                     IIT Gandhinagar and few individual scholars and faculties in various
                     universities from different parts of India. For the survey, we shared our
                     questions with 55 DH scholars and faculties from 25 academic institutions
                     including public and private universities from different parts of the country.
                     The responses were relatively low, and we have received 17 responses to the
                     survey (See Appendix 1). This paper aims to detail both the challenges and
                     opportunities of the institutionalization of the Indian DH community. In the
                     following sections, we will examine the critical issues and challenges in
                     infrastructure such as the lack of physical space, DH pedagogy, digital tools
                     and software, institution and government and support which hinder DH research
                     practice in India. We will also discuss the interviews and survey report to
                     substantiate our arguments and finally, we will present the conclusion of this
                     article.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">What is infrastructure? Infrastructure provides more effective technical systems
                     and services, for instance, from road to electricity, train, telephone and
                     Internet and so on. The characteristics of infrastructure are to enable,
                     facilitate, organize, support and manage any given system [<a class="ref" href="#edwards2009">Edwards et al.,                 2009</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2012">Rockwell G 2012</a>]

                     organization. It is also apposite to the infrastructure of DH. Many scholars
                     have been discussed the term infrastructure for DH (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#arms2007">Arms and Larsen 2007</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#crane2009">Crane et al. 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#brown2010">Brown and Greengrass 2010</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2016">Edmond 2016</a>]. There are few terms
                     such as real infrastructure, research infrastructure, academic infrastructure
                     and cyberinfrastructure are used to refer to the necessities of DH structure.
                     These terms employed to discuss various components which include from digital
                     libraries to digital artefact, data organization, digital tools, publication,
                     digital pedagogy, digital literacy, data management etc. In his book <cite class="title italic">Big Digital Imagining: a Meeting Place for the Humanities and
                        the Digital Humanities</cite>, Patrik Svensson discourses the various
                     components of humanities and digital humanities infrastructure which he draws
                     from his experience in various DH projects as a director of HUMlab Umeå
                     University. He says, 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           It is not possible to imagine digital humanities — or
                           any kind of humanities — without infrastructure. However, most of the
                           humanities may not think of itself in terms of infrastructure, and the
                           digital humanities must engage with infrastructure not just where doing
                           so may come most naturally, such as language technology and archaeology,
                           but wherever there is a need. Engagement is required not just in terms
                           of building and using infrastructure but also in terms of
                           conceptualizing and critiquing infrastructure. [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>, 131]

                     is applicable to the Indian context. In India, as we have seen in the
                     introduction, the rise in the digital initiatives is an impetus for Indian DH
                     scholars to engage in knowledge practices and take part in the global context.
                     Nonetheless, the local exigencies of “conceptualizing and
                     critiquing infrastructure” of humanities encumber digital research
                     practices [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>, 131]. For instance, if a scholar is
                     interested in analyzing the data from the open-access archive through
                     computational methods, he/she requires digital tools and software, training and
                     finally a platform for publishing his/her outcome. Or if a scholar is interested
                     in digitizing and archiving some historical document online, he/she requires a
                     workspace (DH lab), computational skills, digital machine for scanning the

                     collaborates with a computer specialist for an archival project — he/she
                     requires the basic knowledge of how the interfaces of digital intricacies work
                     in the archive and how to maintain the archive for its sustainability. These
                     paradigms demonstrate that “[i]nfrastructural systems are
                     not and have never been one thing” and the multifaceted
                     infrastructures are indispensable for a holistic approach to digital research

                     material and non-material infrastructures shape the outcome and how the
                     deficiency in one will affect the other one.

                           materialised...Teaching DH has been a challenge for me as I don't have any
                           formal education/training in it. But students’ response has been very
                           encouraging and they like the practical part of the course where they are
                           exposed to some open source softwares like voyant, QGIS, Gephi, Ngram and
                           some other text analytics tools. The theoretical debates also generate a lot
                           of interest amongst our students. But the problems that students as well as
                           teachers face in the course are mainly related to the availability of course
                           material and fast changing digital tools.

                           difficult for the students to grasp the basics of DH and how the study
                           benefits research on Arts, Heritage and Culture. Having no infrastructure it
                           becomes tough to demonstrate the softwares and their specific usages that
                           restrict the study only to the theoretical level rather than practical
                           applications. I believe every University and Department should have an
                           introductory course on DH, if not a specific module...The other constraint
                           is getting trained professionals in the team for planning and

                           the digital studies as a new area of research. The other aspects is that
                           when comes to technological support, for example the data visualization
                           tools on mapping are not always accessible and also people are not
                           completely aware of digital tools. We can guide students to identifying
                           their research data and offer research ideas but when comes to realizing in

                     open source tools, which do not require much programming skills and apply for
                     their work. But, in some cases such as the critical inquiry of the text through
                     an algorithm or developing digital archive, they seek help from the external
                     support as Rath mentioned above. However, this is not possible for all other
                     state and central university faculties/scholars as they do not have the
                     facilities of funding, services and support for their research from their

                     scholars who directly come from the traditional humanities. In the inaugural
                     conference of DHAI, the panels presented diverse DH projects such as digital
                     infrastructure, pedagogy, scholarly publishing, and archive etc. but just very
                     few presentations on the digital tool and text mining. Does this mean that the
                     current Indian DH scholars are disinterested in text mining? Nothing could be
                     further from the truth, this comes not from disinterestedness but the lack of
                     technical proficiency. These scholars come from traditional humanities with
                     little education on computer applications but very much interested in employing
                     digital technologies and heuristics for their innovative digital research. This
                     gives “a little confidence or inclination to understand the

                     faculties are that they can find very rare platforms for learning digital tools
                     and technologies for their research in country like India which “supplies millions of software engineers to the world”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mukherjee2008">Mukherjee 2008</a>]. At the same time, not all humanities scholars
                     and faculties have fund to attend winter and summer schools, workshops on DH
                     which often occur in the west, for instance, DHSI (<a href="http://www.dhsi.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.dhsi.org/'); return false" class="ref">http://www.dhsi.org/</a>) etc. In India, a
                     few DH avenues conduct various workshops and winter school on digital tools. The
                     DHPSR group at IIT Indore conducted one-week workshop on “Digital Humanities: Tools, Texts, Theories” in which R and some
                     online tools such as Voyant were taught [<a class="ref" href="#gian2018">GIAN Digital Humanities 2018</a>]. Similarly,
                     CDH Pune conducts winter school on DH every year since 2015 and in the recent
                     workshop which provided training in using Omeka tool for content development
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cdh2013">CDH 2013</a>]. These platforms offer some opportunities to DH
                     scholars and faculties to learn tools and methods for their research.
                     Additionally, self-paced learning becomes very common in the digital era due to
                     the open access system — some scholars, who are active on the Internet, learn
                     many open DH resources of tools and techniques<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e566">[7]</a>. However,
                     the knowledge in data management and data organization is also equally important
                     as one participant wrote in the survey as “setting up a
                     research method garnered to mining and categorising digital data has been a
                     challenge.” Correspondingly, during our interviews, some scholars
                     expressed the challenge of “know-how”” of digital tools and
                     software. Few scholars even end up giving their digital research practice after
                     many attempts due to lack technical competency.

                     literacy, the curriculum of humanities students has to implement the DH pedagogy
                     and training at graduation level which will give the confidence to the scholars
                     to understand the intricacy behind digital technologies and data harvesting and
                     to implement it in their research practices. Dibyadyuti Roy is one of the
                     co-founders of DHARTI who tells us about the DHARTI’s contribution on DH in
                     India: “I would personally like to see the DH curriculum
                     permeate not only into universities but schools and vocational institutes as
                     well. Organizing free-to-attend workshops that allow DH to become accessible
                     for all kinds of audiences would be one goal that I would see for
                     DHARTI.” As he says, such local initiatives of free-to-attend or
                     nominal fee workshops, summer and winter schools will be helpful for the current
                     research scholars to improve their technical proficiency. Notwithstanding, the
                     inaccessibility and unavailability of digital tools and software are also
                     significant obstacles that remain unaddressed.

                     physics, and computer science… [, it] gained a central place in the
                     humanities only with the migration of texts to the web”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pawlicka2017">Pawlicka 2017</a>, 535]. Digital technologies have a crucial
                     role to archive/analyze/map such kind of data/text in DH. However, for Indian DH
                     scholars, many constraints from the local limit the possibilities of the desired
                     outcome to archive or analyze the data. The deficit in digital technologies for
                     Indian languages is one such limiting factor which affects digital research in
                     Indian languages and literatures as Murray and Hand observe, “humanities work in Indic languages has been impeded by the
                     lack of optimized [optimal] character recognition software”
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#murray2015">#murray2015</a></span>. There are a few government initiatives

                     attempt to facilitate the basic digital technologies such as “[w]ord Processing, Presentation preparation, Spread Sheets

                     Indian languages for public use and scholarly activity [<a class="ref" href="#aboutildc2008">About ILDC 2008</a>]. Nevertheless, these digital technologies are
                     inadequate for the DH scholars whose research focus on the works in Indian
                     languages. Prashant Bhattacharji, in his article “Computer
                     Science in India: A restricted student pool?”, quotes Microsoft’s
                     CTO, Craig Mundie’s remark on Indian Computer Engineers as “[they] are more into theory, [t]here is no local software and no new
                     applications” in Indian languages [<a class="ref" href="#bhattacharji2014">Bhattacharji P 2014</a>].
                     As he says, the dearth of digital tools and software in Indian languages is a
                     major limitation that is specific issue of the Global South [<a class="ref" href="#bhattacharji2014">Bhattacharji P 2014</a>]. The main issue stems from the disciplinary
                     divide of humanities and computer science. Even though some traditional
                     humanities scholars use digital archives and databases, they perceive employing
                     computing for humanities research as more critical and pose epistemological
                     skepticism in the concept of technology and text as data. Furthermore, the
                     inadequacy of fund and the lack of institutional service and support thwart
                     humanities scholar to have access to the payable digital technologies, and

                     from the institutes for advancing humanities research in India. When the DH
                     scholars require resources for their research which are similar to the science
                     counterpart such a demand or request is viewed with skepticism by both
                     bureaucracy and departmental administration. In traditional humanities, the idea
                     of DH is still perceived with skepticism. Scholars such as Stanley Fish and
                     Timothy Brennan have also argued that DH becomes applied cousin of foundational
                     humanities [<a class="ref" href="#fish2012">Fish 2012</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#brennan2017">Brennan 2017</a>].
                     Administrations in most universities are not able to comprehend the seemingly
                     contradictory term “Digital Humanities.” It is easier in
                     autonomous institutions such as IITs and elite private universities than in
                     state or central universities that are already constrained in funding resources.
                     In 2009, Shreesh Chaudhary in an article, “India: Science
                     and technology vs the humanities” points out the huge funding
                     difference between science and technological institutions (STIs) and humanities
                     and social sciences institutions (HSTs). He says that science and technology
                     institutes are funded by ministries of science and technology, defence, IT and
                     industry. They receive some US$20 million a year for routine expenses, plus
                     millions more from foreign agencies, non-government organizations, foreign
                     governments and international bodies, as well as alumni donations for
                     non-routine expenses [<a class="ref" href="#chaudhary2009">Chaudhary S                 2009</a>]. He says, “the HSIs receive only crumbs. …While finance is not a problem
                     for the STIs, it is a big problem for the others…The HSIs are starved of
                     funds. They cannot provide even a minimal standard working environment for
                     their academics and neither can they for their students.”

                     endeavors are receiving funds galore; the situation is not quite as rosy at
                     the other end. Humanities scholars in India are unable to catch a break.

                     model or profit model of education, falling enrollments, adjunct faculty system
                     and so on [<a class="ref" href="#berube1995">Bérubé and Nelson 1995</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#jay2014">Jay 2014</a>]. The disproportionation in the funding between science
                     and humanities seem common in many countries. Frank Donoghue points out the
                     unequal outside funding for American colleges and universities as, “almost all of the federal resources [that] is dedicated to
                     research in the sciences and engineering, the humanities has suffered
                     everywhere”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#donoghue2008">Donoghue 2008</a>, 126]. In Britain, if the humanists are unable
                     to show their contribution to economic profitability — their fund will drop and
                     the number of faculties and students also will decline [<a class="ref" href="#nussbaum2012">Nussbaum 2012</a>, 127]. On the other hand, in India, the
                     allocation of fund for humanities especially for research activities is meager
                     when compared to science and technology institutes. Pant and Dass draw the
                     disparity in the fund allocation to Indian Council of Social Science Research
                     (ICSSR) from 2006 to 2010 — the total grant given to “ICSSR
                     was only 2.3% of the amount provided to the Council of Scientific and
                     Industrial Research (CSIR), Of the funds given to ICSSR, only 20% could be
                     used for research purposes, while the rest of the amount was utilised for
                     meeting administrative costs, highlighting the lack of seriousness given to
                     these subjects”

                     first universities in colonial India were established to focus on conducting

                     science has many benefits such as “a slew of scholarships
                     and grants right from high school levels” and he also points out the
                     social pressure on good students to study science [<a class="ref" href="#gangopadhyay2012">Gangopadhyay 2012</a>]. Therefore, the increase number of scholarships
                     for studying science and the social pressure to choose science over the

                     service and support in terms of both human and non-human sources for DH
                     scholars. For instance, some institutions do not even have the basic facilities
                     such as Internet as one of the survey participants mentioned as “[w]e don’t have access to basic facilities regularly like the
                     Internet and all.” Also, the completion of the project is not the end
                     of the project — it is just the beginning for the users. For example, the
                     scholars require institutes’ support to maintain some dynamic projects such as
                     digital databases and archives which require human resources and digital tools
                     to update, disseminate and maintain the longevity of the data. But these
                     projects are neglected and conceived as a digital product which requires only a
                     digital space in the institute’s web portal. Most of these projects have
                     remained unprocessed and stagnant on the institute’s computer. For instance,

                     Lack of fund to attend international and national conferences and workshops
                     obstruct developing contacts for collaborative projects. This absence of social

                     establishment of DH in India. We also asked the survey participants to state the

                     an interdisciplinary field of research practice is <em class="emph">invisible/hidden</em>
                     under the rubric of humanities but it continuous to be <em class="emph">visible/site</em>
                     through the research practices and projects of these DH scholars and faculties
                     in many private and public universities. The gradual increase in courses,
                     conferences and workshops gives us a scope of DH in India as an emerging field
                     and we can anticipate many interesting programmes and projects in future. That
                     is good news. The bad news is that our university ecosystem and administrative
                     mechanism are slow to respond to these intellectual and infrastructure
                     challenges. It, therefore, behooves all of us who are invested in pushing the
                     boundaries of research pedagogy and learning in the humanities to emphasize and
                     facilitate the supporting role of DH within the larger rubric of humanities.
                     Those efforts may open avenues for critical inquiry to continue to fulfill our
                     mandate as humanities scholars and researchers in a democratic nation state.
