            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>Roopika Risam’s <title rend="italic">New Digital Worlds</title> interrogates the
               ongoing digitization of analog cultural records that came into existence during colonial
               times. Risam contends that the processes which produced the initial analog records were
               often animated by a mix of ethical egoism, racial bias and cultural caricature. Risam
               proposes a way out by embracing decolonial computing: a spectrum of techniques that seek
               to elevate historically-disadvantaged worldviews. Risam hopes to employ interventionist
               data approaches to address the challenges brought to bear upon peoples continually
               affected by colonial aggression.</p>

      <body>
        
         <p>Traditionally, the field known as digital humanities (DH) brings digital computational
            methods to bear on traditional humanities scholarship. When digital humanities tools are
            applied to cultural artifacts, sociofacts and mentifacts, a <term>digital
               cultural record</term> may be produced. Post-colonial digital humanities (PDH) pushes
            the envelope by interrogating the 'human' in digital humanities. PDH approaches the
            digital cultural record by way of a hermeneutic of suspicion, recognizing that there
            exists no suppositionless position from which to engage DH. Concretely, PDH rests on the
            premise that, in creating the first analog cultural records, colonial authorities chose
            to advance colonial interests whenever such interests bifurcated from those of the
            colonized. When such analog records are eventually digitized, inherent imperfections
            simply migrate into the digital domain. </p>
         <p>In <title rend="italic">New Digital Worlds</title>, Roopika Risam takes the position that such
            migration of imperfections precipitates the disruptions that subsist within the digital
            cultural record. PDH, consequently, aims to uncover and intervene in disruptions
            produced by colonialism and neocolonialism. It tackles the shadows cast by the
            hermeneutical position of the colonizers who created cultural records for the colonized. </p>
         <p>The digital cultural record, as a by-product of historical research work, naturally
            inherits all the riddles emanating from the historical method. For instance, the word
            history means 'what happened in the past', but it also means 'the study of what happened
            in the past'. Historians often make a distinction between <emph>histories
               from above</emph> <ptr target="#katz2013"/> and <emph>histories from below</emph> <ptr target="#bhattacharya1983"/>
          <title rend="italic">. Histories from Above</title> dwell upon the big
            books, the big concepts, the big institutions, the big thinkers, the big events and the
            so-called golden ages. <title rend="italic">Histories from Below</title>, on the other hand,
            account for historical events from the perspective of ordinary people rather than
            leaders – emphasizing the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the non-conformists,
            and other marginal groups.</p>
         <p>In light of those two broad approaches to history, questions immediately arise regarding
            the production of the digital cultural record. PDH embraces <title rend="italic">history
               from below</title>, while accusing colonial authorities of embracing history from above.
            Throughout the book, Risam maintains the need to checkmate the potential and actual
            violence that colonized peoples have endured because of the existence of uncritiqued
            cultural records, whether analog or digital, coming from above. Risam gives several
            reasons why such interventions are necessary. </p>
         <p>To begin with, the uncritiqued digital cultural record has consequences for people’s
            lives. Risam cites an example from Puerto Rico. Following the devastation of Hurricane
            Maria in 2017, it was found that existing digital maps (created by digitizing colonial
            analog maps) were insufficient to support relief efforts. People suffered and died as
            relief agencies faced difficulties in navigating the devastated island. The Mapathon
            project, a PDH endeavor, helped fill the <quote rend="inline">gaps and omissions</quote> <ptr target="#risam2018" loc="24"/>
            subsisting in the initial maps. Updated maps produced by the Mapathon project helped to
            render relief efforts more efficient, thereby saving hundreds of lives.</p>
         <p>In addition, re-evaluating the cultural record will help to checkmate the epistemic
            violence which animated its initial production. Ontological categories do not typically
            translate properly from one culture to another. Consequently, the colonial endeavour to
            articulate universal claims generally meets with deep-seated conceptual stumbling
            blocks. Colonizing empires often created justifying narratives by resorting to making
            caricatures of peoples, things, and mores that do not fit snugly into the colonial
            mindset. Evidence of such caricatures abound in historical records: records which end up
            getting digitized. A lot of psychic damage occurs when such records are employed in
            education, as colonized youths find themselves at the receiving end of a pedagogy
            designed for mockery. Timely interventions by PDH will go a long way in correcting those
            anomalies.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, carefully crafted PDH projects will help to stem the tide of widespread
            misrepresentation – one of the consequences of broadcasting widespread caricatures.
            Nowadays, millions of people get their information from digital media. Inundating
            digital media with negatively-biased cultural records exponentially multiplies
            opportunities for misrepresentation, naturally leading to pervasive misunderstanding and
            a breakdown in communication. A cascade of errors ensues, first leading to a devaluing
            of Black and indigenous lives, then to the defunding of African-American, Americana,
            Black, and Ethnic studies, as witnessed in a number of universities in the West <ptr target="#risam2018" loc="15"/> <ptr target="#rhodes2016"/> <ptr target="#brewer2019"/>. </p>
         <p>Another reason to embrace PDH is to further enhance knowledge from the margins, an
            emphasis of history from below. A famous African thinker once said that until the lions
            have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter
            <ptr target="#brooks1994"/>. By choosing to lend a voice to the historically-disadvantaged <emph>digital </emph>Dalits and subalterns <ptr target="#risam2018" loc="10"/>, Risam hopes to
            explore the unexamined questions of power, globalization, and colonial ideologies
            (emanating from the global north) that have shaped the digital cultural record. By
            choosing to hear from the kings, queens, peasants, and outcasts of history, the author
            hopes to produce a richer encoding of the past as embodied in the digital cultural
            record.</p>
         <p>Going further, PDH intends to pay attention to decolonial computing, which calls for
            renewed attention to critical race theory within technocultures <ptr target="#risam2018" loc="139"/>. After
            much practice and rumination, data scientists eventually learn than data is not
            information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not understanding, understanding
            is not wisdom. Decolonial computing is about interrogating who is doing computing, where
            they are doing it, and, thereby, what computing means both epistemologically and
            ontologically. PDH questions the hitherto presumed political and ethical neutrality of
            computing techniques. Myriad questions about the objectivity of technical methods are
            re-examined in new light.</p>
         <p>This book is recommended for scholars that recognize the utmost importance of critical
            historiography, while intending to expand the frontiers of digital humanities. Risam
            walks the talk through a comprehensive listing of named PDH projects which take <title
               rend="italic">history from below</title> seriously. Risam’s unusual decision to examine
            the conceptual frameworks that animate the design of computing systems remains a good
            example of dialectical engagement animated by a philosophical spirit. The products of
            PDH research work will make tacit knowledge explicit, shed light upon hermeneutical
            blind spots, and shake up existing digital humanities pedagogy. The new approaches
            proposed will go a long way in answering many old, lingering questions. </p>
