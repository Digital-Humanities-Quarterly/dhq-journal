                  <p>Roopika Risam’s <cite class="title italic">New Digital Worlds</cite> interrogates the
                     ongoing digitization of analog cultural records that came into existence during colonial
                     times. Risam contends that the processes which produced the initial analog records
                     were
                     often animated by a mix of ethical egoism, racial bias and cultural caricature. Risam
                     proposes a way out by embracing decolonial computing: a spectrum of techniques that
                     seek
                     to elevate historically-disadvantaged worldviews. Risam hopes to employ interventionist
                     data approaches to address the challenges brought to bear upon peoples continually
                     affected by colonial aggression.</p>
                  </div>
               
               
               
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Traditionally, the field known as digital humanities (DH) brings digital computational
                  methods to bear on traditional humanities scholarship. When digital humanities tools
                  are
                  applied to cultural artifacts, sociofacts and mentifacts, a <em class="term">digital
                     cultural record</em> may be produced. Post-colonial digital humanities (PDH) pushes
                  the envelope by interrogating the 'human' in digital humanities. PDH approaches the
                  digital cultural record by way of a hermeneutic of suspicion, recognizing that there
                  exists no suppositionless position from which to engage DH. Concretely, PDH rests
                  on the
                  premise that, in creating the first analog cultural records, colonial authorities
                  chose
                  to advance colonial interests whenever such interests bifurcated from those of the
                  colonized. When such analog records are eventually digitized, inherent imperfections
                  simply migrate into the digital domain. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">In <cite class="title italic">New Digital Worlds</cite>, Roopika Risam takes the position that such
                  migration of imperfections precipitates the disruptions that subsist within the digital
                  cultural record. PDH, consequently, aims to uncover and intervene in disruptions
                  produced by colonialism and neocolonialism. It tackles the shadows cast by the
                  hermeneutical position of the colonizers who created cultural records for the colonized.
                  </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">The digital cultural record, as a by-product of historical research work, naturally
                  inherits all the riddles emanating from the historical method. For instance, the word
                  history means 'what happened in the past', but it also means 'the study of what happened
                  in the past'. Historians often make a distinction between <em class="emph">histories
                     from above</em> [<a class="ref" href="#katz2013">Katz 2013</a>] and <em class="emph">histories from below</em> [<a class="ref" href="#bhattacharya1983">Bhattacharya 1983</a>]
                  <cite class="title italic">. Histories from Above</cite> dwell upon the big
                  books, the big concepts, the big institutions, the big thinkers, the big events and
                  the
                  so-called golden ages. <cite class="title italic">Histories from Below</cite>, on the other hand,
                  account for historical events from the perspective of ordinary people rather than
                  leaders – emphasizing the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the non-conformists,
                  and other marginal groups.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">In light of those two broad approaches to history, questions immediately arise regarding
                  the production of the digital cultural record. PDH embraces <cite class="title italic">history
                     from below</cite>, while accusing colonial authorities of embracing history from above.
                  Throughout the book, Risam maintains the need to checkmate the potential and actual
                  violence that colonized peoples have endured because of the existence of uncritiqued
                  cultural records, whether analog or digital, coming from above. Risam gives several
                  reasons why such interventions are necessary. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">To begin with, the uncritiqued digital cultural record has consequences for people’s
                  lives. Risam cites an example from Puerto Rico. Following the devastation of Hurricane
                  Maria in 2017, it was found that existing digital maps (created by digitizing colonial
                  analog maps) were insufficient to support relief efforts. People suffered and died
                  as
                  relief agencies faced difficulties in navigating the devastated island. The Mapathon
                  project, a PDH endeavor, helped fill the “gaps and omissions” [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>, 24]
                  subsisting in the initial maps. Updated maps produced by the Mapathon project helped
                  to
                  render relief efforts more efficient, thereby saving hundreds of lives.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">In addition, re-evaluating the cultural record will help to checkmate the epistemic
                  violence which animated its initial production. Ontological categories do not typically
                  translate properly from one culture to another. Consequently, the colonial endeavour
                  to
                  articulate universal claims generally meets with deep-seated conceptual stumbling
                  blocks. Colonizing empires often created justifying narratives by resorting to making
                  caricatures of peoples, things, and mores that do not fit snugly into the colonial
                  mindset. Evidence of such caricatures abound in historical records: records which
                  end up
                  getting digitized. A lot of psychic damage occurs when such records are employed in
                  education, as colonized youths find themselves at the receiving end of a pedagogy
                  designed for mockery. Timely interventions by PDH will go a long way in correcting
                  those
                  anomalies.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">Furthermore, carefully crafted PDH projects will help to stem the tide of widespread
                  misrepresentation – one of the consequences of broadcasting widespread caricatures.
                  Nowadays, millions of people get their information from digital media. Inundating
                  digital media with negatively-biased cultural records exponentially multiplies
                  opportunities for misrepresentation, naturally leading to pervasive misunderstanding
                  and
                  a breakdown in communication. A cascade of errors ensues, first leading to a devaluing
                  of Black and indigenous lives, then to the defunding of African-American, Americana,
                  Black, and Ethnic studies, as witnessed in a number of universities in the West [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>, 15] [<a class="ref" href="#rhodes2016">Rhodes 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#brewer2019">Brewer 2019</a>]. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p8">Another reason to embrace PDH is to further enhance knowledge from the margins, an
                  emphasis of history from below. A famous African thinker once said that until the
                  lions
                  have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter
                  [<a class="ref" href="#brooks1994">Brooks 1994</a>]. By choosing to lend a voice to the historically-disadvantaged <em class="emph">digital </em>Dalits and subalterns [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>, 10], Risam hopes to
                  explore the unexamined questions of power, globalization, and colonial ideologies
                  (emanating from the global north) that have shaped the digital cultural record. By
                  choosing to hear from the kings, queens, peasants, and outcasts of history, the author
                  hopes to produce a richer encoding of the past as embodied in the digital cultural
                  record.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p9">Going further, PDH intends to pay attention to decolonial computing, which calls for
                  renewed attention to critical race theory within technocultures [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>, 139]. After
                  much practice and rumination, data scientists eventually learn than data is not
                  information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not understanding, understanding
                  is not wisdom. Decolonial computing is about interrogating who is doing computing,
                  where
                  they are doing it, and, thereby, what computing means both epistemologically and
                  ontologically. PDH questions the hitherto presumed political and ethical neutrality
                  of
                  computing techniques. Myriad questions about the objectivity of technical methods
                  are
                  re-examined in new light.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p10">This book is recommended for scholars that recognize the utmost importance of critical
                  historiography, while intending to expand the frontiers of digital humanities. Risam
                  walks the talk through a comprehensive listing of named PDH projects which take <cite class="title italic">history from below</cite> seriously. Risam’s unusual decision to examine
                  the conceptual frameworks that animate the design of computing systems remains a good
                  example of dialectical engagement animated by a philosophical spirit. The products
                  of
                  PDH research work will make tacit knowledge explicit, shed light upon hermeneutical
                  blind spots, and shake up existing digital humanities pedagogy. The new approaches
                  proposed will go a long way in answering many old, lingering questions. </div>
