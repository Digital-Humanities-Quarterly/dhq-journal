                  <p>This article suggests a computational method for the analysis of figurative language
                     as a network, using methods from natural 
                     language processing (NLP), particularly topic classification and network analysis.
                     The analysis of figurative language plays a major 
                     role in literary criticism and, to varying degrees, in other fields of the humanities
                     and social sciences whose orientation is 
                     textual. The analysis of figurative language, rather than literal language, poses
                     certain difficulties due to the very structure of 
                     figurative expressions. The suggested method in this articles offers a way to overcome
                     these difficulties. By taking as a case study 
                     the play <cite class="title italic">Timon of Athens</cite> by Shakespeare and Middleton, the article examines 
                     the method's ability to provide insights into the thematic concerns of a text, assess
                     existing interpretations, and develop a close 
                     reading.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In <span class="hi italic">The Arte of English Poesie</span>, George Puttenham demonstrates the abusive power of figurative language by referring
                     to the ancient Athenian judges of the Areopagus, who had decided “to forbid all manner
                     of figurative speeches to be used before them in their consistory of Justice, as mere
                     illusions of the mind and wresters of upright judgment” (Puttenham 1589, 239). Ironically,
                     although the Areopagite judges condemn the use of figurative language as deceptive,
                     they themselves use a metaphor of a carpenter in their condemnation, saying “that
                     to allow such manner of foreign and colored talk to make the judges affectioned were
                     all one as if the carpenter, before he began to square his timber, would make his
                     square crooked: inasmuch as the strait and upright mind of a judge is the very rule
                     of justice till it be perverted” (239). As much as the judges of ancient Athens wish
                     to banish all figurative language from their midst, they prove to be susceptible to
                     its power from within, unable to shake off the hold it has on their minds. The influence
                     of figurative language is not only evident here through the metaphor of the carpenter,
                     but it is rather the more subtle homonym senses of the words “upright” and “rule”
                     that truly reveal the pervasive power of the figurative. According to Lakoff and Johnson
                     in          <span class="hi italic">Metaphors We Live By</span>, “upright” is a part of a class of metaphors they call orientational, which rely
                     on our most basic sense of space and physical concepts, so much so that “without which
                     we could not function in the world – could not reason or communicate" (Lakoff and
                     Johnson 1980, 61). In this article I suggest a computational approach for the analysis
                     of figurative language, which employs two main methods, particularly topic classification
                     and network analysis, as well as offer as a case study an interpretation of the play
                     <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span> by Shakespeare and Middleton on the basis of the analysis.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The results of such an analysis of figurative language can provide insights into the
                     thematic concerns of a text and the forces that shape them, enabling us to return
                     differently to a close reading. Unlike an analysis of literal language with NLP (Natural
                     Language Processing), there are certain difficulties that arise due to the very structure
                     of figurative expressions. In the following section, I discuss the theory of figurative
                     language, particularly in relation to my argument regarding the network structure
                     of figurative language. The third section focuses on the computational methods; firstly,
                     on topic classification and modeling, as well as on training a classifier on the basis
                     of a dataset of four tragedies, and secondly, on network analysis and its application
                     to the conceptualization of figurative language as a network. In the fourth section
                     of this article, I test in two ways this method’s ability to provide meaningful information
                     on the analyzed text by applying it to the play     <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span>, first by assessing existing interpretations and secondly by combining it with a
                     close reading of the play. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In the end, computational methods and tools for research in the humanities are only
                     as valuable as the value they bring to scholars in the field, and they are not the
                     end in themselves. Simply using a computational tool and coming up with various quantifications
                     is unlikely to prove useful, as Thomas Kuhn argues and Franco Moretti applies to digital
                     humanities: “numbers gathered without some knowledge of the regularity to be expected
                     almost never speak for themselves” (Kuhn 1961, 175).  <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e218">[1]</a> Without developing a critical interpretation of the text, corpus or subject under
                     research on the basis of the computational analysis, we run the risk that the work
                     of digital humanists remains impenetrable and irrelevant to scholars in our field
                     who are unfamiliar with the methods.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">A metaphor brings together dissimilar worlds into play, connecting one conceptual
                     domain with another of a different kind. The connection between the tenor and the
                     vehicle of a metaphor, i.e., the underlying subject and the transported meaning, is
                     not a necessary one, but rather based on substitution and a relative freedom from
                     any constraints that a context may place on a word. After the occurrence of a metaphoric
                     transference of meaning between two conceptual domains, it is as though the tenor
                     and the vehicle simply go their separate ways and the contexts remain distinct. However,
                     this does not entail that a metaphor is merely a temporary displacement of meaning,
                     rather that, as I. A. Richards argues in <span class="hi italic">The Philosophy of Rhetoric</span>, “fundamentally it is a borrowing between and intercourse of thoughts, a transaction
                     between contexts” (Richards 1965, 100). Although the two parts of the metaphor may
                     remain distinct, they do not necessarily remain unchanged by the interaction, as each
                     carries a residue of the other. When a word, which had previously taken part in a
                     metaphor, takes on the role of either a tenor or a vehicle in a figurative expression,
                     it brings along to the exchange its recently acquired significations. According to
                     Richards: “the processes of metaphor in language, the exchanges between the meanings
                     of words which we study in explicit verbal metaphors, are super-imposed upon a perceived
                     world which is itself a product of earlier or unwitting metaphor” (108-9). This process
                     of meaning transference through metaphors, which takes place in relation to a previous
                     unwitting layer of metaphors, I argue, has the structure of a network, a network that
                     forms and reforms out of the various interactions between the metaphoric components.
                     Accordingly, the two layers of metaphors in Richards’ argument, the explicit and the
                     unwitting metaphors, are two aspects of the same network, the latter being the existing
                     state of the network while the former is the introduction of a new metaphoric instance.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The computational method that I propose in this article offers a way to systematize
                     this conceptualization of metaphors as a network. This process is described by Moretti
                     as “operationalization”, applying to digital humanities the work of Bridgman in the
                     philosophy of science, <span class="hi italic">The Logic of Modern Physics</span>. The example that Moretti brings from Bridgman concerns length: “to find the length
                     of an object we have to perform certain physical operations. The concept of length
                     is therefore fixed when the operations by which length is fixed are fixed” (Moretti
                     2013, 1). According to Moretti, regarding computational analysis and literary theory,
                     this means that we are able to take a literary concept and transform it into a set
                     of operations, “building a bridge from concepts to measurements, and then to the world
                     […], from concepts of literary theory, through some form of quantification, to literary
                     texts” (1). In this research, I have devised a set of operations that builds a bridge
                     between the concept of figurative language as a network, through a computational analysis,
                     to literary texts, mapping in this way the interrelatedness of metaphors in a given
                     text or corpus.  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The idea of metaphoric exchange as a network is implicitly present in the works of
                     various researchers, such as Lakoff and Johnson, Hans Blumenberg and I. A. Richards,
                     each theorizes about it from a different angle. Lakoff and Johnson’s theory of metaphors,
                     in  <span class="hi italic">Metaphors We Live By</span>, argue that metaphors are not simply a “rhetorical flourish”, but rather constitutive
                     of our perception of the world: “our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which
                     we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature” (3). They distinguish
                     between three major types of metaphors, orientational, ontological and structural,
                     and in certain cases the latter is “based on similarities that arise out of orientational
                     and ontological metaphors” (152). This substantiates my argument regarding the network
                     structure of figurative language, since the first two types of metaphors serve as
                     an underlying interconnected metaphoric structure, akin to Richards’ unwitting metaphors,
                     on the basis of which new and richer metaphoric exchange is possible.  <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e243">[2]</a> That metaphors have the structure of a network is arguably most evident in Lakoff
                     and Johnson’s notion of metaphorical entailment, according to which instances of a
                     structural metaphor such as   <span class="hi italic">time is money</span>, e.g. <span class="hi italic">time is a resource, time is a valuable commodity</span>, link between “all the instances of a single metaphorical structuring of a concept”
                     (96). Furthermore, entailments do not just tie together instances of the same metaphorical
                     structuring, but also create interactions between dissimilar metaphors, as Lakoff
                     and Johnson state: “a shared metaphorical entailment can establish a cross-metaphorical
                     correspondence” (96). </div>

                     judges according to Puttenham, ascribes the figurative with a secondary status, an
                     optional addition to the ‘real’ literal meaning of our verbal expressions. In <span class="hi italic">Paradigms for a Metaphorology, </span>Blumenberg questions whether all metaphoric expressions are in fact translatable to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Blumenberg gives the “<span class="hi italic">terra incognita</span>” metaphor as an example of an absolute metaphor, grounding it in the historical experiences
                     of the age of discovery, to which the metaphor provided an entire way of perceiving
                     reality, “a relation to the world that imagines itself to be standing on the threshold
                     of an immeasurable increase in knowledge” (54). Absolute metaphors are hence a part
                     of a historical network of metaphoric exchanges, as they both originate in specific
                     circumstances and they themselves “have a history” (5). Their absoluteness means that
                     they are resistant to conversion into conceptuality, but “not that one metaphor could
                     not be replaced or represented by another, or corrected through a more precise one”
                     (5). In other words, absolute metaphors manifest in various metaphoric instances and
                     they too take part in meaning transference, shaping other metaphors as well as being
                     reshaped by the exchanges.      </div>

                     of forces”, to use Moretti’s application of Thompson’s idea, i.e., a diagram that
                     discloses “the forces that have been at work” (Moretti 2005, 56) in shaping the network’s
                     structure. These forces are a resonance of the social reality and ideological significations
                     that underlie the production of a text, whether they are the result of a dominant
                     factor, such as politics, religion, psychology, or of any combination of factors.
                     An analysis of such a network makes it possible “to burrow down to the substructure
                     of thought, the underground” (Blumenberg 2010, 5), indicating to us “the fundamental
                     certainties, conjectures, and judgments in relation to which the attitudes and expectations,
                     actions and inactions […] of an epoch are regulated” (14). Unlike texts low on metaphors,
                     such as legal documents or medical books, texts saturated with figurative language,
                     such as poetry and early modern English drama, provide us with comprehensive networks
                     of metaphors, making them especially instrumental for the analysis of this substructure
                     of thought and the ideological forces that shape them.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p11">In order to operationalize the network structure of figurative language, the first
                        step that I suggest is to break down the figurative expressions into their components,
                        such as the tenor and vehicle, and classify which words in a given instance carry
                        a metaphoric meaning. For example, consider the following sentence from <span class="hi italic">Macbeth</span>: “Let's make us medicines of our great revenge” (IV.iii.217). The words “medicines”
                        and “revenge” are essential in this figurative instance, while a word such as “great”
                        does not carry a figurative significance. Although it could be argued that, in a sense,
                        “great” is also metaphoric, since it ascribes size to an abstract idea, i.e., revenge,
                        yet if the adjective of revenge were the word monstrous, there would hardly be a question
                        as to its metaphoric status, and it too would have been included in the analysis.
                        Separating the various figurative components enables us to trace the repetition of
                        the components in other metaphoric instances, mapping in this way the multiple interactions
                        that each component takes part in. However, constructing a network on the basis of
                        words would yield an immense network and, moreover, it would not be efficient for
                        capturing various manifestations of similar metaphors, such as in Lakoff and Johnson’s
                        example:     <span class="hi italic">time is money</span> and <span class="hi italic">time is a valuable commodity.</span> In order to overcome this difficulty, I have devised a system of classification,
                        i.e., grouping together words into shared topics; thus, words like money and valuable
                        commodity are both classified under a topic titled ‘economy’. By using a computational
                        method called topic classification, I have automated this step of the operationalization,
                        a method which requires several other steps in order to complete it.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p12">The idea behind topic classification is akin to another method called topic modeling,
                        in which a computer divides a text or a corpus into groups of frequently reoccurring
                        words by using a probabilistic calculation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e304">[3]</a> The importance of the probabilistic approach is that words have various meanings
                        depending on their context; thus, each word has a certain probability of appearing
                        with certain words and another probability of appearing with others, accounting in
                        this way for the multiple senses of a word.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e310">[4]</a> Topic modeling has applications in various fields, from biomedicine, cognitive science,
                        to anthropology, political science, journalism, social media analysis and others.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e318">[5]</a> Although topic modeling algorithms have further advanced in recent years, such as
                        the BAT model (Bidirectional Adversarial Topic) in 2020 and TND (Topic Noise Discriminator)
                        in 2022, <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e333">[6]</a> so as to result in more accurate output, there are still major obstacles when it
                        comes to the topic modeling of figurative language.  </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p13">Unsupervised topic modeling is entirely automated, a process in which the computer
                        analysis results in groups of words, the number of groups is predetermined manually,
                        and each group is titled only numerically as topic 1, topic 2 and so on. It is important
                        to note that both topic modeling and classification take into account the context
                        of words, so that certain words appear in multiple groups. In topic modeling, however,
                        discerning the titles of the groups of words remains a manual task that requires an
                        active and often subjective interpretation. A list of words considered as a topic
                        by a topic modeling may include words that human interpreters recognize as belonging
                        to distinct topics, a problem termed by Chang et al. as “word intrusion”, as in following
                        example: “{dog, cat, horse, apple, pig, cow}” (Chang, J. et al 2009, 3). Although
                        here the word apple is easily identified as the intruder, in certain cases the list
                        of words is almost completely incoherent. This problem is related to the difficulty
                        of predetermining the number of topics, an issue that affects the degree to which
                        a topic modeling is successful in creating coherent topics. On the one hand, having
                        a low number of topics may result in overgeneralizations, i.e., in broad topics, conflating
                        two or more into one. But on the other hand, having a large number of topics is likely
                        to result “in uninterpretable topics that pick out idiosyncratic word combinations”
                        (Steyvers 2011, 441).             </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14">In general, unsupervised topic modeling works best when the analyzed corpus has a
                        relatively small number of topics, with optimally few dominant ones per text in the
                        corpus.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e348">[7]</a> Topic modeling of encyclopedias or scientific journals is hence highly effective,
                        since each encyclopedic entrance has relatively a clear topic orientation with a small
                        number of other possible contexts. For example, under ‘theatre’ in Wikipedia are names
                        of playwrights, plays, theatres and other related words, but one can also find words
                        relating to various cultures and rituals. When it comes to a text highly saturated
                        with figurative language, using topic modeling tends to result in collocations of
                        unrelated words, forming incoherent topics in various degrees. This occurs since metaphoric
                        components that appear frequently together, i.e., they present a high probability
                        of belonging to the same topic according to the algorithm, nonetheless belong to distinct
                        conceptual domains. And yet, since poetry and plays contain both figurative and literal
                        language, it becomes possible, to a certain degree, to successfully conduct topic
                        modeling, albeit without being able to discern which of the topics and words are the
                        ones used figuratively. The possible benefit of applying topic modeling to poetry
                        is in providing a thematic overview of a poem or a corpus, as shown in the work of
                        Borja Navarro-Colorado, and yet not without qualifications. In his research, he applies
                        LDA-topic modeling to a corpus of 5,078 Spanish sonnets, using various methods in
                        order to reduce incoherent topics. Upon comparing 100 LDA-topics with the thematic
                        reading of the sonnets by Rivers, he concluded that: “we cannot find a clear or constant
                        relationship between a LDA-topic and a theme out of this comparison” (Navarro 2018,
                        7). Navarro recognizes the problematic character of figurative language with regard
                        to topic modeling, stating that:          </div>

                        The linguistic uses in poetry work in the exact opposite way. In poetry a word related
                        with a specific topic can be frequently used to refer to other topics (7-8).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e358">[8]</a>

                        M. Rhody analyzed 4,500 poems, arriving at the conclusion that “topic models of purely
                        figurative language texts like poetry do not produce topics with the same <span class="hi italic">thematic</span> clarity as those in Blei’s topic model of <span class="hi italic">Science</span>” (Rhody 2012, 25). This conclusion, however, does not deter Rhody from using topic
                        modeling, but rather sparks a creative approach as to its application on figurative
                        texts. Rhody argues that instead of thematic clarity, what topic modelling offers
                        in the case of poetry is the ability to discern different kinds of discourses, thus
                        it leads to a close reading of poems “with high proportions of the same topic in order
                        to check whether or not the poems are drawing from similar discourses, even if those
                        same poems have different <span class="hi italic">thematic</span> concerns” (33). Hence, it is actually due to the imperfect results of the algorithm,
                        she argues, that topic modelling of “highly-figurative language” is useful for literary
                        criticism, since “poetry causes it to fail in ways that are potentially productive”
                        (33). It is important to note, however, that Rhody treats the entirety of a poem as
                        figurative, even though poems usually include literal parts as well. Although Rhody
                        suggests a way to benefit from topic modeling in the analysis of figurative texts,
                        it is merely bypassing the difficulties and not solving them.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">A figurative sentence is in a sense antithetical to the idea of topic modeling regarding
                        the dominance of one topic in a said document, since a metaphor equates between two
                        components from dissimilar contexts, both of equal importance.  Since the purpose
                        of the operationalization that I suggest is to create a network of the interactions
                        between metaphoric components, ascribing a dominant topic, even with one or two minor
                        topics, to an entire poem cannot provide data about the metaphoric interactions. For
                        that purpose, one must ascribe topics to individual words within a text and only then
                        analyze their interactions. However, not all the words are relevant, as certain words
                        are not indicative of topics, such as prepositions, articles and others, which are
                        called in NLP stop words. In most cases, prior to the topic classification or topic
                        modeling, the text undergoes a preprocessing, in which one of the methods is the cleaning
                        of excess linguistic units, such as stop words, punctuation, names of characters and
                        others. Matthew Jockers, for example, in his topic modeling of 19  th century novels,
                        found that “highly interpretable and thematically coherent topics could be derived
                        through a model built entirely from nouns” (Jockers 2013, 131); hence, all the adjectives,
                        adverbs, verbs, pronouns and so on, were cleaned in the preprocessing. Since in many
                        figurative instances there is significance to adjectives, adverbs and verbs, for example
                        when Timon says: “feast your ears with the music” (III.vii.32-3), excluding such words
                        would leave out valuable information from the analysis of figurative language.

                        to overcome the various problems posed by figurative language, such as the incoherency
                        of topics and the dominance of a single or few topics in an entire text. In topic
                        classification, the titles as well as the number of topics are predetermined by the
                        researcher in advance. Unlike topic modeling, automating topic classification requires
                        a process of pretraining an algorithm via machine learning on a manually classified
                        dataset. Manual topic classification could suffice when researching a relatively small
                        number of texts, but in cases of big data training a topic classifier provides an
                        alternative to topic modeling, one which is advantageous for the analysis of figurative
                        language. Although my focus is on one case study, namely on   <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span>, and hence a manual classification would have been enough in order to test this method’s
                        potential for textual analysis, I have trained a topic classifier both to demonstrate
                        the computational automatization of topic classification as well as to provide basis

                        language recognition, in which algorithms detect whether a sentence is figurative
                        or not, they do not isolate figurative sentences from a whole text, but rather require
                        the text to be parsed first into sentences in order to be applied.  <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e412">[11]</a> Parsing the plays automatically into sentences also proves unsuitable for the purpose
                        of analyzing figurative language, since sentences can include more than one figurative
                        instance, by which I do not mean simply that multiple words are used figuratively,
                        as is the case in any metaphor, but that there are at times multiple unique metaphors
                        in a sentence. For the time being, it seems there is no escape from extracting the

                        and what are the topics themselves, and then manually classify each of the 1,388 instances
                        into the topics. Since the topics should be as relevant to the corpus as possible,
                        I did not decide in advance what they would be, but rather worked from the texts up,
                        gleaning the topics from the figurative instances and slowly adding more topics. In
                        this process, I experimented with various topics, observing, for example, that certain
                        new topics were required, or that at times it would be better to split one topic into
                        two, or that a certain topic is redundant and should be subsumed under a different

                        it does not necessarily undermine the viability of topic classification, but rather
                        shows that various classifications are possible depending on the researcher’s orientation.
                        For example, one might decide that ‘art’ is a topic, while another may wish to distinguish
                        between several topics pertaining to art, such as ‘paintings’, ‘sculptures’ and so
                        on. Deciding on the topics depends both on the corpus and the purpose of the research;
                        thus, if the corpus deals with art, it is more likely that the researcher would want
                        to distinguish between various artistic media. The subjective decision regarding the
                        topics, hence, yields an analysis of different levels of the corpus that are not contradictory.

                        various methods in NLP in order to train a classifier that automatically labels each
                        word in a figurative instance into one of the 103 topics. After cleaning stop words
                        and character names from the dataset, I have trained a type of deep learning algorithm
                        called neural network combined with DistilBERT, a version of the pretrained language
                        model developed by Google.   <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e738">[13]</a> Since the original texts of the plays are not in standard spelling or punctuation,
                        I have used contemporary editions in order to have consistency in the dataset and
                        with DistilBERT, being pretrained on contemporary English.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e744">[14]</a> The topic classifier currently achieves a promising result of 72.94% accuracy, which
                        can be further improved for future work by fine-tuning the machine learning process.
                        <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e766">[15]</a> The accuracy is the precent of correct predictions of the classifier, i.e., in the
                        process of training the algorithm the dataset is randomly split into two, a training
                        dataset (66%) and a test dataset (33%), so that in this way the algorithm compares
                        between its own predictions and the original ones made by the creator of the dataset.
                        After completing the topic classification of the text under research, the next step
                        that I suggest for the operationalization of figurative language as a network is mapping
                        the interactions between the topics, applying for this purpose a method called network
                        analysis. </div>

                        the nodes, usually represented by circles in the visualization, which can stand for
                        various entities, as individual human beings, numbers, places, words, topics, etc.,
                        depending on the objectives of the researcher. The second feature is the edges, visually
                        represented by lines connecting the circles, which stand for the interactions between
                        the nodes on the basis of what the researcher defines as an interaction. For example,
                        a researcher working on cinema can define an interaction as the co-occurrence of two
                        characters in a scene, while another researcher may define an interaction only when
                        there is also a verbal exchange between the characters.  <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e789">[17]</a>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p25">An important distinction in network analysis is between directed and undirected networks,
                        each of which represents different relations between the nodes and is used for different
                        purposes. Directed networks are used for “relational phenomena that logically have
                        a sense of direction” (Borgatti 2013, 12), meaning that one node in the network leads
                        to another and so on, as in cases such as contagious disease or the flow of information.
                        In undirected networks, the relations between the nodes “must always be reciprocated,
                        as in ‘was seen with’ or ‘is kin to’” (12), as well as in the example of characters
                        appearing in the same scene. In my construction of the network of figurative topics,
                        I defined an interaction between two topics as their co-occurrence in the same figurative
                        instance, entailing that it is an undirected network, e.g., in “Macbeth does murder
                        sleep” (II.ii.37), there is an interaction between the topic of ‘violence’ and that
                        of ‘sleep’. The interactions between the nodes can be weighted, so that if a topic
                        appears with another topic multiple times on different occasions, then the weight
                        of their interaction is higher, being the sum of their co-occurrence, which is visually
                        represented by a thicker line.  </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p26">Another aspect of network analysis is calculating various kinds of centralities, whose
                        purpose is to measure how central different nodes are in the network in relation to
                        other nodes. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e801">[18]</a> The four centralities which I will now discuss are degree centrality, weighted degree
                        centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality. Degree centrality is
                        the measurement of a node’s unique interactions, indicating the number of nodes with
                        which a node interacts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e807">[19]</a> For example, if a particular node has a total of fifty interactions, but all of them
                        are with just one other node, its degree centrality would be one. Weighted degree
                        centrality measures the total amount of interactions of a node; thus, with regard
                        to the previous example, the weighted degree of such a node would be fifty.    </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p27">Before discussing the other two kinds of centralities, I will discuss another issue
                        that is relevant with regard to these centralities, i.e., the clustering of nodes
                        as well as the core-periphery structure. There are various algorithms that detect
                        clusters in a network, and although each works somewhat differently, in general they
                        calculate the connectedness of nodes, clustering together nodes that have more interactions
                        between them. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e816">[20]</a> In a network that consists of two clusters, for example, each cluster has several
                        nodes that interact amongst themselves repeatedly, but only one node from each cluster
                        has interactions with the other cluster. Betweenness centrality measures exactly this
                        sort of positions that nodes occupy within a network; thus, nodes with high betweenness
                        function as bridges between poorly connected clusters.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e822">[21]</a> The core-periphery structure, unlike clusters, consists only of two blocks, that
                        of the core in which the nodes are highly connected to each other, and that of the
                        periphery in which the nodes are connected to certain core nodes, as well as partially
                        or not at all to other peripheral nodes. Core nodes, hence, have high degree centrality
                        as well as high betweenness, presenting multiple unique interactions that keep peripheral
                        nodes connected to the network.   <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e824">[22]</a> High betweenness nodes might not be themselves highly connected, i.e., their degree
                        is not necessarily high, but they play a central role in maintaining the network as
                        a whole, since without them the network would either split into distinct components
                        or present weaker and less meaningful relations.   </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p28">The fourth kind of centrality is the eigenvector, which measures the influence of
                        a node in a network by calculating the interactions of a node with other highly connected
                        nodes, even though this node itself might not be well connected. In <span class="hi italic">Centrality and Network Flow</span>, Stephen Borgatti explains the eigenvector as follows: “The idea is that even if
                        a node influences just one other node, who subsequently influences many other nodes
                        (who themselves influence still more others), then the first node in that chain is
                        highly influential” (Borgatti 2005, 61). For example, consider node 'A' has many interactions
                        with just one other node, node 'B', while node 'B' interacts with many nodes in the
                        network, meaning that it has a high degree centrality. In such a case, since node
                        ‘A’ has a significant relation with node ‘B’, a well-connected node, node ‘A’ is in
                        an influential position in the network. One way of understanding this centrality is
                        as a hierarchical system, in which a high-ranking individual communicates with just
                        one lower ranking individual, while this second in command interacts with the rest
                        of the group. Simply put, it is not just interactions with a high number of nodes
                        that entails a node is influential, but whether a node interacts with other well-connected
                        nodes.</div>

                        not be obvious to say outright that the topic of ‘economy’ dominates the play’s figurative
                        language. Although it is unsurprising to find out that the figurative topic of economy
                        has high centrality measures, the fact that <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span> revolves around money, credit and debt, does not necessarily mean that the figurative
                        language does too. In the following interpretation of the play my focus is, first
                        of all, on the major figurative topics in the network, but this by no means entails
                        that one cannot interpret the network differently and focus on other topics and their
                        interactions. That at the heart of     <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span> beats a struggle with the rise of mercantile capitalism serves only as the starting
                        point for many researchers, whose focus then varies widely, covering a range of auxiliary
                        subjects from gender to politics, religion, aesthetics and others.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e939">[24]</a> However, isolating various phenomena into distinct domains, such as economy and politics,
                        whether this process is rooted in our daily experiences, stems from a mental process
                        or serves only a discursive purpose for research, in the end does not mean that each
                        phenomenon exists on its own, severed from an intricate network of ties with other
                        phenomena. </div>

                        and ‘nature’ (see Figure 7). The various discrepancies between centrality measures,
                        such as that ‘nature’ has a relatively low number of weighted degree and a high eigenvector,
                        are in themselves significant indicators prompting further investigation. Although
                        subjects such as nature and anatomy have received critical attention, considering
                        both together in relation to economy is usually anecdotal or at best indirectly discussed
                        via related subjects, such as the relation between reproduction and mother earth as
                        an implicit conjunction of body and nature.     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e970">[25]</a> Thus, inspecting the relations between the network’s main topics already provides
                        us with a potentially ripe plot that has been overlooked, which can serve for the

                     <div class="ptext" id="p34">The network analysis, it is important to note, does not just indicate that the aforementioned
                        topics are dominant in the play due to their high occurrence, but also reveals the
                        interactions that these topics have with other topics (see Figure 8). A close reading
                        of the play that integrates an analysis of the network should also read closely the
                        network itself, consider the nuanced interactions between topics as well as the meaning
                        behind the various centrality measures. <span class="hi italic">Timon</span>’s network presents strong interactions between the topics of ‘economy’, ‘anatomy’
                        and ‘social relations’, as the highest number of interactions that each of them has
                        is with the two other topics. This core trio of topics at the center of the network
                        branches out through ‘economy’ and ‘anatomy’ to other significant topics such as ‘food’,
                        ‘violence’, ‘nature’ and ‘emotions’. The data in Figure 8 shows this branching out
                        by the fact that both ‘economy’ and ‘anatomy’ appear multiple times with various topics,
                        whereas ‘social relations’ appears only with ‘economy’ and ‘anatomy’. Moreover, this
                        is evident by the cluster analysis, as seen in Figure 6, in which ‘anatomy’ belongs
                        to one cluster, whereas ‘economy’ and ‘social relations’ to another. The dominant
                        topic in the third cluster is ‘nature’, whose relatively high betweenness expresses
                        its distinct place in the network.     </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">Although the betweenness centrality of ‘nature’ is quite similar to that of ‘anatomy’
                        and ‘economy’, relative to its weighted degree in comparison to these two topics,
                        the high betweenness of ‘nature’ stands out. This indicates that ‘nature’ spreads
                        throughout the network so as to become a dominant force across the play, vital for
                        keeping the relation between core and periphery, thus maintaining the network as a
                        whole. Timon’s mock encomium to thievery expresses a stance regarding nature similar
                        to the one in the network, as being the medium or facilitator for the spread of corrupt
                        economic self-interest:

                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">An important scholarly debate regarding  <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span> is how to explain the extreme shift that the character of Timon undergoes, from an
                        altruistic paternal figure in acts 1 and 2 to a misanthropic madman in acts 3-5.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1889">[26]</a> Considering this problem through the play’s network can be potentially rewarding,
                        since by constructing networks that include only the figurative instances of Timon
                        in each of the acts, we could compare between them and look for distinct indicators
                        on which to establish an interpretation. Even without scrutinizing the networks of
                        Timon’s first phase (acts 1-2) and second phase (acts 3-5) in search of differences,
                        there is an unmistakable divergence in two major topics, namely the topics of ‘nature’
                        and ‘social relations’ (see Figures 10 and 11). In the first two acts of Timon’s lines,
                        ‘nature’ barely appears at all and ‘social relations’ is a dominant topic, whereas
                        in the last three acts the centrality of ‘nature’ cannot be ignored, while the topic
                        of ‘social relations’ drastically loses its importance.     </div>

                        by simply looking at their visualizations, is that the network of acts 1-2 is sginificantly
                        smaller and less dense than that of acts 3-5. However, this is not simply attributed
                        to the fact that one network consists of 2 acts while the other of 3 acts, but rather
                        due to two reasons: (i) there is a drastic increase in the total number of words spoken
                        by Timon in act 4. (ii) in acts 3-5 there is an increase in the precentage of words
                        used in the figurative instances in comparison to acts 1 and 2 (see Figure 12).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p38">Both the shift in the two major topics, ‘nature’ and ‘social relations’, and the shift
                        in Timon’s use of figurative language corroborate that there is a pronounced split
                        between the Timon of the first two acts and the Timon of acts 3-5. Comparing between
                        the topic interactions in Timon’s two phases reveals this split as well, as in acts
                        1-2 the dominant interactions are between ‘economy’, ‘social relations’ and ‘language’,
                        whereas in the rest of the play, they are between ‘economy’, ‘anatomy’ and ‘violence’
                        (see Figure 13). On the basis of the data from the play’s network, it is possible
                        to assess existing interpretations of the play and of Timon’s split, as well as develop
                        other possible interpretations. Interpretations of Timon’s split and of the play as
                        a whole are ultimately linked; hence, to develop or inspect interpretations of the
                        former, a contextualization through the latter is vital.  </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">Consider, for example, Finkelstein’s interpretation in <span class="hi italic">Amicitia and Beneficia in Timon of Athens</span>, which focuses on nature mainly through Cicero’s notion of sociality and friendship
                        as relationships rooted in nature: “these relationships constitute the state, itself
                        aligned with virtuous nature” (Finkelstein 2020, 805). Finkelstein’s in-depth contextualization
                        of friendship and benefits in <span class="hi italic">Timon</span> through the classical works of Seneca, Plutarch, Cicero and others, though insightful
                        and comprehensive, in the end treats nature’s role in the play mostly in a narrow
                        sense, as the underlying condition of a specific political system, “the republican
                        state as a natural entity” (806). In the network of <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens, </span>the topic of ‘politics’ is relatively a minor one, ranking in the various centralities
                        between place 18-20 (see Figure 7); hence, we may question the stress that Finklestein
                        puts on the political aspects of the play. Moreover, the main interactions of ‘politics’
                        in the network are with ‘economy’, ‘nature’, ‘anatomy’ and ‘violence’, whereas ‘social
                        relations’ barely interacts with ‘politics’ (see Figure 14), suggesting that there
                        is a certain degree of separation between these two domains, which hence, in the least,
                        qualifies Finkelstein’s interpretation.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p40">Regarding Timon’s shift, Finkelstein focuses on the relations between economy, politics,
                        the natural state and social relations, arguing that in the first phase Timon acts
                        “both like Cicero’s friend, virtuously giving benefits without an expectation of favor,
                        and like someone almost opposite: Seneca’s strongman, aloof to his expectations of
                        other’s behavior” (812). Timon, however, cannot have it both ways; hence, on the one
                        hand, “the collapse of relationships in the second half feels like a violent breach
                        in nature”, and on the other hand, it “points to the need for a strong political will
                        that can distinguish virtue from venality” (817). The argument regarding Timons’ first
                        phase could be seen as having an expression in Timon’s networks, i.e., the shift from
                        the topic of ‘social relations’ to that of ‘nature’. However, regarding the latter
                        phase, there is no indication that ‘politics’ undergoes a change in position (see
                        Figures 10 and 11) or gains a special significance in Timon’s top interactions in
                        either phases (see Figures 15 and 16).  </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">Another interpretation worth considering is Ken Jackson’s influential reading of the
                        play, which sees Timon’s motivation for gift-giving in a positive Christian light,
                        distinguishing his reading from the critical tradition of seeing in a “negative (Johnsonian)
                        view Timon’s giving” (Jackson 2001, 39). According to Jackson, “in creating the sudden
                        split between the two Timons, Shakespeare actually reveals their proximity. Timon’s
                        misanthropy is implied in his giving. […] his misanthropy is religious, a necessary
                        renunciation of the circular economy of exchange” (47). For Jackson, Timon is a kind
                        of Abrahamic figure, for whom in “responding to the call of the other, God, the impossible,
                        ‘a duty to hate is implied’” (46). Furthermore, Jackson argues, Timon is in a sense
                        caught between the ethical and the religious, which explains his “confusing generosity,
                        the way he simultaneously seems to love others but, in that love, to distance himself”
                        (51). </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p42">The main topics involved in Jackson’s interpretation, as it were, are ‘economy’, ‘religion’,
                        ‘ethics’, ‘social relations’ and ‘emotions’. Although in the entire play’s network
                        the topics of ‘religion’ and ‘ethics’ are somewhat more significant than ‘politics’
                        (in comparison to Finkelstein’s emphasis), they are also relatively minor ones (see
                        Figure 7). The topic of ‘emotions’ is a significant topic in the whole, but in Jackson’s
                        interpretation it is not as emphasized as the other topics. However, looking closely
                        at Timon’s two networks (see Figures 10 and 11) reveals that in the first phase ‘ethics’
                        is quite significant and ‘religion’ is in the background, yet in the second phase
                        ‘religion’ gains prominence, whereas ‘ethics’ decreases. These shifts are not as pronounced
                        as those of ‘nature’ and ‘social relations’, but they are significant enough to argue
                        that the network expresses what is for Jackson, in the second part of the play, a
                        radical movement towards the religious. In the following section, I develop a reading
                        of the play and the problem of the two Timons on the basis of the computational analysis,
                        examining whether the play’s network provides information that can coalesce into a
                        coherent interpretation. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p43">From its outset, <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens </span>presents the relations between the characters as revolving around economic value,
                        and throughout the play it remains the key element in defining the mode of existence
                        of the Athenian society. Whether it is the appraisal of commodities, the patronage
                        of art, the showering of gifts or the collecting of debt, the play repeatedly foregrounds
                        social relations through economic exchanges, so as to produce an almost fixed image
                        of the market as “the constant model of human relations” (Rizzoli 2017, 22). As earlier
                        mentioned, the network analysis does not just support the interpretation that economic
                        considerations and social relations are indissolubly tied together in the play (Figure
                        8), but rather provides insights into the nature of this tie as perceived by Timon
                        in comparison to the ruling mode of thinking in Athens. </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p44">On the basis of the network, I argue that whereas what makes the world of Athens go
                        around is the monetary economic form, Timon perceives the world (in his first phase
                        of the play) through the economic form of barter. Building on Marx’s definition of
                        barter as a relation between commodities in which one converts “the bodily shape of
                        that other commodity into the form of its own value" (Goux 1990, 37), Goux argues
                        in <span class="hi italic">Symbolic Economies</span> that this is equivalent to the social relations taking place in the formation of
                        the ego, having “precisely the same structure as <span class="hi italic">the specular relationship with the other</span>” (13). Identifying with another brings about the experience of the self, an “identification
                        with the image of the <span class="hi italic">like</span>” (14). Just like when two commodities in barter express “value in the body of the
                        other”, so is the case in social relations of identification, as “in each other’s
                        presence, the two beings recognize each other as similar” (13). The three main topics
                        in Timon’s network of acts 1-2, i.e., ‘economy’, ‘social relations’ and ‘anatomy’,
                        are constitutive of the barter form as a mode of thinking, as an absolute metaphor,
                        since it is their interactions that bring about the process of social identification
                        as the symbolic economy of barter.  </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p45">In his philanthropic phase, Timon experiences his own worth through an identification
                        with the worth he ascribes to his friends, telling Apemantus: “what better or properer
                        can we call our own than the riches of our friends?” (I.ii.100-1). However, Timon’s
                        identification is with their collective worth; thus, on the one hand, it is as though
                        he places himself above each of them as individuals, and yet on the other hand, his
                        sense of self is fragmented and distributed among others like his gifts and fortune.
                        Underlying both Timon’s understanding of gift-giving and of friendship is a desire
                        for worth and meaning anchored in a concrete, bodily presence, one that affirms his
                        personal relations. However, Timon does not live in a society dominated by barter
                        but rather by money, an economic form that splits between the intrinsic value and
                        the extrinsic value, between the concrete materiality of a commodity and its value
                        in the marketplace. Although Timon is not oblivious to the reality of money, he appears
                        unwilling to accept and internalize it as a mode of thinking.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e4408">[27]</a> It is important to note that Timon’s barter perception of social relations is not
                        free from economic considerations and self-interest, as he openly says to his so-called
                        friends: “what need we have any friends, if we should ne’er have need of ‘em? They
                        were the most needless creatures living should we ne’er have use for ‘em” (I.ii.94-6).
                        And yet, Timon expects his gifts to be reciprocated with the friendship of those who
                        receive them, and a material reciprocation, if the need were to arise, is premised
                        for him on this owed fraternity, not on a binding legal document of debt.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p46">The culture of credit in early modern England that informs the play was, on the one
                        hand, rooted in personal relations of trust and advanced communal bonds, and yet on
                        the other hand, at the end of the 16th century, credit became more and more anchored
                        in legal contracts, turning into an impersonal system in which violent penalty became
                        the mechanism of enforcement.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e4420">[28]</a> Timon believes his credit network is one of personal relations, a communal body that
                        breaks bread and shares “one another’s fortunes” (I.ii.103). The transaction of credit
                        opens up both a temporal and a spatial gap between those involved, as it postpones
                        the end of the exchange. This gap, when mediated by trust, becomes a social force
                        that ties a community together in personal relations despite physical distance, and
                        yet when legal mechanisms of penalty occupy the gap, it turns even social relations
                        of close proximity into impersonal ones. To close this gap, as it were, the English
                        law placed as collateral the body of the debtor in the hands of creditors, permitting
                        them to “detain his debtor’s indefinitely”, and even to use “the objectionable conditions
                        of prison as a means to exact revenge” (Bailey 2011, 378-9). Although Timon is explicitly
                        the prime source of nourishment and money to his false friends, as he is well-aware,
                        yet since for him they are all tied in reciprocal relations, it is as though he does
                        not distinguish between the body of the community and his own; thus, Apemantus’s words
                        ring true when he says: “what a number of men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not!” (I.ii.39-40).
                        In this stage of the play, Timon believes that the “bond of men” (I.i.148) is a natural
                        relation, that “we are born to do benefits” (I.ii.99-100), and yet this belief is
                        but the result of the illusory appearance of an intrinsic value that exists naturally
                        in the body of a commodity outside of its monetary value.  </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p47">In Timon’s second phase (acts 3-5), he internalizes the economic forms of money and
                        credit, which demystify his idea of a communal body and leads him to discover the
                        inevitable self-interest of the individual body and its frailty in the face of the
                        impersonal law. The rise in the interactions between ‘anatomy’ and ‘violence’ in acts
                        3-5, as well as with topics such as ‘economy’ and ‘food’ (see Figures 15 &amp; 16), shows
                        that the physical reality of the body itself becomes a pronounced issue for Timon.
                        When he is denied by his so-called friends, his disbelief derives from his belief
                        in barter-like reciprocal social relations, according to which “reciprocal debts contracted
                        between as many interested parties as possible over a number of months, or even years,
                        would be ‘reckoned’ and cancelled against each other” (Muldrew 1998, 101). As Timon
                        experiences this breach in the equality of barter, the veil is lifted from his way
                        of viewing sociality, revealing to him the natural state of man where previously there
                        was simply no need to consciously consider it, since nature and social relations had
                        been perceived as one and the same. The shifts in the centralities of ‘social relations’
                        and ‘nature’ in Timon’s networks serve as the basis of this interpretation, as the
                        high centrality of ‘social relations’ and low centrality of ‘nature’ in the first
                        half express Timon’s conflating of social bonds with the natural state to the point
                        of disregarding the latter, while his private revelation of the natural state as distinct
                        from the social reality turns the topic of ‘nature’ into a visible and conscious matter
                        for him, bringing to its rise in the second half.    </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p48">The nature that Timon discovers is not a nurturing earth that fosters “the bond of
                        men” and breeds kinship, but rather the “common whore of mankind” that brings out
                        “ungrateful man” and “teem with new monsters” (IV.iii.187, 189). As Rizzoli argues
                        in <span class="hi italic">Shakespeare and the Ideologies of the Marketplace</span>, the play gestures towards “the ‘naturalized’ image of man and commerce which supports
                        the mercantilist articulation of the market’s laws” (Rizzoli 2017, 22). For Rizzoli,
                        the play shows that “market practices are thus justified as a natural fact; they are
                        shown to be essential and incontestable as the acquisitive drives they aim to gratify”
                        (22). Through the internalized monetary economic form, Timon now sees the natural
                        man as an anti-social animal and yet as inherently economically-minded, driven by
                        the “interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers” (Smith 1776, 380), as observed
                        by Adam Smith in his analysis of mercantilism. </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p49">When living in isolation in the wild, Timon clings to the mere idea of the intrinsic
                        value, of the material body of money and commodities as in barter, exactly because
                        it no longer functions as a symbolic currency for Timon’s social relations of identification
                        and as he takes no part in Athen’s money economy. Unlike money and credit, food functions
                        for Timon as the ultimate barter commodity, a paradigm of the natural materiality,
                        as it necessitates the immediate physical presence of those feasting together. Looking
                        closely at the topic of ‘food’ reveals that it becomes much more dominant for Timon
                        in the second half of the play, and its topic interactions are with ‘anatomy’, ‘nature’
                        and ‘economy’ (see Figure 17). In the second phase, the distinction between the intrinsic
                        value of gold and that of food becomes finally unmistakable for Timon, and yet they
                        are still inextricably linked for him. Digging the earth in search of roots to satisfy
                        his hunger, Timon exclaims that “Who seeks for better of thee [the earth], sauce his
                        palate / With thy most operant poison” (IV.iii.24-5), and straight away instead of
                        nourishing food he finds gold, the poison of society. Even though gold in its natural
                        state does not provide the immediate presence of worth, but only a social promise
                        of future sustenance, Timon still associates it with a consumable substance, with
                        poison.    </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p50">Moreover, in Timon’s network, ‘food’ and ‘animals’ share strong interactions with
                        ‘violence’, ‘economy’ and ‘nature’ (see Figure 17), whereas for the other characters
                        the topic of ‘animals’ is much less intertwined with ‘food’. Instead, the network
                        I have constructed for the rest of the characters combined shows that for them the
                        topics of ‘social relations’ and ‘food’ are the ones sharing significant interactions,
                        namely with ‘economy’, ‘anatomy’, ‘emotions’ and ‘nature’.    </div>

                        Reminiscent of Hobbes’s <span class="hi italic">Leviathan</span>, for whom only the coercive power of the state can inhibit the natural state of man
                        as <span class="hi italic">Homo homini lupus,</span><a class="noteRef" href="#d4e4935">[29]</a> Timon sees violent intervention as the only option against the natural greed of the
                        man-wolf. But, unlike Hobbes, for Timon there is no remedy in the authority of the
                        state’s law and the only real solution is the total destruction of Athens, which he
                        encourages Alcibiades to execute. The inevitable course of events for the self-devouring
                        wolf, according to Timon, is the self-annihilation of mankind, since as Timon poses:
                        “if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard
                        thy life for thy dinner” (IV.iii.332-4). Although Alcibiades fights for what he considers
                        to be Timon’s cause, he ultimately stands for the Hobbesian solution of coercive law.
                        In contrast to all of the other characters in the play, Alcibiades is the only one
                        for whom the topic of ‘judiciary’ is of significance at all (see Figure 18).    </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p52">Rizzoli’s reading of the play as showing the “dominance of the market and its autonomous
                        laws over any political institution” (Rizzoli 2017, 20) privileges the perspective
                        of the Athenian senators over others in the play, subsuming Alcibiades under their
                        power “by applying to their political actions the contingent strategies of the market”
                        (21). And yet, that the Athenian society is not in utter chaos, despite the all-against-all
                        nature of man that Timon depicts, testifies that a system of law is in place, albeit
                        one that sanctions exploitation through the abuse of credit practices, favoring the
                        economic self-interest of the individual over social and personal bonds. It is against
                        this kind of judicial system that Alcibiades wishes to take revenge, as he faces the
                        Athenian senators with his army and accuses them of making their “wills the scope
                        of justice” (V.v.4-5). According to Bailey’s interpretation, Alcibiades animates “the
                        restorative principal of equivalence in exchange”; thus, his conflict with the senate
                        transforms “the quasi-legal brutality of debt bondage into a state-sanctioned means
                        of affixing relative worth” (Bailey 2011, 397). Alcibiades is not free from economic
                        considerations, but this and his acceptance of the senators’ surrender, do not entail
                        that he unwittingly falls prey to their economic and judicial logic.  </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p53">Although in the end it seems for a moment that Timon finds solace in the idea of a
                        return to nature in death, making his “everlasting mansion / Upon the beached verge
                        of the salt flood” (V.ii.100-1), this daydream quickly shatters by the “turbulent
                        surge” (V.ii.103), as nature and men alike keep harrowing his gravestone. Even in
                        his death, Timon is unable to escape the by-now internalized economic form of money
                        and the economic nature of sociality that accompanies it. In his final words, “Graves
                        only be men’s work and death their gain, / Sun, hide thy beams, Timon hath done his
                        reign” (V.ii.107), the ultimate split takes place between an intrinsic value of materiality,
                        the living body, and an extrinsic value, a gain possessed only in death, in the absence
                        of life and external to it. </div>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">In this article I have explored a method for operationalizing the theoretical idea
                     that figurative language is a network, as well as tested its potential on the play
                     <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span>. The construction of a network from the topics of figurative instances has proved
                     to be an effective method for the analysis of a text, enabling us to interpret closely
                     the network relations between conceptual domains. Using topic classification that
                     focuses on small units, i.e., the figurative instances, instead of topic modeling
                     on the level of an entire text, makes it possible to create a network of the interactions
                     between topics and analyze the figurative language. To further develop this method
                     for the analysis of figurative language, it could be beneficial to turn the network
                     into a directed one in order to explore the relations between tenors and vehicles,
                     considering the directionality from tenor to vehicle. This, however, introduces a
                     variety of challenges, such as figurative cases in which the tenor is absent textually
                     and only implied. Regarding the automatic classification of topics in figurative instances,
                     though it has shown promising results, there are still improvements that can be made.
                     Several conclusions can be drawn from the training of the classifier in order to reach
                     better results, starting with reducing the number of topics and enlarging the dataset,
                     in this way the algorithm will have more data and less ambiguity regarding topics.
                     Moreover, instead of using DistilBERT, experimenting with other large language models,
                     such as Llama, Gemini or ChatGPT, could potentially yield a better topic classifier.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">Testing the method suggested in this article on <span class="hi italic">Timon of Athens</span> has resulted in constructive ways for assessing existing interpretations, as well
                     as in revealing nuanced patterns that contribute to a fruitful close reading of the
                     play and for interpreting various issues that has long occupied scholars. However,
                     it is important to note that although assessing existing interpretations via this
                     method can corroborate certain assumptions and question others, it does not necessarily
                     detract from their overall value. Focusing on subjects that have minor significance
                     in a text’s network is not inherently incorrect, since any subject that is of importance
                     to a researcher is worthwhile. That a certain topic appears a low number of times
                     does not necessarily mean it is not meaningful, as it could appear in crucial parts
                     of a text. In the end, whether certain subjects are significant is a question of the
                     purpose of a given research and the subject that the scholar wishes to focus on. The
                     network of topics is, after all, but a graph representation of the text, and it could
                     be mined, as it were, for insights on the various topics that it represents; thus,
                     any interpretation could potentially benefit from examining the interactions between
                     the topics with which it is concerned.   </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">By focusing on the main figurative topics of the play, as well as on those of specific
                     characters and acts, it became possible to form an interpretation that ties together
                     the various strands of data presented by the network analysis. And yet, the network
                     of the play’s figurative topics still holds undiscovered riches, veins of information
                     waiting to be dug up, as each and every topic and interaction in the network could
                     potentially reveal new insights. To conclude, the network of a text’s figurative topics
                     can provide us with a new perspective that brings to light previously unnoticed aspects
                     of the concerns of a text, drawing our attention to discrepancies that make us raise
                     questions and rethink what we know of the text. </div>
