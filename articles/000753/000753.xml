         <p>A Network Analysis of Figurative Topic Classification:  </p>
         <p>The Case Study of Timon of Athens </p>
         <div>
            <head>1. Introduction</head>
            <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Arte of English Poesie</hi>, George Puttenham demonstrates the abusive power of figurative language by referring to the ancient Athenian judges of the Areopagus, who had decided “to forbid all manner of figurative speeches to be used before them in their consistory of Justice, as mere illusions of the mind and wresters of upright judgment” (Puttenham 1589, 239). Ironically, although the Areopagite judges condemn the use of figurative language as deceptive, they themselves use a metaphor of a carpenter in their condemnation, saying “that to allow such manner of foreign and colored talk to make the judges affectioned were all one as if the carpenter, before he began to square his timber, would make his square crooked: inasmuch as the strait and upright mind of a judge is the very rule of justice till it be perverted” (239). As much as the judges of ancient Athens wish to banish all figurative language from their midst, they prove to be susceptible to its power from within, unable to shake off the hold it has on their minds. The influence of figurative language is not only evident here through the metaphor of the carpenter, but it is rather the more subtle homonym senses of the words “upright” and “rule” that truly reveal the pervasive power of the figurative. According to Lakoff and Johnson in          <hi rend="italic">Metaphors We Live By</hi>, “upright” is a part of a class of metaphors they call orientational, which rely on our most basic sense of space and physical concepts, so much so that “without which we could not function in the world – could not reason or communicate" (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 61). In this article I suggest a computational approach for the analysis of figurative language, which employs two main methods, particularly topic classification and network analysis, as well as offer as a case study an interpretation of the play  <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> by Shakespeare and Middleton on the basis of the analysis.</p>
            <p>The results of such an analysis of figurative language can provide insights into the thematic concerns of a text and the forces that shape them, enabling us to return differently to a close reading. Unlike an analysis of literal language with NLP (Natural Language Processing), there are certain difficulties that arise due to the very structure of figurative expressions. In the following section, I discuss the theory of figurative language, particularly in relation to my argument regarding the network structure of figurative language. The third section focuses on the computational methods; firstly, on topic classification and modeling, as well as on training a classifier on the basis of a dataset of four tragedies, and secondly, on network analysis and its application to the conceptualization of figurative language as a network. In the fourth section of this article, I test in two ways this method’s ability to provide meaningful information on the analyzed text by applying it to the play     <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>, first by assessing existing interpretations and secondly by combining it with a close reading of the play. </p>
            <p>In the end, computational methods and tools for research in the humanities are only as valuable as the value they bring to scholars in the field, and they are not the end in themselves. Simply using a computational tool and coming up with various quantifications is unlikely to prove useful, as Thomas Kuhn argues and Franco Moretti applies to digital humanities: “numbers gathered without some knowledge of the regularity to be expected almost never speak for themselves” (Kuhn 1961, 175).  <note> See Moretti, 2013. “’Operationalizing’: or, the Function of Measurement in Modern Literary Theory”, p’ 4.</note> Without developing a critical interpretation of the text, corpus or subject under research on the basis of the computational analysis, we run the risk that the work of digital humanists remains impenetrable and irrelevant to scholars in our field who are unfamiliar with the methods.  </p>

            <head>2. Theory: Figurative Language as a Network</head>
            <p>	A metaphor brings together dissimilar worlds into play, connecting one conceptual domain with another of a different kind. The connection between the tenor and the vehicle of a metaphor, i.e., the underlying subject and the transported meaning, is not a necessary one, but rather based on substitution and a relative freedom from any constraints that a context may place on a word. After the occurrence of a metaphoric transference of meaning between two conceptual domains, it is as though the tenor and the vehicle simply go their separate ways and the contexts remain distinct. However, this does not entail that a metaphor is merely a temporary displacement of meaning, rather that, as I. A. Richards argues in <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of Rhetoric</hi>, “fundamentally it is a borrowing between and intercourse of thoughts, a transaction between contexts” (Richards 1965, 100). Although the two parts of the metaphor may remain distinct, they do not necessarily remain unchanged by the interaction, as each carries a residue of the other. When a word, which had previously taken part in a metaphor, takes on the role of either a tenor or a vehicle in a figurative expression, it brings along to the exchange its recently acquired significations. According to Richards: “the processes of metaphor in language, the exchanges between the meanings of words which we study in explicit verbal metaphors, are super-imposed upon a perceived world which is itself a product of earlier or unwitting metaphor” (108-9). This process of meaning transference through metaphors, which takes place in relation to a previous unwitting layer of metaphors, I argue, has the structure of a network, a network that forms and reforms out of the various interactions between the metaphoric components. Accordingly, the two layers of metaphors in Richards’ argument, the explicit and the unwitting metaphors, are two aspects of the same network, the latter being the existing state of the network while the former is the introduction of a new metaphoric instance.    </p>
            <p>	The computational method that I propose in this article offers a way to systematize this conceptualization of metaphors as a network. This process is described by Moretti as “operationalization”, applying to digital humanities the work of Bridgman in the philosophy of science, <hi rend="italic">The Logic of Modern Physics</hi>. The example that Moretti brings from Bridgman concerns length: “to find the length of an object we have to perform certain physical operations. The concept of length is therefore fixed when the operations by which length is fixed are fixed” (Moretti 2013, 1). According to Moretti, regarding computational analysis and literary theory, this means that we are able to take a literary concept and transform it into a set of operations, “building a bridge from concepts to measurements, and then to the world […], from concepts of literary theory, through some form of quantification, to literary texts” (1). In this research, I have devised a set of operations that builds a bridge between the concept of figurative language as a network, through a computational analysis, to literary texts, mapping in this way the interrelatedness of metaphors in a given text or corpus.  </p>
            <p>The idea of metaphoric exchange as a network is implicitly present in the works of various researchers, such as Lakoff and Johnson, Hans Blumenberg and I. A. Richards, each theorizes about it from a different angle. Lakoff and Johnson’s theory of metaphors, in  <hi rend="italic">Metaphors We Live By</hi>, argue that metaphors are not simply a “rhetorical flourish”, but rather constitutive of our perception of the world: “our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature” (3). They distinguish between three major types of metaphors, orientational, ontological and structural, and in certain cases the latter is “based on similarities that arise out of orientational and ontological metaphors” (152). This substantiates my argument regarding the network structure of figurative language, since the first two types of metaphors serve as an underlying interconnected metaphoric structure, akin to Richards’ unwitting metaphors, on the basis of which new and richer metaphoric exchange is possible.  <note> See Lakoff and Johnson, 2003. <hi rend="italic">Metaphors We Live By</hi>, 61.</note> That metaphors have the structure of a network is arguably most evident in Lakoff and Johnson’s notion of metaphorical entailment, according to which instances of a structural metaphor such as   <hi rend="italic">time is money</hi>, e.g. <hi rend="italic">time is a resource, time is a valuable commodity</hi>, link between “all the instances of a single metaphorical structuring of a concept” (96). Furthermore, entailments do not just tie together instances of the same metaphorical structuring, but also create interactions between dissimilar metaphors, as Lakoff and Johnson state: “a shared metaphorical entailment can establish a cross-metaphorical correspondence” (96). </p>
            <p>Thinking about metaphors merely as a decorative art, as “colored talk” as do the Athenian judges according to Puttenham, ascribes the figurative with a secondary status, an optional addition to the ‘real’ literal meaning of our verbal expressions. In <hi rend="italic">Paradigms for a Metaphorology, </hi>Blumenberg questions whether all metaphoric expressions are in fact translatable to a literal underlying meaning by introducing what he calls absolute metaphors:   </p>
            <p>Absolute metaphors ‘answer’ the supposedly naïve, in principle unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not <hi rend="italic">pose</hi> them ourselves but find them already <hi rend="italic">posed</hi> in the ground of our existence (Blumenberg 2010, 14).</p>
            <p>Blumenberg gives the “<hi rend="italic">terra incognita</hi>” metaphor as an example of an absolute metaphor, grounding it in the historical experiences of the age of discovery, to which the metaphor provided an entire way of perceiving reality, “a relation to the world that imagines itself to be standing on the threshold of an immeasurable increase in knowledge” (54). Absolute metaphors are hence a part of a historical network of metaphoric exchanges, as they both originate in specific circumstances and they themselves “have a history” (5). Their absoluteness means that they are resistant to conversion into conceptuality, but “not that one metaphor could not be replaced or represented by another, or corrected through a more precise one” (5). In other words, absolute metaphors manifest in various metaphoric instances and they too take part in meaning transference, shaping other metaphors as well as being reshaped by the exchanges.      </p>
            <p>By mapping out the network of figurative language in a text, we construct a “diagram of forces”, to use Moretti’s application of Thompson’s idea, i.e., a diagram that discloses “the forces that have been at work” (Moretti 2005, 56) in shaping the network’s structure. These forces are a resonance of the social reality and ideological significations that underlie the production of a text, whether they are the result of a dominant factor, such as politics, religion, psychology, or of any combination of factors. An analysis of such a network makes it possible “to burrow down to the substructure of thought, the underground” (Blumenberg 2010, 5), indicating to us “the fundamental certainties, conjectures, and judgments in relation to which the attitudes and expectations, actions and inactions […] of an epoch are regulated” (14). Unlike texts low on metaphors, such as legal documents or medical books, texts saturated with figurative language, such as poetry and early modern English drama, provide us with comprehensive networks of metaphors, making them especially instrumental for the analysis of this substructure of thought and the ideological forces that shape them.</p>

               <head>3.1 Topic Classification vs. Topic Modeling</head>
               <p>In order to operationalize the network structure of figurative language, the first step that I suggest is to break down the figurative expressions into their components, such as the tenor and vehicle, and classify which words in a given instance carry a metaphoric meaning. For example, consider the following sentence from <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>: “Let's make us medicines of our great revenge” (IV.iii.217). The words “medicines” and “revenge” are essential in this figurative instance, while a word such as “great” does not carry a figurative significance. Although it could be argued that, in a sense, “great” is also metaphoric, since it ascribes size to an abstract idea, i.e., revenge, yet if the adjective of revenge were the word monstrous, there would hardly be a question as to its metaphoric status, and it too would have been included in the analysis. Separating the various figurative components enables us to trace the repetition of the components in other metaphoric instances, mapping in this way the multiple interactions that each component takes part in. However, constructing a network on the basis of words would yield an immense network and, moreover, it would not be efficient for capturing various manifestations of similar metaphors, such as in Lakoff and Johnson’s example:     <hi rend="italic">time is money</hi> and <hi rend="italic">time is a valuable commodity.</hi> In order to overcome this difficulty, I have devised a system of classification, i.e., grouping together words into shared topics; thus, words like money and valuable commodity are both classified under a topic titled ‘economy’. By using a computational method called topic classification, I have automated this step of the operationalization, a method which requires several other steps in order to complete it.</p>
               <p>The idea behind topic classification is akin to another method called topic modeling, in which a computer divides a text or a corpus into groups of frequently reoccurring words by using a probabilistic calculation.<note> See Blei, David M. Andrew Y. Ng. Michael I. Jordan. 2003. “Latent Dirichlet Allocation”<hi rend="italic">. Journal of Machine Learning Research</hi>, Vol. 3, pp. 993-1022. </note> The importance of the probabilistic approach is that words have various meanings depending on their context; thus, each word has a certain probability of appearing with certain words and another probability of appearing with others, accounting in this way for the multiple senses of a word.<note> One of the earliest topic modeling was introduced by Thomas Hofmann in 1999 under the name pLSI (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing), which was later developed into the more advanced technique called LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)  by Blei, NG and Jordan in 2003 (See Blei et al. <hi rend="italic">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</hi>)<hi rend="italic">.</hi>
                  </note> Topic modeling has applications in various fields, from biomedicine, cognitive science, to anthropology, political science, journalism, social media analysis and others.<note> See Liu et al, 2016. “an Overview of Topic Modeling and its Current Application in Bioinformatics” <hi rend="italic">, SpringerPlus</hi> 5:1608; Boyd-Garber et al, 2017. “Applications of Topic Models”,  <hi rend="italic">Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval</hi>, Vol XX, No. XX, pp. 1-54; Landauer, Thomas K., D. McNamara, S. Dennis, and W. Kintsch (eds.). 2011. <hi rend="italic">Handbook of Latent Semantic Analysis</hi>, New York and London: Routledge; Marwick, Ben. 2014. “Discovery of Emergent Issues and Controversies in Anthropology Using Text Mining, Topic Modeling, and Social Network Analysis of Microblog Content”, in Yanchang Zhao and Yonghua Cen (eds).   <hi rend="italic">Data Mining Applications with R</hi>. </note> Although topic modeling algorithms have further advanced in recent years, such as the BAT model (Bidirectional Adversarial Topic) in 2020 and TND (Topic Noise Discriminator) in 2022, <note> See Churchill, Rob and Lisa Singh. 2023. <hi rend="italic">Using topic-noise models to generate domain-specific topics across data sources</hi>; Wang et al, 2020. <hi rend="italic">Neural Topic Modeling with Bidirectional Adversarial Training</hi>.</note> so as to result in more accurate output, there are still major obstacles when it comes to the topic modeling of figurative language.  </p>
               <p>Unsupervised topic modeling is entirely automated, a process in which the computer analysis results in groups of words, the number of groups is predetermined manually, and each group is titled only numerically as topic 1, topic 2 and so on. It is important to note that both topic modeling and classification take into account the context of words, so that certain words appear in multiple groups. In topic modeling, however, discerning the titles of the groups of words remains a manual task that requires an active and often subjective interpretation. A list of words considered as a topic by a topic modeling may include words that human interpreters recognize as belonging to distinct topics, a problem termed by Chang et al. as “word intrusion”, as in following example: “{dog, cat, horse, apple, pig, cow}” (Chang, J. et al 2009, 3). Although here the word apple is easily identified as the intruder, in certain cases the list of words is almost completely incoherent. This problem is related to the difficulty of predetermining the number of topics, an issue that affects the degree to which a topic modeling is successful in creating coherent topics. On the one hand, having a low number of topics may result in overgeneralizations, i.e., in broad topics, conflating two or more into one. But on the other hand, having a large number of topics is likely to result “in uninterpretable topics that pick out idiosyncratic word combinations” (Steyvers 2011, 441).             </p>
               <p>In general, unsupervised topic modeling works best when the analyzed corpus has a relatively small number of topics, with optimally few dominant ones per text in the corpus.<note> See Gabe Igantow and Rada Mihalcea, 2017. <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Text Mining: Research Design, Data Collection, and Analysis</hi>.</note> Topic modeling of encyclopedias or scientific journals is hence highly effective, since each encyclopedic entrance has relatively a clear topic orientation with a small number of other possible contexts. For example, under ‘theatre’ in Wikipedia are names of playwrights, plays, theatres and other related words, but one can also find words relating to various cultures and rituals. When it comes to a text highly saturated with figurative language, using topic modeling tends to result in collocations of unrelated words, forming incoherent topics in various degrees. This occurs since metaphoric components that appear frequently together, i.e., they present a high probability of belonging to the same topic according to the algorithm, nonetheless belong to distinct conceptual domains. And yet, since poetry and plays contain both figurative and literal language, it becomes possible, to a certain degree, to successfully conduct topic modeling, albeit without being able to discern which of the topics and words are the ones used figuratively. The possible benefit of applying topic modeling to poetry is in providing a thematic overview of a poem or a corpus, as shown in the work of Borja Navarro-Colorado, and yet not without qualifications. In his research, he applies LDA-topic modeling to a corpus of 5,078 Spanish sonnets, using various methods in order to reduce incoherent topics. Upon comparing 100 LDA-topics with the thematic reading of the sonnets by Rivers, he concluded that: “we cannot find a clear or constant relationship between a LDA-topic and a theme out of this comparison” (Navarro 2018, 7). Navarro recognizes the problematic character of figurative language with regard to topic modeling, stating that:          </p>
               <p>LDA topic modeling applied to poetry does not extract clear and defined themes as it does when applied to scientific texts. […] In scientific texts there are words that are used exclusively in very specific contexts, related to specific topics. […] The linguistic uses in poetry work in the exact opposite way. In poetry a word related with a specific topic can be frequently used to refer to other topics (7-8).<note> Only when Navarro further reduced the 100 topics to 81, and then manually classified the rest into 13 classes, considering several LDA-topics as in fact belonging to one theme, that the topic modeling was able “to group together texts with the same theme” (Navarro, 10).</note>
               </p>
               <p>In another research attempting to use topic modeling on figurative language, Lisa M. Rhody analyzed 4,500 poems, arriving at the conclusion that “topic models of purely figurative language texts like poetry do not produce topics with the same <hi rend="italic">thematic</hi> clarity as those in Blei’s topic model of <hi rend="italic">Science</hi>” (Rhody 2012, 25). This conclusion, however, does not deter Rhody from using topic modeling, but rather sparks a creative approach as to its application on figurative texts. Rhody argues that instead of thematic clarity, what topic modelling offers in the case of poetry is the ability to discern different kinds of discourses, thus it leads to a close reading of poems “with high proportions of the same topic in order to check whether or not the poems are drawing from similar discourses, even if those same poems have different <hi rend="italic">thematic</hi> concerns” (33). Hence, it is actually due to the imperfect results of the algorithm, she argues, that topic modelling of “highly-figurative language” is useful for literary criticism, since “poetry causes it to fail in ways that are potentially productive” (33). It is important to note, however, that Rhody treats the entirety of a poem as figurative, even though poems usually include literal parts as well. Although Rhody suggests a way to benefit from topic modeling in the analysis of figurative texts, it is merely bypassing the difficulties and not solving them.</p>
               <p>A figurative sentence is in a sense antithetical to the idea of topic modeling regarding the dominance of one topic in a said document, since a metaphor equates between two components from dissimilar contexts, both of equal importance.  Since the purpose of the operationalization that I suggest is to create a network of the interactions between metaphoric components, ascribing a dominant topic, even with one or two minor topics, to an entire poem cannot provide data about the metaphoric interactions. For that purpose, one must ascribe topics to individual words within a text and only then analyze their interactions. However, not all the words are relevant, as certain words are not indicative of topics, such as prepositions, articles and others, which are called in NLP stop words. In most cases, prior to the topic classification or topic modeling, the text undergoes a preprocessing, in which one of the methods is the cleaning of excess linguistic units, such as stop words, punctuation, names of characters and others. Matthew Jockers, for example, in his topic modeling of 19  th century novels, found that “highly interpretable and thematically coherent topics could be derived through a model built entirely from nouns” (Jockers 2013, 131); hence, all the adjectives, adverbs, verbs, pronouns and so on, were cleaned in the preprocessing. Since in many figurative instances there is significance to adjectives, adverbs and verbs, for example when Timon says: “feast your ears with the music” (III.vii.32-3), excluding such words would leave out valuable information from the analysis of figurative language.       </p>
               <p>Using topic classification, instead of unsupervised topic modeling, makes it possible to overcome the various problems posed by figurative language, such as the incoherency of topics and the dominance of a single or few topics in an entire text. In topic classification, the titles as well as the number of topics are predetermined by the researcher in advance. Unlike topic modeling, automating topic classification requires a process of pretraining an algorithm via machine learning on a manually classified dataset. Manual topic classification could suffice when researching a relatively small number of texts, but in cases of big data training a topic classifier provides an alternative to topic modeling, one which is advantageous for the analysis of figurative language. Although my focus is on one case study, namely on   <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>, and hence a manual classification would have been enough in order to test this method’s potential for textual analysis, I have trained a topic classifier both to demonstrate the computational automatization of topic classification as well as to provide basis for future research on a large corpus.  </p>
               <p>In order to create the dataset for training a topic classifier, I have used four tragedies written around the same time as  <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> (1607).<note> The rationale behind choosing plays from the same genre and written around the same time, though by various playwrights, is to create a domain-specific dataset with a range of examples and to minimize outliers (See Brownlee, Jason. 2020. <hi rend="italic">Data Preparation for Machine Learning</hi>). </note> The plays in the dataset are <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> (1606) by Shakespeare and partly by Middelton,  <hi rend="italic">A Yorkshire Tragedy</hi> (1605) by Middleton, <hi rend="italic">The Rape of Lucrece</hi> (1607) by Heywood and <hi rend="italic">The Bloody Banquet</hi> (1610) by Dekker and Middleton.<note> The exact dating of these five plays is a debatable issue (See Wiggins), but in all likelihood they were written between 1605-1610. For the sake of consistency, I follow the datings suggested by Martin Wiggins in the <hi rend="italic">British Drama 1533-1642: A Catalogue,</hi> Vols V &amp; VI, 2015.</note> Since plays contain both literal and figurative language, the first step was to extract all the figurative instances. Although there are methods in computer science for figurative language recognition, in which algorithms detect whether a sentence is figurative or not, they do not isolate figurative sentences from a whole text, but rather require the text to be parsed first into sentences in order to be applied.  <note> See Mao et al, 2022. “MetaPro: a Computational metaphor processing model for text pre-processing”, <hi rend="italic">Information Fusion,</hi> 86-87, pp. 30-43; Babieo et al, 2022. “MIss RoBERTa WiLDe: Metaphor Identification Using Masked Language Model with Wikitionary Lexical Definitions”,  <hi rend="italic">Applied Sciences,</hi> 12, 2081; Potamias R. A., Siolas G., Stafylopatis, A. 2019. “A Robust Deep Ensemble Classifier for Figurative Language Detection”, in <hi rend="italic">International Conference on Engineering Applications of Neural Networks</hi>, pp. 164-175.</note> Parsing the plays automatically into sentences also proves unsuitable for the purpose of analyzing figurative language, since sentences can include more than one figurative instance, by which I do not mean simply that multiple words are used figuratively, as is the case in any metaphor, but that there are at times multiple unique metaphors in a sentence. For the time being, it seems there is no escape from extracting the figurative instances manually.</p>
               <p>The number of figurative instances that I extracted from the four plays is 1,388: <hi rend="italic">A Yorkshire Tragedy</hi>: 146; <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>: 482; <hi rend="italic">The Rape of Lucrece</hi>: 415; <hi rend="italic">The Bloody Banquet</hi>: 345. The next step of creating the dataset is to determine the number of topics and what are the topics themselves, and then manually classify each of the 1,388 instances into the topics. Since the topics should be as relevant to the corpus as possible, I did not decide in advance what they would be, but rather worked from the texts up, gleaning the topics from the figurative instances and slowly adding more topics. In this process, I experimented with various topics, observing, for example, that certain new topics were required, or that at times it would be better to split one topic into two, or that a certain topic is redundant and should be subsumed under a different one. The final result was 103 topics, such as ‘nature’, ‘politics’, ‘economy’, ‘sexuality’ and others (see Figure 1).</p>

               <p>Although determining the number of topics and their titles has subjective aspects, it does not necessarily undermine the viability of topic classification, but rather shows that various classifications are possible depending on the researcher’s orientation. For example, one might decide that ‘art’ is a topic, while another may wish to distinguish between several topics pertaining to art, such as ‘paintings’, ‘sculptures’ and so on. Deciding on the topics depends both on the corpus and the purpose of the research; thus, if the corpus deals with art, it is more likely that the researcher would want to distinguish between various artistic media. The subjective decision regarding the topics, hence, yields an analysis of different levels of the corpus that are not contradictory.  <note> Another subjective aspect is with regard to the classifying process itself, since, given the same set of topics and figurative instances, two interpreters might still choose different topics for a word in certain cases. The inter-annotators agreement (IAA) is a method by which the agreement between interpreters can be measured, providing a status of consensus, in varying degrees, to the classifications (this procedure requires certain resources and hence will be implemented in a future study).  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Once I had completed the manual classification of the dataset, I experimented with various methods in NLP in order to train a classifier that automatically labels each word in a figurative instance into one of the 103 topics. After cleaning stop words and character names from the dataset, I have trained a type of deep learning algorithm called neural network combined with DistilBERT, a version of the pretrained language model developed by Google.   <note> See Sanh et al, 2019. <hi rend="italic">DistilBERT, a Distilled Version of BERT: Smaller, Faster, Cheaper and Lighter</hi>.</note> Since the original texts of the plays are not in standard spelling or punctuation, I have used contemporary editions in order to have consistency in the dataset and with DistilBERT, being pretrained on contemporary English.<note> Initially I experimented with training the classifier on the original texts taken from EEBO (Early English Book Online), without spelling standardization, but the results were better with the contemporary editions.

F-score is another important measure of predictive performance, calculating two factors called precision and recall (see Derczynski’s <hi rend="italic">Complementarity, F-score, and NLP Evaluation</hi>, 2016).</note> The accuracy is the precent of correct predictions of the classifier, i.e., in the process of training the algorithm the dataset is randomly split into two, a training dataset (66%) and a test dataset (33%), so that in this way the algorithm compares between its own predictions and the original ones made by the creator of the dataset. After completing the topic classification of the text under research, the next step that I suggest for the operationalization of figurative language as a network is mapping the interactions between the topics, applying for this purpose a method called network analysis. </p>

               <head>3.2 Network Analysis</head>
               <p>Network analysis is a branch of graph theory in mathematics and it has various applications, such as in sociology, economics, history and medicine; for example, in epidemiological research, network theory is used for determining the diffusion of diseases.<note> See Cherven, Ken. 2015.   <hi rend="italic">Mastering Gephi Network Visualization</hi>. UK: Birmingham, Packt Publishing. For the influence of network theory in humanistic research see Ruth Ahnert et al. 2020. <hi rend="italic">The Network Turn: Changing Perspectives in the Humanities</hi>.</note> Network theory is a highly developed field, rich with techniques, approaches as well as debates, but for the purpose of this research there are specific relevant concepts, on which my discussion will now focus. Firstly, a network has two basic features, the nodes, usually represented by circles in the visualization, which can stand for various entities, as individual human beings, numbers, places, words, topics, etc., depending on the objectives of the researcher. The second feature is the edges, visually represented by lines connecting the circles, which stand for the interactions between the nodes on the basis of what the researcher defines as an interaction. For example, a researcher working on cinema can define an interaction as the co-occurrence of two characters in a scene, while another researcher may define an interaction only when there is also a verbal exchange between the characters.  <note> See Chung-Yi Weng et al. 2009. <hi rend="italic">RoleNet: Movie Analysis from the Perspective of Social Networks</hi>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>An important distinction in network analysis is between directed and undirected networks, each of which represents different relations between the nodes and is used for different purposes. Directed networks are used for “relational phenomena that logically have a sense of direction” (Borgatti 2013, 12), meaning that one node in the network leads to another and so on, as in cases such as contagious disease or the flow of information. In undirected networks, the relations between the nodes “must always be reciprocated, as in ‘was seen with’ or ‘is kin to’” (12), as well as in the example of characters appearing in the same scene. In my construction of the network of figurative topics, I defined an interaction between two topics as their co-occurrence in the same figurative instance, entailing that it is an undirected network, e.g., in “Macbeth does murder sleep” (II.ii.37), there is an interaction between the topic of ‘violence’ and that of ‘sleep’. The interactions between the nodes can be weighted, so that if a topic appears with another topic multiple times on different occasions, then the weight of their interaction is higher, being the sum of their co-occurrence, which is visually represented by a thicker line.  </p>
               <p>Another aspect of network analysis is calculating various kinds of centralities, whose purpose is to measure how central different nodes are in the network in relation to other nodes. <note> For a discussion on other centrality measures and their role in humanities see Ruth Ahnert et al. 2020. <hi rend="italic">The Network Turn: Changing Perspectives in the Humanities</hi>, esp. chap 5. </note> The four centralities which I will now discuss are degree centrality, weighted degree centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality. Degree centrality is the measurement of a node’s unique interactions, indicating the number of nodes with which a node interacts.<note> See Cherven, esp. chap 1; see Stephen P. Borgatti et al. 2013. <hi rend="italic">Analyzing Social Networks</hi>, esp. Chap 10.</note> For example, if a particular node has a total of fifty interactions, but all of them are with just one other node, its degree centrality would be one. Weighted degree centrality measures the total amount of interactions of a node; thus, with regard to the previous example, the weighted degree of such a node would be fifty.    </p>
               <p>Before discussing the other two kinds of centralities, I will discuss another issue that is relevant with regard to these centralities, i.e., the clustering of nodes as well as the core-periphery structure. There are various algorithms that detect clusters in a network, and although each works somewhat differently, in general they calculate the connectedness of nodes, clustering together nodes that have more interactions between them. <note> Examples of such algorithms are Clustering Coefficient, Modularity Class, Chinese Whispers, Link Communities, Hierarchical Clustering (See Cherven, esp. chap 6; Borgatti, esp. chap 11; Albert-László Barabási, 2016. <hi rend="italic">Network Science</hi>, esp. chap 9). </note> In a network that consists of two clusters, for example, each cluster has several nodes that interact amongst themselves repeatedly, but only one node from each cluster has interactions with the other cluster. Betweenness centrality measures exactly this sort of positions that nodes occupy within a network; thus, nodes with high betweenness function as bridges between poorly connected clusters.<note> See Cherven, chap 1 &amp; 6; Borgatti, esp. chap 10. </note> The core-periphery structure, unlike clusters, consists only of two blocks, that of the core in which the nodes are highly connected to each other, and that of the periphery in which the nodes are connected to certain core nodes, as well as partially or not at all to other peripheral nodes. Core nodes, hence, have high degree centrality as well as high betweenness, presenting multiple unique interactions that keep peripheral nodes connected to the network.   <note> See Borgatti, esp. chap 12; see Stuart Oldham et al. 2019. “Consistency and Differences between Centrality Measures across Distinct Classes of Networks”, in <hi rend="italic">PLoS ONE</hi> 14(7).</note> High betweenness nodes might not be themselves highly connected, i.e., their degree is not necessarily high, but they play a central role in maintaining the network as a whole, since without them the network would either split into distinct components or present weaker and less meaningful relations.   </p>
               <p>The fourth kind of centrality is the eigenvector, which measures the influence of a node in a network by calculating the interactions of a node with other highly connected nodes, even though this node itself might not be well connected. In <hi rend="italic">Centrality and Network Flow</hi>, Stephen Borgatti explains the eigenvector as follows: “The idea is that even if a node influences just one other node, who subsequently influences many other nodes (who themselves influence still more others), then the first node in that chain is highly influential” (Borgatti 2005, 61). For example, consider node 'A' has many interactions with just one other node, node 'B', while node 'B' interacts with many nodes in the network, meaning that it has a high degree centrality. In such a case, since node ‘A’ has a significant relation with node ‘B’, a well-connected node, node ‘A’ is in an influential position in the network. One way of understanding this centrality is as a hierarchical system, in which a high-ranking individual communicates with just one lower ranking individual, while this second in command interacts with the rest of the group. Simply put, it is not just interactions with a high number of nodes that entails a node is influential, but whether a node interacts with other well-connected nodes.</p>
               <p>To construct the networks of figurative topics, I have used a software called <hi rend="italic">Gephi</hi>, which includes many algorithms, statistics and filters in order to analyze the data. When constructing the network with <hi rend="italic">Gephi</hi>, I have used one file which contains a list of all the nodes and another file which contains a list of all the interactions. Figure 3 and 4 show networks of the figurative instances that appear in Figure 2, in which the size of the nodes represent the degree centrality and the colors of the nodes represent the clusters. </p>

               </p>
               <p>It is important to note that <hi rend="italic">Gephi</hi> initially provides a random layout of the network, to which the researcher can then apply various algorithms in order to detect clusters and organize the network’s structure. Thus, when constructing the network of  <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> for the analysis in the following section, <hi rend="italic">Gephi</hi> produced first a random layout (see Figure 5) of the 4,715 interactions between the topics that appear in the 546 figurative instances extracted from the play. Figure 6 shows the network of the play after I applied algorithms for cluster detection, centrality measurements as well as ForceAtlas2, an algorithm that organizes the network by simulating gravity between the nodes.<note> See Jacomy et al. 2014. <hi rend="italic">ForceAtlas 2, a Continuous Graph Layout Algorithm for Handy Network Visualization Designed for the Gephi Software.</hi> PLOS ONE 9(6).</note>
               </p>
               <p>The final step is to assess the usefulness of a text’s network of figurative topics regarding its ability to contribute to the interpretative criticism of that text, whether by corroborating certain assumptions, challenging existing views or by altogether providing new insights. Ultimately, the computational methods of distant reading used in this research are but tools and not the end in themselves. Topic classification and network analysis can be meaningful for literary studies in so far as we actively engage with the patterns they reveal and return differently <figure>

               <head>4.1 Initial Results and Assessments</head>
               <p>Anyone who has read or been to a production of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> knows that the main theme of the play pertains to economic issues, and yet it would not be obvious to say outright that the topic of ‘economy’ dominates the play’s figurative language. Although it is unsurprising to find out that the figurative topic of economy has high centrality measures, the fact that <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> revolves around money, credit and debt, does not necessarily mean that the figurative language does too. In the following interpretation of the play my focus is, first of all, on the major figurative topics in the network, but this by no means entails that one cannot interpret the network differently and focus on other topics and their interactions. That at the heart of     <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> beats a struggle with the rise of mercantile capitalism serves only as the starting point for many researchers, whose focus then varies widely, covering a range of auxiliary subjects from gender to politics, religion, aesthetics and others.<note> See Grady, Hugh. 2009. <hi rend="italic">Modernity, </hi>“Usury and Art in Timon of Athens”. <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare and Impure Aesthetics</hi>. Cambridge UP; Kaytor, Daryl. 2012. “Shakespeare’s Political Philosophy: a Debt to Plato in Timon of Athens”, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy and Literature, </hi>Vol. 36(1), pp. 136-152; Prendergast, Maria Teresa M. 2020. “Unmanly Melancholy”: Lack, Fetishism, and Abuse in <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Criticism</hi> Vol 42(2), pp. 207-227; Jackson, Ken. 2001. ““One Wish” or the Possibility of the Impossible: Derrida, the Gift, and God in <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>.” <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Quarterly</hi>, Vol 52 (1), pp. 34-66.</note> However, isolating various phenomena into distinct domains, such as economy and politics, whether this process is rooted in our daily experiences, stems from a mental process or serves only a discursive purpose for research, in the end does not mean that each phenomenon exists on its own, severed from an intricate network of ties with other phenomena. </p>
               <p>According to the data of <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi>’s network, the three topics with the highest centrality measures are ‘economy’, ‘anatomy’ and ‘nature’ (see Figure 7). The various discrepancies between centrality measures, such as that ‘nature’ has a relatively low number of weighted degree and a high eigenvector, are in themselves significant indicators prompting further investigation. Although subjects such as nature and anatomy have received critical attention, considering both together in relation to economy is usually anecdotal or at best indirectly discussed via related subjects, such as the relation between reproduction and mother earth as an implicit conjunction of body and nature.     <note> Works with affinity to the subject of the body in  <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> include, for example, “Carnival, Friendship and Beautiful Death” by Adriana Raducanu (2020); “Be as a Planetary Plague”: Pestilence and Cure in <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>” by Jodie Austin (2020); “Forms of Payback and the Genre of Debt” by Amanda Bailey (2011); “A Nature but Infected: Plague and Embodied Transformation in <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>” by Darryl Chalk (2009); Works with affinity to the subject of the nature include: “Shakespeare and the Ideologies of the Marketplace” by Renato Rizzoli (2017); “Each Thing a Thief: Walter Benjamin on the Agency of Objects” by Julia Ng (2011).    </note> Thus, inspecting the relations between the network’s main topics already provides us with a potentially ripe plot that has been overlooked, which can serve for the development of a novel critical interpretation.  </p>

               <p>Figure 8: data of the top 14 interactions between nodes in the network of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>.</p>
               <p>The network analysis, it is important to note, does not just indicate that the aforementioned topics are dominant in the play due to their high occurrence, but also reveals the interactions that these topics have with other topics (see Figure 8). A close reading of the play that integrates an analysis of the network should also read closely the network itself, consider the nuanced interactions between topics as well as the meaning behind the various centrality measures. <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi>’s network presents strong interactions between the topics of ‘economy’, ‘anatomy’ and ‘social relations’, as the highest number of interactions that each of them has is with the two other topics. This core trio of topics at the center of the network branches out through ‘economy’ and ‘anatomy’ to other significant topics such as ‘food’, ‘violence’, ‘nature’ and ‘emotions’. The data in Figure 8 shows this branching out by the fact that both ‘economy’ and ‘anatomy’ appear multiple times with various topics, whereas ‘social relations’ appears only with ‘economy’ and ‘anatomy’. Moreover, this is evident by the cluster analysis, as seen in Figure 6, in which ‘anatomy’ belongs to one cluster, whereas ‘economy’ and ‘social relations’ to another. The dominant topic in the third cluster is ‘nature’, whose relatively high betweenness expresses its distinct place in the network.     </p>
               <p>Although the betweenness centrality of ‘nature’ is quite similar to that of ‘anatomy’ and ‘economy’, relative to its weighted degree in comparison to these two topics, the high betweenness of ‘nature’ stands out. This indicates that ‘nature’ spreads throughout the network so as to become a dominant force across the play, vital for keeping the relation between core and periphery, thus maintaining the network as a whole. Timon’s mock encomium to thievery expresses a stance regarding nature similar to the one in the network, as being the medium or facilitator for the spread of corrupt economic self-interest:   </p>
               <p>The sun's a thief and with his great attraction</p>
               <p>Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief</p>
               <p>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;</p>
               <p>The sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves</p>
               <p>The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief</p>
               <p>That feeds and breeds by a composture stol’n </p>
               <p>From general excrement. Each thing's a thief (IV.iii.431-7).  </p>
               <p>An important scholarly debate regarding  <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> is how to explain the extreme shift that the character of Timon undergoes, from an altruistic paternal figure in acts 1 and 2 to a misanthropic madman in acts 3-5.<note> See the introduction to <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> (Arden, 2017) by Anthony B. Dawson and Gretchen E. Minton, esp. 52-54. See Bailey, esp. 375-6. See Jackson, esp. 47.</note> Considering this problem through the play’s network can be potentially rewarding, since by constructing networks that include only the figurative instances of Timon in each of the acts, we could compare between them and look for distinct indicators on which to establish an interpretation. Even without scrutinizing the networks of Timon’s first phase (acts 1-2) and second phase (acts 3-5) in search of differences, there is an unmistakable divergence in two major topics, namely the topics of ‘nature’ and ‘social relations’ (see Figures 10 and 11). In the first two acts of Timon’s lines, ‘nature’ barely appears at all and ‘social relations’ is a dominant topic, whereas in the last three acts the centrality of ‘nature’ cannot be ignored, while the topic of ‘social relations’ drastically loses its importance.     </p>

               <p>Figure 11: Network and data of the character of Timon in Acts 3-5.</p>
               <p>Another obvious difference between the two networks, which one can immediately notice by simply looking at their visualizations, is that the network of acts 1-2 is sginificantly smaller and less dense than that of acts 3-5. However, this is not simply attributed to the fact that one network consists of 2 acts while the other of 3 acts, but rather due to two reasons: (i) there is a drastic increase in the total number of words spoken by Timon in act 4. (ii) in acts 3-5 there is an increase in the precentage of words used in the figurative instances in comparison to acts 1 and 2 (see Figure 12).   </p>

               <p>Figure 12: a comparison between the words spoken by Timon in the figurative instances and all the words spoken by him.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head/>
               </figure>
               <p>Both the shift in the two major topics, ‘nature’ and ‘social relations’, and the shift in Timon’s use of figurative language corroborate that there is a pronounced split between the Timon of the first two acts and the Timon of acts 3-5. Comparing between the topic interactions in Timon’s two phases reveals this split as well, as in acts 1-2 the dominant interactions are between ‘economy’, ‘social relations’ and ‘language’, whereas in the rest of the play, they are between ‘economy’, ‘anatomy’ and ‘violence’ (see Figure 13). On the basis of the data from the play’s network, it is possible to assess existing interpretations of the play and of Timon’s split, as well as develop other possible interpretations. Interpretations of Timon’s split and of the play as a whole are ultimately linked; hence, to develop or inspect interpretations of the former, a contextualization through the latter is vital.  </p>
               <p>Consider, for example, Finkelstein’s interpretation in <hi rend="italic">Amicitia and Beneficia in Timon of Athens</hi>, which focuses on nature mainly through Cicero’s notion of sociality and friendship as relationships rooted in nature: “these relationships constitute the state, itself aligned with virtuous nature” (Finkelstein 2020, 805). Finkelstein’s in-depth contextualization of friendship and benefits in <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> through the classical works of Seneca, Plutarch, Cicero and others, though insightful and comprehensive, in the end treats nature’s role in the play mostly in a narrow sense, as the underlying condition of a specific political system, “the republican state as a natural entity” (806). In the network of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens, </hi>the topic of ‘politics’ is relatively a minor one, ranking in the various centralities between place 18-20 (see Figure 7); hence, we may question the stress that Finklestein puts on the political aspects of the play. Moreover, the main interactions of ‘politics’ in the network are with ‘economy’, ‘nature’, ‘anatomy’ and ‘violence’, whereas ‘social relations’ barely interacts with ‘politics’ (see Figure 14), suggesting that there is a certain degree of separation between these two domains, which hence, in the least, qualifies Finkelstein’s interpretation.</p>

               <p>Figure 14: data of the top 16 interactions of the topic ‘politics’ in the network of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>.</p>
               <p>Regarding Timon’s shift, Finkelstein focuses on the relations between economy, politics, the natural state and social relations, arguing that in the first phase Timon acts “both like Cicero’s friend, virtuously giving benefits without an expectation of favor, and like someone almost opposite: Seneca’s strongman, aloof to his expectations of other’s behavior” (812). Timon, however, cannot have it both ways; hence, on the one hand, “the collapse of relationships in the second half feels like a violent breach in nature”, and on the other hand, it “points to the need for a strong political will that can distinguish virtue from venality” (817). The argument regarding Timons’ first phase could be seen as having an expression in Timon’s networks, i.e., the shift from the topic of ‘social relations’ to that of ‘nature’. However, regarding the latter phase, there is no indication that ‘politics’ undergoes a change in position (see Figures 10 and 11) or gains a special significance in Timon’s top interactions in either phases (see Figures 15 and 16).  </p>

               <p>Figure 16: Timon’s top interactions in acts 3-5.</p>
               <p>Another interpretation worth considering is Ken Jackson’s influential reading of the play, which sees Timon’s motivation for gift-giving in a positive Christian light, distinguishing his reading from the critical tradition of seeing in a “negative (Johnsonian) view Timon’s giving” (Jackson 2001, 39). According to Jackson, “in creating the sudden split between the two Timons, Shakespeare actually reveals their proximity. Timon’s misanthropy is implied in his giving. […] his misanthropy is religious, a necessary renunciation of the circular economy of exchange” (47). For Jackson, Timon is a kind of Abrahamic figure, for whom in “responding to the call of the other, God, the impossible, ‘a duty to hate is implied’” (46). Furthermore, Jackson argues, Timon is in a sense caught between the ethical and the religious, which explains his “confusing generosity, the way he simultaneously seems to love others but, in that love, to distance himself” (51). </p>
               <p>The main topics involved in Jackson’s interpretation, as it were, are ‘economy’, ‘religion’, ‘ethics’, ‘social relations’ and ‘emotions’. Although in the entire play’s network the topics of ‘religion’ and ‘ethics’ are somewhat more significant than ‘politics’ (in comparison to Finkelstein’s emphasis), they are also relatively minor ones (see Figure 7). The topic of ‘emotions’ is a significant topic in the whole, but in Jackson’s interpretation it is not as emphasized as the other topics. However, looking closely at Timon’s two networks (see Figures 10 and 11) reveals that in the first phase ‘ethics’ is quite significant and ‘religion’ is in the background, yet in the second phase ‘religion’ gains prominence, whereas ‘ethics’ decreases. These shifts are not as pronounced as those of ‘nature’ and ‘social relations’, but they are significant enough to argue that the network expresses what is for Jackson, in the second part of the play, a radical movement towards the religious. In the following section, I develop a reading of the play and the problem of the two Timons on the basis of the computational analysis, examining whether the play’s network provides information that can coalesce into a coherent interpretation. </p>

               <head>4.2 Interpreting <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>
               </head>
               <p>From its outset, <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens </hi>presents the relations between the characters as revolving around economic value, and throughout the play it remains the key element in defining the mode of existence of the Athenian society. Whether it is the appraisal of commodities, the patronage of art, the showering of gifts or the collecting of debt, the play repeatedly foregrounds social relations through economic exchanges, so as to produce an almost fixed image of the market as “the constant model of human relations” (Rizzoli 2017, 22). As earlier mentioned, the network analysis does not just support the interpretation that economic considerations and social relations are indissolubly tied together in the play (Figure 8), but rather provides insights into the nature of this tie as perceived by Timon in comparison to the ruling mode of thinking in Athens. </p>
               <p>On the basis of the network, I argue that whereas what makes the world of Athens go around is the monetary economic form, Timon perceives the world (in his first phase of the play) through the economic form of barter. Building on Marx’s definition of barter as a relation between commodities in which one converts “the bodily shape of that other commodity into the form of its own value" (Goux 1990, 37), Goux argues in <hi rend="italic">Symbolic Economies</hi> that this is equivalent to the social relations taking place in the formation of the ego, having “precisely the same structure as <hi rend="italic">the specular relationship with the other</hi>” (13). Identifying with another brings about the experience of the self, an “identification with the image of the <hi rend="italic">like</hi>” (14). Just like when two commodities in barter express “value in the body of the other”, so is the case in social relations of identification, as “in each other’s presence, the two beings recognize each other as similar” (13). The three main topics in Timon’s network of acts 1-2, i.e., ‘economy’, ‘social relations’ and ‘anatomy’, are constitutive of the barter form as a mode of thinking, as an absolute metaphor, since it is their interactions that bring about the process of social identification as the symbolic economy of barter.  </p>
               <p>In his philanthropic phase, Timon experiences his own worth through an identification with the worth he ascribes to his friends, telling Apemantus: “what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends?” (I.ii.100-1). However, Timon’s identification is with their collective worth; thus, on the one hand, it is as though he places himself above each of them as individuals, and yet on the other hand, his sense of self is fragmented and distributed among others like his gifts and fortune. Underlying both Timon’s understanding of gift-giving and of friendship is a desire for worth and meaning anchored in a concrete, bodily presence, one that affirms his personal relations. However, Timon does not live in a society dominated by barter but rather by money, an economic form that splits between the intrinsic value and the extrinsic value, between the concrete materiality of a commodity and its value in the marketplace. Although Timon is not oblivious to the reality of money, he appears unwilling to accept and internalize it as a mode of thinking.<note> According to Marc Shell in <hi rend="italic">The Economy of Literature</hi>, “there is a theoretical necessity for, as well as the historical fact of, the internalization of economic form in language. Unlike specific <hi rend="italic">topoi</hi>, this internalization is general; it invades and pervades everything” (Shell 1978, 15).</note> It is important to note that Timon’s barter perception of social relations is not free from economic considerations and self-interest, as he openly says to his so-called friends: “what need we have any friends, if we should ne’er have need of ‘em? They were the most needless creatures living should we ne’er have use for ‘em” (I.ii.94-6). And yet, Timon expects his gifts to be reciprocated with the friendship of those who receive them, and a material reciprocation, if the need were to arise, is premised for him on this owed fraternity, not on a binding legal document of debt.</p>
               <p>The culture of credit in early modern England that informs the play was, on the one hand, rooted in personal relations of trust and advanced communal bonds, and yet on the other hand, at the end of the 16th century, credit became more and more anchored in legal contracts, turning into an impersonal system in which violent penalty became the mechanism of enforcement.<note> See Bailey, 382. </note> Timon believes his credit network is one of personal relations, a communal body that breaks bread and shares “one another’s fortunes” (I.ii.103). The transaction of credit opens up both a temporal and a spatial gap between those involved, as it postpones the end of the exchange. This gap, when mediated by trust, becomes a social force that ties a community together in personal relations despite physical distance, and yet when legal mechanisms of penalty occupy the gap, it turns even social relations of close proximity into impersonal ones. To close this gap, as it were, the English law placed as collateral the body of the debtor in the hands of creditors, permitting them to “detain his debtor’s indefinitely”, and even to use “the objectionable conditions of prison as a means to exact revenge” (Bailey 2011, 378-9). Although Timon is explicitly the prime source of nourishment and money to his false friends, as he is well-aware, yet since for him they are all tied in reciprocal relations, it is as though he does not distinguish between the body of the community and his own; thus, Apemantus’s words ring true when he says: “what a number of men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not!” (I.ii.39-40). In this stage of the play, Timon believes that the “bond of men” (I.i.148) is a natural relation, that “we are born to do benefits” (I.ii.99-100), and yet this belief is but the result of the illusory appearance of an intrinsic value that exists naturally in the body of a commodity outside of its monetary value.  </p>
               <p>In Timon’s second phase (acts 3-5), he internalizes the economic forms of money and credit, which demystify his idea of a communal body and leads him to discover the inevitable self-interest of the individual body and its frailty in the face of the impersonal law. The rise in the interactions between ‘anatomy’ and ‘violence’ in acts 3-5, as well as with topics such as ‘economy’ and ‘food’ (see Figures 15 &amp; 16), shows that the physical reality of the body itself becomes a pronounced issue for Timon. When he is denied by his so-called friends, his disbelief derives from his belief in barter-like reciprocal social relations, according to which “reciprocal debts contracted between as many interested parties as possible over a number of months, or even years, would be ‘reckoned’ and cancelled against each other” (Muldrew 1998, 101). As Timon experiences this breach in the equality of barter, the veil is lifted from his way of viewing sociality, revealing to him the natural state of man where previously there was simply no need to consciously consider it, since nature and social relations had been perceived as one and the same. The shifts in the centralities of ‘social relations’ and ‘nature’ in Timon’s networks serve as the basis of this interpretation, as the high centrality of ‘social relations’ and low centrality of ‘nature’ in the first half express Timon’s conflating of social bonds with the natural state to the point of disregarding the latter, while his private revelation of the natural state as distinct from the social reality turns the topic of ‘nature’ into a visible and conscious matter for him, bringing to its rise in the second half.    </p>
               <p>The nature that Timon discovers is not a nurturing earth that fosters “the bond of men” and breeds kinship, but rather the “common whore of mankind” that brings out “ungrateful man” and “teem with new monsters” (IV.iii.187, 189). As Rizzoli argues in <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare and the Ideologies of the Marketplace</hi>, the play gestures towards “the ‘naturalized’ image of man and commerce which supports the mercantilist articulation of the market’s laws” (Rizzoli 2017, 22). For Rizzoli, the play shows that “market practices are thus justified as a natural fact; they are shown to be essential and incontestable as the acquisitive drives they aim to gratify” (22). Through the internalized monetary economic form, Timon now sees the natural man as an anti-social animal and yet as inherently economically-minded, driven by the “interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers” (Smith 1776, 380), as observed by Adam Smith in his analysis of mercantilism. </p>
               <p>When living in isolation in the wild, Timon clings to the mere idea of the intrinsic value, of the material body of money and commodities as in barter, exactly because it no longer functions as a symbolic currency for Timon’s social relations of identification and as he takes no part in Athen’s money economy. Unlike money and credit, food functions for Timon as the ultimate barter commodity, a paradigm of the natural materiality, as it necessitates the immediate physical presence of those feasting together. Looking closely at the topic of ‘food’ reveals that it becomes much more dominant for Timon in the second half of the play, and its topic interactions are with ‘anatomy’, ‘nature’ and ‘economy’ (see Figure 17). In the second phase, the distinction between the intrinsic value of gold and that of food becomes finally unmistakable for Timon, and yet they are still inextricably linked for him. Digging the earth in search of roots to satisfy his hunger, Timon exclaims that “Who seeks for better of thee [the earth], sauce his palate / With thy most operant poison” (IV.iii.24-5), and straight away instead of nourishing food he finds gold, the poison of society. Even though gold in its natural state does not provide the immediate presence of worth, but only a social promise of future sustenance, Timon still associates it with a consumable substance, with poison.    </p>
               <p>Moreover, in Timon’s network, ‘food’ and ‘animals’ share strong interactions with ‘violence’, ‘economy’ and ‘nature’ (see Figure 17), whereas for the other characters the topic of ‘animals’ is much less intertwined with ‘food’. Instead, the network I have constructed for the rest of the characters combined shows that for them the topics of ‘social relations’ and ‘food’ are the ones sharing significant interactions, namely with ‘economy’, ‘anatomy’, ‘emotions’ and ‘nature’.    </p>

               <p>Figure 17: a comparison between Timon and the other characters, as pertaining to the topics of ‘animals’, ‘food’ and ‘social relations’; the colored cells indicate shared interactions with ‘food’.</p>
               <p>Once Timon has internalized the monetary economic form, he no longer sees friendship as a natural physical bond, but rather as inextricable from bestial self-serving drives. Reminiscent of Hobbes’s <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, for whom only the coercive power of the state can inhibit the natural state of man as <hi rend="italic">Homo homini lupus,</hi>
                  <note> For Hobbes: “before the names of Just, and Unjust can have place, there must be some coercive Power, to compel men equally to the performance of their Covenants, by the terrour of some punishment” (110).</note> Timon sees violent intervention as the only option against the natural greed of the man-wolf. But, unlike Hobbes, for Timon there is no remedy in the authority of the state’s law and the only real solution is the total destruction of Athens, which he encourages Alcibiades to execute. The inevitable course of events for the self-devouring wolf, according to Timon, is the self-annihilation of mankind, since as Timon poses: “if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner” (IV.iii.332-4). Although Alcibiades fights for what he considers to be Timon’s cause, he ultimately stands for the Hobbesian solution of coercive law. In contrast to all of the other characters in the play, Alcibiades is the only one for whom the topic of ‘judiciary’ is of significance at all (see Figure 18).    </p>

               <p>Figure 18: network and data of Alcibiades’ network of figurative topics.</p>
               <p>Rizzoli’s reading of the play as showing the “dominance of the market and its autonomous laws over any political institution” (Rizzoli 2017, 20) privileges the perspective of the Athenian senators over others in the play, subsuming Alcibiades under their power “by applying to their political actions the contingent strategies of the market” (21). And yet, that the Athenian society is not in utter chaos, despite the all-against-all nature of man that Timon depicts, testifies that a system of law is in place, albeit one that sanctions exploitation through the abuse of credit practices, favoring the economic self-interest of the individual over social and personal bonds. It is against this kind of judicial system that Alcibiades wishes to take revenge, as he faces the Athenian senators with his army and accuses them of making their “wills the scope of justice” (V.v.4-5). According to Bailey’s interpretation, Alcibiades animates “the restorative principal of equivalence in exchange”; thus, his conflict with the senate transforms “the quasi-legal brutality of debt bondage into a state-sanctioned means of affixing relative worth” (Bailey 2011, 397). Alcibiades is not free from economic considerations, but this and his acceptance of the senators’ surrender, do not entail that he unwittingly falls prey to their economic and judicial logic.  </p>
               <p>Although in the end it seems for a moment that Timon finds solace in the idea of a return to nature in death, making his “everlasting mansion / Upon the beached verge of the salt flood” (V.ii.100-1), this daydream quickly shatters by the “turbulent surge” (V.ii.103), as nature and men alike keep harrowing his gravestone. Even in his death, Timon is unable to escape the by-now internalized economic form of money and the economic nature of sociality that accompanies it. In his final words, “Graves only be men’s work and death their gain, / Sun, hide thy beams, Timon hath done his reign” (V.ii.107), the ultimate split takes place between an intrinsic value of materiality, the living body, and an extrinsic value, a gain possessed only in death, in the absence of life and external to it. </p>

            <head>5 Conclusions</head>
            <p>	In this article I have explored a method for operationalizing the theoretical idea that figurative language is a network, as well as tested its potential on the play <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>. The construction of a network from the topics of figurative instances has proved to be an effective method for the analysis of a text, enabling us to interpret closely the network relations between conceptual domains. Using topic classification that focuses on small units, i.e., the figurative instances, instead of topic modeling on the level of an entire text, makes it possible to create a network of the interactions between topics and analyze the figurative language. To further develop this method for the analysis of figurative language, it could be beneficial to turn the network into a directed one in order to explore the relations between tenors and vehicles, considering the directionality from tenor to vehicle. This, however, introduces a variety of challenges, such as figurative cases in which the tenor is absent textually and only implied. Regarding the automatic classification of topics in figurative instances, though it has shown promising results, there are still improvements that can be made. Several conclusions can be drawn from the training of the classifier in order to reach better results, starting with reducing the number of topics and enlarging the dataset, in this way the algorithm will have more data and less ambiguity regarding topics. Moreover, instead of using DistilBERT, experimenting with other large language models, such as Llama, Gemini or ChatGPT, could potentially yield a better topic classifier.   </p>
            <p>Testing the method suggested in this article on <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> has resulted in constructive ways for assessing existing interpretations, as well as in revealing nuanced patterns that contribute to a fruitful close reading of the play and for interpreting various issues that has long occupied scholars. However, it is important to note that although assessing existing interpretations via this method can corroborate certain assumptions and question others, it does not necessarily detract from their overall value. Focusing on subjects that have minor significance in a text’s network is not inherently incorrect, since any subject that is of importance to a researcher is worthwhile. That a certain topic appears a low number of times does not necessarily mean it is not meaningful, as it could appear in crucial parts of a text. In the end, whether certain subjects are significant is a question of the purpose of a given research and the subject that the scholar wishes to focus on. The network of topics is, after all, but a graph representation of the text, and it could be mined, as it were, for insights on the various topics that it represents; thus, any interpretation could potentially benefit from examining the interactions between the topics with which it is concerned.   </p>
            <p>By focusing on the main figurative topics of the play, as well as on those of specific characters and acts, it became possible to form an interpretation that ties together the various strands of data presented by the network analysis. And yet, the network of the play’s figurative topics still holds undiscovered riches, veins of information waiting to be dug up, as each and every topic and interaction in the network could potentially reveal new insights. To conclude, the network of a text’s figurative topics can provide us with a new perspective that brings to light previously unnoticed aspects of the concerns of a text, drawing our attention to discrepancies that make us raise questions and rethink what we know of the text. </p>
