            <p>Catalogue records underpin the audit, curatorial, and public access functions of
               collecting institutions. And they are relied upon by many humanities researchers, and
               increasingly those looking to analyse collection holdings at scale. However, far from
               being a neutral record of collection holdings, catalogues are the products of
               cataloguing labour, often spanning many decades, and so are subject to various biases
               and inequities. Understanding how collection catalogues are shaped by their histories
               is then crucial for addressing many of the contemporary challenges faced by
               cataloguing professionals and for enhancing their use in humanities research, as well
               as for opening up new directions for historical research. This paper contributes a
               computationally-based approach for generating new and important knowledge about
               catalogues, in particular for investigating how a catalogue is shaped by an earlier
               one. We contend that understanding at scale the transmission of records and style
               from one catalogue to another requires the use of computational techniques to detect
               and analyse the various ways in which transmission manifests across a catalogue. </p>
            <p>Our case study concerns the transmission of Mary Dorothy George’s voice through time,
               across space, and between mediums, from the 1930s to the late-twentieth century and
               beyond, from the British Museum in London to the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington,
               Connecticut, from printed volumes to networked digital data. It aims to show how
               transmission happens, how it can be found, and how it can be characterised. Detecting
               and characterising transmission is important because cataloguers like George are the
               interlocuters between us and the pasts they described, legacy voices that refuse to
               stay in their historical place, and whose raced, sexed, and classed influence on the
               future should not go unchecked.</p>
            <p>Our contributions are relevant both for historical research into catalogues and
               cataloguing, knowledge organisation and infrastructure, and cultural organisations,
               and for cataloguing practitioners seeking to rationalise/review their catalogues to
               improve user experience, address systemic inequalities in object representation, and
               develop best practice for future work. Furthermore, in broad terms, by contributing
               to the generation of new knowledge about the biases/inequities of catalogues our work
               will enable new and better research into the collections that catalogues
               describe.</p>

            <p>So reads the <q>Summary</q> field of the Lewis Walpole Library’s catalogue entry for
               Thomas Rowlandson’s <hi rend="italic">Bath Races</hi> (see Figure 1), a satirical
               print published in London by Thomas Tegg in 1810. This description was written in
                  2009.<note> We know that this record was first created November 16, 2009 as
                  indicated by the first six digits of the 008 MARC field (YYMMDD). We surmise
                  from circumstances in this case that the summary was probably also written then
                  because the practice at that time was to fully catalogue items going out on loan
                  if no digital catalogue record existed. In this case, this Rowlandson print was
                  requested for loan in 2009 for the exhibition <title rend="quotes">Thomas Rowlandson: Pleasures and
                  Pursuits in Georgian England</title> organized by Patrician Phagan at the Frances Lehman
                  Loeb Art Center, Vassar College.</note> It is simple, clear, and informative, and
               is part of a catalogue record that records a physical description of the object,
               transcribes its inscriptions, and categorises it by genre and topic. The record,
               including its free text description, was created by the Lewis Walpole Library but it
               was not created in a vacuum. Rather - like any catalogue record - it was shaped by
               the circumstances of its production. </p>

            <p>One such circumstance is previous cataloguing. In the process of producing their
               records, cataloguers will typically consult earlier related records when they are
               available. For any cataloguer working on <q>Golden Age</q> satirical prints, prints like
                  <title rend="italic">Bath Races</title>, Mary Dorothy George’s work on the <title
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the
                  Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum</title> (hereafter the <title
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>) has long been an
               essential point of reference. Spanning seven volumes published between 1935 and 1954
               they are a classic of the genre such that once the <title rend="italic">Catalogue of
                  Political and Personal Satires</title> became out of print, demand for the catalogues
               remained and they were republished as microfilm in 1978 by Chadwyck-Healey. More
               recently, lightly edited versions of George’s descriptions have been published on the
               British Museum Collections Online website, which launched in 2009 and contains
               entries for over 11,000 prints described by George in the <title rend="italic">Catalogue
                  of Political and Personal Satires</title>, including <title rend="italic">Bath
                  Races</title>.</p>
            <p>In the case of the Lewis Walpole Library’s entry for <title rend="italic">Bath
                  Races</title>, we know that the corresponding record in <title rend="italic">Catalogue
                  of Political and Personal Satires</title> and its later derivations at British Museum
               Collections Online influenced the content of the record: George’s volume is cited and
               the web version of the object description is quoted.<note> This was added in 2013,
                  when summaries on British Museum Collections Online were gradually and
                  systematically appended to Orbis records for Lewis Walpole Library collections.
               </note> But there is more to the story here than a nod to a respected forbear. In
               their production of a description of <title rend="italic">Bath Races</title>, the
               cataloguers behind the Lewis Walpole description were influenced by the <title
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>, or - to use
               Michael Baxandall’s [<ref target="#baxandall1985">1985</ref>] more active formulations of creative influence - they drew
               on, engaged with, reacted to, differentiated from, remodeled, developed, tackled,
               even subverted George’s description. Thus, where George calls the protagonists
               <q>Cripples and invalids,</q> the Lewis Walpole Library entry calls them <quote rend="inline">Sick and infirm
               patients on crutches and in wheelchairs;</quote> where George has the patients <quote rend="inline">rush[ing]
               down a hill,</quote> the Lewis Walpole Library entry has them <quote rend="inline">rac[ing] down a grassy hill;</quote>
               where George sees <quote rend="inline">Young women cheer[ing] on the competitors,</quote> the Lewis Walpole
               Library entry sees <quote rend="inline">spectators cheer[ing] them along.</quote> By taking the structure of
               George’s description but deviating from its now judgemental tone, those who produced
               the Lewis Walpole Library’s catalogue entry transmitted aspects of George’s
               curatorial <q>voice</q> across time and space, even as they worked to tackle or subvert
               George’s linguistic choices. </p>
            <p>We start, then, from the position that digitised and digital legacy catalogues
               entries like these should, assembled at scale, be recognised as highly valuable
               resources for generating important new knowledge about cataloguing and curatorial
               practices, their histories, and their consequences. At the same time we respond to
               the calls (e.g. <ptr target="#bowker2000"/>) to recover the motivations behind
               classification and its impact on the fabric of knowledge when classification systems
               like legacy catalogues become further uncoupled from their circumstances of
               production, such as - in our case - as a result of digitisation. Further, we observe
               that this uncoupling can produce negative effects when <quote rend="inline">the future that an
               algorithmic system can predict is limited by the historical data used to train that
               system</quote> <ptr target="#agostinho2019"/>. Our concerns with historicizing the catalogue thus
               intersect with important cross-disciplinary and inter-sectoral research on cultural
               institutions and power <ptr target="#duncan1995"/> <ptr target="#perez2003"/>, histories of anglophone
               cataloguing <ptr target="#hill2016"/> <ptr target="#sutherland2017"/>, and metadata <ptr target="#noble2018"/> <ptr target="#thylstrup2019"/>.</p>
            <p>The catalogue records we seek to historicize underpin the audit, curatorial, and
               public access functions of collecting institutions. And they are relied upon by many
               humanities researchers: consider the historian searching archival materials, the
               literary scholar collating a corpus of books, or the art historian identifying and
               analysing relevant prints. In these contexts, we argue that it is important to
               recognise that catalogues are the products of curatorial and cataloguing labour,
               often spanning many decades, and they are shaped by earlier catalogues, by shifting
               curatorial and cataloguing practices and priorities, and by broader social
               circumstances and cultures <ptr target="#johnson1990"/> <ptr target="#kingdon2019"/> <ptr target="#sutherland2021"/> <ptr target="#turner2020"/> <ptr target="#yakel2003"/>. Thus many catalogues comprise subsets of records
               written at different times, by different people, according to different principles
               and goals. This situation is exacerbated in those cases where parts of an earlier
               catalogue are incorporated into a new catalogue. This means that far from a neutral
               record of collection holdings, catalogues are subject to various biases and
               inequities, which impact in problematic and potentially unknown ways on how they are
               used. </p>
            <p>Crucially, the historically specific labours and practices of catalogue production
               are all too easily obscured by the presentation of the catalogue as an always-already
               present unifying entity, and are further obscured when collections are federated for
               access, into datasets, or as machine readable endpoints. Cataloguers, curators and
               researchers will be more or less familiar with the histories of the catalogues that
               they work with. Hence, to some extent, they will be able to account for how specific
               labours and practices resulted in particular emphases and absences, biases and
               inequities. However, such knowledge is often held in the heads of individuals or in
               annotations made to printed catalogues, and is based on interactions with certain
               parts of a catalogue. And whilst principles and best practices exist for documenting
               collections and producing catalogues, there is normally a lack of comprehensive
               documented information about their use in local cataloguing processes. In turn,
               collecting institutions have not found ways to make this information useable for
               publics, a move - as recent work has shown - that can foster anti-racist and
               anti-colonial practice <ptr target="#pringle2020"/>. Similarly, whilst some records of the
               production processes of a catalogue may exist, it is often necessary to work
               backwards from the contents of the current catalogue in order to understand its
               history, and even then the authors of many records will remain unknown and
               unknowable.</p>
            <p>We contend that manifestations of the historically specific circumstances in which
               cataloguing takes place, from which biases/inequities arise in the form of linguistic
               and structural traces, are amenable to computational analysis and are more apparent
               when a catalogue is analysed at scale with support from computational techniques.
               Further we contend that by approaching catalogues as data we can generate knowledge
               about them that supports the writing of their histories, documenting their features
               when reproduced as datasets, and planning revisions that advance equity and social
               justice <ptr target="#cox2021"/> <ptr target="#gebru2020"/> <ptr target="#padilla2019"/>.</p>
            <p>In previous work we demonstrated how linguistic and structural traces in catalogues
               manifest the <q>curatorial voices</q> of cataloguers and curators, and their institutions.
               By combining archival research and corpus linguistic analysis we analysed curatorial
               voice in over 9,000 descriptions of printed images from the <title rend="italic"
                  >Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>, comprising around one million
               words <ptr target="#baker2020"/> <ptr target="#salway2020"/>. We were able to make a
               systematic account of how the catalogue descriptions included or omitted mentions of
               certain aspects of objects, how they varied in the degree to which they described or
               interpreted objects, and how they were shaped by the historically specific
               circumstances in which cataloguing labour took place. We argued that a
               computationally-derived characterisation of these choices could be usefully applied
               to current and future cataloguing practice: e.g. to develop or refine guidelines for
               object description, and to estimate the person time required to edit or enhance
               catalogue data. </p>
            <p>The current paper is concerned with <emph>transmission</emph> from legacy
               catalogues to contemporary catalogues and thus builds on and complements the
               computational analysis of curatorial voice. By <q>transmission</q> we refer both to the
               incorporation of more or less edited catalogue records from a legacy catalogue into a
               contemporary catalogue, and to the stylistic influence of earlier cataloguing
               practice in the production of new records. </p>
            <p>As a case study we take a catalogue comprising 16,669 records for printed images held
               by the Lewis Walpole Library, a research centre for eighteenth-century studies in the
               United States. These records were chosen because they represent a small-scale and
               well delimited collection containing free-text descriptions, and because we expected
               that those descriptions would show signs of transmission from the <title rend="italic"
                  >Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>. The collections these records
               are based on, and that now form the Lewis Walpole Library, began to be assembled by
               Annie Burr and Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis in the early twentieth century. Documentation
               of the printed image collections accelerated in the mid-1950s, first with the
               production of over 12,000 catalogue cards by Annie Burr (officially Curator of Prints
               from 1957) and her voluntary assistant Elizabeth Creamer <ptr target="#annieburr1960"/> <ptr target="#yale1957"/>. After Annie Burr’s death in 1959 cataloguing
               labour was taken <q>vigorously forward</q> by Genevieve Butterfield <ptr target="#lewis1969"/>. In 1980
               the Lewis Walpole Library became part of Yale University, and from 2003 its
               collections catalogue was gradually integrated into Orbis, Yale’s digital library
               catalogue. Throughout this period the Lewis Walpole Library’s collections were added
               to and its catalogues updated, requiring particular curatorial and cataloguing
               expertise to manage and explain the printed image collections, from knowledge of the
               history of printing to methods for describing visual materials. For one subset of the
               printed image collections, satirical prints produced in England between the 1770s and
               1830s, the Lewises and their staff based their cataloguing on Volumes 5 to 11 of the
                  <title rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>, transforming
               the entries these volumes contained, all of which were written by George, into index
               cards that detailed titles, persons, places, events, and keywords <ptr target="#lewis1969"/> <ptr target="#vermeulen2014"/>. These volumes were acquired by the Lewis Walpole Library
               between 1938 and 1970, annotated by the Lewises, and described by Wilmarth as
               <q>invaluable.</q> Subsequent cataloguers took this practice forward, drawing on the <title
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </title>and latterly their
               derivations on British Museum Collections Online.</p>
            <p>This paper is about detecting and characterising the transmission of Mary Dorothy
               George’s voice through time, across space, and between mediums, from the 1930s to the
               late-twentieth century and beyond, from the British Museum in London to the Lewis
               Walpole Library in Farmington, Connecticut, from printed volumes to networked digital
                  data.<note> Note that we do not distinguish between a) transmission from the <title
                     rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </title>to the Lewis
                  Walpole Library catalogue and b) transmission from the later derivations of <title
                     rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </title>on British
                  Museum Collections to the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue. These different types
                  of transmission are difficult to disentangle due to cataloguing practices and
                  infrastructural processes that have over-written prior work and not encouraged
                  versioning of catalogue data.</note> It aims to show how transmission happens, how
               it can be found, and how it can be characterised. The paper does not systematically
               analyse the biases and inequalities transmitted. Rather we examine the fact and the
               nature of transmission, taking transmission as a proxy for catalogue data that
               retains features produced under historically specific circumstances that were
               different - perhaps vastly so - from the circumstances in which that data has
               subsequently been used. We contend that such an investigation into if and how a
               catalogue is shaped by an earlier one is a vital step, because there are many domains
               where cataloguers like Mary Dorothy George are canonical influences, cataloguers who
               are persistent interlocuters between us and the pasts they described, legacy voices
               that refuse to stay in their historical place, and whose raced, sexed, and classed
               influence on the future should not go unchecked.</p>
            <p>The contributions of this paper are novel computational approaches for detecting
               records that contain instances of transmission (Section 2) and for analysing these
               records in order to understand more about how transmission shaped a particular
               catalogue, and for elaborating general models of transmission (Section 3). The
               computational approaches are envisioned as part of an overall approach that frames
               catalogues as data, and that also relies on the expert knowledge of cataloguers and
               historical research in order to generate knowledge that can form the basis of work to
               understand, contextualise, and repair collection catalogues.</p>

            <head>2. Detecting instances of transmission</head>
            <p>How can we systematically identify at scale those records in a digital (or digitised)
               catalogue that are likely to be the products of transmission from earlier catalogues?
               We present two computational approaches, both of which attempt to identify pertinent
               subsets of catalogue records based primarily on the content of certain fields in the
               records, rather than drawing primarily on extant knowledge about the catalogues and
               the collections they describe. The first approach (described in Section 2.1) should
               be quite generally applicable to other catalogues in the way it goes about
               identifying features that may be indicative of transmission. The second approach
               (described in Section 2.2) pertains to catalogues in which records contain relatively
               lengthy free-text descriptions of collection items. We show both here as applied to
               detecting the hypothesised transmission from the <title rend="italic">Catalogue of
                  Political and Personal Satires </title>to the Lewis Walpole Library’s catalogue. The
               outputs from these approaches - i.e. selections of records - are analysed in Section
               3 in order to consider to what extent they are instances of transmission, and to
               explore what we can learn from them about the processes of transmission.</p>

               <head>2.1 Using features from various MARC fields to select sets of records</head>
               <p>Our first approach to systematically identifying candidate records of transmission
                  from <title rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </title>to the
                  Lewis Walpole Library catalogue was to automatically generate overviews of the
                  usage and content of the MARC fields across all the records from the Lewis Walpole
                  Library Catalogue and then to manually scan the overviews for signs that
                  particular fields in some records: </p>
               <list type="unordered"><item>(i) explicitly cite the Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires;</item>
               <item>(ii) contain evidence that the records could at least possibly be based on the <title
                     rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title> in that they
                  relate to objects of the same genre and period as described in the earlier
                  catalogue, i.e. satirical prints from 1771-1832.</item></list>
               <p>For each of the 90 MARC fields used by the Lewis Walpole Library we generated an
                  overview of our dataset that contained: a count of total instances of the field
                  (there may be multiple instances per record); the average <q>word</q> count of the
                  content of each field; a sample of up to 20 instances of the field; and eight
                  frequency ordered ngram lists (1&lt;= n &lt;=8) generated from the content of the
                  field after it was split on subfield tags<note> See overviewsPart1.txt and
                     overviewsPart2.zip in <ptr target="#salway2021"/>.</note>. Figure 2 shows a small
                  part of the overview that was generated for MARC field 600 (Subject Added
                  Entry-Personal Name), with a sample of four entries and the 10 most frequent
                  trigrams. This overview of MARC field 600 shows evidence of point (ii),
                  specifically: persons frequently associated with prints described in the <title
                     rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>; associated date
                  ranges that align with the publication dates (1771 to 1832) for prints George
                  described; and subfields corresponding with the satirical print genre.</p>

               <p>The most frequently occurring MARC field was 500 (General note) with 54,712
                  instances in the 16,669 records. The MARC fields that occurred more than 16,669
                  times (and hence potentially more than once in some records) were 655 (Index Term
                  - Genre/Form), 650 (Subject Added Entry - Topical Term), 035 (System Control
                  Number) and 300 (Physical Description). Field 245 (Title Statement) occurred
                  exactly 16,669 times. The fields that occurred more than 8,000 times were 040
                  (Cataloging Source), 043 (Geographic Area Code), 099 (Local Call Numbers), 600
                  (Subject Added Entry - Personal Name), 700 (Added Entry - Personal Name), 260
                  (Publication, Distribution, etc. (Imprint)), 100 (Main Entry - Personal Name), 079
                  (encoding level), 510 (Citation / references note) and 520 (Summary, etc.). Of the remaining MARC fields, 59 of them occurred less than 1,000 times and - of those -
                  48 occurred less than 100 times. </p>
               <p>We examined the overview for each of the fields guided by points (i) and (ii)
                  above, starting with the statistics and sample entries. If these indicated
                  anything potentially relevant, we scanned the most frequent n-grams. When an
                  n-gram of interest was noted we then searched for it as part of longer n-grams and
                  in the lists for other fields. Once we had narrowed our focus to specific “clues”
                  in several fields we then analysed their contents in more detail. For example,
                  having noted several ways in which British Museum registration numbers and BMSat
                  numbers were written in the MARC fields 500 and 510, we wrote regular expressions
                  to count in how many records these numbers were present. Figure 3 summarises the
                  fields that were of most interest to us and our observations about the potential
                  traces of transmission they contain<note> Separately we also noted that the
                     control field 001 (Control number) occurs 16,669 times - once per record - and
                     this gives us a unique reference for each record. In the Lewis Walpole Library
                     this number reflects the order in which records were added to the catalogue
                     which is potentially useful information, although they may have been edited
                     subsequently. As above, the exact date of creation is also indicated by the
                     first six digits of the 008 MARC field.</note>.</p>

            <head>2.1.1 Selection of records presumed to be written by the Lewis Walpole Library</head>
            <p>In order to investigate the influence of the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Political
                  and Personal Satires</hi>, and in particular Mary Dorothy George’s voice, on later
               cataloguing at the Lewis Walpole Library, for our first selection of records we
               created a corpus of descriptions from the MARC field 520 that - based on evidence
               from other MARC fields in the record - could not have been based directly on the <hi
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</hi>. Specifically we
               aimed to select those Lewis Walpole Library records that describe satirical prints
               that are not in BMSat. Hence we selected all records that met all the following
               criteria: (i) the string ‘Satires (Visual Works)’ appears in the MARC 655 field,
               and/or ‘Caricatures and Cartoons’ appears in the MARC 600 field; (ii) in the MARC 500
               and 510 fields there are no string matches for patterns that characterise the most
               common ways in which BMSat and British Museum registration numbers are written; (iii)
               the string ‘not in the catalogue of prints and drawings’ appears in the MARC 500
               field (case insensitive matching); (iv) there are no matches for the string ' — british museum online catalogue' in the MARC 520 field (case insensitive matching);
               and, (v) there is free text in the MARC 520 field but that free text is not enclosed
               in quotation marks. </p>
            <p>This gave 543 records. Based on subject knowledge and curatorial expertise we judged
               that 543 is reasonable as the number of satirical prints held by the Lewis Walpole
               Library that have narrative descriptions and no equivalent in the British Museum.
               Further, we checked if any of the 543 records indicated reuse of a description in a
               catalogue other than the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal
                  Satires </hi>or of a dealer description (e.g. in an auction catalogue). Finally,
               we checked if any of the 543 records do in fact relate to printed images held by the
               British Museum, but escaped our tests, therefore making its MARC 520 field entry a
               potentially unattributed adaptation from the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Political
                  and Personal Satires </hi>or British Museum Collections Online. These checks
               revealed no issues, and so we subsequently made a corpus of descriptions that we are
               confident were written by staff at the Lewis Walpole Library without reference to the
                  <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires; </hi>see Section
               3.2 for analysis of this corpus.<note> The 543 selected records are listed in
                  543Records_forCorpusOfWrittenByLWL.xlsx <ptr target="#salway2021"/>; they were
                  selected by filtering a larger set of records according to features given in

                  than necessary and led to some ‘valid’ records being excluded, but we were
                  prioritising the precision of the results over recall. </note>

            <head>2.1.2 Selection of records that refer to different impressions of the same
               print</head>
            <p>The second selection of records that we made was based on the observation that
               different Lewis Walpole Library records mentioned the same BMSat number in either the
               MARC 500 or 510 fields. This indicates a phenomenon particular to catalogues of
               collections of printed images, whereby institutions hold multiple unique impressions,
               versions, states, or copies of the same printed image.<note> During the <q>Golden Age</q>
                  of British satirical prints, print reproduction used craft-like technologies that
                  made exact reproduction unachievable: for example, each copper plate engraving or
                  etching was inked by hand, lines incised on copper plates lost definition each
                  time they we used in printing, and colouring was completed by outworkers by hand.
                  As a result, whilst multiple impressions from the same plate often constituted
                  part of the same print run and would have contained the same narrative content,
                  the impressions often sufficiently differ so as to require divergent description.
                  For the history of <q>Golden Age</q> British satirical prints and their production see
                  Baker [<ref target="#baker2017">2017</ref>], Donald [<ref target="#donald1996">1996</ref>] and Gatrell [<ref target="#gatrell2006">2006</ref>]. For the production of printed
                  images in long-eighteenth century Europe, see Stijnman [<ref target="#stijnman2012">2012</ref>] and Griffiths
                  [<ref target="#griffiths2016">2016</ref>].</note> Because these multiple impressions, versions, states, or copies of
               the <q>same</q> printed images may arrive at collecting institutions at different times,
               be catalogued by different individuals working in different institutional contexts,
               and are subject to different professional and scholarly influences, this raises the
               possibility that variation between catalogue records for the <q>same</q> image could
               support the investigation of transmission from BMSat to the Lewis Walpole Library
               catalogue by contrasting those records. For example, we might consider adjustments
               made to legacy descriptions in order to account for slight differences between
               collection objects, observe differing uses of BMSat as a source, or think through the
               possible rationale for and historical specificity of widely divergent
               descriptions.</p>
            <p>We made a dataset that grouped descriptions from each set of Lewis Walpole Library
               records that refer to the same BMSat number.<note>
                  withBMSatNumbers_multipleRecords.xlsx <ptr target="#salway2021"/>.</note> There are
               three groups with six Lewis Walpole Library records; four groups with five records;
               11 groups with four records; 59 groups with three records; and 441 groups with two
               records. For an example, see Figure 4 which shows the contents of the MARC 520 field
               in four different Lewis Walpole Library records that all appear to refer to different
               impressions and copies of the same satirical print (BMSat 4050).<note> There is a
                  fifth Lewis Walpole Library record referring to this print but its description
                  field is empty. BMSat records are accessible at <ref

                     >https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection</ref>.</note> Note that the
               variations between the four descriptions take a variety of forms: a reference to a
               physical characteristic that differentiates the first description from the second;
               the common string <quote rend="inline">On the table beside him are two;</quote> their similar lengths and points
               of emphasis. See Section 3.1 for the analysis of the selection of 1,123 records.</p>

            <head>2.2 Using a text distance metric to find pairs of related descriptions in two
               catalogues</head>
            <p>Our second approach to systematically identifying candidate records of transmission
               from the <title rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </title>to the
               Lewis Walpole Library catalogue addresses cases where the writing of descriptions in
               records has involved copying (parts of) descriptions from earlier catalogues with
               some degree of subsequent editing and/or addition of new text, but there is
               insufficient metadata to match up pairs of records from the two catalogues. To find
               these records we made pairwise comparisons of all the descriptions from one catalogue
               with all descriptions from the other using a text distance metric, and ranked the
               pairs of descriptions according to the metric. From this the pairs ranked as most
               similar (referred to as those with the <q>lowest text distance</q>) could be manually
               inspected as candidate examples of transmission.<note> Such an approach is
                  appropriate to a case like ours where descriptions for one catalogue (BMSat) are
                  not associated with catalogue or registration numbers; and, as it happens we
                  cannot be sure that all LWL records refer to BMSat catalogue/registration numbers
                  when they should.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are many different text distance metrics belonging to several families. We
               conducted trials to determine which is the most effective metric for our purposes,
               i.e. which most consistently ranks pairs of descriptions that are examples of
               transmission more highly than other pairs. We also considered how resource intensive
               the metrics are.<note> Whilst the resource intensivity of our work is not equivalent
                  to that of, say, training a large language model, we contend that all DH work
                  should be mindful of its resource intensivity. This is particularly true for any
                  DH work that has justice-oriented goals, because without attending to how research
                  takes place, that research can cause unintended harms. For how we frame our
                  computational work see Sussex Humanities Lab Carbon Use and Environmental Impact
                  Working Group et al [<ref target="#workinggroup2020">2020</ref>]. The first author in particular would like to recognise
                  Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Max Liboiron, Angelina McMillan-Major and
                  Shmargaret Shmitchell for inspiring their ongoing (often unsuccessful) attempts to
                  ground their DH research methods in practices that reduce environmental and
                  ecological harms without amplifying colonial harms, in an environmentalism that is
                  intersectional <ptr target="#bender2021"/> <ptr target="#liboiron2021"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, we hand-picked a set of fifteen pairs of descriptions that exhibited varying
               degrees of copying, editing, and addition, including pairs of descriptions that
               related to different collection items with similar content, and dissimilar pairs. We
               then generated results (in most cases text distance metrics) for each pair using
               sixteen of the functions that are implemented in the Python <emph
                  >textdistance</emph> package,<note>
                  <ref target="https://pypi.org/project/textdistance/"
                     >https://pypi.org/project/textdistance/</ref>
               </note> with several from each of four families of function.<note> The file
                  15pairs_16text-distance-metrics.txt <ptr target="#salway2021"/> shows the results from
                  the sixteen functions for fifteen pairs of BMSat-LWL descriptions which were
                  chosen to reflect a range of similarity/transmission.</note> Broadly speaking we
               observed the following. </p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Edit-based metrics</hi> (Hamming and Levenshtein): these metrics count how many
               character-level changes would be needed to change one string into another, so the
               higher the value of the metric the greater the difference between the two strings,
               i.e. values closer to zero would be suggestive of transmission. In most cases these
               metrics are not suitable for our purposes because the editing of descriptions often
               entails inserting or deleting words that shift the positions of many other
               characters, causing the edit distance to increase greatly even if the strings share
               much in common. For example, see Figure 5 for a pair of descriptions from the Lewis
               Walpole Library and BMSat respectively, which gave distances of 408 (Hamming) and 133
               (Levenshtein) even though it would appear that the Lewis Walpole description is very
               much based on the one in BMSat.<note> This pair of examples and the other pairs
                  presented subsequently come from the previously mentioned results file.</note> It
               seems that these metrics would only be effective in cases where very few edits were
               made or edits were direct replacements of single characters, e.g. if single quotation
               marks were replaced with double quotation marks throughout a description.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">Token-based metrics </hi>(Jaccard, Tversky, Tanimoto and cosine): these metrics treat the
               two strings as ‘bags of words’ and measure how many words they have in common - that
               is, they are not concerned with the order or sequences of words. The Tanimoto
               function gives a negative value, where the lower the value the greater the distance
               between the strings. The other three functions tested give values from 0 (no words in
               common) to 1 (the counts of words in the strings are identical). We observed that all
               four functions tended to give results that were proportional to one another, and they
               were mostly effective at separating cases of transmission (high similarity) from
               non-transmission (low similarity). However, they were susceptible to cases in which
               pairs of descriptions shared much vocabulary whilst not being examples of
               transmission: this happens when descriptions of different impressions of the same
               printed image are written independently but refer to many of the same things in the
               printed image, or when two descriptions relate to two different printed images that
               depict many similar kinds of things. For the example in Figure 6, which shows
               descriptions of two different impressions of the same printed image which appear to
               us not to be based on one another, the Jaccard, Tversky and cosine functions all
               returned scores greater than 0.8, and the Tanimoto function returned -0.31; that is,
               for the example in Figure 3, token-based metrics detect - erroneously - a case of
               transmission.</p>

            <p><hi rend="bold">Sequence-based functions</hi> (Ratcliff Obershelp (RO), Longest Common Substring (LCS)):
               the LCS function simply returns the longest substring that the two strings share in
                  common<note> Related to this are the prefix and postfix functions which return the
                  substrings that the two given strings share at the beginning and at the
                  end.</note>. For the pair of descriptions in Figure 6 this is <q>broken mirror</q> which
               quickly suggests that the descriptions were written independently, whereas a long
               substring could indicate copying. We could count the number of characters in the
               longest common substring in order to rank pairs of descriptions as a percentage of
               the length of the description. However, it would give a misleading low score in cases
               where a copied description has been lightly edited in several places throughout. The
               RO function accounts for multiple common substrings, and returns a value between 0-1
               which gets closer to 1 as the two strings share more and longer sequences of words.
               Unlike the token-based metrics, it seems to be effective at distinguishing pairs of
               descriptions that are partial copies from pairs that just happen to share a lot of
               common vocabulary: for the pair in Figure 6, RO gave a score of 0.37, and for the pair in Figure 5 it gave 0.84; that is, RO detects transmission in Figure 5 but not in Figure 6. The only problem we noted with RO was that, like all the other functions we
               considered, it is vulnerable to pairs of short descriptions that share multiple
               multiword technical and indexing terms, whilst not being examples of transmission. </p>
            <p><hi rend="bold">Normalised compression distance</hi> (bwtrle_ncd, sqrt_ncd, bz2_ncd, lzma_ncd, zlib_ncd):
               in principle the application of a text compression algorithm to two strings serves to
               amplify their similarities or differences; the five functions we tried correspond to
               five different compression algorithms. However, we struggled to understand how these
               functions work and how to interpret their results. For example in a preliminary trial
               they gave the following values for pair of identical descriptions when, intuitively
               we might have expected either 0 or 1: bwtrle_ncd (0.67), sqrt_ncd (0.41), bz2_ncd
               (0.23), lzma_ncd (0.02), and zlib_ncd (0.03). This discouraged us from exploring them
               further, but this is not to say that they do not warrant further consideration for
               the task of detecting transmission.</p>
            <p>An optimal approach might combine several text distance functions in order to detect
               the broadest possible range of copying/editing/addition, e.g. direct complete
               copying, with minor formatting or other changes; incorporation of (part of) one
               description into another; and, paraphrasing of another description. However it would
               require much more research (beyond the scope of this paper) to understand how to
               effectively combine the functions and optimise their use, so we proceeded using just
               one.</p>
            <p>As noted, the Ratcliff Obershelp (RO) function looked to be the most suitable for our
               purposes, however we realised that it would be prohibitively resource intensive for
               the task at hand. We estimated that it would take up to two years to run a pairwise
               comparison of 4,545 LWL x 9,330 BMSat descriptions, using a relatively high-powered
               workstation and without exploiting parallelisation. Usefully in the standard Python
               library the Sequence Matcher class includes an implementation of a text distance
               function which is considered to be similar to RO. With a further trial we observed
               that this function produces results that are similar to or better than RO, i.e. it
               makes similar, and sometimes sharper, distinctions between transmission and not
                  transmission.<note> Results from our trial comparing Ratcliff Obershelp with the
                  Sequence Matcher functions are given in
                  RatcliffObershelp_sequenceMatcher_comparison.txt <ptr target="#salway2021"/>.</note>
               Importantly this implementation executes significantly more quickly than RO -
               according to its documentation,<note>
                  <ref
                     target="https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html#difflib.SequenceMatcher"
                     >https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html#difflib.SequenceMatcher</ref>
               </note> it executes in linear time in the best case and in quadratic time at worst;
               this compares with cubic time in the worst case for RO. Furthermore, the function can
               very quickly calculate a highest-possible value (<q>sequenceMatcher.realquickratio</q>),
               allowing for many pairs to be discounted before a more expensive and accurate
               calculation is made (<q>sequenceMatcher.ratio</q>).</p>
            <p>For the pairwise comparison of 4,545 Lewis Walpole Library descriptions with 9,330
               BMSat descriptions we first pre-processed the Lewis Walpole Library descriptions to
               mirror how the BMSat descriptions had been prepared. This involved some text clean-up
               and substituting bracketed and quoted text with the strings <q>BRACKETED</q> and
               <q>TRANSCRIBED.</q><note> We refer the reader to the earlier paper <ptr target="#salway2020"/> for details of the pre-processing of BMSat. Here and in LWL 543 transcribed
                  text and bracketed text were substituted with the strings <q>TRANSCRIBED</q> and
                  <q>BRACKETED,</q> so that this text - which is not original to the curator/cataloguer’s
                  description - is ignored in the analysis.</note> Then we executed a script which
               for each LWL-BMSat pair: (i) computed sequenceMatcher.realquickratio and skipped to
               the next pair if this was &lt; 0.9; then, (ii) computed sequenceMatcher.ratio<note>
                  Two parameters were set: autoJunk = True (default value); and, isJunk = None. Note
                  the sequenceMatcher.ratio function is not commutative and we only generated
                  results with the LWL descriptions passed as the first text string, and the BMSat
                  descriptions passed as the second.</note> and filtered results to remove pairs for
               which SM.ratio &lt; 0.5 which, from inspection of trial results, we are confident is
               a suitable threshold to remove only pairs that are not examples of transmission. The
               remaining 1,649 pairs were written to a file with their similarity scores<note>
                  pairwiseComparisonResults.tsv <ptr target="#salway2021"/>.</note> for subsequent
               analysis (see Section 3.1). The script took about 5 hours to execute.</p>

            <head>3. Analysing transmission</head>
            <p>The three selections of records made in Section 2 were analysed in order to consider
               to what extent they contain instances of transmission, and to explore what we can
               learn from them about the processes of transmission. Here we describe methods for
               characterising transmission and elaborate on different kinds of transmission from
               BMSat to records at the Lewis Walpole Library. It is important to note that this
               analysis is situated in our shared knowledge of and familiarity with the catalogues
               at hand.<note> For example, even though the methods used in Section 2.2 do not
                  account for directionality of influence, our analysis of the pairs selected in
                  Section 2.2 assumes that since the mid-twentieth century cataloguing of satirical
                  prints at the Lewis Walpole Library was a task potentially influenced by - drawing
                  on, engaging with, reacting to, etc - cataloguing that took place at the British
                  Museum in the early- to mid-twentieth century, and not vice versa.</note> As such
               then, our case study and our analysis of it provides a way into developing a
               conceptual framework for thinking about the different ways in which catalogues are
               shaped and constructed over time. But other case studies of transmission between
               catalogues, that - we contend - could follow our approaches to select candidate
               records and analyse those selections, will provide different contributions to that
               framework.</p>

            <head>3.1 Computer-assisted close reading</head>
            <p>In this sub-section we focus on the close reading of computationally selected groups
               of descriptions, a method akin to what Martin Paul Eve calls <title rend="italic">Close
                  Reading with Computers</title> [<ref target="#eve2019">2019</ref>]. The selection reported in Section 2.1.2
               consists of 518 instances in which the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue contained
               multiple records for different impressions of the <q>same</q> printed image (1,141 records
               in total). From this selection we focused on the MARC 520 <q>Summary</q> Fields, used by
               the Lewis Walpole Library for object descriptions. In the majority of instances the
               linked records contained either identical descriptions or a combination of an empty
               field and a description. In the remaining instances, we observed from the MARC 520
               <q>Summary</q> Field signs of transmission that fell broadly into one of three
               categories:</p> 
            <list type="unordered">
               <item>1. Descriptions which are copies or near copies of descriptions of different
                  impressions of the <q>same</q> printed image in other catalogues, either a) with the
                  copied text quoted and with an accompanying citation in the MARC 520 Field (most
                  of which appear to come from British Museum Collections Online) or b) with the
                  text unquoted and with an accompanying citation in the MARC 500 or 510 Fields. For
                  example, in the case of <title rend="italic">A Nincompoop, or hen peck'd husband
                  </title>(1807) there are two Lewis Walpole Library descriptions. In one of these Lewis Walpole Library descriptions the text is the same the British Museum Online description but with three changes: first, the opening line is edited from ‘A small ugly man trots (l. to r.)’ to ‘A small ugly man trots (walking left to right)’; second the British Museum Online description<note>
                     BMSat 10909 </note> is placed within double quotation marks; and third, ‘ — British Museum catalogue’ is inserted after the quotation marks.<note> LWL Orbis
                        Record 8638085 </note>  In the second Lewis Walpole Library description of <title rend="italic">A Nincompoop</title> the British Museum Online description is again placed within double quotation marks, but on this occasion it is followed by the wording ‘British Museum online catalogue, description of an earlier state’.<note> LWL Orbis Record 8638683</note>
               </item>
               <item>2. Descriptions which take narrative or linguistic elements from descriptions of
                  different impressions of the <q>same</q> printed image in other catalogues, usually
                  British Museum Collections Online or the <title rend="italic">Catalogue of Political
                     and Personal Satires</title>, but contain significant differences or adaptations.
                  For example, we find Lewis Walpole Library descriptions that are summaries of
                  corresponding descriptions in another catalogue. This is the case with <title
                     rend="italic">A fashionable suit!</title> (1800), for which the Lewis Walpole
                  Library catalogue description retains the narrative structure of the British
                  Museum Collections Online description but in truncated form, as observed in Figure 7.</item>

                  elements from descriptions of different impressions of the <q>same</q> printed image in
                  other catalogues, and so are believed to be Lewis Walpole Library originals. These
                  are few in number, and include the description of <title rend="italic">Bath Races

            <p>The selection made in Section 2.1.2 enabled us to observe the presence of
               transmission from BMSat to the Lewis Walpole Library, and to begin to understand the
               variability of that transmission. However the analysis is insufficient to form the
               basis of a conceptual framework for thinking about the different ways in which
               catalogues are shaped and constructed over time. The selection of LWL-BMSat 1649
               pairs ranked by a text distance metric (described in Section 2.2) provided then a
               usefully different and complimentary set of descriptions with which to develop that
                  framework.<note> One in five of the LWL records in the selection contain no
                  mention of BMSat, and so would have evaded methods described in Part 2.1</note>
            </p>
            <p>In an echo of the Section 2.1.2 selection, the majority of pairs ranked in Section
               2.2 as candidate examples of transmission by Sequence Matcher are very close matches:
               roughly 3 in 4 pairs have a SM.ratio greater than 0.9, and these pairs differ only by
               single word replacements (e.g. “pig which” to “pig who”), the removal of a series
               number, or the expansion of an acronym. The pairs with a lower SM.ratio score exhibit
               different phenomena. One pair (SM.ratio=0.5) shows transmission from BMSat to Lewis
               Walpole Library that includes removing an opening line (“Heading to printed verses
               *BRACKETED*”) in favour of placing that information in a different MARC field, and a
               conclusion that adds additional descriptive detail (“They raise glasses whose stems
               have been broken”).<note> LWL Orbis Record 8782502; BMSat 10958. </note> A second
               pair (SM.ratio=0.58) indicates direct transmission from BMSat to Lewis Walpole
               Library, but with a new line inserted in the middle of the description that
               emphasises an aspect of the print omitted from the BMSat description.<note> LWL Orbis
                  Record 7949892; BMSat 8408.</note> We also find in this selection the description
               of a Rowlandson border fragment published in 1799 that is not in the <hi
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </hi>but is written in
               the style so closely resembling descriptions in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of
                  Political and Personal Satires</hi> that it is paired (SM.ratio=0.5) with a
               description for a different print. This pair is presented in Figure 8.</p>

            <p>But these are edge cases. As we read across all the selected pairs, more regular
               patterns of transmission start to emerge. Lewis Walpole Library entries expand on
               abbreviations in BMSat, for example, <q>BMSat 4922</q> becomes <q>British Museum satire no.
                  4922.</q><note> LWL Orbis Record 8362224</note> Lewis Walpole Library entries
               systematically revise quirks of BMSat descriptions: for example, they remove brackets
               from spatial vocabulary and quotation marks from eighteenth-century
                  terminology.<note> LWL Orbis Record 7951545; BMSat 7467.</note> And in Lewis
               Walpole Library descriptions leading and trailing details from BMSat descriptions are
               removed and distributed to other parts of the catalogue entry. These patterns of
               revision are not always consistent. For example, the Lewis Walpole Library
               description for <title rend="italic">The rake's progress at the University</title> (1806)
               is a lossy transmission in that it omits from the description the leading text <q>See
               BMSat 10639,</q> a reference to another print in the <title rend="italic">Catalogue of
                  Political and Personal Satires</title>, without finding it a place elsewhere in the
                  record.<note> LWL Orbis Record 8545613; BMSat 10641.</note> More often, however,
               these details are retained, such as in the Lewis Walpole Library entry for
               Rowlandson’s 1807 print <title rend="italic">Mrs. Showwell</title> which removes from the
               close of the description <q>26 February 1807. Hand-coloured etching.</q>, and places those
               details appropriate to the object at hand (it is not coloured) in the MARC 260
               (Publication, Distribution, etc. (Imprint)) and 300 (Physical Description) Fields
                  respectively.<note> LWL Orbis Record 8626750; BMSat 10786.</note> Here
               transmission intersects with temporally specific cataloguing infrastructures.
               Printing methods, dates of production, and references to other prints were details
               that it made sense for Mary Dorothy George to include in the main body of her object
               descriptions: in a printed catalogue, the consistent placement of information on the
               page and relative to other details was a proxy for record structure. When these
               records were moved to British Museum Collections Online, they were parsed in largely
               unadapted form so as to create unmarked sub-fields in a flexible collection database
               designed for a large and varied museum collection <ptr target="#griffiths2010"/>. But when parsed
               to fit first a card catalogue system devised by the Lewis’s and later a digital
               catalogue built on a granular bibliographic standard (MARC 21) capable of handling
               hundreds of unique fields, it appears that it made greater sense to move these
               details to dedicated fields.<note> The British Museum migrated entries from the <title
                     rend="italic">Catalogue and Political and Personal Satires </title>to, first,
                  fields used in their internal database and, later, fields used in their British
                  Museum Collections Online <ptr target="#griffiths2010"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If this reading provides insight into how cataloguing infrastructures shaped the
               transmission of catalogue data over time, the selection made with a text distance
               metric in Section 2.2 also underscores the role of objects in shaping transmission:
               in short, on numerous occasions Lewis Walpole Library catalogue entries diverge from
               BMSat equivalents so as to better represent the object at hand. For example, in the
               Lewis Walpole Library catalogue entry for <title rend="italic">Mrs. Showwell </title>the
               opening line - <quote rend="inline">Below the title: ‘The Woman who shews General Guise collection of
               Pictures at Oxford’</quote> - is removed as the Lewis Walpole Library version is trimmed and
               thus contains no title. In the Lewis Walpole Library description of a Peter Pinder
               print from 1787, the opening to the corresponding BMSat entry - <quote rend="inline">Proof without
               letters</quote> - is removed as the Lewis Walpole Library object is not a proof.<note> LWL
                  Orbis Record 7780448; BMSat 7188.</note> And in the Lewis Walpole Library
               catalogue record for a 1828 print depicting chess players, the MARC 520 field repeats
               the description found in BMSat for a near identical print from circa 1788, but
               removes the opening line - <quote rend="inline">Title perhaps cut off</quote> - because the Lewis Walpole
               Library object contains the full print and shows that no title was ever
                  present.<note> LWL Orbis Record 9760098; BMSat 7400.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The text distance selection thus enabled us to build on model of transmission
               discussed above and to identify three categories of divergent transmission:</p>
            <list type="ordered">
               <item>procedural divergence, in which BMSat records were adapted to align with
                  cataloguing practices at and/or infrastructural choices made by the Lewis Walpole
                  Library;</item>
               <item>divergence due to variant objects, in which BMSat records were adapted to align
                  with material characteristics of objects held by the Lewis Walpole Library;</item>
               <item>revisions to descriptions, whether in the form of truncated prose, additional
                  detail, or word switches, the motivations for which are difficult to ascertain
                  from the records alone.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Taken together, close reading suggests that many Lewis Walpole Library records
               projected Mary Dorothy George into the future, lightly editing her on the way, but
               doing little to arrest her historically specific interlocution between us and the
               catalogued past. Where George was revised for reasons other than cataloguing
               procedure or variant objects, we glimpse the aspects of her descriptions that most
               troubled subsequent cataloguers. Some of these revisions suggest an attentiveness to
               the identities that George saw as normative. For example, the Lewis Walpole Library
               entry for <title rend="italic">A West India sportsman </title>adapts the opening <quote rend="inline">The
               sportsman sits in a chair..</quote> to <quote rend="inline">The English sportsman sits in a chair..,</quote> in
               recognition of the fact that in BMSat men are Englishmen unless described
                  otherwise.<note> LWL Orbis Record 11990160; BMSat 10804.</note> And whilst the
               retention of a racial epithet in the Lewis Walpole Library entry for <title
                  rend="italic">A West India sportsman </title>reminds us that such revisions were
               themselves historical acts, and whilst as Vermeulen and Carby [<ref target="#carby2014">2014</ref>] note in the
               Lewis Walpole Library catalogue <quote rend="inline">[t]here is no subject <q>White;</q> white people are,
               quite literally, the unmarked bodies of the archive,</quote> other revisions suggest some
               recognition of George’s historically specific choice of language. For example, the
               Lewis Walpole Library entry for Woodward and Tegg’s 1807 <title rend="italic">A riddle
                  expounded, or, The dignity of a parsons horse </title>- an interaction between a
               parson and <quote rend="inline">a jovial countryman</quote> that sends up monarchical power - shows transmission
               intersecting with changing curatorial sensibilities (see Figure 9). This print
               features a heavily caricatured parson, a hybrid of two long-eighteenth century
               stereotypes: the money-grubbing tithe pig and the drunken clergyman popularised by
               the ballad <title rend="quotes">The Vicar and Moses</title> <ptr target="#virgin1989"/>. In turn, George described the parson
               as <quote rend="inline">drink-blotched and prosperous-looking,</quote><note> BMSat 10904.</note> language
               revised by a Lewis Walpole Library cataloguer(s) to <quote rend="inline">red-faced and freckled and
               prosperous looking, with a round belly.</quote><note> LWL Orbis Record 8712571.</note> This
               revision performs three functions: first, it delegitimises pejorative associations of
               facial markings with alcoholism; second, by noting the <q>round belly,</q> the revision
               provides an example of what <soCalled>prosperous looking</soCalled> might look like to long-eighteenth
               century British satirical audiences; and third, it expands - if only a little - the
               assumed readers of the description from a narrow group of experts in long-eighteenth
               century British history to a more general public. Taken together with other revisions
               made to George’s original - a correction to the mounting point of a railing, the
               creation of greater motion in spatial terminology, the assertion that to have a
               sermon in one’s pocket is to carry it - the Lewis Walpole Library description of <title
                  rend="italic">A riddle expounded</title> transmits George for the present: for
               search, for diverse audiences, and for a context in which collecting institutions
               recognise and address their roles in maintaining structural inequalities.</p>

            </figure>
           
            <p>The case of <title rend="italic">A riddle expounded</title> is also a validation of our
               methods. From George’s 80 word description of the print, thirteen words are edited or
               replaced by the Lewis Walpole Library and sixteen words are added. These edits are
               not clustered together, they change every line and most clauses, such that a 58
               character string - to <quote rend="inline">a tree, to address a fat elderly parson on horseback (r</quote> - is
               the longest shared by both the BMSat and Lewis Walpole Library descriptions. By using
               a suitable text distance metric we were able to surface transmission like this, to
               read it, and to report on it. In so doing we expanded our knowledge of BMSat to Lewis
               Walpole Library transmission beyond MARC fields that record transmission, revisions
               between descriptions of different impressions of the <q>same</q> printed image, and
               descriptions truncated by the omission of opening or closing details. This
               understanding of transmission was complemented by analysis, reported in the next
               sub-section, of those descriptions presumed to be written by the Lewis Walpole
               Library.</p>

            <head>3.2 Corpus linguistic analysis</head>
            <p>In this sub-section our analysis switches from the close reading of individual
               descriptions to a corpus-level comparison of descriptions from the two catalogues at
               hand. We previously conducted a corpus linguistic analysis of the BMSat corpus which
               identified a characteristic curatorial voice in its descriptions, in terms of what
               things were typically referred to or ignored in descriptions, and in terms of the
               degree of description/interpretation/evaluation <ptr target="#salway2020"/>. In Section
               2.1.2 of the current paper we described the creation of a set of 543 Lewis Walpole
               Library descriptions which we believe were not based directly on any BMSat
               descriptions. If this set of Lewis Walpole Library descriptions exhibits similar
               characteristics to the BMSat corpus then that would support the idea of transmission
               of style, although this alone would not be sufficient evidence to say that the Lewis
               Walpole Library style was influenced by George’s style rather than their both being
               influenced by something else.</p>
            <p>We applied the method from Salway and Baker [<ref target="#salway2020">2020</ref>] to analyse the 543 Lewis Walpole
               Library descriptions (hereafter <q>LWL 543</q>). Here we show and discuss the results
               alongside the earlier results for the BMSat corpus;<note> We refer the reader to the
                  earlier paper <ptr target="#salway2020"/> for details of motivation, methodology,
                  results and discussion of curatorial voice.</note> given that the LWL 543 comprise
               only about 33,000 words (compared with around one million for BMSat) we recognise
               that any conclusions drawn from the analysis can only be tentative. </p>
            <p>Figure 10 shows the 100 most frequent words in BMSat alongside the 100 most frequent in
               LWL 543 (cf. Table 2 in Salway and Baker [<ref target="#salway2020">2020</ref>]). Words that occur in both top
               100’s are shown in bold, whilst the remaining words are underlined and their rank
               position in the other corpus is given in brackets<note> Capitalised words are counted
                  separately from their non-capitalised versions, this proved to be fruitful in the
                  previous analysis.</note>. There are seventy words in the top 100’s for both
               corpora, and many of these appear in similarly ranked positions. Furthermore, many of
               the thirty remaining words in each list occur in rank position 101-200 in the other
               list, i.e. sixteen of the BMSat top 100 are in positions 101-200 in LWL 543, and
               nineteen of the LWL 543 top 100 are ranked 101-200 in BMSat.<note> Some cases of
                  bigger differences may be due to varying content in the prints being described,
                  e.g. ‘Lord’, ‘Fox’ and ‘John’ being in the BMSat top 100.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst some words would be expected to feature high in the frequency list for most
               English-language corpora, e.g. ‘the’, ‘a’, ‘of’ etc., many words that are prominent
               in both lists are particular to the task of describing visual objects, and satirical
               prints specifically, e.g. ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘wearing’, ‘hat’, ‘dressed’, ‘background’.
               Thus the results shown in Figure 10 suggest that the LWL catalogue contains
               descriptions that, whilst not based directly on specific descriptions from BMSat,
               share a style or curatorial voice. </p>

            <p>The next main step in the analysis of BMSat descriptions was to group the 300 most
               frequent words according to the kind of information they provide, see Figure 3 in
               Salway and Baker [<ref target="#baker2020">2020</ref>]. Figure 11 in the current paper uses the same categories to
               group the top 100 words in LWL 543<note> Given the much smaller corpus it did not
                  seem meaningful to go beyond the top 100.</note>. The fact that these words fit
               well in the same categories suggests that the LWL descriptions are providing similar
               informational content as the BMSat descriptions. For example, 10 of the 18 nouns
               listed in Figure 11 appear in the corresponding list for BMSat: the remaining 8 (chair,
               wig, door, dog, women, room, floor, stick) are similar in referring to people and
               everyday things in quite generic ways. </p>

            <p>Turning from informational content to consider the extent to which BMSat descriptions
               interpret/evaluate visual content, rather than describe it, Salway and Baker [<ref target="#salway2020">2020</ref>]
               analysed the 100 most frequent words ending in -ly. We noted many examples of words
               that were likely used to interpret something about somebody’s actions in terms of
               their mental state, e.g. ‘angrily’, ‘delightedly’, ‘derisively’, ‘contemptuously’,
               such as to give a sense of a story playing out (see Table 6 in Salway and Baker
               [<ref target="#salway2020">2020</ref>]). We also noted words used to make an evaluative judgement such as about
               somebody’s appearance, e.g. ‘fashionably’ and ‘grotesquely’. For comparison, a list
               of -ly words occurring three or more times in the LWL 543 descriptions is given in
               Figure 12. Though the small number of examples means we cannot draw firm conclusions,
               it does seem that whilst the LWL 543 descriptions show signs of evaluating
               appearances (see the bolded words), there is only one example of a word that could be
               used to interpret an action such as to give a sense of a story playing out, i.e.
               ‘intently’. Whether this is due to a different curatorial style, or simply the
               contents of the prints being described, would require a different line of
               investigation.</p>

            <p>By basing our comparison on existing results for one corpus there is perhaps a danger
               of us observing similarities and missing differences. To actively seek differences,
               we conducted a keyness analysis to identify words that occur relatively more often in
               one corpus than the other, with statistical significance. Figures 13 and 14 show the
               keywords in BMSat and LWL 543 respectively<note> The keyness analysis used ‘Ratio of
                  relative frequencies’ for effect size, and <q>Log-likelihood</q> for statistical
                  significance. The selected keywords had an effect size &gt;=2, and statistical
                  significance p &lt; 0.05. A frequency threshold was also applied so the BMSat
                  results show only words occurring 500 or more times in BMSat, and the LWL results
                  show words occurring 50 or more times in LWL. We acknowledge that these are all
                  rather arbitrary choices and could be relaxed to show more keywords and hence
                  potentially more difference.</note>. </p>
            <p>Various differences stand out in the keyword lists. First, proper names (Mrs,
               Wellington, Fox, Napoleon, Duke, John) are keywords in BMSat relative to LWL 543,
               whilst unnamed people (woman, man) and everyday scenes (dog, chair, table, wall) are
               keywords in LWL 543 relative to BMSat. This may be explained by the LWL 543 selection
               containing a higher proportion of records for social satires than BMSat, wherein
               descriptions of political satires - featuring men like Charles James Fox, Napoleon
               Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington - account for roughly three-fifths of all
               descriptions. Second, when compared with BMSat, the LWL 543 descriptions do not
               contain references such as ‘See BMSat’ ‘BM No’. This supports that observation in
               Section 3.1 that Lewis Walpole Library records either expand on these abbreviations
               or move such abbreviations to dedicated data fields.<note> Note that given the
                  importance of the <title rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires
                  </title>even records not based on it often still refer to it.</note> The BMSat list
               also contains words that we might consider to be part of a general <q>language of
               description</q> and it might seem surprising that these are not used so much in the LWL
               543. However, the presence of some may be due to the content of prints, i.e. more
               prints depicting speech (answers, saying and says), and another due to spelling
               variation (centre). The remaining BMSat keywords (inscribed, cocked, design, round,
               extreme, profile, Behind, He, which, wears) may point to minor stylistic differences
               or may simply be due to the small amount of text in the LWL 543 descriptions. </p>

            <p>In summary, for all the points of comparison relating to informational content - i.e.
               what is described, and what vocabulary is used - the results suggest that overall the
               BMSat and LWL 543 descriptions are very similar. The comparison in terms of degree of
               description/interpretation/evaluation suggested some difference, but was inconclusive
               given the small number of examples available in the LWL 543. Thus, we may tentatively
               conclude that a common language of cataloguing is used for descriptions in both
               catalogues, even for those records where there cannot have been direct transmission
               of records from one to the other. This leaves open the possibility that the LWL 543
               descriptions were influenced by the transmission of curatorial voice from BMSat:
               however, to make any claims about direct influence from one catalogue to another - as
               distinct from two catalogues sharing an influence from elsewhere - would require a
               different kind of investigation, i.e. a parallel historical investigation into the
               circumstances in which catalogue records were produced.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>4. Discussion</head>
            <p>We have shown how a mixed methods approach can be used to systematically identify
               those catalogue records that are likely to be the products of transmission from an
               earlier catalogue and to analyse them such that models of transmission can be
               elaborated. Whilst we stopped short of asserting that these models form the
               beginnings of a conceptual framework for thinking about the different ways in which
               catalogues are shaped and constructed over time, we expect that the findings from our
               case study will resonate with both cataloguing professionals and researchers who rely
               on catalogue records, especially those who work closely with visual materials,
               domains where cataloguers like Mary Dorothy George are canonical influences.</p>
            <p>In the case of George and the hypothesised transmission from the <title rend="italic"
                  >Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </title>to catalogue records for printed
               images held by the Lewis Walpole Library, we found - <emph>per
               </emph>Baxandall - that influence was varied. Transmission through time, across space,
               and between mediums took many forms. There were cases where catalogue descriptions
               were copied, quoted, and cited, and there were cases where transmission was
               stylistic. Staff at the Lewis Walpole Library drew on and engaged with the <title
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>, and latterly their
               derivations on British Museum Collections Online, as a source of expertise.
               Individual cataloguers reacted to the normative assumptions of George’s early- to mid-
               twentieth century British worldview and developed her thinking for modern audiences.
               When their objects demanded it, the Library staff differentiated their records from
               those in the <title rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</title>. And
               records made for a paper catalogue were remodelled for digital cataloguing
               infrastructures.</p>
            <p>Whilst we can speculate, often with some confidence, on the reasons why a given
               pattern of transmission occurred, the methods we present are less able to get at
               purpose and process, at why and how transmission occurred the way it did. For
               example, we may know that descriptions written by the Lewis Walpole Library are
               linguistically similar to those in BMSat (Section 3.2), but we do not know why
               cataloguers produced each George-like descriptions, how their access to the <title
                  rend="italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </title>and latterly their
               derivations on British Museum Collections Online shaped the production of catalogue
               records, or the extent to which George-like precedents set early in the Library’s
               life shaped later behaviour. Equally, we know that, for example, the Lewis Walpole
               Library record for <title rend="italic">Bath Races</title> tackles and subverts the
               linguistic choices in George’s entry, but only through detailed analysis of
               institutional histories and processes can we develop a mature understanding of why
               the decision was made to produce this description and how and when that occurred. It
               is a cliche to say that ‘more research is needed’, but when historically specific
               labours and practices are obscured both by the presentation of the catalogue as an
               always-already present unifying entity, and when collections are federated for
               access, into datasets, or as machine readable endpoints, knowing our data is vital;
               we may not be able to fix or eliminate the biases in a given catalogue or dataset,
               but we can and should enquire into their ‘deeper structural issues, historical
               antecedents, and power asymmetries’ <ptr target="#birhane2021"></ptr>, of which - in the domain of
               cultural heritage - the transmission of legacy voices across time and outside their
               historical place is one.</p>
            <p>Our methods can advance these imperatives in that they provide a relatively
               collection agnostic approach to characterising types of transmission between
               collection catalogues at scale. Findings resulting from comparable analysis at
               collecting institutions can form the basis for a variety of actions to be taken
               forward depending on institutional context and priorities: further archival research
               into cataloguing processes to correlate and enrich data driven findings; oral
               histories with staff to create data on why choices were made; revisions to records to
               highlight the source of their information; rationalisation between records to even
               out parsing during transmission; allocation of staff time towards plans to repair
               records, document common types of transmission, and/or write business cases for
               recataloguing. We note here that the age or size of an institution may create
               variability in how far our methods can be usefully redeployed or enable opportunities
               not presented by our case study: for example, departments that are (or once were)
               responsible for managing their own catalogues may have retained rich data on the
               editing and versioning of their catalogue records; alternatively, catalogues may have
               been produced in distinct and known phases or batches to support the use of a new
               cataloguing infrastructures (e.g. card catalogue, early database, online collections
               portal), such that sub-divisions of records can be made prior to analysis.
               Nevertheless, for collecting institutions of all ages and sizes, maintaining a
               catalogue is central to their operation. Computational methods for detecting
               transmission and for characterising the multi-faceted influences that produced their
               catalogue can, we hope, usefully support that operation and in turn enrich
               understanding of the collections those catalogues describe.</p>
