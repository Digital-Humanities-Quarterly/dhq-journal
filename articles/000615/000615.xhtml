                  <p>Catalogue records underpin the audit, curatorial, and public access functions of
                     collecting institutions. And they are relied upon by many humanities researchers,
                     and
                     increasingly those looking to analyse collection holdings at scale. However, far from
                     being a neutral record of collection holdings, catalogues are the products of
                     cataloguing labour, often spanning many decades, and so are subject to various biases
                     and inequities. Understanding how collection catalogues are shaped by their histories
                     is then crucial for addressing many of the contemporary challenges faced by
                     cataloguing professionals and for enhancing their use in humanities research, as well
                     as for opening up new directions for historical research. This paper contributes a
                     computationally-based approach for generating new and important knowledge about
                     catalogues, in particular for investigating how a catalogue is shaped by an earlier
                     one. We contend that understanding at scale the transmission of records and style
                     from one catalogue to another requires the use of computational techniques to detect
                     and analyse the various ways in which transmission manifests across a catalogue. </p>
                  
                  <p>Our case study concerns the transmission of Mary Dorothy George’s voice through time,
                     across space, and between mediums, from the 1930s to the late-twentieth century and
                     beyond, from the British Museum in London to the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington,
                     Connecticut, from printed volumes to networked digital data. It aims to show how
                     transmission happens, how it can be found, and how it can be characterised. Detecting
                     and characterising transmission is important because cataloguers like George are the
                     interlocuters between us and the pasts they described, legacy voices that refuse to
                     stay in their historical place, and whose raced, sexed, and classed influence on the
                     future should not go unchecked.</p>
                  
                  <p>Our contributions are relevant both for historical research into catalogues and
                     cataloguing, knowledge organisation and infrastructure, and cultural organisations,
                     and for cataloguing practitioners seeking to rationalise/review their catalogues to
                     improve user experience, address systemic inequalities in object representation, and
                     develop best practice for future work. Furthermore, in broad terms, by contributing
                     to the generation of new knowledge about the biases/inequities of catalogues our work
                     will enable new and better research into the collections that catalogues
                     describe.</p>

                     it

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">One such circumstance is previous cataloguing. In the process of producing their
                     records, cataloguers will typically consult earlier related records when they are
                     available. For any cataloguer working on “Golden Age” satirical prints, prints like
                     <cite class="title italic">Bath Races</cite>, Mary Dorothy George’s work on the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the
                        Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum</cite> (hereafter the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</cite>) has long been an
                     essential point of reference. Spanning seven volumes published between 1935 and 1954
                     they are a classic of the genre such that once the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of
                        Political and Personal Satires</cite> became out of print, demand for the catalogues
                     remained and they were republished as microfilm in 1978 by Chadwyck-Healey. More
                     recently, lightly edited versions of George’s descriptions have been published on
                     the
                     British Museum Collections Online website, which launched in 2009 and contains
                     entries for over 11,000 prints described by George in the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue
                        of Political and Personal Satires</cite>, including <cite class="title italic">Bath
                        Races</cite>.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In the case of the Lewis Walpole Library’s entry for <cite class="title italic">Bath
                        Races</cite>, we know that the corresponding record in <cite class="title italic">Catalogue
                        of Political and Personal Satires</cite> and its later derivations at British Museum
                     Collections Online influenced the content of the record: George’s volume is cited
                     and
                     the web version of the object description is quoted.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e297">[3]</a> But there is more to the story here than a nod to a respected forbear. In
                     their production of a description of <cite class="title italic">Bath Races</cite>, the
                     cataloguers behind the Lewis Walpole description were influenced by the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</cite>, or - to use
                     Michael Baxandall’s [<a href="#baxandall1985">1985</a>] more active formulations of creative influence - they drew
                     on, engaged with, reacted to, differentiated from, remodeled, developed, tackled,
                     even subverted George’s description. Thus, where George calls the protagonists
                     “Cripples and invalids,” the Lewis Walpole Library entry calls them “Sick and infirm
                     patients on crutches and in wheelchairs;” where George has the patients “rush[ing]
                     down a hill,” the Lewis Walpole Library entry has them “rac[ing] down a grassy hill;”
                     where George sees “Young women cheer[ing] on the competitors,” the Lewis Walpole
                     Library entry sees “spectators cheer[ing] them along.” By taking the structure of
                     George’s description but deviating from its now judgemental tone, those who produced
                     the Lewis Walpole Library’s catalogue entry transmitted aspects of George’s
                     curatorial “voice” across time and space, even as they worked to tackle or subvert
                     George’s linguistic choices. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">We start, then, from the position that digitised and digital legacy catalogues
                     entries like these should, assembled at scale, be recognised as highly valuable
                     resources for generating important new knowledge about cataloguing and curatorial
                     practices, their histories, and their consequences. At the same time we respond to
                     the calls (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#bowker2000">Bowker and Star 2000</a>]) to recover the motivations behind
                     classification and its impact on the fabric of knowledge when classification systems
                     like legacy catalogues become further uncoupled from their circumstances of
                     production, such as - in our case - as a result of digitisation. Further, we observe
                     that this uncoupling can produce negative effects when “the future that an
                     algorithmic system can predict is limited by the historical data used to train that
                     system” [<a class="ref" href="#agostinho2019">Agostinho et al. 2019</a>]. Our concerns with historicizing the catalogue thus
                     intersect with important cross-disciplinary and inter-sectoral research on cultural
                     institutions and power [<a class="ref" href="#duncan1995">Duncan 1995</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#perez2003">Perez 2003</a>], histories of anglophone

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The catalogue records we seek to historicize underpin the audit, curatorial, and
                     public access functions of collecting institutions. And they are relied upon by many
                     humanities researchers: consider the historian searching archival materials, the
                     literary scholar collating a corpus of books, or the art historian identifying and
                     analysing relevant prints. In these contexts, we argue that it is important to
                     recognise that catalogues are the products of curatorial and cataloguing labour,
                     often spanning many decades, and they are shaped by earlier catalogues, by shifting
                     curatorial and cataloguing practices and priorities, and by broader social
                     circumstances and cultures [<a class="ref" href="#johnson1990">Johnson 1990</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#kingdon2019">Kingdon 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#sutherland2021">Sutherland and Purcell 2021</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#turner2020">Turner 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#yakel2003">Yakel 2003</a>]. Thus many catalogues comprise subsets of records
                     written at different times, by different people, according to different principles
                     and goals. This situation is exacerbated in those cases where parts of an earlier
                     catalogue are incorporated into a new catalogue. This means that far from a neutral
                     record of collection holdings, catalogues are subject to various biases and
                     inequities, which impact in problematic and potentially unknown ways on how they are
                     used. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Crucially, the historically specific labours and practices of catalogue production
                     are all too easily obscured by the presentation of the catalogue as an always-already
                     present unifying entity, and are further obscured when collections are federated for
                     access, into datasets, or as machine readable endpoints. Cataloguers, curators and
                     researchers will be more or less familiar with the histories of the catalogues that
                     they work with. Hence, to some extent, they will be able to account for how specific
                     labours and practices resulted in particular emphases and absences, biases and
                     inequities. However, such knowledge is often held in the heads of individuals or in
                     annotations made to printed catalogues, and is based on interactions with certain
                     parts of a catalogue. And whilst principles and best practices exist for documenting
                     collections and producing catalogues, there is normally a lack of comprehensive
                     documented information about their use in local cataloguing processes. In turn,
                     collecting institutions have not found ways to make this information useable for
                     publics, a move - as recent work has shown - that can foster anti-racist and
                     anti-colonial practice [<a class="ref" href="#pringle2020">Pringle 2020</a>]. Similarly, whilst some records of the
                     production processes of a catalogue may exist, it is often necessary to work

                     when a catalogue is analysed at scale with support from computational techniques.
                     Further we contend that by approaching catalogues as data we can generate knowledge
                     about them that supports the writing of their histories, documenting their features

                     By combining archival research and corpus linguistic analysis we analysed curatorial
                     voice in over 9,000 descriptions of printed images from the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</cite>, comprising around one million
                     words [<a class="ref" href="#baker2020">Baker and Salway 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#salway2020">Salway and Baker 2020</a>]. We were able to make a
                     systematic account of how the catalogue descriptions included or omitted mentions
                     of
                     certain aspects of objects, how they varied in the degree to which they described

                     by the Lewis Walpole Library, a research centre for eighteenth-century studies in
                     the
                     United States. These records were chosen because they represent a small-scale and
                     well delimited collection containing free-text descriptions, and because we expected
                     that those descriptions would show signs of transmission from the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</cite>. The collections these records
                     are based on, and that now form the Lewis Walpole Library, began to be assembled by
                     Annie Burr and Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis in the early twentieth century. Documentation
                     of the printed image collections accelerated in the mid-1950s, first with the
                     production of over 12,000 catalogue cards by Annie Burr (officially Curator of Prints
                     from 1957) and her voluntary assistant Elizabeth Creamer [<a class="ref" href="#annieburr1960">Annie Burr Lewis papers 1849-1960</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#yale1957">Yale University, 1957</a>]. After Annie Burr’s death in 1959 cataloguing
                     labour was taken “vigorously forward” by Genevieve Butterfield [<a class="ref" href="#lewis1969">Lewis 1969</a>]. In 1980
                     the Lewis Walpole Library became part of Yale University, and from 2003 its
                     collections catalogue was gradually integrated into Orbis, Yale’s digital library
                     catalogue. Throughout this period the Lewis Walpole Library’s collections were added
                     to and its catalogues updated, requiring particular curatorial and cataloguing
                     expertise to manage and explain the printed image collections, from knowledge of the
                     history of printing to methods for describing visual materials. For one subset of
                     the
                     printed image collections, satirical prints produced in England between the 1770s
                     and
                     1830s, the Lewises and their staff based their cataloguing on Volumes 5 to 11 of the
                     <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</cite>, transforming
                     the entries these volumes contained, all of which were written by George, into index
                     cards that detailed titles, persons, places, events, and keywords [<a class="ref" href="#lewis1969">Lewis 1969</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#vermeulen2014">Vermeulen and Carby 2014</a>]. These volumes were acquired by the Lewis Walpole Library
                     between 1938 and 1970, annotated by the Lewises, and described by Wilmarth as
                     “invaluable.” Subsequent cataloguers took this practice forward, drawing on the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </cite>and latterly their

                     analyse the biases and inequalities transmitted. Rather we examine the fact and the
                     nature of transmission, taking transmission as a proxy for catalogue data that
                     retains features produced under historically specific circumstances that were
                     different - perhaps vastly so - from the circumstances in which that data has
                     subsequently been used. We content that such an investigation into if and how a
                     catalogue is shaped by an earlier one is a vital step, because there are many domains
                     where cataloguers like Mary Dorothy George are canonical influences, cataloguers who
                     are persistent interlocuters between us and the pasts they described, legacy voices
                     that refuse to stay in their historical place, and whose raced, sexed, and classed

                     catalogue that are likely to be the products of transmission from earlier catalogues?
                     We present two computational approaches, both of which attempt to identify pertinent
                     subsets of catalogue records based primarily on the content of certain fields in the
                     records, rather than drawing primarily on extant knowledge about the catalogues and
                     the collections they describe. The first approach (described in Section 2.1) should
                     be quite generally applicable to other catalogues in the way it goes about
                     identifying features that may be indicative of transmission. The second approach
                     (described in Section 2.2) pertains to catalogues in which records contain relatively
                     lengthy free-text descriptions of collection items. We show both here as applied to
                     detecting the hypothesised transmission from the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of

                     outputs from these approaches - i.e. selections of records - are analysed in Section
                     3 in order to consider to what extent they are instances of transmission, and to
                     explore what we can learn from them about the processes of transmission.</div>

                     Library that have narrative descriptions and no equivalent in the British Museum.
                     Further, we checked if any of the 543 records indicated reuse of a description in
                     a
                     catalogue other than the <span class="hi italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal

                     we checked if any of the 543 records do in fact relate to printed images held by the
                     British Museum, but escaped our tests, therefore making its MARC 520 field entry a

                     revealed no issues, and so we subsequently made a corpus of descriptions that we are

                     support the investigation of transmission from BMSat to the Lewis Walpole Library
                     catalogue by contrasting those records. For example, we might consider adjustments

                     is, they are not concerned with the order or sequences of words. The Tanimoto
                     function gives a negative value, where the lower the value the greater the distance

                     four functions tended to give results that were proportional to one another, and they
                     were mostly effective at separating cases of transmission (high similarity) from
                     non-transmission (low similarity). However, they were susceptible to cases in which
                     pairs of descriptions shared much vocabulary whilst not being examples of
                     transmission: this happens when descriptions of different impressions of the same
                     printed image are written independently but refer to many of the same things in the
                     printed image, or when two descriptions relate to two different printed images that
                     depict many similar kinds of things. For the example in Figre 3, which shows
                     descriptions of two different impressions of the same printed image which appear to
                     us not to be based on one another, the Jaccard, Tversky and cosine functions all
                     returned scores greater than 0.8, and the Tanimoto function returned -0.31; that is,

                     the length of the description. However, it would give a misleading low score in cases
                     where a copied description has been lightly edited in several places throughout. The
                     RO function accounts for multiple common substrings, and returns a value between 0-1
                     which gets closer to 1 as the two strings share more and longer sequences of words.
                     Unlike the token-based metrics, it seems to be effective at distinguishing pairs of
                     descriptions that are partial copies from pairs that just happen to share a lot of
                     common vocabulary: for the pair in Figure 3, RO gave a score of 0.37, and for the
                     pair
                     in Table 1 it gave 0.84; that is, RO detects transmission in Table 1 but not in Table
                     3. The only problem we noted with RO was that, like all the other functions we
                     considered, it is vulnerable to pairs of short descriptions that share multiple
                     multiword technical and indexing terms, whilst not being examples of transmission.

                     to
                     amplify their similarities or differences; the five functions we tried correspond
                     to
                     five different compression algorithms. However, we struggled to understand how these
                     functions work and how to interpret their results. For example in a preliminary trial
                     they gave the following values for pair of identical descriptions when, intuitively
                     we might have expected either 0 or 1: bwtrle_ncd (0.67), sqrt_ncd (0.41), bz2_ncd

                     further, but this is not to say that they do not warrant further consideration for

                     the task at hand. We estimated that it would take up to two years to run a pairwise
                     comparison of 4,545 LWL x 9,330 BMSat descriptions, using a relatively high-powered
                     workstation and without exploiting parallelisation. Usefully in the standard Python
                     library the Sequence Matcher class includes an implementation of a text distance
                     function which is considered to be similar to RO. With a further trial we observed
                     that this function produces results that are similar to or better than RO, i.e. it
                     makes similar, and sometimes sharper, distinctions between transmission and not

                     this compares with cubic time in the worst case for RO. Furthermore, the function

                     very quickly calculate a highest-possible value (“sequenceMatcher.realquickratio”),

                     description for The rake's progress at the University (1806)
                     is a lossy transmission in that it omits from the description the leading text “See
                     BMSat 10639,” a reference to another print in the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of
                        Political and Personal Satires</cite>, without finding it a place elsewhere in the
                     record.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e922">[38]</a> More often, however,
                     these details are retained, such as in the Lewis Walpole Library entry for
                     Rowlandson’s 1807 print <cite class="title italic">Mrs. Showwell</cite> which removes from the
                     close of the description “26 February 1807. Hand-coloured etching.”, and places those
                     details appropriate to the object at hand (it is not coloured) in the MARC 260
                     (Publication, Distribution, etc. (Imprint)) and 300 (Physical Description) Fields
                     respectively.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e929">[39]</a> Here
                     transmission intersects with temporally specific cataloguing infrastructures.
                     Printing methods, dates of production, and references to other prints were details
                     that it made sense for Mary Dorothy George to include in the main body of her object
                     descriptions: in a printed catalogue, the consistent placement of information on the
                     page and relative to other details was a proxy for record structure. When these
                     records were moved to British Museum Collections Online, they were parsed in largely
                     unadapted form so as to create unmarked sub-fields in a flexible collection database
                     designed for a large and varied museum collection [<a class="ref" href="#griffiths2010">Griffiths, 2010</a>]. But when parsed
                     to fit first a card catalogue system devised by the Lewis’s and later a digital
                     catalogue built on a granular bibliographic standard (MARC 21) capable of handling
                     hundreds of unique fields, it appears that it made greater sense to move these
                     details to dedicated fields.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e934">[40]</a>

                     in short, on numerous occasions Lewis Walpole Library catalogue entries diverges from
                     BMSat equivalents so as to better represent the object at hand. For example, in the
                     Lewis Walpole Library catalogue entry for <cite class="title italic">Mrs. Showwell </cite>the
                     opening line - “Below the title: ‘The Woman who shews General Guise collection of
                     Pictures at Oxford’” - is removed as the Lewis Walpole Library version is trimmed and
                     thus contains no title. In the Lewis Walpole Library description of a Peter Pinder
                     print from 1787, the opening to the corresponding BMSat entry - “Proof without
                     letters” - is removed as the Lewis Walpole Library object is not a proof.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e954">[41]</a> And in the Lewis Walpole Library
                     catalogue record for a 1828 print depicting chess players, the MARC 520 field repeats
                     the description found in BMSat for a near identical print from circa 1788, but
                     removes the opening line - “Title perhaps cut off” - because the Lewis Walpole
                     Library object contains the full print and shows that no title was ever
                     present.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e960">[42]</a>

                     projected Mary Dorothy George into the future, lightly editing her on the way, but
                     doing little to arrest her historically specific interlocution between us and the
                     catalogued past. Where George was revised for reasons other than cataloguing
                     procedure or variant objects, we glimpse the aspects of her descriptions that most
                     troubled subsequent cataloguers. Some of these revisions suggest an attentiveness
                     to
                     the identities that George saw as normative. For example, the Lewis Walpole Library
                     entry for <cite class="title italic">A West India sportsman </cite>adapts the opening “The
                     sportsman sits in a chair..” to “The English sportsman sits in a chair..,” in
                     recognition of the fact that in BMSat men are Englishmen unless described
                     otherwise.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e987">[43]</a> And whilst the
                     retention of a racial epithet in the Lewis Walpole Library entry for <cite class="title italic">A West India sportsman </cite>reminds us that such revisions were
                     themselves historical acts, and whilst as Vermeulen and Carby [<span class="error"><a href="#carby2014">2014</a></span>] note in the
                     Lewis Walpole Library catalogue “[t]here is no subject ‘White;’ white people are,
                     quite literally, the unmarked bodies of the archive,” other revisions suggest some
                     recognition of George’s historically specific choice of language. For example, the
                     Lewis Walpole Library entry for Woodward and Tegg’s 1807 <cite class="title italic">A riddle
                        expounded, or, The dignity of a parsons horse </cite>- an interaction between a
                     parson and “a jovial countryman” that sends up monarchical power - shows transmission
                     intersecting with changing curatorial sensibilities (see Table 6). This print
                     features a heavily caricatured parson, a hybrid of two long-eighteenth century
                     stereotypes: the money-grubbing tithe pig and the drunken clergyman popularised by
                     the ballad “The Vicar and Moses” [<a class="ref" href="#virgin1989">Virgin 1989</a>]. In turn, George described the parson
                     as “drink-blotched and prosperous-looking,”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1015">[44]</a> language
                     revised by a Lewis Walpole Library cataloguer(s) to “red-faced and freckled and
                     prosperous looking, with a round belly.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1019">[45]</a> This
                     revision performs three functions: first, it delegitimises pejorative associations
                     of
                     facial markings with alcoholism; second, by noting the “round belly,” the revision
                     provides an example of what “prosperous looking” might look like to long-eighteenth
                     century British satirical audiences; and third, it expands - if only a little - the
                     assumed readers of the description from a narrow group of experts in long-eighteenth
                     century British history to a more general public. Taken together with other revisions
                     made to George’s original - a correction to the mounting point of a railing, the
                     creation of greater motion in spatial terminology, the assertion that to have a
                     sermon in one’s pocket is to carry it - the Lewis Walpole Library description of <cite class="title italic">A riddle expounded</cite> transmits George for the present: for
                     search, for diverse audiences, and for a context in which collecting institutions
                     recognise and address their roles in maintaining structural inequalities.</div>

                     methods. From George’s 80 word description of the print, thirteen words are edited
                     or
                     replaced by the Lewis Walpole Library and sixteen words are added. These edits are
                     not clustered together, they change every line and most clauses, such that a 58
                     character string - to “a tree, to address a fat elderly parson on horseback (r” - is
                     the longest shared by both the BMSat and Lewis Walpole Library descriptions. By using
                     a suitable text distance metric we were able to surface transmission like this, to
                     read it, and to report on it. In so doing we expanded our knowledge of BMSat to Lewis
                     Walpole Library transmission beyond MARC fields that record transmission, revisions
                     between descriptions of different impressions of the “same” printed image, and
                     descriptions truncated by the omission of opening or closing details. This
                     understanding of transmission was complemented by analysis, reported in the next

                     things were typically referred to or ignored in descriptions, and in terms of the

                     characteristics to the BMSat corpus then that would support the idea of transmission
                     of style, although this alone would not be sufficient evidence to say that the Lewis

                     well in the same categories suggests that the LWL descriptions are providing similar
                     informational content as the BMSat descriptions. For example, 10 of the 18 nouns

                     analysed the 100 most frequent words ending in -ly. We noted many examples of words
                     that were likely used to interpret something about somebody’s actions in terms of
                     their mental state, e.g. ‘angrily’, ‘delightedly’, ‘derisively’, ‘contemptuously’,
                     such as to give a sense of a story playing out (see Table 6 in Salway and Baker
                     [<a href="#salway2020">2020</a>]). We also noted words used to make an evaluative judgement such as about
                     somebody’s appearance, e.g. ‘fashionably’ and ‘grotesquely’. For comparison, a list
                     of -ly words occurring three or more times in the LWL 543 descriptions is given in
                     Figure 4. Though the small number of examples means we cannot draw firm conclusions,
                     it does seem that whilst the LWL 543 descriptions show signs of evaluating
                     appearances (see the bolded words), there is only one example of a word that could
                     be
                     used to interpret an action such as to give a sense of a story playing out, i.e.
                     ‘intently’. Whether this is due to a different curatorial style, or simply the
                     contents of the prints being described, would require a different line of

                     of us observing similarities and missing differences. To actively seek differences,
                     we conducted a keyness analysis to identify words that occur relatively more often
                     in
                     one corpus than the other, with statistical significance. Tables 9a and 9b show the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">Various differences stand out in the keyword lists. First, proper names (Mrs,
                     Wellington, Fox, Napoleon, Duke, John) are keywords in BMSat relative to LWL 543,
                     whilst unnamed people (woman, man) and everyday scenes (dog, chair, table, wall) are
                     keywords in LWL 543 relative to BMSat. This may be explained by the LWL 543 selection
                     containing a higher proportion of records for social satires than BMSat, wherein
                     descriptions of political satires - featuring men like Charles James Fox, Napoleon
                     Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington - account for roughly three-fifths of all
                     descriptions. Second, when compared with BMSat, the LWL 543 descriptions do not
                     contain references such as ‘See BMSat’ ‘BM No’. This supports that observation in
                     Section 3.1 that Lewis Walpole Library records either expand on these abbreviations
                     or move such abbreviations to dedicated data fields.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1144">[51]</a> The BMSat list
                     also contains words that we might consider to be part of a general “language of
                     description” and it might seem surprising that these are not used so much in the LWL
                     543. However, the presence of some may be due to the content of prints, i.e. more
                     prints depicting speech (answers, saying and says), and another due to spelling
                     variation (centre). The remaining BMSat keywords (inscribed, cocked, design, round,
                     extreme, profile, Behind, He, which, wears) may point to minor stylistic differences
                     or may simply be due to the small amount of text in the LWL 543 descriptions. </div>

                     what is described, and what vocabulary is used - the results suggest that overall
                     the
                     BMSat and LWL 543 descriptions are very similar. The comparison in terms of degree
                     of
                     description/interpretation/evaluation suggested some difference, but was inconclusive
                     given the small number of examples available in the LWL 543. Thus, we may tentatively
                     conclude that a common language of cataloguing is used for descriptions in both
                     catalogues, even for those records where there cannot have been direct transmission
                     of records from one to the other. This leaves open the possibility that the LWL 543
                     descriptions were influenced by the transmission of curatorial voice from BMSat:
                     however, to make any claims about direct influence from one catalogue to another -
                     as
                     distinct from two catalogues sharing an influence from elsewhere - would require a
                     different kind of investigation, i.e. a parallel historical investigation into the

                     elaborated. Whilst we stopped short of asserting that these models form the
                     beginnings of a conceptual framework for thinking about the different ways in which

                     and between mediums took many forms. There were cases where catalogue descriptions
                     were copied, quoted, and cited, and there were cases where transmission was
                     stylistic. Staff at the Lewis Walpole Library drew on and engaged with the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</cite>, and latterly their
                     derivations on British Museum Collections Online, as a source of expertise.

                     -twentieth century British worldview and developed her thinking for modern audiences.

                     pattern of transmission occurred, the methods we present are less able to get at
                     purpose and process, at why and how transmission occurred the way it did. For
                     example, we may know that descriptions written by the Lewis Walpole Library are
                     linguistically similar to those in BMSat (Section 3.2), but we do not know why
                     cataloguers produced each George-like descriptions, how their access to the <cite class="title italic">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires </cite>and latterly their
                     derivations on British Museum Collections Online shaped the production of catalogue
                     records, or the extent to which George-like precedents set early in the Library’s
                     life shaped later behaviour. Equally, we know that, for example, the Lewis Walpole
                     Library record for <cite class="title italic">Bath Races</cite> tackles and subverts the
                     linguistic choices in George’s entry, but only through detailed analysis of
                     institutional histories and processes can we develop a mature understanding of why
                     the decision was made to produce this description and how and when that occurred.
                     It
                     is a cliche to say that ‘more research is needed’, but when historically specific
                     labours and practices are obscured both by the presentation of the catalogue as an
                     always-already present unifying entity, and when collections are federated for
                     access, into datasets, or as machine readable endpoints, knowing our data is vital;
                     we may not be able to fix or eliminate the biases in a given catalogue or dataset,
                     but we can and should enquire into their ‘deeper structural issues, historical
                     antecedents, and power asymmetries’ [<a class="ref" href="#birhane2021">Birhane 2021</a>], of which - in the domain of
                     cultural heritage – the transmission of legacy voices across time and outside their

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">Our methods can advance these imperatives in that they provide a relatively
                     collection agnostic approach to characterising types of transmission between
                     collection catalogues at scale. Findings resulting from comparable analysis at
                     collecting institutions can form the basis for a variety of actions to be taken
                     forward depending on institutional context and priorities: further archival research
                     into cataloguing processes to correlate and enrich data driven findings; oral
                     histories with staff to create data on why choices were made; revisions to records
                     to
                     highlight the source of their information; rationalisation between records to even
                     out parsing during transmission; allocation of staff time towards plans to repair
                     records, document common types of transmission, and/or write business cases for
                     recataloguing. We note here that the age or size of an institution may create
                     variability in how far our methods can be usefully redeployed or enable opportunities
                     not presented by our case study: for example, departments that are (or once were)
                     responsible for managing their own catalogues may have retained rich data on the
                     editing and versioning of their catalogue records; alternatively, catalogues may have
                     been produced in distinct and known phases or batches to support the use of a new
                     cataloguing infrastructures (e.g. card catalogue, early database, online collections
                     portal), such that sub-divisions of records can be made prior to analysis.
                     Nevertheless, for collecting institutions of all ages and sizes, maintaining a
                     catalogue is central to their operation. Computational methods for detecting
                     transmission and for characterising the multi-faceted influences that produced their
                     catalogue can, we hope, usefully support that operation and in turn enrich
                     understanding of the collections those catalogues describe.</div>

                     if no digital catalogue record existed. In this case, this Rowlandson print was
                     requested for loan in 2009 for the exhibition “Thomas Rowlandson: Pleasures and

                     of British satirical prints, print reproduction used craft-like technologies that
                     made exact reproduction unachievable: for example, each copper plate engraving or
                     etching was inked by hand, lines incised on copper plates lost definition each
                     time they we used in printing, and colouring was completed by outworkers by hand.
                     As a result, whilst multiple impressions from the same plate often constituted
                     part of the same print run and would have contained the same narrative content,
                     the impressions often sufficiently differ so as to require divergent description.
