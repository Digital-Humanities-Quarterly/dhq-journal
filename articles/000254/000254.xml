                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>Digital humanities scholars have made a tradition of problematizing our
                    understanding of textuality through discussions concerning the design of
                    information systems for texts that, in many cases, still look like books. This
                    discussion is concerned with how creating opportunities for studying audio texts
                    further complicates our understanding of <q>the rationale of a textualized
                        document,</q> defined by Jerome McGann as <q>the dynamic structure of a document as it
                        is realized in determinate (artisanal) and determinable (reflective)
                        ways</q>. This discussion frames a rationale of audio text within the
                    context of developing information infrastructures for accessing audio texts. I
                    introduce a tool called ARLO that we have been developing in the High
                    Performance Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship (HiPSTAS) project
                        (<ref target="http://www.hipstas.org">http://www.hipstas.org</ref>) for
                    accessing and analyzing sound collections alongside new standards being proposed
                    for the development of audio visual (AV) metadata and content models. The
                    discussion concludes by considering what these interventions tell us about how a
                    rationale of audio textuality helps us rethink rationales of text in digital
                    environments.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction</head>
                <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, <title rend="italic">A Critique of Modern Textual
                        Criticism</title>, <title rend="italic">The Textual Condition</title>, and
                        <title rend="italic">Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts</title> laid
                    theoretical groundwork for understanding the social nature of text <ptr
                        target="#mcgann1983"/>
                    <ptr target="#mcgann1991"/>
                    <ptr target="#mckenzie1999"/>. Namely, McGann and McKenzie argued against the
                    traditional editing practices that included identifying a <term>definitive
                        text</term>, a <term>copy text</term>, an <term>ideal text</term>, an
                        <term>Ur text</term>, or a <term>standard text</term> for scholarly
                    editions. They reasoned that these practices obfuscated the social histories and
                    contexts that meaning-making with texts must reflect, including how texts are
                    produced, transmitted, received, and consumed. McCann, McKenzie, and others
                    emphasized textual theories that reflected the significance of materiality,
                    versioning, technical transmission, and institutional contexts. McGann’s <title
                        rend="quotes">The Rationale of Hypertext</title> applies these social text
                    theories in the digital realm <ptr target="#mcgann1995"/> where an escape from
                        <q>book-bound</q> and <q>fixed point</q> navigations indicates a new kind of
                    social condition in the digital age of hypertexts. In the fifteen years since,
                    we have seen multiple scholars (such as <ptr target="#bryant2002"/>
                    <ptr target="#drucker2002"/>
                    <ptr target="#liu2004"/>
                    <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008"/>) take up McGann’s charge to use social text
                    theory and the seemingly expanded perspective afforded by the digital
                    environment to rethink what McGann has called <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#mcgann2001">the rationale of a textualized document</quote>
                    <ptr target="#mcgann2001" loc="137"/></cit>. Of this tradition, this discussion is
                    concerned with how digital audio texts further shape rationales of texts more
                        generally.<note>Audio is best defined as sound that has been recorded,
                        transmitted, or reproduced.</note>
                </p>
                <p>First, after defining some key terms, I frame this problem within conversations
                    about textuality that have arisen around developing information infrastructures
                    for accessing <term>verbal texts</term>. What I am calling verbal texts are
                    documents such as books, articles, letters, and audio for which the content has
                    been represented in information systems as linguistic content or words. Second,
                    in order to situate rationales of verbal texts in the context of audio-texts, I
                    describe a specific example – the development of a tool for accessing and
                    analyzing sound collections in the High Performance Sound Technologies for
                    Access and Scholarship (HiPSTAS) project (<ref target="http://www.hipstas.org"
                        >http://www.hipstas.org</ref>). Third, I use this history and this specific
                    example to consider how current content models and metadata standards reflect
                    rationales of audio texts both in digital humanities and beyond. Finally, I
                    conclude by considering what these interventions tell us about how we may
                    rethink a rationale of textuality in digital environments.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>2. Rationales of Text</head>
                <p>The <term>rationale</term> of a text comprises the principles by which we argue
                    that text makes meaning. This discussion is guided by McGann’s definition of
                    text’s <term>rationale</term> as part of a social condition which he contends is
                    made apparent through <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann2001">the dynamic
                        structure of a document as it is realized in determinate (artisanal) and
                        determinable (reflective) ways</quote>
                    <ptr target="#mcgann2001" loc="137"/></cit>. With this definition, McGann is focused
                    primarily on verbal texts, but he is also considering how the physical object of
                    the text is made as artisanal properties. These properties might include how a
                    book is bound or which picture might be on the cover of a particular edition or
                    which font or words were chosen. The text's reflective properties, on the other
                    hand, point to how this physical and conceptual text is understood by a reader
                    who might make meaning about (or reflect on) that book binding, that image, and
                    that font or word choice. These two kinds of information, which McGann calls
                    determinate and determinable, jointly or dynamically comprise the verbal text’s
                    meaning in social text theory.</p>
                <p>Additionally, by placing special emphasis on how interpretation relies on the
                    realization of a <term>document,</term> McGann situates these determinate and
                    determinable properties within the context of processes for textual production,
                    transmission, and reception in social text theory. Unlike the concept of
                        <term>text</term>, which can span multiple iterations of a work,
                        <term>document</term> is understood as a situated object in time and place:
                    it is <quote rend="inline" source="#buckland1997">any physical or symbolic
                        sign, preserved or recorded, intended to represent, to reconstruct, or to
                        demonstrate a physical or conceptual phenomenon</quote> (Briet, 1951 quoted
                    in <ptr target="#buckland1997"/>). Much as social text theory is concerned with
                    the publishing and social systems (the scholarly infrastructure) that define
                    textuality, document theory in information science likewise comprises the study
                    of the <term>document</term> within particular contexts or systems of
                    organization and distribution called <term>documentation</term> including
                    collecting, standardizing, filing, classifying, copying, disseminating, and
                    preserving documents <ptr target="#buckland1997" loc="805"/>. Historically,
                    these concerns have been shared by many information scholars who consider the
                        <term>document</term> in terms of these analog, digital, and decidedly
                    social, processes of documentation (for examples, see <ptr target="#otlet1990"
                    />; <ptr target="#frohmann2004"/>; <ptr target="#briet2006"/>; <ptr
                        target="#feinberg2010"/>). McGann’s rationale of text as <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#mcgann2001">the dynamic structure of a document
                        as it is realized</quote> also refers to these documentation processes
                    (among others) as essential means by which we come to understand textuality or
                    the rationale of text.</p>

                <p>Before proceeding, it is important to note that text can be realized in different
                    ways. D.F. McKenzie defines text as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#mckenzie1999">verbal, visual, oral, and
                            numeric data, in the form of maps, prints, and music, of archives of
                            recorded sound, of films, videos, and any computer-stored information,
                            everything in fact from epigraphy to the latest forms of
                            discography</quote>
                        <ptr target="#mckenzie1999" loc="13"/>
                    </cit>. Further, in the digital envinronment we can process texts as other texts
                    such as sonifying or rasterizing verbal texts, a consequence of <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ernst2012">the digital code [that] renders
                            commensurate texts, images, and sounds</quote>
                        <ptr target="#ernst2012" loc="84"/>
                    </cit>. It is also important to realize that the kinds of text with which McGann
                    and others in digital humanities have been primarily interested are literary,
                    cultural, or aesthetic. As such, these kinds of verbal texts are usually
                    self-reflective or <q>playfully</q> aware of their status as realized texts.
                    That is, a literary text such as a poem asks the reader to take into
                    consideration how the poem looks on the page, how the words sound together, how
                    the choice of one word over another or the lack of a word makes meaning. As a
                    result, these kinds of texts have what McGann calls a <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#mcgann2001">generic rationale... to maximize attention to the
                        structure and interplay of the textual orders</quote> – orders such as the
                    linguistic (semantic) and bibliographic (graphical) codes present on a page <ptr
                        target="#mcgann2001" loc="138"/>. Literary, cultural, and aesthetic texts
                    often emphasize how blurring the boundaries between these elements <ptr
                        target="#mcgann2001" loc="137"/> can help form the text’s meaning. </p>
                <p>This discussion will address how sound in spoken word audio may be realized in
                    digital information systems. While a wide range of literary, cultural, and
                    aesthetic artifacts may be classified as <term>text</term>, the primary focus
                    for definitions (or rationales) of text in digital humanities have focused on

                    admits that phonological and tactile elements (such as how words sound and how a

                <head>3. Rationales of Digital Text</head>
                <p>Many conversations in digital humanities are concerned with how we model literary
                    texts in systems that reproduce, transmit, display, and analyze text. These
                    discussions typically detail the difficulties creating a model of text that
                    seems to both represent the scholar’s perceived rationale of that text (as
                        <q>authentic</q>) with the explicitness and consistency that a computer that
                    can <q>compute</q> or process those elements requires <ptr
                        target="#johansson1991a"/>.<note>A computational model of text, in Willard
                        McCarty’s terms, would be both completely explicit and absolutely consistent
                        as well as manipulable.</note> As Willard McCarty reminds us, creating a
                    computationally tractable model of something like <q>text</q> is tendentious: it

                    <ptr target="#mccarty2004"/></cit>. Floyd and Renear also note that an ontology for
                    modeling textuality through computers requires a balance between recognizable
                    and computable: the model <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#floyd2007">need not

                <p>In order to better explicate these tensions between a tractable text and an
                    authentic representation of text, I outline two models for computing texts that
                    are widely used by the humanities and library communities and have been
                    critiqued in DH for seemingly inauthentic representations of textuality. The
                    first is a content model called Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects (OHCO),
                    which has a history in typesetting and printing and was the model upon which the
                    TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
                    Interchange <ptr target="#tei2014"/> was developed. The second example,
                    Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), is a model meant to
                    facilitate the organization and discovery of cultural artifacts through library
                    catalogs (International Federation of Library Associations).</p>
                <div>
                    <head>3.1. Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects (OHCO)</head>
                    <p>TEI, one of the first and most widely adopted models of text used in
                        developing information infrastructures in DH was based on the idea of text
                        as an ordered hierarchy of content objects (OHCO) <ptr target="#derose1990"
                        />. In the OHCO model, texts are primarily comprised of <q>linguistic
                            objects</q> in which form (sections, paragraphs, and quotation blocks)
                        and content (the words that comprise these entities) are separate but
                        related aspects. As a hierarchical model, bigger objects such as chapters or
                        volumes <q>contain</q> smaller objects such as paragraphs, which in turn
                        contain other smaller objects such as lists or quotation blocks. This model
                        reflects a concern with procedural practices for verbal texts in typesetting
                        and printing, which entails adding meaningful metadata to a text as
                        meta-instructions for how to format a document <ptr target="#derose1990"
                            loc="2"/>. With the OHCO model, computation is facilitated by the
                        structure of these content objects since they can be consistently maintained
                        across different formats or layouts. </p>
                    <p>Rationales of text provide for an understanding of text by which we can
                        evaluate whether a model such as OHCO adequately represents textuality more
                        generally. Critiques of OHCO are concerned with the many ways in which
                        elements of a dynamic text overlap and are therefore poorly represented by a
                        hierarchical, nested structure. Literary texts such as novels and poems, for
                        example, often comprise multiple, overlapping themes or rhyming schemes that
                        fall across lines or stanzas. Due to these debates about the model’s
                        representation of text, the OHCO authors subsequently <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#derose1990">retreated from the simple OHCO thesis</quote> and

                        stipulate that while the OHCO model is both practically and empirically
                        valuable to the general community of text consumers, it is perhaps less
                        valuable in the context of literary, cultural, and aesthetic texts where a
                        text can be understood to reflect a rationale of text with a spectrum of
                        determined and determinable dynamics.</p>

                    <p>Meant to serve as a model for standards, FRBR was developed primarily as a
                        model or vocabulary for library catalogers and system designers by the
                        International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) in
                        order to standardize practices for finding, identifying, selecting, and
                        obtaining cultural artifacts from libraries <ptr target="#tillet2004"
                            loc="2"/>. In an attempt to standardize terminologies for abstract
                        concepts, FRBR includes rules for the specific use of general terms
                        including <term>work</term>, <term>expression</term>,
                            <term>manifestation</term>, and <term>item</term>. In FRBR,
                            <term>work</term> is described as <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#tillet2004">the story being told in the book, the ideas in a

                        <term>expression</term> is described as a particular translation or edition
                        (scholarly or popular for example) of the work; <term>manifestation</term>
                        is described as a particular publication of the work; and <term>item</term>
                        is described as the <quote rend="inline" source="#tillet2004">physical
                            object that has paper pages and a binding and can sometimes be used to

                        <ptr target="#tillet2004" loc="2"/>. In its focus on conceptual
                        entity-relationships, FRBR’s entities reflect an attempt to disambiguate
                        terms by grouping entities by their characteristics as well as by grouping
                        them according to the relationships that tie them together. Thus, multiple
                        editions or <term>expressions</term> of Hamlet can be associated with the
                        same <term>work</term>, making all of the editions findable, identifiable,
                        and obtainable according to that relationship.</p>
                    <p>Though FRBR entities are imagined as <q>universals</q>, Renear and Dubin show
                        how rationales of text that include textual dynamics at play provide an
                        opportunity for problematizing how the FRBR entities represent texts <ptr
                            target="#renear2007"/>. In particular, the authors use the example of
                        the author of a TEI XML (eXtensible Markup Language) document. They discuss
                        a TEI XML document as a complex object that can be simultaneously considered
                        a <term>manifestation</term> (or a new publication of the same content) and
                        an <term>expression </term> (in the event of a scholarly edition that
                        expresses a version of the text that has not been articulated in this way
                        previously). Due to the kinds of ambiguities these examples represent,
                        Renear and Durbin argue that three of the four FRBR entities in Group #1 are
                        problematic since they are not self identical or unique. They argue that the
                        entities are, in fact, <term>roles</term> rather than <term>types</term>.
                        That is, while a <term>type</term> remains a <q>rigid</q> property
                        regardless of the context, a <term>role</term>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#renear2007">is brought about by contingent
                            social circumstances</quote> and seems to represent more readily the

                    <p>Consequent to making a distinction between <term>role</term> and
                            <term>type</term> for the FRBR entities, Renear and Durbin refactor the
                        FRBR types in order to suggest new, more <q>rigid</q> or distinct types.
                        Adopting John Searle’s distinction between natural objects, which are
                        presumed independent of context, and social objects, which are contingent on
                        the social dimension of knowing <ptr target="#searle1995"/>, Renear and
                        Durbin call these more distinct types <term>symbol sequences</term> (which
                        play the role of realizing a work), <term>physical kinds</term> (which play

                        While Renear and Durbin admit to their suggestion’s inconsistencies, the
                        important point here is the extent to which rationales of text are being
                        used both to problematize as well as reimagine how we can develop rigorous
                        text processing systems for the reproduction, transmission, dissemination,
                        and analysis of texts that are both tractable by computers and authentic to

                <p>A consideration for rationales of <term>audio</term> text as they are realized
                    through systems for processing audio is also productive, especially since, in
                    the humanities, such systems are often developed for literary, cultural, and
                    aesthetic texts such as oral histories, poetry performances, speeches, and
                    storytelling. In order to better understand what is at stake in terms of
                    rationales for audio text, the following describes the rationale of audio text
                    as it is currently being realized in information systems from three
                    perspectives: (1) through the development of a prototype for sound analysis
                    software in the High Performance Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship
                    (HiPSTAS) project; (2) as a content model represented by the TEI; and (3) in
                    terms of a library cataloging model for describing audiovisual resources through
                    the BIBFRAME Initiative. </p>

                    <head>4.1 Audio textuality in HiPSTAS</head>
                    <p>A joint project of the School of Information (iSchool) at the University of
                        Texas at Austin (UT) and the Illinois Informatics Institute (I3) at the
                        University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), the High Performance
                        Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship (HiPSTAS) project is
                        developing the ARLO (Adaptive Recognition with Layered Optimization)
                        software. ARLO is a web-based, machine-learning application originally
                        developed for acoustic studies in animal behavior and ecology <ptr
                            target="#enstrom1993"/>. In ARLO, the audio text is represented as a
                        spectrogram. Designed to model a bank of hairs in the inner ear and to
                        vibrate at different audio frequencies in response to sound waves, ARLO
                        creates spectrograms by monitoring and then sampling the instantaneous
                        energy of these <q>hairs</q> or tuning forks<note> The instantaneous energy
                            is then factored by summing the fork’s potential energy or the
                            deflection of the fork and its kinetic energy based on the speed of the
                            movement, per second.</note> and then using this data to create a 2D
                        matrix of values (frequency vs. time). These matrices or spectrograms (see
                        example in Figure 1) show a map of sonic energy across time with each row of
                        pixels representing a frequency band and the color of each pixel
                        representing the numerical value of total energy of that particular
                        frequency (or how much the tuning fork trembles) for that point in time.
                        ARLO uses these spectrograms to model sonic features for machine learning
                        processes including clustering (unsupervised learning) as well as
                        classification (prediction or supervised learning).</p>
                    <p>HiPSTAS was originally funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities as
                        an Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities between May 2013
                        and May 2014 for scholars who are interested in using machine-learning
                        software to analyze audio texts of primarily verbal events such as poetry
                        performances, speeches, and storytelling activities. Many of the HiPSTAS
                        participants used ARLO to analyze poetry performances in PennSound, a
                        web-based archive launched by Charles Bernstein and Al Filreis in 2005 as a
                        noncommercial offering of approximately 30,000 downloadable MP3s — mostly as
                        song-length singles. The PennSound recordings are already retrievable both
                        from a library catalog by authors’ names and via Web search engines, but the
                        HiPSTAS participants were primarily interested in analyzing <q>vocal
                            gestures</q> in the performances. These gestures such as <cit>

                            <q>para-content</q> such as pitch and laughter. One participant writes,

                        learning processes — which seemed to offer access to these dynamic aspects
                        of audio textuality — the participants began to articulate how these
                        rationales for audio texts might be realized in a system like ARLO.</p>
                    <p>While provocative, systems like ARLO also provide an opportunity for
                        interrogating whether or not they adequately represent both authentic and
                        tractable texts. For instance, identifying sonic patterns in a system such
                        as ARLO is a time-consuming task of finding and labeling training data that
                        adhere to the listener’s understanding of the audio-text’s rationale or
                        dynamic structures. Using these human-generated training examples, ARLO
                        creates a model for labeling new, <q>unseen</q> audio examples. In the case
                        of a scholar working with recordings, this could mean marking up a sound
                        recording according to some of the sonic aspects the participants identified
                        above such as variances in pitch, recording noises, or the presence of
                        laughter or applause. For example, Figure 1 shows how one could mark up
                        different voices on spectrogram such as <q>William Owens</q> (at point
                            <q>A</q>) and <q>Robert Frost</q> (at point <q>C</q>) as well as
                        silences (at point <q>B</q>) in order to teach the machine to model these
                        patterns and to identify or classify more of these sonic patterns of
                        interest in a collection. </p>
                    <p>Labeling examples for machine-learning is ultimately an ontological exercise
                        that requires some standardization. Standardization allows for consistency
                        across machine learning examples as well as results that can be more easily
                        interpreted in terms of a particular discourse community. For instance,
                        instead of compiling their own list of labels, the PennSound scholars chose
                        to use terms provided in the <title rend="quotes">Transcriptions of
                            Speech</title> section of the TEI P5 Guidelines because they wanted a
                        set of terms that had been standardized by a community of scholars for whom

                    <p>After the poets and scholars had used these TEI terms in ARLO to label
                        two-second samples from PennSound’s 5497 hours of audio, however, they
                        determined that the list was insufficient for adequately describing the
                        sonic aspects of their audio texts.</p>
                    <p>The issue, as described by the participants, was that ARLO’s prototype
                        environment for labeling required them to label snippets of sound as though
                        they were static objects while they understood the audio texts to be dynamic
                        events that reflected a relational context. For instance, one participant
                        might mark a two-second sample <q>Beatable</q> with a <q>High</q> pitch and
                        another might classify the same sample as <q>Arrhythmic</q> with a
                            <q>Low</q> pitch. This seeming discrepancy was the result of differing
                        perspectives on the sounds since <q>High</q> is only perceived as
                            <q>High</q> in relation to <q>Low</q> and <q>Arrhythmic</q> is only
                        meaningful in relation to <q>Beatable.</q><note>These results are discussed
                            in detail in <ptr target="#clement2014a"/>.</note> The participants also
                        wanted to label larger contexts rather than snippets and to tag the
                        recording scenario (such as the sound of the room) over time; the perceived
                        gender of the speaker so that they could mark why they thought a pitch was
                        higher or lower (in relation to how a voice perceived as male or female
                        might register); and the genre of a noise (such as musical or lilting voice)
                        as they perceived it. It quickly became clear that the TEI terms did not
                        provide a way for the participants to label their audio texts as
                        situationally contingent or in a way they felt adequately represented the
                        various audio-textual dynamics they could perceive based on their
                        perspectives in a particular moment in time. Consequently, while
                        participants had rationales of audio-text they wished to access and analyze,
                        their experience in this pilot study seemed to indicate that these
                        rationales were computationally intractable or non-computable in the ARLO
                        system.</p>

                        guidelines represent one of the few rich content models for reproducing,

                        developed to produce transcripts or written representations of a stretch of
                        speech. According to extant meetings notes and draft versions, speech

                        guidelines <ptr target="#sperbergmcqueen1990"/>. Indeed, when tasked with
                        creating recommendations for its inclusion, the Spoken Text Working Group
                        (STWG) purposefully restricted their guidelines, as much as possible, to the
                        verbal aspects of a recording <ptr target="#johansson1991a"/>. Consequently,
                        they labeled prosodic and paralinguistic features such as the vocal gestures

                        guidelines still focus on the verbal content of recordings, stating

                    <p>From the extant meeting notes surrounding the development of these
                        guidelines, it appears that the TEI STWG found time-based sound dynamics
                        such as pitch, speed, and tone meaningful, but impractical to represent
                        given the TEI’s structure. Notes from the working group’s 1991 meeting
                        reflect the group’s knowledge of the relationship between para-linguistic
                        content and cultural studies in the works of <ptr target="#svartvik1980"/>
                        and <ptr target="#tedlock1983"/>, which are heavily cited, but also the
                        understanding that the STWG had to compromise representing these audio-text
                        dynamics in order to stay consistent with the TEI’s underlying OHCO model of
                        textuality and its subsequent use of hierarchical XML (EXtensible Markup
                        Language) elements. The STWG call <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#johansson1991b">performative features such as pitch, speed

                        and suggest that they be marked similarly in TEI-marked transcriptions,
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#johansson1991b">using milestone tags

                        <ptr target="#johansson1991b"/>. Likening these performative features to
                        type changes such as italicized or underlined text, the note suggest
                            <q>milestone</q> tags that identify these sonic events as clear points
                        in time with a start and an end point instead of as dynamic events that
                        happen in concert with other patterns across time. The end result is similar
                        to the instances in which structural tags produced in the TEI guidelines for
                        text such as <gi>p</gi> for paragraph or <gi>l</gi> for line cut off themes
                        across novels or truncate rhyming schemes across poems.</p>

                            Study</title> is, like FRBR’s authors, very keen to incorporate
                        alternate models that meet both public and scholarly needs for access and
                        discovery methods, her primary model of reference, unlike FRBR’s or the
                        TEI’s, is time-based audiovisual resources rather than verbal texts. </p>
                    <p>As the report indicates, AV resources have medium-specific characteristics
                        that must be taken into consideration in any digital representation. First,
                        they are by nature event-centric and carrier dependent. That is, what is
                        central to the rationale of such recordings is that an event or action (or a
                        continuum of events and actions) that took place in a time and at a place
                        was recorded or <q>fixed</q> to a carrier such as a film reel or an audio
                        tape. Van Malssen notes that <quote rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014"
                            >while machine dependency is not unique to time-based media, it is an
                            unextractable attribute</quote> that must be taken into account when
                        considering provenance but also for access and discovery in terms of
                        creating playback opportunities at the right speed or color resolution <ptr
                            target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="6"/>. Second, AV resources are more often
                        than not created by and contributed to by many collaborators. Third, these
                        materials are often unique in that they have never been published <ptr
                            target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="7"/>. Fourth, AV resources can be singular
                        items but they are also manifest in the aggregate as collections and can
                        appear on multiple carriers. For example, albums have multiple tracks; songs
                        appear in multiple collections; and long interviews or films are often
                        recorded across multiple tapes or reels <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014"
                            loc="8"/>. Fifth, the audio and moving image media we see today have
                        complicated relationships to their original recordings. Most have been
                        migrated across media formats as older media degenerates and new media
                        evolves. Historical recordings migrated to reel-to-reel tapes, for example,
                        may have first been recorded on glass discs that were shorter in length.
                        Thus, the reel-to-reel tapes do not have a one-to-one relationship to the
                        carriers that originally held the recording. Or, film reels may have been
                        conserved or enhanced in later generations after decades of poor quality
                        viewings. Because of these important characteristics of AV materials, Van
                        Malssen argues that models for cataloguing (and thus discovering) AV must
                        reflect a primary concern with modes of creation and access rather than
                        simply a focus on particular types of content <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014"
                            loc="4"/>. </p>
                    <p>Due to these issues, Van Malssen recommends an event-centric content model
                        for AV resources that takes the physically situated context (e.g., the
                        recording and playback circumstances) into account. If expressions can be
                        described as either work- or event-centric, it would allow for <cit><quote
                            rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014">the inclusion of works, or some
                            work elements as part of the event, but does not require a work be
                            present</quote>
                        <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="24"/></cit>. This distinction between
                            <term>event</term> and <term>work</term> is exemplified by the
                        difference between an audio recording of a battle that took place in World
                        War II and a filmed reenactment of the same battle. A description of the
                        battle recording would be <term>event-centric</term> since the event took
                        place in space and time and is the object of description at the content
                        level; the filmed re-enactment would be more like the traditional notion of
                        the work in the mind of the creator <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="18"
                        />. Van Malssen notes that not treating these catalog descriptions
                        differently results in a blurring of resources: both event and the
                        reenactment would employ the same subject terms (World War II) even though
                        the first <emph>is</emph> the event while the second uses the event as
                        content.</p>
                    <p>For audio texts such as recordings of poetry performances, an event-centric
                        description could reshape processes for discovery and possibilities for
                        research. For instance, poetry readings that are recitations of a written
                        text could be marked differently than poetry performances. FRBR identifies
                        an <term>expression</term> as a different edition or translation of a work
                        and the <term>manifestation</term> as the physical embodiment of that
                        expression with the <term>item</term> as <soCalled>a single exemplar of a manifestation.</soCalled> A
                        marked difference between work and event would be salient in poetry
                        performance studies where the performance of a poem that is also written
                        could be very similar to or very different from the written text – either a
                        new expression or a whole new work (that is the event). For example, in Ken
                        Sherwood’s analysis of the recordings and transcriptions of Amiri Baraka,
                        Kamau Brathwaite, and Cecilia Vicuña, he speaks of <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#sherwood2006">emergent performance events</quote> as
                        different works in comparison to poetry recitations, which he considers oral
                        versions (or variant expressions) of the written text <ptr
                            target="#sherwood2006"/>. A performance, Bernstein argues <cit><quote
                            rend="inline" source="#bernstein2011">opens up the potential for
                            shifting frames, and the shift of frame is itself perceived as a

                            ghost of the textual composition</quote>
                        <ptr target="#bernstein2011" loc="127"/></cit>. A model that could be either
                        event- or work-centric could serve to help identify these kinds of hybrid
                        situations in which an event gives rise to a work or vice versa, creating an
                        entirely new, but related, entity. </p>
                    <p>It is clear that our print-based, logocentric biases preclude us from
                        facilitating new kinds of discovery and analysis with alternate media, but
                        seeing these biases also makes it apparent that we are building models of
                        textuality in general that remain insufficiently poor. The attempt in the
                        HiPSTAS project to create an infrastructure for analyzing audio patterns in
                        audio texts illustrates the importance in the humanities for rationales of
                        audio text that engage audio as events that may make meaning differently by
                        means of markedly different reception scenarios. Finding and making meaning
                        with audio texts can include a consideration for sound dynamics that can
                        only be perceived through time such as pitch, timbre, and intonation as well
                        as the importance of material recording scenario artifacts, all of which
                        could be considered <q>noise</q> and essentially rendered undiscoverable in
                        the context of systems that model all texts as if they are static, verbal
                        documents. As a culture, we have become adept at modeling textuality in
                        terms of a print-based paradigm in which texts are discrete entities (in
                        terms of both time and space) of verbal content. We are arguably less adept
                        at modeling time-based or three-dimensional media, which we still insist on
                        fixing in time and translating into words, either through metadata or
                        through transcripts.<note>See more discussions of these perceived

                        book-like) verbal texts are equally insufficient in the digital environment.

                <head>5. Towards [Other] Rationale[s] of [Audio] Text</head>
                <p>The expanding web, advancing opportunities for networking within and across
                    library collections through Linked Data, and our increasingly complex needs for
                    discovering and analyzing all types of library holdings has resulted in a
                    general re-evaluation of how we model all types of cultural artifacts through
                    information systems. Situating the above reflections on the rationale of audio
                    text in the context of Renear and Durbin’s recommendations for roles in FRBR and
                    the AV model recommendations for describing events in the LC’s BIBFRAME standard
                    provides for an opportunity to reconsider methods for representing textuality
                    more generally as always situated and contingent in information systems.
                    Specifically, the following section introduces three aspects of textuality that
                    could be foregrounded through event-centric content and discovery models:
                    collective intentionality, emergent performativity, and indexical
                    performativity.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>5.1 Collective intentionality</head>
                    <p>With an event-centric model, textual events could be described as social
                        objects that reflect collective intentionalities. Arguing that the role a
                            <q>natural</q> object plays is determined by contingent social
                        circumstances, Renear and Durbin cite J.R. Searle’s understanding of these
                        circumstances as the <q>collective intentionality</q> of producers,
                        transmitters, and consumers who shape the role an object plays in a system
                            (<ptr target="#searle1995"/>, quoted in <ptr target="#renear2007"/>).
                        This notion of collective intentionality is also essential in social text
                        theories such as Martha Nell Smith’s ideas concerning triangular textuality
                            (<quote rend="inline" source="#smith1992">the influence of biography,
                            reception, and textual reproduction</quote>) in Emily Dickinson’s work

                        <ptr target="#drucker2003"/>; or in D.F. McKenzie’s insistence that texts
                        serve as signposts for spatio-temporality, as they alert <cit><quote
                            rend="inline" source="#mckenzie1999">us to the roles of institutions
                            and their complex structures in affecting the forms of social discourse,

                        <ptr target="#mckenzie1999" loc="15"/></cit>. In defining each manifestation as
                        the fixing or recording of socio-textual events, McGann, McKenzie, Smith,
                        and others are discussing texts as social objects in much the same way as
                        Renear and Durbin who are arguing that the social and cultural circumstances
                        that help produce texts and our understandings of a text should be included
                        in computational models for texts. </p>
                    <p>While it would seem that such social circumstances are beyond the
                        codifications of a bibliographic standard for access, there are emerging
                        models for discovering AV that are promising. Van Malssen cites
                            <term>indecs</term>, a project of the European Community Info 2000
                        initiative, as an AV model that adequately <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#vanmalssen2014">places emphasis on the role that events play
                            in the creation of a resource</quote> by using the expression entity to
                        describe events as <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014"
                            >‘creating’ events (an event which results in the making of a creation),
                            ‘using’ events (events which results [sic] in the use of a resource), or
                            ‘transforming’ events which involve the use of one creation in the
                            making of another)</quote>
                        <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="19"/></cit>. Marking the role of event is
                        markedly different even than the promising W3C Provenance Data Model
                        (PROV-DM), which is a framework that includes <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            source="#provdm">information about entities, activities, and people
                            involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to

                            trustworthiness</quote>
                        <ptr target="#provdm"/></cit>. Designed to model the relationships involved in the
                        creation of items, PROV-DM is organized into six components that include the
                        following: <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#provdm">(1) entities and
                            activities, and the time at which they were created, used, or ended; (2)
                            derivations of entities from entities; (3) agents bearing responsibility
                            for entities that were generated and activities that happened; (4) a
                            notion of bundle, a mechanism to support provenance of provenance; (5)
                            properties to link entities that refer to the same thing; and, (6)
                            collections forming a logical structure for its members</quote>
                        <ptr target="#provdm"/></cit>. Like the FRBR model, however, PROV-DM does not
                        designate the role of events in terms such as <q>creating events,</q>
                        <q>transforming events,</q> and <q>using events</q> but rather the
                        manifestations such as texts, paintings, or photographs that result from
                        these events. Thus, while a more robust model such as PROV-DM can provide a
                        model for text that foregrounds the results of collective intentionalities
                        (and thus records its occurrence), the event-centric information concerning
                        the roles these events play in relationship to each other and to the objects
                        they effect remains obfuscated. </p>

                    <p>A model of textuality that represents text as a spatial and temporal
                        phenomenon might allow for interactions and representations in a digital
                        environment that, rather than insisting on fixity, foreground principles of
                        emergence. For example, the AV model recommendations for BIBFRAME note that
                        FRBR does not provide a model for describing an aggregate manifestation that
                        comprises two or more distinct expressions such as when two different parts
                        of a recording are recorded or <q>fixed</q> at different times and different
                        places or when different tracks on a recording are compilations of wholly
                        different works, a scenario that is not far removed from similar instances
                        of volumes of poetry or short stories, which have been republished and
                        reissued. This inadequacy comes into greater relief as we begin to think
                        about the creating, using, and transforming events that give rise to whole
                        new works.</p>
                    <p>The recommendations for a BIBRAME AV model attempts to expand on the notion

                        file that might have singular or multiple video and audio tracks plus a
                        subtitle track, the AV model recommendations cite the concept of
                            <term>essence</term> as it is used in the PBCore (Public Broadcasting
                        Metadata Dictionary Project) and EBU (European Broadcasting Unit) Core
                        models for broadcast collections as a more robust concept for an
                        event-centric model since it typically includes information about both the
                        content and carrier as well as enabling the description of multiple
                        instantiations of a given content item, such as a broadcast that is
                        repeatedly aired at different times. The AV model recommendations favor the
                        essence model as one that <quote rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014">is
                            as much about the bitstream or signal as it is about the content carried
                            in that stream</quote> because it <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            source="#vanmalssen2014">is expressed in these models through sets of
                            carrier sub-elements . . . which can be repeated for different essence
                            types found in that carrier</quote>
                        <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="18"/></cit>. </p>
                    <p>This notion of essence corresponds to John Bryant’s definition of verbal
                        texts as <q>fluid</q> or as a <q>flow of energy</q> rather than a product or
                        a <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bryant2002">conceptual thing or actual set
                            of things or even discrete events</quote>
                        <ptr target="#bryant2002" loc="61"/></cit>. According to this definition, the
                        aggregated text comprises multiple versions in manuscript and print, various
                        notes and letters and comments of contemporaries or current readers, as well
                        as an element of what I have called <term>textual performance</term>
                        <ptr target="#clement2011"/> or a concept of textuality as it is manifested
                        or performed in real time and space with a collaborative audience. By
                        developing models that expand notions of fixity as an essential element, we
                        allow manifestations to be aggregate and contingent, a representation for
                        text that allows for new modes of discovery and access. </p>

                    <head>5.4 Indexical performativity</head>
                    <p>As discussed, according to the recommendations for a BIBFRAME AV model, an AV
                        object should always be described in terms of the event of its realization,
                        in terms of how it has been and could be realized on a particular carrier or
                        format (such as a vinyl record or a CD), or in terms of a particular
                        playback system (such as a record player or CD player). As such, every
                        manifestation becomes indexical because each points to these events or
                        technological protocols that generated the item. As such, the nature of an
                        object’s identification as an <q>item</q> would be based in part on the
                        information surrounding the contingent circumstances of its realization. For
                        instance, in order to enable <quote rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014"
                            >authentic access and preservation,</quote> the AV model recommendations
                        cite a need for software systems that not only describe granular features of
                        certain formats such as <quote rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014"
                            >audio reel, number of tracks, playback speed, reel size, etc.</quote>,
                        but also the technical characteristics of carriers in order <quote
                            rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014">to enable identification of the
                            appropriate playback equipment</quote> that can respond to or make
                        manifest these features <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="24"/>. </p>
                    <p>Accordingly, these aspects of an object’s indexicality are also performative
                        in a digital environment since they create how we understand the structure
                        of the event of an object’s instantiation. Wolfgang Ernst describes this
                        kind of performativity in the digital environment as the extent to which
                        code plays a role as text, as image, as audio, and so on; from this
                        perspective, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#ernst2012">rigid text is
                            replaced by an operative mathematics</quote>
                        <ptr target="#ernst2012" loc="87"/></cit>. By drawing attention to the manner in
                        which code effects commensurability among digital <q>items</q> such as text,
                        images, and sound, Ernst considers <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            source="#ernst2012">the structure of an archive whose essence, the
                            closer one looks [as] less the archived material per se than a dynamic
                            conception of the idea of the archive</quote>
                        <ptr target="#ernst2012" loc="83"/></cit>. This is to say that the very nature of
                        digital materiality requires that a model for <q>item</q> (through attribute
                        and values) be applied on the level of the bitstream in order for any text
                        to be realized as such. This aspect of the item’s indexical performativity
                        is also identified in Renear and Durbin’s assertion that <cit><quote
                            rend="inline" source="#floyd2007">items are the things, whatever their
                            nature (physical, abstract, or metaphorical), which play the role in
                            bibliographic control that FRBR assigns to items</quote>
                        <ptr target="#floyd2007"/></cit>. In both cases, the attributes and relations of
                        an item (whether on the level of its physical or digital instantiation) that
                        effect its manifestation are also what would define its role as an item in a
                        system like FRBR or BIBFRAME and our understandings of its
                        <q>itemness</q>.</p>
                    <p>When modeled as event-centric, these attributes and relations of an item are
                        directly affected by changing data models that demand updated software and
                        hardware with changing protocols and algorithms for the constant realizing
                        of items over time and across systems. For instance, as Jonathon Sterne
                        argues, <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#sterne2006">the transformations
                            effected by MP3 encoding are themselves heavily-directed cultural
                            practices. MP3s contain within them a whole philosophy of audition
                            [based on the limitations of human hearing] and a praxeology of
                            listening . . . [that] emphasizes distraction over attention and
                            exchange over use</quote>
                        <ptr target="#sterne2006" loc="828"/></cit>. Noting that the MP3 is a container
                        for an audio digital recording that has been compressed with the use of a
                        mathematical model that takes human auditory perception into account, Sterne
                        writes that the <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#sterne2006">most compelling
                            part of the MP3 is the psychoacoustic model encoded within it . . . It
                            preemptively discards data in the sound file that it anticipates the
                            body will discard later, resulting in a smaller file</quote>
                        <ptr target="#sterne2006" loc="833"/></cit>. Depending on what aspect of the sound
                        recording one seeks to address, therefore, the MP3, which is typically
                        categorized in traditional models such as FRBR as a derivative item of the
                        same manifestation, could be understood as actually realizing a different
                        event: one without the soundscape that exists beyond human hearing.</p>
                    <p>This notion of an event-centric indexicality can be made more broadly
                        applicable to all kinds of digital textuality. Michael Witmore has written
                        that <quote rend="inline" source="#witmore2010">a text is a text because
                            it is massively addressable at different levels of scale . . . one can
                            query a position within the text at a certain level of
                            abstraction</quote> such as a word or a line, but also on the level of a
                        theme or a character <ptr target="#witmore2010"/>. In a digital context in
                        which we are attempting to model textuality for discoverability and
                        analysis, a text can also be understood as massively and differently
                        addressable and therefore indexical according to how the protocols we design
                        in the system instantiate it at a given point and time. Consider Witmore’s
                        definition of text addressability in relation to Sterne’s description of the
                        MP3 and McGann’s <title rend="quotes">Rationale of Hypertext</title> in
                        which a central identifying feature of the hypertext is that <quote

                        <ptr target="#mcgann2001" loc="71"/></cit>. With such a text, Witmore’s levels of
                        abstraction are exponentially complicated by the digital text’s
                        complexities. The digital text can become differently discernible and
                        interpreted by different audiences with each different manifestation or code
                        performance. In web pages created <q>on the fly</q> with PHP (Hypertext
                        Preprocessor), for example, the same URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) or
                        URL (Uniform Resource Locator) could take a reader to a different textual
                        instantiation each time. As McGann reminds us, with hypertext, <cit><quote

                        materials) in that the technological context in which the text has been

                        in the item, it creates our understanding of the item’s

                <p>There is an aside in McGann’s <title rend="quotes">Rationale of Hypertext</title>
                    that almost goes unnoticed. In discussing the myriad extensibilities that
                    hypertext employs that <quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann2001">go beyond its
                        initial design,</quote> McGann writes, <cit><quote rend="inline"

                    <ptr target="#mcgann2001" loc="71"/></cit>. This conclusion concerns that
                        <q>someone</q> or, rather, the realities and practicalities of managing
                    computationally tractable as well as authentic and recognizable, texts in an
                    information system. Renear and Durbin, for example, note that FRBR is a
                    guideline for practice, an <quote rend="inline" source="#renear2007"
                        >extraordinarily promising and compelling...general ontology,</quote> which
                    never claims its entities <emph>are</emph> types — and thus, Renear and Durbin
                    concede, their argument for articulating them as <term>roles</term> could be
                    considered, at best, an academic exercise, and, at worst <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#renear2007">willfully obtuse</quote>
                    <ptr target="#renear2007"/>. Similarly, Van Malssen writes that the recommended
                    BIBFAME AV model is meant to be <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#vanmalssen2014"
                        >intuitive enough so a trained professional user is able to interpret it and
                        easily make decisions about how to apply it to a given content type</quote>
                    <ptr target="#vanmalssen2014" loc="25"/></cit>. The recommendations are an attempt to
                    suggest a model that is flexible enough to describe film and audio as well as
                    books in an effort to create practical guidelines or guidelines for real
                    information infrastructures that are managed by and used by real practitioners
                    and scholars. </p>
                <p>Yet, a concern for the ontological issues that shape information management
                    systems is increasingly important since widely used ontologies like FRBR and
                    BIBFRAME and semantics like the TEI often impact other practicalities such as
                    data interchange in Linked Data and the Semantic Web. For instance, projects
                    such as ARC (Advanced Research Consortium), which is the umbrella organization
                    for NINES, 18thCONNECT, ModNets and other communities who are trying to both
                    shape and facilitate digital scholarship in the humanities,<note>ARC is
                        described at <ref target="http://idhmc.tamu.edu/arcgrant/"

                    Description Framework) data models for Linked Data on the Dublin Core standards,
                    which are, in turn, heavily influenced by FRBR <ptr target="#chaudhri2009"/>. </p>
                <p>As such, this discussion serves as a provocation rather than a practical how-to.
                    I am noting here that digital humanities has a tradition of problematizing our
                    understanding of textuality through the design of information systems. I am also
                    suggesting that these efforts have been almost exclusively performed in the
                    context of rationales for verbal texts that still, in many (if not most) cases,
                    look like books or pages of books. Scholars within this tradition have an
                    opportunity to ask more questions and to create different, more encompassing
                    solutions within the context of designing systems for AV materials.</p>
                <p>To conclude, both the Council for Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and
                    the Library of Congress (LC) have issued reports detailing the dire state of
                    access and preservation with sound recordings. Both have called for <cit><quote

                    <ptr target="#loc2012" loc="15"/></cit> in order to help relieve backlogs of
                    undescribed (even though digitized) audio collections and to facilitate better
                    means for access and discovery. One of the results of these reports is an
                    urgency to re-evaluate how we develop metadata frameworks that facilitate access
                    to audio. One means of re-evaluation is a reconsideration of our rationales of
                    text. What if all entities were modeled as dynamic events? Would notions of
                    collective intentionality, emergence, and indexical performativity foreground
                    our searches and shape what we are able to find? Text is central to the
                    Humanities, but as the editor of this special issue notes, <q>digitization remediates all analog sources into a common
                        binary format,</q> a situation which serves as an invitation to think
                    through these remediations towards the development of future information systems
                    that will continue to shape new and different rationales of text.</p>
