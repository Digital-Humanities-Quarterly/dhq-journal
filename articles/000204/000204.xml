                     mental simulation of characters’ experiences in fictional narratives, virtual
                     worlds, or games – can change individuals’ self-concepts, attitudes, behaviors,
                     and emotions. He has investigated how such transformative experiences can build
                     interpersonal understanding and empathy, reduce stereotypes and prejudice, and
                     inspire higher levels of social consciousness.</p>

            <p>With the growing volume of user-generated classification systems arising from media
               tagging-based platforms (such as Flickr and Tumblr) and the advent of new
               crowdsourcing platforms for cultural heritage collections, determining the value and

               </cit> for libraries, museums and other cultural heritage organizations becomes
               increasingly essential. The present study builds on prior work investigating the
               value and accuracy of folksonomies by: (1) demonstrating the benefit of
               user-generated <soCalled>tags</soCalled> - or unregulated keywords typically meant
               for personal organizational purposes - for facilitating item retrieval and (2)
               assessing the accuracy of descriptive metadata generated via a game-based
               crowdsourcing application. In this study, participants (N = 16) were first tasked
               with finding a set of five images using a search index containing either a
               combination of folksonomic and controlled vocabulary metadata or only controlled
               vocabulary metadata. Data analysis revealed that participants in the folksonomic and
               controlled vocabulary search condition were, on average, six times faster to search
               for each image (<emph>M</emph> = 25.08 secs) compared to participants searching with
               access only to controlled vocabulary metadata (<emph>M</emph> = 154.1 secs), and
               successfully retrieved significantly more items overall. Following this search task,
               all participants were asked to provide descriptive metadata for nine digital objects
               by playing three separate single-player tagging games. Analysis showed that 88% of
               participant-provided tags were judged to be accurate, and that both tagging patterns
               and accuracy levels did not significantly differ between groups of professional
               librarians and participants outside of the Library Science field. These findings
               illustrate the value of folksonomies for enhancing item
                  <soCalled>findability,</soCalled> or the ease with which a patron can access
               materials, and the ability of librarians and general users alike to contribute valid,
               meaningful metadata. This could significantly impact the way libraries and other
               cultural heritage organizations conceptualize the tasks of searching and
               classification.</p>

            <p>Classification is a basic, integral and historically significant human function.
               Defined by Golder and Huberman as an act <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#golder2006">through which meaning emerges</quote>
                  <ptr target="#golder2006" loc="200"/>
               </cit>, the practice of classification represents one of the primary intellectual
               foundations of library and information sciences. Useful classification systems both
               accurately reflect the contents of a particular collection and allow for the
               effective and efficient retrieval of items or information. Given the subjective
               nature of human classification, examining meaning has no universal procedure. From
               the birth of the library science field until the late 1800s, during which the first
               edition of Dewey Decimal Classification was published in 1876, followed quickly by
               the Cutter Expansive Classification System and the introduction of Library of
               Congress Subject Headings <ptr target="#stone2000"/>, all libraries and centers of
               information each used an independent, unstandardized systems of organization,
               otherwise known as <soCalled>local
                  classification.</soCalled>
            </p>
            <p>With the rise of such classifications as Dewey, Cutter and LC Classification, local
               classification was mostly retired in the late 19th century in favor of a united
               system that would allow for understanding across all libraries. This was, of course,
               until the rise of Internet tagging-based platforms such as Flickr, Twitter, Tumblr,
               and Delicious presented a challenge to these standardized, centralized systems.
               Currently information professionals are facing an unprecedented amount of
               unstructured classification. Classification systems generated by such tagging-based
               platforms are referred to as <quote rend="inline" source="#folksonomy">folksonomy,</quote> or <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#folksonomy">a type of classification system for
                     online content, created by an individual user who tags information with freely
                     chosen keywords; also, the cooperation of a group of people to create such a
                     classification system</quote>
                  <ptr target="#folksonomy"/>
               </cit>.</p>
            <p>While folksonomies represented an increased diversity of classification, they were
               perceived mostly as sources of entertainment and documentations of casual
               colloquialisms rather than a formal system of documentation. However, in 2006 Golder
               and Huberman conducted a study of folksonomic data generated by users of the website
               Delicious demonstrating that user-provided tags not only formed in coherent groups,
               but also accurately described the basic elements of items that were tagged, such as
               the <soCalled>Who,</soCalled>
               <soCalled>What,</soCalled>
               <soCalled>Where,</soCalled>
               <soCalled>When,</soCalled>
               <soCalled>Why,</soCalled> and <soCalled>How</soCalled> of items, proving their
               ability to supplement formal records. </p>
            <p>Golder and Huberman’s analysis also revealed two highly subjective categories that
               may diminish the potential value of crowdsourced metadata: <q>Self Reference</q>
               (i.e., any tag including the word <q>my,</q> such as <q>mydocuments</q>) and <q>Task
                  Organizing</q> (i.e., tags denoting actions such as <q>readlater</q> or
                  <q>sendtomom</q>). In examining the overall accuracy and reliability of tags,
               Golder and Huberman concluded: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#golder2006">Because stable patterns emerge in tag
                     proportions, minority opinions can coexist alongside extremely popular ones
                     without disrupting the nearly stable consensus choices made by many
                     users</quote>
                  <ptr target="#golder2006" loc="199"/>
               </cit>. </p>
            <p>This research was expanded upon in 2007, when Noll and Meinel compared tags from
               websites Delicious and Google against author-created metadata and found that the
               former provided a more accurate representation of items’ overall content. Bischoff et
               al. [2009] also examined folksonomic metadata within the context of the music
               industry and found that tags submitted by users at the website Last.fm were
               comparable with professional metadata being produced at AllMusic.com. Syn and Spring
               [2009] examined folksonomic classifications within the domain of academic publishing,
               and also found authoritative metadata to be lacking when compared with its
               user-generated counterparts. As stated by Noll and Mienel, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#noll2007">tags provide additional information which
                     is not directly contained within a document. We therefore argue that
                     integrating tagging information can help to improve or augment document
                     classification and retrieval techniques and is worth further research.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#noll2007" loc="186"/>
               </cit>. Together, these studies indicate that folksonomies can easily and usefully be
               stored alongside classical, controlled vocabularies.</p>
            <p>While some may have reservations regarding the <soCalled>mixing</soCalled> of
               folksonomic and controlled vocabularies, these two classification systems need not be
               viewed as mutually exclusive. Both systems have inherent advantages as well as
               potential flaws. Controlled vocabularies are reliable and logically structured, but
               can be somewhat inaccessible to the casual user <ptr target="#maggio2009"/>.
               Furthermore, they can be time-consuming and expensive to produce and maintain. For
               example, if one’s local library employs two catalogers at an average salary of
               $58,960/year <ptr target="#ALA2008"/>, it sets aside $117,920 for implementing
               controlled vocabularies on a limited number of new collection items alone. In
               contrast, folksonomies represent a relatively quicker and more cost-effective
               alternative <ptr target="#syn2009"/>, with greater public appeal and accessibility,
               as evidenced by their overwhelming usage on social media. Mai noted: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#mai2011">Folksonomies have come about in part in
                     reaction to the perception that many classificatory structures represent an
                     outdated worldview, in part from the belief that since there is no single
                     purpose, goal or activity that unifies the universe of knowledge</quote>
                  <ptr target="#mai2011" loc="115"/>
               </cit>. As many users have become accustomed to the level of service and interaction
               styles offered by current popular search engines, traditional searches are <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#antell2008">unlikely to be very successful</quote> and are
               becoming <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#antell2008">less frequent as patrons’ behavior is

                  <ptr target="#antell2008" loc="76"/>
               </cit>. As researcher Heather Hedden points out, if an artifact <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#hedden2008">[in today's culture] if it cannot be
                     found, it may as well not exist</quote>

               </cit>. However, their lack of centralization renders folksonomies prone to issues of
               potential data contamination, such as an unorganized, unstructured plurality of
               subjects and the likelihood of data duplication between users. Regardless,
               folksonomies and traditional systems of organizations may be used in tandem to
               address the shortcomings of their respective features, allowing for a more diverse
               and organized form of classification. </p>
            <p>Our research aimed to provide new empirical evidence supporting the value of
               folksonomies by: (1) directly testing the benefits of adding user-generated
               folksonomic metadata to a search index and (2) comparing the range and accuracy of
               tags produced by library and information science professionals and non-professional
               users. The three main questions guiding this work were:</p>
            <list type="unordered">
               <item>RQ1: Will users exhibit reduced search times and greater hit rates when
                  retrieving images with a search index that includes folksonomic metadata
                  contributed by previous users? </item>
               <item>RQ2: Will general users and information science professionals differ in the
                  type and quality of metadata they provide in a free-form tagging game? </item>
               <item>RQ3: Will users only provide information useful to them (e.g., Self Reference
                  and Task Organization tags), or will they attempt to provide metadata that is
                  useful on a wider scale?</item>

            <head>2. Background and Overview of Present Research</head>
            <p>The present research employed a hybrid form of usability testing utilizing the
               Metadata Games platform [<ref target="http://www.metadatagames.org"
                  >http://www.metadatagames.org</ref>], an online, free and open-source suite of
               games supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and developed by
               Dartmouth College’s Tiltfactor Laboratory. The Metadata Games Project, launched in
               January 2014, aims to use games to help augment digital records by collecting
               metadata on image, audio, and film/video artifacts through gameplay <ptr
                  target="#flanagan2013"/>. Current Metadata Games media content partners include
               Dartmouth College’s Rauner Special Collections Library, the British Library, the
               Boston Public Library, the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute Library, UCLA,
               and Clemson University’s Open Parks Network. Inspired by other successful
               crowdsourcing efforts, the designers endeavored to create a diverse suite of games
               that could enable the public to engage with cultural heritage institutions and their
               digital collections, invite them to contribute knowledge to those collections, and
               set the stage for users to create and discover new connections among material within
               and across collections. The Metadata Games platform currently includes a palette of
               games that cater to a variety of player interests, including both single-player and
               multi-player games, competitive and cooperative games, and real-time and turn-based
               games, available for browsers and/or mobile devices. Despite their variety, all the
               games in the suite are united by a common purpose: to allow players to access media
               items from a number of cultural heritage institutions’ collections and provide them
               with the opportunity to contribute new metadata, in the form of single-word or
               short-phrase tags, within the context of an immersive, enjoyable game experience. The
               end result is that institutions benefit from increased engagement from a variety of
               users and acquire a wider array of data about their media collections. </p>
            <p>This research represents a collaborative project between the first author, who chose
               to use the Metadata Games platform as the focus for an independent study project at
               the Simmons College of Library and Information Sciences, and the co-authors from
               Dartmouth College’s Tiltfactor Laboratory. To be clear, the goal of the reported
               study was not to provide a validation of the Metadata Games platform, but rather to
               study the value of folksonomic metadata more generally; that is, the focus of this
               research was on the data itself, and the tool employed was intended to be largely
               incidental and peripheral to the study’s aims. At the time, the Metadata Games
               project was one of the few open-source metadata gathering tools available for
               cultural heritage institutions.<note> Other noteworthy examples include the
                  steve.museum, one of the first projects to crowdsource metadata in the cultural
                  heritage domain, which created an online web interface for registered users to
                  submit tags to a selection of works from participating museums [<ref
                     target="https://code.google.com/p/steve-museum/"
                     >https://code.google.com/p/steve-museum/</ref>]. In addition, in 2008, the
                  Library of Congress (LoC) used the photo-sharing service Flickr to gather comments
                  and tags on 3,000 images <ptr target="#springer2008"/>. From this project, the LoC
                  teamed with Flickr to form the Flickr Commons, a communal page for other cultural
                  heritage institutions with image collections [<ref
                     target="https://www.flickr.com/commons"
                  >https://www.flickr.com/commons</ref>].</note> Thus, while the reported study
               results <emph>are</emph> specific to datasets gathered by the Metadata Games
               platform, the conclusions drawn from this study are intended to be generalizable to
               any organization currently making use of services such as CrowdAsk, LibraryThing or
               Scripto or considering a crowdsourced metadata project.</p>

            <head>3. Methods</head>
            <p>According to Nielsen, the number of participants needed for a usability test to be
               considered statistically relevant is five <ptr target="#nielsen2012b"/>; however,
               because of the additional collection of quantitative data in our hybrid study,
               sixteen individuals (eight men and eight women; six of whom were aged 18-24, eight
               aged 25-44, one aged 45-60, and one over 60 years of age) were recruited to
               participate individually in 30-40 minute sessions. In order to discern any
               differential patterns of results between librarians and non-librarians, and to
               separate out any potential advantage that users in the field of Library and
               Information Sciences might have with content search and metadata generation, a mixed
               sample (with nine participants recruited from LIS-related fields and seven from
               non-LIS-related fields) was used for the study. </p>
            <p>The study was divided into two main tasks. In the first task, participants were
               presented with physical facsimiles of five images from the Leslie Jones Collection of
               the Boston Public Library and instructed to retrieve these items using the Metadata
               Games search platform. The images presented to participants were divided into the
               following categories: Places, People (Recognizable), People (Unidentified or
               Unrecognizable), Events/Actions, Miscellaneous Formats (Posters, Drawings,
               Manuscripts etc.), as seen in <ref target="#figure01">Figures 1-5</ref> below. Upon
               being given each physical facsimile, participants were timed from the moment they
               entered their first search term until the moment they clicked on the correct digital
               item retrieved from the Metadata Games search platform. This practice was adapted to
               reflect the digital items that would most commonly exist in a typical
               humanities-based collection, (i.e., photographs, manuscripts, postcards, glass plate
               negatives and other miscellanea). This design mirrored the common everyday occurrence
               of patrons attempting to retrieve a specific media item that they have in mind when
               using a library search index. According to a 2013 PEW Research Study, 82% of people
               that used the library in the last 12 months did so looking for a specific book, DVD
               or other resource <ptr target="#pew2013"/>. </p>
            <p>For this image search component of the study, participants were randomly assigned to
               one of two search index conditions: one with access to controlled vocabularies and
               folksonomic metadata (i.e., the <q>folksonomy condition</q>) and the other with
               restricted access only to controlled vocabularies (i.e., the <q>controlled vocabulary
                  condition</q>) [See <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref> for a schematic
               representation of the study design]. Searches were conducted using two different,
               customized versions of the search index on the Metadata Games website [<ref
                  target="play.metadatagames.org/search">play.metadatagames.org/search</ref>]. The
               folksonomic metadata was generated by previous users of the Metadata Games platform,
               whereas the controlled vocabularies attached to the items were generated by Boston
               Public Library staff. The process of inputting the controlled vocabularies into both
               versions of the search index required some reformatting. For example, because the
               version of the search platform used in the study did not allow for special characters
               such as the dash <q>-</q> or the comma <q>,</q>, terms such as <q>Boston Red Sox
                  (baseball team)</q> were imported as two individual tags: <q>Boston Red Sox</q>
               and <q>baseball team.</q>

            <p>Additionally, the system returned exact matches only, which meant that if a
               participant searched for <q>sailboat</q> and the only term present in the system was
                  <q>sailboats,</q> the search would be unsuccessful. This aspect of the study
               design was necessitated by the technical specifications and functionality of the
               version of the Metadata Games search index used in the study, rather than a strategic
               methodological choice. The frequency of preventable <soCalled>exact match</soCalled>
               retrieval failures is discussed below in Section 4.1.</p>
            <p>To further illustrate the differences between the two search index conditions,
               consider the case of a participant in each condition attempting to retrieve image 3
               (see <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> above). In the controlled vocabulary
               condition, the only search terms that would yield a successful retrieval were:
                  <q>harbors,</q>
               <q>sailboats,</q>
               <q>marblehead harbor</q> and <q>glass negatives.</q> In contrast, in the folksonomy
               condition, a participant would successfully retrieve this item by entering any of the
               following search terms: <q>harbor,</q>
               <q>sailboats,</q>
               <q>water,</q>
               <q>woman,</q>
               <q>sail boats,</q>
               <q>porch,</q>

               <q>glass negatives,</q>
               <q>sailboats on water</q> and <q>yacht.</q></p>
            <p>Immediately following the image search task, participants were instructed to play
               three different single-player tagging games from the Metadata Games suite: <title
                  rend="italic">Zen Tag</title>, <title rend="italic">NexTag</title>, and <title
                  rend="italic">Stupid Robot</title>. In the <soCalled>free-tagging</soCalled> game
                  <title rend="italic">Zen Tag</title> (<ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>),
               users are able to input as many tags as they wish for four separate images. <title
                  rend="italic">NexTag</title> (<ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>), uses the
               same game mechanic as <title rend="italic">Zen Tag</title>, but utilizes a more
               minimalist user interface and presents a more robust image to players. Finally, in
                  <title rend="italic">Stupid Robot</title> (<ref target="#figure09">Figure
               9</ref>), a novice robot asks users to help it learn new words by tagging images. The
               game presents one image to users and gives them two minutes to input tags, with the
               constraint that they may only enter one tag for each given word length (i.e., one
               four-letter word, one five-letter word, and so on). In playing a single session of
               each game, participants in the present study tagged the same nine images (four images
               each in <title rend="italic">Zen Tag </title>and <title rend="italic">NexTag
               </title>and one in <title rend="italic">Stupid Robot</title>). Tags from these three
               games were compiled and compared against the traditional metadata provided by staff
               from the Boston Public Library.</p>

               <head>3.1 Scoring</head>
               <p>Tags were scored by the lead author using a revised version of the Voorbij and
                  Kipp scale used by Thomas et al. <ptr target="#thomas2009"/>. This scale, which
                  was chosen due to its overall similarity to the Library of Congress Subject
                  Headings hierarchy, includes the following categories for scoring the level of
                  correspondence between a folksonomic tag and a tag included in the controlled
                  vocabulary for the same item: <list type="ordered">
                     <item>Exact match to controlled vocabulary</item>
                     <item>Synonyms</item>
                     <item>Broader terms</item>
                     <item>Narrower terms</item>
                     <item>Related terms</item>
                     <item>Terms with an undefined relationship</item>
                     <item>Terms that were not related at all</item>
                  </list></p>
               <p>A score of one was thus reserved for an exact match between a user-provided tag
                  and the professional metadata, including punctuation. To illustrate, consider the
                  sample image provided in <ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref> and the
                  corresponding professional and folksonomic metadata provided in <ref
                     target="#table01">Tables 1</ref> and <ref target="#table02">2</ref> below. With
                  this example, the user-provided term <q>Hindenburg Airship</q> would not be deemed
                  an exact match because, as indicated in Table 1, the controlled vocabulary term
                  encloses <q>Airship</q> in parentheses. Scores three through five were based on
                  judgments made by the Library of Congress in their subject heading hierarchy. For
                  example, <q>dog</q> would represent a broader term of the controlled vocabulary
                  term <q>Golden retriever,</q> whereas the tag <q>biology</q> would represent a
                  narrower term than the controlled vocabulary term <q>Science.</q> We reserved
                     <q>related terms</q> (a score of 5) for tags referring to objects or concepts
                  that were represented in the image but not expressed in the professional metadata.
                  A score of six was only to be awarded if, after research, the conclusion was made
                  that the term was unrelated to the image or any of the terms included in the
                  controlled vocabulary. A score of seven, though rare, was reserved for useless
                     <soCalled>junk</soCalled> tags, such as any term that was profane, explicit,
                  nonsensical or anything that would not qualify as useful to libraries (e.g.,
                  anything under the <q>Self Reference</q> or <q>Task Organization</q> classes
                  mentioned previously). </p>

               <head>4.1 Findability and Searching</head>
               <p><hi rend="bold"><emph>Search Time.</emph></hi> On average, participants in the
                  controlled vocabulary index condition took six times longer to search for each
                  image (<emph>M </emph>= 154.1 secs, <emph>SD </emph>= 98.84) compared to
                  participants in the combined index condition (<emph>M </emph>= 25.08 secs,
                     <emph>SD </emph>= 19.39) (see <ref target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref> below). A
                  one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) confirmed that this difference was a
                  statistically significant one, <emph>F </emph>(3, 15) = 3.94, <emph>p </emph>&lt;
                  .04. However, it is important to note that participants were free to ask to move
                  on at their discretion if they no longer wished to continue searching for an item.
                  Focusing exclusively on the search times associated with <emph>successfully</emph>
                  retrieved items in both conditions, an ANOVA confirmed that participants in the
                  controlled vocabulary condition still exhibited a significantly longer search time
                  per item (M = 111.36, SD = 89.24) compared to participants in the folksonomy
                  condition (M = 19.94, SD = 9.04), F (1, 12) = 8.51, <emph>p</emph> &lt; .014.</p>
               <p><hi rend="bold"><emph>Items Found.</emph>
                  </hi>Because participants were allowed to <soCalled>give up</soCalled> on finding
                  any particular item, each participant was assigned a numeric score from 0 to 5 to
                  represent the number of items they <emph>successfully</emph> found. A one-way
                  ANOVA showed that the average number of <soCalled>found items</soCalled> was
                  significantly higher in the folksonomy index condition (<emph>M </emph>= 4.88,
                     <emph>SD </emph>= .35) than in the controlled vocabulary index condition
                     (<emph>M </emph>= 1.38, <emph>SD </emph>= 1.06), <emph>F </emph>(1, 15) =
                  78.40, <emph>p </emph>&lt; .001 (see <ref target="#figure12">Figure 12</ref>
                  below).</p>
               <figure xml:id="figure11">

               <p>When taking the failed searches of the controlled vocabulary condition into
                  account, there were a total of 131 completely <soCalled>preventable</soCalled>
                  failures overall. Importantly, a majority of these failures were due to the entry
                  of folksonomic synonyms for tags that were included in the controlled vocabulary
                  index, which clearly demonstrates the value of folksonomies for improving search
                  effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, of the total 379 searches that
                  participants in the controlled vocabulary condition conducted, only a small
                  fraction of search failures (13 searches or 3.4%) were caused by the exact match
                  parameters set forth by the Metadata Games search system. Thus, the differential
                  levels of search time and item retrieval exhibited by participants in the two
                  search index conditions are primarily attributable to the specific tags that were
                  accessible in the two indexes – and not to the particular of the search system
                  used in the present study.</p>

               <p>Recall that all tags generated by participants in the gameplay portion of the
                  study were coded using the Voorbij and Kipp scales; <ref target="#figure13">Figure
                     13</ref> (below) depicts the breakdown of scores assigned to the 811 tags
                  generated by the participants.</p>

                  <graphic url="resources/images/figure13.png"/>
               </figure>
               <p>As shown above, a score of five (<q>related terms</q>) accounts for the largest
                  segment of recorded tags, meaning that 50% of all of the tags entered were valid
                  classifications not included in traditional metadata. This implies a fundamental
                  semantic gap between traditional classification and folksonomies.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>As illustrated in <ref target="#figure14">Figures 14</ref> and <ref
                     target="#figure15">15</ref> (above), the distribution of Voorbij and Kipp
                  scores was constant and nearly identical between the LIS and non-LIS subsamples.
                  This suggests that, when given the same instructions, both librarians and
                  non-librarians can and do produce the same types of useful, accurate data.
                  Additionally, a score of seven, for a so-called <soCalled>junk</soCalled> tag, was
                  equally rare in both subsamples’ data. By comparing every participant’s percentage
                  of exact matches and synonyms versus undefined and unrelated terms (<ref
                     target="#figure16">Figure 16</ref> below), it is clear that most participants
                  (88%) show an inclination towards folksonomic correctness. It is worth noting that
                  the two highest scoring participants were a horticulturalist between the ages of
                  18-25 (participant 16) and a librarian between the ages of 45-60 (participant 14). </p>

               <head>4.3 Best Subjects for Crowdsourcing</head>
               <p>Another concern for cultural heritage institutions is determining what media
                  subjects might work best to collect new metadata through crowdsourcing. As
                  previously mentioned, the images that participants tagged in the present study
                  were divided into five key subject groups (see <ref target="#figure17">Figure
                     17</ref>). </p>
               <figure xml:id="figure17">
                  <head>Average Search Time per Image Type (in seconds)</head>
                  <graphic url="resources/images/figure17.png"/>
               </figure>
               <p>Results revealed that the images garnering the highest number of unique tags were
                  those that fell into the categories People (Unrecognizable) and Miscellaneous
                  Formats (in this case, a digitized newspaper). The image that generated the fewest
                  tags was Image 4, a picture of Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, and Henry Ford.
                  Few people recognized the inventors and many simply input tags such as <q>old
                     men,</q> although it is important to note that several participants did express
                  some level of familiarity with the figures in the image (e.g., one participant
                  uttered, <q>I feel like I should know this.</q>). These results suggest that the
                  best subjects for crowdsourced metadata might be media items that requires no
                  prior knowledge. For example, the unrecognizable person and the digitized
                  newspaper were some of the only instances in which the intent of the photograph
                  was either completely subjective (unrecognizable person) or objectively stated
                  (digitized newspaper). Many other images of famous historical figures and events
                  simply caused the participants to become frustrated with their own lack of
                  knowledge. In light of this fact, crowdsourcing platforms may be well-advised to
                  provide users with the tools to perform their own research about the content of
                  the media to fill in any gaps in knowledge or recollection that they experience.
                  This is a challenge that Metadata Games has begun to address, with the addition of
                  a Wikipedia search bar to encourage users to research what they do not know about
                  a particular media item. </p>

            <head>5. Conclusions</head>
            <p>As of now, there remains debate about the comparative value of traditional and
               folksonomic metadata as organizational systems for today’s information needs.
               Nonetheless, there is growing recognition of the fact that folksonomies offer
               libraries with an ideal return-on-investment scenario <ptr target="#syn2009"/> with
               minimum cost (much of which can be off-set by digital humanities grants), maximum
               output of data <ptr target="#bischoff2009"/>
               <ptr target="#noll2007"/>, as well as the chance to increase community engagement
               with their patrons. As the findings of the present study demonstrate, folksonomic
               metadata, when used in tandem with traditional metadata, increases findability,
               corrects preventable search failures, and is by and large accurate. Furthermore, the
               data suggest that given the same tagging conditions, librarians and non-librarians
               produce a surprisingly similar distribution of useful metadata. Collectively, these
               findings point to the potential to change the way we search for and organize our most
               treasured media. </p>
