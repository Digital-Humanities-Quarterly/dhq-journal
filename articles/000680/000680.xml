               <ptr target="#hall2019" loc="p. 103"/>. This article takes up the work of these
               scholars in its investigation of the Neapolitan language on YouTube. According to
               UNESCO, the Neapolitan language is a vulnerable language because the number of
               speakers has been decreasing steadily in Southern Italy, forecasting the eventual
               extinction of the Southern Italian language. UNESCO’s categorization of Neapolitan as
                  <q>vulnerable</q> is problematic because it only accounts for speakers in Southern
               Italy and not in the Italian diaspora, which involves a physical relocation of
               Neapolitans to other parts of the world such as Australia and the United States. It
               is also problematic because it indicates that Italians either in Italy or in the
               diaspora may no longer want to speak Neapolitan. A Neapolitan digital diaspora,
               unaccounted for in UNESCO statistics, also exists on social media, which may include
               Neapolitans in Italy and abroad but also may include first-generation Italians,
               heritage-language speakers, and other-culture people fluent or familiar with the
               language. In this article, I explore how usages of Neapolitan-Italian language on
               YouTube might counter the linguistic and cultural subordination of Neapolitans.</p>

                     knowledge production has accelerated rapidly in the last few decades, the
                     exclusions and biases that have characterized print culture — products of
                     colonialism, racism, and patriarchy — have been reproduced in the digital
                     cultural record</quote>
                  <ptr target="#risam2019" loc="p. 139"/>. Risam’s work dovetails with such digital
                  humanities multilingualism scholars as Élika Ortega <ptr target="#ortega2014"/>
                  and Alexander Gil <ptr target="#gil2014"/>, who consider how technology intersects
                  with globalization and transnational cultural ecologies to explore why digital
                  scholarship, like most academic scholarship, is only sanctioned or recognized if
                  it is (a) either published in English or (b) produced by and from English-speaking
                  nations. In particular, Risam’s work echoes Southern Italian digital humanist,
                  Domenico Fiormente, who has repeatedly critiqued the cultural homogeneity of the
                  digital humanities (<ptr target="#fiormonte2012"/>; <ptr target="#fiormonte2021"
                  />). For Fiormonte: </p>
               <p>the Anglophone dominance of DH produces a series of negative effects: (1) [it]
                  prevents the construction of a genuinely democratic, supportive, and multilingual
                  international community (one of the hallmarks of the human and social sciences);
                  (2) [it] links institutional representation (mostly governed by Anglophones) with
                  the selection and management of tools and resources, hindering methodological and
                  epistemological pluralism; (3)...[it] changes the representation of research in
                  the field of DH and tends to project its own monolingual nature on the entire
                  discipline <ptr target="#fiormonte2021" loc="p. 348"/>.</p>
               <p>My work is a response to Fiormonte’s insistence that <quote rend="inline">the cost
                     of Anglophone monolingualism cannot be borne entirely by
                     non-Anglophones</quote>
                  <ptr target="#fiormonte2021" loc="p. 359"/> and to Risam’s call to digital
                  humanities scholars to use their training and skills to devise local practices
                  that <quote rend="inline">avoid a directional politics of knowledge that flows
                     from the top down</quote>
                  <ptr target="#risam2019" loc="p. 143"/>; I therefore attempt to unsettle
                  categories of difference to revise and expand the existing digital cultural
                  record.</p>
               <p>Much like digital humanities, Italian Studies has struggled with <quote
                     rend="inline">inclusivity and the representation of traditionally marginalized
                     voices</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hall2019" loc="p. 103"/>. Italian digital humanities projects to
                  date tend to reproduce or recover the dominant Italian cultural canon and even so,
                  there is <quote rend="inline">little in Italian Studies scholarship in major
                     digital humanities journals</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hall2019" loc="p. 109"/>. Crystal Hall explains that <quote
                     rend="inline">one of the most notable aspects of Italian digital humanities
                     from a North American perspective is the centrality of Dante in many prominent
                     DH projects</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hall2019" loc="pp. 98–99"/>. Digital humanities scholarship related
                  to Southern Italy is especially uncommon. Though projects such as <title
                     rend="italic">The Medieval Kingdom of Sicily Image Database</title>
                  <ptr target="#duke2022"/> illustrate promise for the future of Southern Italian
                  cultural recovery projects in the digital humanities, there is still much work to
                  be done to ensure that <quote rend="inline">the [Southern Italian] stories and
                     voices which have been underrepresented in both print and digital knowledge
                     production…[and] marginalized in their national contexts — can be heard</quote>
                  <ptr target="#risam2019" loc="p. 139"/>. My work is an effort to respond to this
                  lacuna in the field.</p>
               <p>Walter Mignolo explains that one’s locus of enunciation or place of speaking,
                  involves a recognition of how her personal histories, cultural backgrounds and
                  ideological commitments shape her current behaviors and perspectives <ptr
                     target="#mignolo2007"/>. My personal experience as a second generation
                  Neapolitan-American and as a Professor of inform this project. As a an immigrant
                  daughter, I have often felt like a <q>linguistic outsider</q> in both the Italian
                  and American culture. Through long periods of time spent in Naples, and as a
                  heritage language speaker in the K-16 system, I have experienced firsthand the
                  type of linguistic and cultural biases I see many students of color struggle with
                  as they try to negotiate their accented Englishes with the privileged <q>Standard
                     Englishes</q> of the academy. My position as researcher is informed by these
                  experiences, as is my argument for linguistic justice and a translingual ideology
                  that emphasizes all languages as emerging, fluid, and contextual. </p>
               <p>This project is also informed by statistics from UNESCO’s <title rend="quotes"
                     >Atlas of the World’s Languages In Danger</title>
                  <ptr target="#unesco2010"/> and, more recently, the Endangered Language Alliance’s
                  proclamation that <quote rend="inline">Neapolitan is considered vulnerable to
                     extinction due to the declining intergenerational transmission and overwhelming

                  postcolonial, the region of Naples was historically colonized by various feudal or
                  monarchical systems ending with the intra-colonization by the House of Savoy and
                  pursuant establishment of a northern, Piedmontese national government through the
                  project of Italian unification. Pasquale Verdicchio points out that <quote

                  by the Risorgimento, or movement for the unification and independence of Italy,
                  consisted of three interconnected elements: the perception of southerners as

                  was inexplicable to the northern masses; the colonial choice of post-Risorgimento
                  governments to move the potential conflict of the unemployed southern masses
                  further south, in order to dispossess other presumed inferior populations of their

                  regions from its Southern counterparts. Nicola De Blasi explains how linguistic
                  disenfranchisement followed political subjugation for Naples, though Neapolitan
                  was the most widely spread language (not dialect) in the pre-unification Kingdom
                  of Two Sicilies, and despite the fact that the use and global circulation of the

                     (Explicit),</title> and then on the comments that follow the video. I examine
                  the way the producers of the video harness the multimodal affordances of YouTube
                  (video, audio, transcription) to advance the language beyond Italian borders, but
                  also to consider how Neapolitans <quote rend="inline">wish to be portrayed as

                  Rather, people both create and are created by these environments. In this way
                  affordances are [also] socially constructed and change as people act on their
                  environment...for example, on Facebook the structure of the software creates

                  has important connections to the material conditions that govern the choices
                  Neapolitans make about language. These choices are embodied through bodily
                  gestures, intonations, and facial expressions. The affordances of YouTube
                  intersect with the <quote rend="inline">vulnerable</quote>
                  <ptr target="#unesco2010"/> Neapolitan language to illustrate the institutional
                  systems (political, economic, and social) that direct Italians toward a
                  determinate view of Neapolitans. This socio-political economy is often the content
                  or subject of Neapolitan representations or exchanges on social media platforms
                  such as YouTube.</p>
               <p>As political scientist Michael Warner notes, <quote rend="inline">The direction of
                     our glance can constitute our social world</quote>
                  <ptr target="#warner2005" loc="p. 89"/>. A Neapolitan YouTube video can
                  reconstitute the social world the Neapolitan language and people are from,
                  enabling counternarratives of Neapolitanità that resist the national
                  (geographically bound) imaginary of the region and its people. YouTube, a global
                  social media platform, moves Neapolitanitá beyond Naples and Italy to a place
                  where it can be consumed anywhere in the world, at any time of day, by Italians or
                  anyone else. The repeated, collective consumption of YouTube videos fosters
                  circulation and socialization about language and culture that were impossible
                  pre-Web 2.0. </p>
               <p>Jillian Cavanaugh’s analysis of the endangered Bergamasco Italian dialect on
                  YouTube identifies categories or types of videos that contain the language: (1)
                  videos taken from some other media source (usually television or film) and dubbed
                  into Bergamasco, transforming the content such that the speakers speak not only
                  Bergamasco, but <hi rend="italic">as </hi>Bergamasco; and (2) originally produced
                  videos with spoken (and sometimes written) language in Bergamasco <ptr
                     target="#cavanaugh2017" loc="p. 90"/>. The Neapolitan YouTube case study I
                  describe below falls into Cavanaugh’s two categories. It remakes or remixes an
                  originally produced film or video (Miley Cyrus’s original <title rend="quotes"
                     >Wrecking Ball</title> video) into a YouTube iteration that looks back at
                  particular cultural inheritances Neapolitans embody, hybridizing conventional
                  scripts of Neapolitan language and identity <hi rend="italic">in Italy.</hi> In
                  other words, the video below reimagines and revises dominant ideologies and
                  narratives of Neapolitans, particularly those that are emplaced in the national,
                  geographically bound context of Italy. </p>
               <p>YouTube’s digital, social, and paralinguistic affordances create a post-national
                  space where Neapolitan language and identity exceeds national or emplaced physical
                  and ideological boundaries. Through each YouTube post, like, dislike, comment, and
                  share — versions of the dialect can extend across objects (as hyperlinks, shares,
                  and, indirectly, other social media platforms) and others (as viewers, followers,
                  and content communities beyond YouTube) that may disrupt or even overturn the
                  language’s <q>definitely endangered</q> status and forge a post-national
                  Neapolitanità. Neapolitans use the affordances of YouTube to use translation as
                  transformation and <quote rend="inline">… think across languages, modalities, and
                     technologies, to transform and adapt [their language and culture] for various
                     audiences</quote>
                  <ptr target="#gonzales2018" loc="p. 24"/>. YouTube gives Neapolitan user/producers
                  an opportunity to affect <q>translation moments</q> that redefine the uses of
                  Neapolitan and what Italian nationalists have determined to be authentic Italian
                  linguistic and cultural capital. The same implications apply for other vulnerable
                  or endangered languages on YouTube, such as Bergamasco, Sicilian, and Nones, which
                  are other <q>minority</q> Italian languages. Such languages, formerly regarded as
                  emplaced and incapable of being useful or used beyond a specific national boundary
                  or location, that are presented on YouTube through videos such as the one I
                  describe below can challenge purist ideas of language, culture, and identity.
                  YouTube representations of these supposed minority languages and cultures enable
                  alternative perceptions and circulation for them, altering their positionality in
                  a national and global context. The way producers and users engage through specific
                  kinds of YouTube videos and other digital objects like them creates new linguistic
                  and cultural counternarratives that rupture users’ orientations toward nation as a
                  point of origin. Post-intercolonial, post-national conceptions of Neapolitanitá
                  become possible through the digital and communicative affordances of YouTube. </p>

                  Neapolitan, using specific language to affect Neapolitan identity. The YouTube

               <p>The FrankeCerrone YouTube channel’s many interviews, skits, and parodies are
                  comedic in nature, and hybridize and materialize Neapolitan language and culture.
                  More importantly, videos like the one discussed below represent Neapolitanitá in
                  new, translingual ways that exceed notions of cultural and linguistic purity and
                  create a post-regional, post-national Neapolitan identity — one that extends
                  beyond the physical location of Naples and defies the national disenfranchisement
                  of Neapolitans and creates a Neapolitan linguistic and cultural diaspora.
                  Neapolitan producers on YouTube exploit digital and social affordances to
                  circulate counternarratives that are often made invisible through the images of
                  Neapolitans circulated through Italian national media (and the digital cultural
                  record writ large).</p>

                  Neapolitan language and culture, but it also strategically repositions objects
                  traditionally associated with male or female gender and sexuality so that these
                  ideologies (in this case, Italian, patriarchal, heteronormative) also are
                  disrupted. The video particularly exemplifies the cultural and linguistic
                  potential for other minority, vulnerable, and/or endangered communities to push
                  back at emplaced, national, patriarchal narratives that restrict the uses and
                  experiences of their languages and communities. </p>
               <p>The repurposing of objects from Cyrus’s original <title rend="quotes">Wrecking
                     Ball</title> video in this one (e.g., blondish hair, blue eyes, clothing,
                  tears) recasts colonial, patriarchal depictions of working-class Neapolitan men
                  and pleads for a more egalitarian working landscape in Naples and the
                  transnational culture that reifies these biases. A blonde and blue eyed male is
                  much more typical of Northern Italy, therefore, superimposing Northern Italian
                  male characteristics onto a Neapolitan body (that hybridizes the female body of a

               <p>In one of the early images in the parody, the actor imitates Miley Cyrus hammering
                  away at the metaphorical pieces of her ended relationship. The irony in the
                  Neapolitan version is that the backdrop of the video signifies the real life and
                  career of a typical bricklayer or <foreign xml:lang="nap"
                     ><q>muratorr</q></foreign> as frustrated, overworked, and underpaid while Cyrus
                  is an affluent Western celebrity who probably has never picked up a sledgehammer
                  in her life except as a prop in her video. The words the actor sings in Neapolitan
                  are subtitled in English throughout the video, though not the standard English

                  other subtitles in the video co-signify to inform the meaning of this particular
                  segment, and also because the humorous depictions of the actor detract from the
                  awkward sounding <q>sheet.</q> The producers might also intend a double entendre
                  in this case where <q>sheet</q> could be interpreted as the lifeless, dull
                  sheetrock that is typically present on a construction job site as well as a

                  opportunities, compensation, benefits or social safety nets for many
                  under-educated, hard working manual laborers. The producers co-opt Cyrus’s theme
                  of lost-love desperation, with the actor singing his local version of despair in
                  the Neapolitan language, while his hair and clothing clearly imitate Cyrus’s in
                  the original <title rend="quotes">Wrecking Ball</title> video:</p>

               <p> frankEcerrone’s deliberate use of the objects of Cyrus’s video to co-signify with
                  the Neapolitan dialect and the narrative contained therein is pointed and also
                  satirical, which many of the comments (discussed later in the article) reflect
                  upon. Cyrus fetishizes the objects of working-class culture (in one part of the
                  video she licks the sledgehammer) to eroticize her performance of heartbreak and
                  lost love while the objects in her video — masonry tools, work boots, stark
                  drywall — are repurposed in Frank Cerrone's video to reshape the significance and
                  use of labor (emotional in Cyrus’s version but physical and emotional in
                  frankEcerrone’s) that Cyrus represents. </p>

                  typical, enjoyable Neapolitan snack (a sandwich is not considered a proper lunch
                  in Naples), becomes part of the soul crushing routine the bricklayer cannot escape
                  as part of his workday. This moment in the video reifies the lack of choice the

                  of profession, especially after 30 years (as stated in later lyrics), and the
                  feeling of entrapment that comes with that lack of choice. Unlike many white
                  collar professionals and business owners in Italy who have a long, sanctioned
                  midday break for a hot <q>pranzo</q> or lunch at home or a local restaurant, the
                     <q>murrator</q> is limited in the length of his work break (only 30 minutes as
                  later lyrics illustrate) and therefore, he is also limited in his selection of
                  lunch foods. Humor is strategically invoked as <quote rend="inline">performative

                  <ptr target="#lizarragaetal2015" loc="p. 14"/> in this part of the video because
                  the sandwich <q>disrupts</q> the rhetorical continuity of the bricklayer/work
                  related artifacts. The sandwich looks fresh, appetizing, and even enjoyable, so it
                  is therefore ironic that this too is repurposed to signify part of the
                  bricklayer’s burdensome life.</p>
               <p>As evidenced earlier, some subtitles of the parody are English translations that
                  do not always convert directly from the Neapolitan. The clip below illustrates
                  faulty translation as well, and is one of many in the video that illustrates
                     <quote rend="inline">translation as a multimodal practice…with critical

                  with the concrete rubble and somber turn in the sounds of the music to clarify,
                  and even amplify lyrics. Manual laborers may be hardworking and dedicated, but
                  particularly in Naples, they are exempt from the benefits of institutional labor
                  that is handsomely rewarded with social security, healthcare, and other employee
                  benefits in Italy (derived by taxes the institutional owners pay on behalf of the
                  employee to the state). The laborer who works 30 years without any of these
                  benefits is, indeed, broken. English and Neapolitan are strategically hybridized
                  in this digital artifact (the parody) to create a new, translanguaged <title

                  semiotic responses, there are certainly comments that reify stereotypes of
                  Neapolitans. In her analysis of northern Italian Bergamasco on YouTube, Jillian
                  Cavanaugh finds that: <quote rend="inline">these . . . videos [reflect] the
                     dominant Bergamasco language ideologies and social stereotypes, in which
                     Bergamasco is associated with maleness, a working class or peasant
                     socioeconomic position, roughness, straightforwardness, the value of hard work,
                     as well as deep connections to the past</quote>
                  <ptr target="#cavanaugh2017" loc="p. 93"/>. The language ideologies and social
                  stereotypes that Cavanaugh describes as tied to Bergamasco are typical
                  associations for Neapolitans and Neapolitanità as well. These associations are
                  depicted not only through the content of the video itself (e.g., the male actor,
                  the video’s theme evidenced by a working class socioeconomic position), but also
                  through the comment section. Some of the comments of this video reflect the
                  emplacement of the Neapolitan language and the Northern-Southern binary and divide
                  that exists in the national imaginary of Italy, also are reflected in the comments

                  <ptr target="#frankecerrone2013"/> by frankEcerrone, while others represent
                  metalinguistic and cultural analyses, often through intercultural dialogue.</p>
               <p>The potential for community building is a social and communicative affordance of
                  YouTube, one that has strong implications for the way languages and cultures are
                  perceived. This notion of community is partly illustrated through YouTube’s
                  digital affordance which enables producers to link their videos and channels to
                  other social media platforms and objects in order to increase their follower base.
                  The comment feature of YouTube is another space where users’ orientations toward
                  the video and one another foster community and reshape Neapolitanità. The comments
                  are one of the most visible and interactive social affordances of YouTube (unlike
                  the <q>share</q> and <q>like</q> buttons, which may be overlooked). The
                  interpretive frame of commenting expands social boundaries around the song and
                  performance, fostering engagement with the Neapolitan language and Neapolitanitá
                  (or Neapolitan identity) beyond Naples and Italy. The commenting feature of
                  YouTube is a social and communicative affordance of YouTube that <quote
                     rend="inline">disrupts codes of tacit social interaction</quote>
                  <ptr target="#humphreys2005" loc="p. 810"/> because commenters’ identities are
                  largely undisclosed, making their social interaction virtual and multimodal.
                  Therefore, viewers might be from Italy or Naples or from the Neapolitan and/or
                  Italian Diaspora, but they can also be from other parts of the world. </p>
               <p>Although one might make some assumptions about a user/viewer’s identity by
                  clicking on the commenter’s username and accessing their <title rend="quotes"
                     >About</title> page, YouTube users do not typically reveal detailed information
                  on this platform as they might on Facebook where aforementioned detailed personal
                  information categories are offered for producers to populate and Friends and
                  Followers to view. And, while YouTube viewers can also look at video producers’ or
                  commenters’ Home, Videos, Playlists, Community, and Channels tabs to garner more
                  detailed information about other commenters, these objects do not always indicate
                  clear cultural or other identity markers, and they may not serve to further a
                  connection among the viewers. This distanced communication is important in that it
                  differs from the tribalization often observed on gaming and other social media
                  sites <ptr target="#nakamura2002"/>. The global community fostered through
                  anonymity on YouTube here is more likely to ignore coercive cultural norms (though
                  these may include politeness and interaction), in favor of freedom of speech. It
                  is precisely this type of freedom that I argue may be necessary to reconstitute
                  Neapolitanitá in the national and global imaginary.</p>

               <p>Gonzales’s multimodal translation practice enables the producers and users of this
                  YouTube video to foreground the materiality of the Neapolitan language
                     <emph>and</emph> of the material, lived experiences of Neapolitans. Shankar and
                  Cavanaugh’s language and materiality theory explains that <quote rend="inline"
                     >looking at the linguistic and the material together is both a theoretical AND

                  <ptr target="#shankar_cavanaugh2012" loc="pp. 359–360"/>. Translingual theory
                  posits that <quote rend="inline">language is constantly in motion, [and] the words
                     that we use to describe specific concepts or ideas shift and transform with our

                  <ptr target="#gonzales2018" loc="p. 39"/>. Producers of multimedia, such as
                  frankEcerrone, have to <quote rend="inline">echo this flexibility and fluidity,

                  <ptr target="#gonzales2018" loc="p. 39"/>. Gonzales’s translation framework
                  carefully weighs the strategic communicative choices interlocutors make in a
                  specific context, such as the particular date and time users might access
                  frankEcerrone’s YouTube parody. Other semiotic/rhetorical choices that <title
                     rend="italic">A Revised Rhetoric of Translation</title> weighs include visual,
                  audio, gestural, and spatial decisions — choices that greatly impact the <quote
                     rend="inline">materiality of language</quote> that Shankar and Cavanaugh
                  discuss. In this example, YouTube’s communicative affordances enable a
                  post-national, postcolonial, translingual, transmodal dialogue through the
                  comments section that foregrounds linguistic and cultural materiality of
                  Neapolitans. </p>
               <p>The comment/reply section of this video spans from September 9, 2013 (the date the
                  video was first published) to March 29, 2022 (the date of access), with the most
                  recent comments posted on March 12, 2022. I used the data sorting features of
                  Google Sheets to categorize a total of 506 comments and replies. In their
                  research, Halpern and Gibbs have illustrated how users’ anonymity on YouTube
                  engenders less deliberation in the comment section and a stronger tendency to
                  share what comes to mind <ptr target="#halpern_gibbs2013"/>. My findings through
                  the 506 comment/reply thread illustrates a lack of deliberation in some places;
                  however, these findings also reflect a transnational, transmodal dialogue that
                  defies the fixed emplacement of the Neapolitan language and culture. The
                  comment/replies whose language I could decipher on this video are written in
                  Neapolitan, Italian, English, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Croatian and
                  Azerbaijani illustrating a number of YouTube viewers/users from beyond Italy and
                  beyond an Italian/Neapolitan diaspora. Most comments are translingual, reflecting
                  a combination of two or more languages (Neapolitan and Italian, Neapolitan and
                  English, etc.) or transmodal (reflecting words <emph>and</emph> emojis or other
                  non-alphabetic characters such as :\). Forty percent of the comment/replies simply
                  illustrate whether users like or dislike the video. However, a more interesting
                  facet of this YouTube comment dialogue is how translations of either the lyrics
                  the actor in the video uses or of the subtitles of the video <q>rupture</q> a
                  singular interpretation of the video, instead offering a co-created meaning of the
                  text, and subsequently, of Neapolitan language and identity. </p>
               <p>For example, user xLinkTijgerFan’s post reflects typical <q>translation
                     moments</q> in the comment/reply thread through the way they post their
                  question in Dutch first and then follow it with an English translation; they
                  receive a reply from an Italian user (Auroretta, whose YouTube <title
                     rend="italic">About</title> page only has Italian information), who opts to
                  reply in English, misspelling the word <q>language.</q> Interestingly, the
                  translingual dialogue reflects the translingual object or video as illustrated in
                  comment examples listed below. xLinkTijgerFan3 poses his metalinguistic question

               <p>The commenter in this case mixes the English word <q>like</q> with their Italian

               <p>Similarly, user/viewers use emojis to create affect that compliments alphabetic
                  text or as word substitutes, in some cases. For example, the post in Table 3
                  translates to <quote rend="inline">you’re a monster</quote> followed by two
                  laughing emojis that extend the meaning of the words in the comment to intend

               <p>In this comment by Vincenzo Desiderio, a person with an Italian name but whose
                  Italian identity cannot be verified (i.e., there is no info on his YouTube <title
                     rend="quotes">About</title> page), says the actor in the video is gay. Although
                  the comment may appear innocuous, it is prefaced by <q><foreign xml:lang="it"
                        >ciccio,</foreign></q> which can be used in a derogatory sense in Italian to
                  mean <q>chubby</q> or <q>fat</q> or simply a rude way to summon someone over (as
                  in saying <said>Yo!</said> vs. calling a person by name). However, in some
                  Northern Italian regions, <q><foreign xml:lang="it">ciccio,</foreign></q> is also
                  used as an endearing term among friends. Either way, the user comments on the
                  reconfiguration of male/female objects/portrayals in the video and comments on the
                  sexual identity of the actor in the video, move beyond the focus of the majority
                  of the comments which center on superficially liking or disliking the video.</p>
               <p>For example, of the 506 comments and replies analyzed regarding this video,
                  approximately 16% reflect metalinguistic commentary (language about language) and
                  16% reflect a social commentary fostered by the content of the video and either
                  connected to local, emplaced (Italian) issues or related to a <quote rend="inline"

                  <ptr target="#cavanaugh2017" loc="p. 95"/>. For example, a particularly long,
                  contentious comment/reply section (see Table 8) offer a metalinguistic and social
                  commentary that constructs and maintains provincial, national tensions that <quote

               <p>The comment/reply section begins with a question that many others in the comments

                  attitudes that have historically been linked to Southern Italians <ptr
                     target="#aprile2011"/>. The dialogue starts off contentious with Matteo Patrian
                  replying to Ferdinando YT that the Neapolitan dialect, is in fact, Arabic (or a

               <p>This overview of the comments illustrates the exciting mixed or translingual ways
                  people use Neapolitan and language in everyday settings, pushing back against
                  so-called pure ideologies of Neapolitan and/or Tuscan-Italian and simultaneously
                  countering emplaced notions of cultural identity. It also posits producers and
                  users of media such as YouTube as translators <quote rend="inline">constantly

                  and 9 also illustrate the concerning reality that for many, Neapolitan on YouTube
                  (and perhaps in other digital spaces) has not engendered new depictions of the
                  language or the culturally divided Italy in which it is used. </p>

                  discusses how people tend to tribalize with their own kind online, reifying the
                  same <q>-isms</q> and stereotypes that exist in physical realities <ptr
                     target="#nakamura2002"/>.<note>Nakamura is not the only cultural critic to
                     point out the replication of real-world -isms in digital environments, from
                     gaming spaces to coding infrastructures. See <ptr target="#mcluhan1995"/>, <ptr

                        target="#everett2009"/>, to name a few.</note> Although more research is
                  necessary to understand what the implications of a transcultural, translingual
                  presence can do for the circulation and preservation of a vulnerable language like
                  Neapolitan and for its attendant cultural ideologies, it is clear that the
                  emplaced ideologies surrounding this language and other minority languages is up
                  against some of the same barriers in social media spaces such as YouTube.</p>
               <p>My analysis illustrates that a translingual, post-colonial framework that
                  considers language and materiality offers a counternarrative analytic for
                  considering so called vulnerable or endangered languages and cultures on social

                  YouTube becomes an effective medium for illustrating translanguaged Neapolitan

                     <q>standard</q> Italian. YouTube’s affordances also offer culturally situated
                  translation moments that revise Neapolitan identity and construct new publics that

                  or endangered. </p>
               <p>The case study I have described here is intended as a call for other postcolonial
                  Italian digital humanities studies that are decidedly <quote rend="inline"
                     >non-Anglo</quote> (Fiormonte in <ptr target="#hall2019" loc="p. 98"/>), go

                  <ptr target="#hall2019" loc="p. 98"/>, and work to revise and expand the digital
                  cultural record to include linguistic and cultural preservation for
                     <q>minority</q> Italian cultures such as Neapolitan Italians, while honoring
                  the cultural specificities of those regions and their people. More importantly,
                  perhaps, this Neapolitan case study also illustrates how other minority and/or
                  colonized cultures might harness the affordances of social media such as YouTube
                  to express counternarratives of their languages and cultures that counter
                  emplaced, national narratives that have kept them silenced and subjugated. </p>
               <p>The case study I have detailed herein is homogeneous in that it represents a
                  male-created viewpoint of labor and inequity in Naples. Also, it is not clear by
                  my analysis who exactly the users of the page and site are (although the comments
                  analyzed are mostly in Italian or Neapolitan) or even how far reaching the
                  Neapolitan diaspora extends globally. Future studies that include a global mapping
                  of Neapolitan social media users/producers and that incorporate their voices
                  through ethnographic methods such as interviews would offer a more holistic,
                  participatory representation of a population that is consistently referred to as a
                        <q><foreign xml:lang="it">popolino</foreign></q> (small or lesser people) in
                  the national Italian imaginary. Still, this case offers a beginning interrogation
                  on how to potentially extend (perhaps even preserve) a statistically derived
                     <q>endangered</q> linguistic and cultural heritage beyond national boundaries,
                  illustrates how digital Neapolitan content communities on YouTube and, perhaps,
                  other social media platforms might work collectively against the socio-political
                  structures that have historically silenced Neapolitans, devalued their language,
                  and dismissed the cultural materiality that informs their lived experiences.
                  Neapolitan on YouTube offers a way for minority cultures (Italian and other) to
                  revise the historical and digital cultural record that has kept them on the
                  linguistic and material periphery of their national positionality.</p>
