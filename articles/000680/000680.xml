Similarly, Crystal Hall <hi rend="background(white)">points out that both the Digital Humanities and Italian Studies “have struggled with inclusivity and the representation for traditionally marginalized voices…[though] both fields offer tools and materials of study that can assist in [a] transformation” [Hall 2019, 103].</hi> This article takes up the work of these scholars in its investigation of the Neapolitan language on YouTube. According to UNESCO, the Neapolitan language is a vulnerable language because the number of speakers has been decreasing steadily in Southern Italy, forecasting the eventual extinction of the Southern Italian language. UNESCO’s categorization of Neapolitan as “vulnerable” is problematic because it only accounts for speakers in Southern Italy and not in the Italian diaspora, which involves a physical relocation of Neapolitans to other parts of the world such as Australia and the United States. It is also problematic because it indicates that Italians either in Italy or in the diaspora may no longer <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">want </hi>to speak Neapolitan. A Neapolitan digital diaspora, unaccounted for in UNESCO statistics, also exists on social media, which may include Neapolitans in Italy and abroad but also may include first-generation Italians, heritage-language speakers, and other-culture people fluent or familiar with the language. In this article, I explore how usages of Neapolitan-Italian language on YouTube might counter the linguistic and cultural subordination of Neapolitans.</p><div><head>An Interdisciplinary Perspective</head><p>This article is fueled by postcolonial digital humanities scholarship (a sub-strand of Disrupting DH)<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p> The <ref target="https://www.disruptingdh.com/"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Disrupting DH movement</hi></ref> has focused on remapping the discipline to include non-Anglo-American and historically marginalized scholars/ship.

My personal experience as a second generation Neapolitan-American and as a Professor of inform this project. As a an immigrant daughter, I have often felt like a “linguistic outsider” in both the Italian and American culture. Through long periods of time spent in a Naples, and as a heritage language speaker in the K-16 system, I have experienced firsthand the type of linguistic and cultural biases I see many students of color struggle with as they try to negotiate their accented Englishes with the privileged “Standard Englishes” of the academy. My position as researcher is informed by these experiences, as is my argument for linguistic justice and a translingual ideology that emphasizes all languages as emerging, fluid, and contextual. </p><p><hi rend="background(white)">This project is also informed by statistics from UNESCO’s “Atlas of the World’s Languages In Danger”</hi> [<hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">UNESCO 2010</hi>] <hi rend="background(white)" xml:space="preserve">and, more recently, the Endangered Language Alliance’s proclamation that “Neapolitan is considered vulnerable to extinction due to the declining intergenerational transmission and overwhelming power and prestige of Standard Italian.

My focus on Naples has cultural exigence as well. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city of Naples and much of its periphery have “retained the imprint of successive cultures that emerged in Europe and the Mediterranean basin,” making it one of the most unique linguistic and cultural centers in Europe. The evolution of the city dates back to the “Neapolis founded by Greek settlers in 470 B.C.” [<ref target="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/726/">UNESCO World Heritage Centre 2022</ref>] and has been described by Mediterranean scholars like Iain Chambers’s as follows: “a violent mixture of antiquated street rites and global design capitalism, Naples confronts us as a riddle. It's sphinx like qualities…disclose and unstable hubris dissected by different cultures and historical rhythms” [<ref target="https://www.dukeupress.edu/mediterranean-crossings"><seg rend="color(1155CC)">Chambers 73 2008</seg></ref>]. This article extends Chambers’ inquiry of the “riddle” that is Naples into the realm of social media. </p><p>Much like the concept of Italianitá or Italianness was constructed at the turn of the twentieth century in Italy through printed media as a way “to consolidate national unity in the face of emerging nations and nationalism in Europe” [Viola and Verheul 1 2019], this article anchors the word Neapolitanitá to illustrate how Neapolitanness, or Neapolitan identity is constructed, revised or perhaps, expanded by translingual representations on YouTube.

Though Naples may not be typically regarded as postcolonial, the region of Naples was historically colonized by various feudal or monarchical systems ending with the intra-colonization by the House of Savoy and pursuant establishment of a northern, Piedmontese national government through the project of Italian unification. Pasquale Verdicchio points out that “Italian identity was consciously built on the presumed racial alterity of southerners” [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/Revisioning-Italy-National-Identity-Publishing/dp/0816627266/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5LF6SWFVETKA&amp;keywords=revisioning+italy&amp;qid=1646866394&amp;sprefix=revisioning+italy%2Caps%2C59&amp;sr=8-1"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">in Allen and Russo 1997</hi></ref>, 191] while Antonio Gramsci’s <hi rend="italic">Prison Notebooks</hi> (dates?)(written between 1929-1935 by the philosopher, during his imprisonment from the Italian Fascist regime in power) explain that the unification project undertaken by the Risorgimento, or movement for the unification and independence of Italy, consisted of three interconnected elements: the perception of southerners as “biologically inferior beings”; the poverty of the southern masses that was inexplicable to the northern masses; the colonial choice of post-Risorgimento governments to move the potential conflict of the unemployed southern masses further south, in order to dispossess other presumed inferior populations of their own land and political autonomy [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/Prison-Notebooks-Volumes-Antonio-Gramsci/dp/023115755X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1IUNQAUXFPNTA&amp;keywords=Prison+Notebooks&amp;qid=1646866467&amp;sprefix=prison+notebooks%2Caps%2C51&amp;sr=8-1"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Gramsci 2011</hi></ref>, 429]. Naples’s political and cultural marginalization prevails: “Like many Mediterranean cities, Naples refers to itself and its local hinterland long before the nation-state appears in its sense of identity…Once a capital, Naples has become an eccentric city without an obvious compass. Seemingly robbed of its destiny, its trajectory has been blocked by a loss that is seemingly incapable of confronting and working out” [<ref target="https://www.dukeupress.edu/mediterranean-crossings">Chambers 76 2008</ref>]. The national and cultural imaginary of Southern Italians, particularly Neapolitans, as poor, uneducated and vulgar has persisted a century and a half since Italy became a nation, as evidenced by organizations such as the overtly anti-Southern political party, the Northern League, which advocates for economic and political autonomy of Northern regions from its Southern counterparts. Nicola De Blasi explains how linguistic disenfranchisement followed political subjugation for Naples, though Neapolitan was the most widely spread language (not dialect) in the pre-unification Kingdom of Two Sicilies, and despite the fact that the use and global circulation of the Neapolitan language in art, particularly music and opera is evident as early as the 18th century [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/Storia-linguistica-di-Napoli/dp/8843062514/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ARCJUZXD1BHU&amp;keywords=storia+linguistica+di+napoli&amp;qid=1646868407&amp;sprefix=storia+linguistica+di+napoli%2Caps%2C48&amp;sr=8-1"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">De Blasi 2012</hi></ref><hi rend="color(9900FF)">,</hi> 140] and persists in popularity today. </p><p><hi rend="background(white)" xml:space="preserve">Much like digital humanists, media communication scholars have also investigated the relationship between media and </hi>cultural identity<hi rend="background(white)" xml:space="preserve">.

This socio-political economy is often the content or subject of Neapolitan representations or exchanges on social media platforms such as YouTube.</p><p>As political scientist Michael Warner notes, “The direction of our glance can constitute our social world” (<ref target="https://benjamins.com/catalog/jlp.4.2.07war"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Warner 2005</hi></ref>, 89). A Neapolitan YouTube video can reconstitute the social world the Neapolitan language and people are from, enabling counternarratives of Neapolitanità that resist the national (geographically bound) imaginary of the region and its people. YouTube, a global social media platform, moves Neapolitanitá beyond Naples and Italy to a place where it can be consumed anywhere in the world, at any time of day, by Italians or anyone else. The repeated, collective consumption of YouTube videos fosters circulation and socialization about language and culture that were impossible pre-Web 2.0. </p><p>Jillian Cavanaugh’s analysis of the endangered Bergamasco Italian dialect on YouTube identifies categories or types of videos that contain the language: (1) videos taken from some other media source (usually television or film) and dubbed into Bergamasco, transforming the content such that the speakers speak not only Bergamasco, but <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">as </hi>Bergamasco; and (2) originally produced videos with spoken (and sometimes written) language in Bergamasco [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Anthropology-Contemporary-Critical-Readings/dp/0190253541"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC) background(white)">Cavanaugh in Brondo 2017</hi></ref><hi rend="background(white)" xml:space="preserve">, </hi>90]. The Neapolitan YouTube case study I describe below falls into Cavanaugh’s two categories. It remakes or remixes an originally produced film or video (Miley Cyrus’s original “Wrecking Ball” video) into a YouTube iteration that looks back at particular cultural inheritances Neapolitans embody, hybridizing conventional scripts of Neapolitan language and identity <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">in Italy. </hi>In other words, the video below reimagines and revises dominant ideologies and narratives of Neapolitans, particularly those that are emplaced in the national, geographically bound context of Italy. </p><p>YouTube’s digital, social, and paralinguistic affordances create a post-national space where Neapolitan language and identity exceeds national or emplaced physical and ideological boundaries. Through each YouTube post, like, dislike, comment, and share—versions of the dialect can extend across objects (as hyperlinks, shares, and, indirectly, other social media platforms) and others (as viewers, followers, and content communities beyond YouTube) that may disrupt or even overturn the language’s “definitely endangered” status and forge a post-national Neapolitanità. Neapolitans use the affordances of YouTube to use translation as transformation and “…think across languages, modalities, and technologies, to transform and adapt [their language and culture] for various audiences” [<ref target="https://www.press.umich.edu/9952377/sites_of_translation"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Gonzales 2018</hi></ref>, 24]. YouTube gives Neapolitan user/producers an opportunity to affect “translation moments” that redefine the uses of Neapolitan and what Italian nationalists have determined to be authentic Italian linguistic and cultural capital. The same implications apply for other vulnerable or endangered languages on YouTube, such as Bergamasco, Sicilian, and Nones, which are other “minority” Italian languages. Such languages, formerly regarded as emplaced and incapable of being useful or used beyond a specific national boundary or location, that are presented on YouTube through videos such as the one I describe below can challenge purist ideas of language, culture, and identity. YouTube representations of these supposed minority languages and cultures enable alternative perceptions and circulation for them, altering their positionality in a national and global context. The way producers and users engage through specific kinds of YouTube videos and other digital objects like them creates new linguistic and cultural counternarratives that rupture users’ orientations toward nation as a point of origin. Post-intercolonial, post-national conceptions of Neapolitanitá become possible through the digital and communicative affordances of YouTube. </p></div><div><head>Parodia Napoletana di Wrecking Ball and Remixing Neapolitanitá</head><p>“<ref target="https://youtu.be/R9bKmv2S9CE"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Miley Cyrus-Wrecking Ball-Parody (Explicit</hi></ref>)” is one case study of Neapolitanità on YouTube that can be classified into what compositionists have long called a remix [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U3O0TD6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Palmeri 2012</hi></ref>].

The meaning is clear however: a typical, enjoyable Neapolitan snack (a sandwich is not considered a proper lunch in Naples), becomes part of the soul crushing routine the bricklayer cannot escape as part of his workday. This moment in the video reifies the lack of choice the bricklayer or “murrator” has in his choice of profession, especially after 30 years (as stated in later lyrics), and the feeling of entrapment that comes with that lack of choice. Unlike many white collar professionals and business owners in Italy who have a long, sanctioned midday break for a hot “pranzo” or lunch at home or a local restaurant, the “murrator” is limited in the length of his work break (only 30 minutes as later lyrics illustrate) and therefore, he is also limited in his selection of lunch foods. Humor is strategically invoked as “performative complexity”[<ref target="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/55037624/Lizarraga_Hull_Scott_Transnational_Chapter-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1649876304&amp;Signature=PcpXdPo9mWTk-GOD76wFS0ToePHncbf-eiioon9DV~A82bEw1o7T58dIuSchcWjSm8EIWr71n8EtIW2iP44t2NeWzWWFMOD9elnPVahwrrcgNwfrUcXqH80lPu-Lv~eE9rDBj9m-L-9tT9~x1da9aZJKo44S1nok03Jjw5cA4ixW-eyuhkV0VMNDLUs2mjRBbFfaUbAcj9CkKA3DfQ9swQRDCTijWIpEvFtc-wwn-mY6E0W2thKYHLLwSBZDrxR1JBDkKB0z5vQ8yRDz3aPP-g5z-d3cEGdcKywc-yZ0dS563uX7uV8GiOKB5sy8GVQV6Wp~9f9O2gZ3Z2hWTah4tA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Lizárraga, et al. 2015</hi></ref>, 14] in this part of the video because the sandwich “disrupts” the rhetorical continuity of the bricklayer/work related artifacts. The sandwich looks fresh, appetizing, and even enjoyable, so it is therefore ironic that this too is repurposed to signify part of the bricklayer’s burdensome life.</p><p>As evidenced earlier, some subtitles of the parody are English translations that do not always convert directly from the Neapolitan. The clip below illustrates faulty translation as well, and is one of many in the video that illustrates “translation as a multimodal practice…with critical attention to how modes like visuals, sounds, and words work together to create meaning for various stakeholders” [<ref target="https://www.press.umich.edu/9952377/sites_of_translation"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Gonzales 2018</hi></ref>, 39-40]. The actor sings “numé paven’ e contributt” which translates directly to “they don’t pay my contributions,” a phrase that may not be clear to non-Italian viewers: </p><p style="text-align: center;"><ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9bKmv2S9CE"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">No Benefits or Healthcare</hi></ref></p><p>Though the subtitle “my boss even doesn’t pay my taxes” may be an imperfect translation in this case, the actors body language, coupled with the concrete rubble and somber turn in the sounds of the music to clarify, and even amplify lyrics. Manual laborers may be hardworking and dedicated, but particularly in Naples, they are exempt from the benefits of institutional labor that is handsomely rewarded with social security, healthcare, and other employee benefits in Italy (derived by taxes the institutional owners pay on behalf of the employee to the state). The laborer who works 30 years without any of these benefits is, indeed, broken. English and Neapolitan are strategically hybridized in this digital artifact (the parody) to create a new, translanguaged “Wrecking Ball” video, one that ironically <hi rend="italic">exceeds</hi> Cyrus’s 1.1 million video views by almost 130,000 viewers as of the date of my analysis. where Neapolitan’s presumably endangered dialect and English’s global lingua franca intersect across multiple modes to affect uptake between producers and viewers, commenters and repliers [<ref target="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suresh-Canagarajah/publication/279558643_Translanguaging_in_the_Classroom_Emerging_Issues_for_Research_and_Pedagogy/links/56310bc308ae3de9381cdc39/Translanguaging-in-the-Classroom-Emerging-Issues-for-Research-and-Pedagogy.pdf"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Canagarajah 2011</hi></ref>, 1].

In her analysis of northern Italian Bergamasco on YouTube, Jillian Cavanaugh finds that: “these . . . videos [reflect] the dominant Bergamasco language ideologies and social stereotypes, in which Bergamasco is associated with maleness, a working class or peasant socioeconomic position, roughness, straightforwardness, the value of hard work, as well as deep connections to the past'' [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Anthropology-Contemporary-Critical-Readings/dp/0190253541"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Cavanaugh in Brondo 2017</hi></ref>, 93]. The language ideologies and social stereotypes that Cavanaugh describes as tied to Bergamasco are typical associations for Neapolitans and Neapolitanità as well. These associations are depicted not only through the content of the video itself (e.g., the male actor, the video’s theme evidenced by a working class socioeconomic position), but also through the comment section. Some of the comments of this video reflect the emplacement of the Neapolitan language and the Northern-Southern binary and divide that exists in the national imaginary of Italy, also are reflected in the comments of “<ref target="https://youtu.be/R9bKmv2S9CE"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Miley Cyrus-Wrecking Ball-Parody (Explicit)</hi></ref>” by frankEcerrone, while others represent metalinguistic and cultural analyses, often through intercultural dialogue. </p><p>The potential for community building is a social and communicative affordance of YouTube, one that has strong implications for the way languages and cultures are perceived. This notion of community is partly illustrated through YouTube’s digital affordance which enables producers to link their videos and channels to other social media platforms and objects in order to increase their follower base<hi rend="color(7030A0)">.</hi> The comment feature of YouTube is another space where users’ orientations toward the video and one another foster community and reshape Neapolitanità. The comments are one of the most visible and interactive social affordances of YouTube (unlike the “share” and “like” buttons, which may be overlooked). The interpretive frame of commenting expands social boundaries around the song and performance, fostering engagement with the Neapolitan language and Neapolitanitá (or Neapolitan identity) beyond Naples and Italy. The commenting feature of YouTube is a social and communicative affordance of YouTube that “disrupts codes of tacit social interaction” [<ref target="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444805058164"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Humphreys 2005</hi></ref>, 810] because commenters’ identities are largely undisclosed, making their social interaction virtual and multimodal. Therefore, viewers might be from Italy or Naples or from the Neapolitan and/or Italian Diaspora, but they can also be from other parts of the world. </p><p>Although one might make some assumptions about a user/viewer’s identity by clicking on the commenter’s username and accessing their “About” page, YouTube users do not typically reveal detailed information on this platform as they might on Facebook where aforementioned detailed personal information categories are offered for producers to populate and Friends and Followers to view. And, while YouTube viewers can also look at video producers’ or commenters’ Home, Videos, Playlists, Community, and Channels tabs to garner more detailed information about other commenters, these objects do not always indicate clear cultural or other identity markers, and they may not serve to further a connection among the viewers. This distanced communication is important in that it differs from the tribalization often observed on gaming and other social media sites [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/Cybertypes-Race-Ethnicity-Identity-Internet/dp/0415938376"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Nakamura 2002</hi></ref>]. The global community fostered through anonymity on YouTube here is more likely to ignore coercive cultural norms (though these may include politeness and interaction), in favor of freedom of speech. It is precisely this type of freedom that I argue may be necessary to reconstitute Neapolitanitá in the national and global imaginary.</p><p>The comment section of the video is a cultural “contact zone” [<ref target="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25595469?casa_token=uNGr5fi69DcAAAAA:5Tgd1Cz4zBnc1qo8gxHyR1Bd7KnmrK9MI3BcKK9gT_DnklIm6-xmG8wlZsBLeaRvEqxdvfltANIObRZf1DTbJ7LIyMIZ0HbhmVljTuh35xFdWbDD00_S"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Pratt 1991</hi></ref>] which enables the translingual, transmodal “translation moments” for Neapolitans that I address in this case study.

Shankar and Cavanaugh’s language and materiality theory explains that “looking at the linguistic and the material together is both a theoretical AND methodological choice . . . that takes into account material AND linguistic labor” (<ref target="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58ee7095197aea0b0dab3405/t/58f5a6bbe3df2866a0706d20/1492494013709/Shankar+2012+Annual+Review+of+Anthropology+%28co-author+J.+Cavanaugh%29+copy.pdf"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Shankar and Cavanaugh 2012</hi></ref>, 359-360). Translingual theory posits that “language is constantly in motion, [and] the words that we use to describe specific concepts or ideas shift and transform with our cultural norms and practices” [<ref target="https://www.press.umich.edu/9952377/sites_of_translation"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Gonzales 2018</hi></ref>, 39]. Producers of multimedia, such as frankEcerrone, have to “echo this flexibility and fluidity, constantly changing their practices as languages and linguistic patterns evolve”[<ref target="https://www.press.umich.edu/9952377/sites_of_translation"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Gonzales 2018</hi></ref>, 39]. Gonzales’s translation framework carefully weighs the strategic communicative choices interlocutors make in a specific context, such as the particular date and time users might access <ref target="https://youtu.be/R9bKmv2S9CE"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)" xml:space="preserve">frankEcerrone’s </hi></ref>YouTube parody. Other semiotic/rhetorical choices that “A Revised Rhetoric of Translation” weighs include visual, audio, gestural, and spatial decisions—choices that greatly impact the “materiality of language” that Shankar and Cavanaugh discuss. In this example, YouTube’s communicative affordances enable a post-national, postcolonial, translingual, transmodal dialogue through the comments section that foregrounds linguistic and cultural materiality of Neapolitans. </p><p>The comment/reply section of this video spans from September 9, 2013 (the date the video was first published) to March 29, 2022 (the date of access), with the most recent comments posted on March 12, 2022. I used the data sorting features of Google Sheets to categorize a total of 506 comments and replies. In their research, Halpern and Gibbs have illustrated how users’ anonymity on YouTube engenders less deliberation in the comment section and a stronger tendency to share what comes to mind (2013). My findings through the 506 comment/reply thread illustrates a lack of deliberation in some places; however, these findings also reflect a transnational, transmodal dialogue that defies the fixed emplacement of the Neapolitan language and culture. The comment/replies whose language I could decipher on this video are written in Neapolitan, Italian, English, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Croatian and Azerbaijan illustrating a number of YouTube viewers/users from beyond Italy and beyond an Italian/Neapolitan diaspora. Most comments are translingual, reflecting a combination of two or more languages (Neapolitan &amp; Italian, Neapolitan &amp; English, etc.) or transmodal (reflecting words <hi rend="italic">and</hi> emojis or other non-alphabetic characters such as :\). Forty percent of the comment/replies simply illustrate whether users like or dislike the video. However, a more interesting facet of this YouTube comment dialogue is how translations of either the lyrics the actor in the video uses or of the subtitles of the video “rupture” a singular interpretation of the video, instead offering a co-created meaning of the text, and subsequently, of Neapolitan language and identity. </p><p>For example, user xLinkTijgerFan’s post reflects typical “translation moments” in the comment/reply thread through the way they post their question in Dutch first and then follow it with an English translation; they receive a reply from an Italian user (Auroretta, whose YouTube “About” page only has Italian information), who opts to reply in English, misspelling the word “language.” Interestingly, the translingual dialogue reflects the translingual object or video as illustrated in comment examples listed below. xLinkTijgerF<ref target="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzErbI7ObPnhV7vDmDB6HbA">an3</ref> poses his metalinguistic question in both Dutch <hi rend="italic">and</hi> English:</p><p>Example 1.

For example, the user psyco_F25 in Example 2 asks “Who, like me, was raised with this song? Like it if you are watching it in 2020” (my translation).</p><p>Example 2. Who grew up listening to this song?</p><p><ref target="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD_PdVA24vb7PGCD0_ImJ9w">psyco_F2</ref>: 5 months ago</p><p>Chi e come me che e cresciuto con questa canzone ? Like per chi lo vede nel 2020</p><p>The commenter in this case mixes the English word <hi rend="italic">like</hi> with their Italian words, translanguaging their request for fellow commenters to like their comment if they feel a shared experience with the song. </p><p>Similarly, user/viewers use emojis to create affect that compliments alphabetic text or as word substitutes, in some cases. For example, the post in Example 3 translates to “you’re a monster” followed by two laughing emojis that extend the meaning of the words in the comment to intend sarcasm or humor versus an intentional slur. In fact, “sij nu mostr” is a compliment in Neapolitan slang, indicating the recipient of the compliment is “huge” or “great.” The laughing emojis emphasize the humorous use of the word monster in this case:</p><p>Example 3. You’re a monster </p><p>Antonio Candia: 4 years ago</p><p>sij nu mostr😂😂</p><p>In Example 4, Stascema qui, posts: “At first it looks like German” with two laughing emojis indicating that the transcultural aspect of the video makes it humorous. </p><p>Example 4.

Without the emojis, this comment could have been interpreted otherwise. </p><p>Some non-Italian user/viewers announce their desire to see the video in their native tongue, such as TheDanySP3 whose post in Example 5 translates “Why don’t you translate it into Spanish?”</p><p>Example 5. Why don’t you translate it in Spanish?</p><p><ref target="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0mTbLlDt5VKQkBA0kBorGg">TheDanySP</ref>: 3 years ago Request for translation in Spanish</p><p>POR QUE NO LO TRADUCIERON AL ESPAÑOL &gt;:v</p><p>There is a trend in this short list of non-English users’ comments (evidenced by their names and, sometimes, the information available on their own YouTube “About” pages) written in English, which is unsurprising, as English is a global language (though problematically global per post-colonial theory), and therefore a cultural norm that is co-opted by the producer of the video through the subtitles intended to translate the Italian parody. Example 6 illustrates a Bulgarian name commenting in English.</p><p>Example 6. It’s cool parody! </p><p>Трикси Аллен: 3 years ago </p><p>It’s cool parody!</p><p>Language and identity are fodder for discussion in the comments, as evidenced by some of the examples above. Some comments respond to the gender-play the video is imbued with through the male iteration of the female Cyrus’s sexy performance, as shown in Example 7.</p><p>Example 7. Ciccio is gay</p><p><ref target="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZBn_YXjCMLqZVdvmqOR66w">vincenzo desiderio</ref>: 4 years ago</p><p>ciccio è gay </p><p>In this comment by Vincenzo Desiderio, a person with an Italian name but whose Italian identity cannot be verified (i.e., there is no info on his YouTube “About” page), says the actor in the video is gay. Although the comment may appear innocuous, it is prefaced by “ciccio,” which can be used in a derogatory sense in Italian to mean “chubby” or “fat” or simply a rude way to summon someone over (as in saying “Yo!” vs. calling a person by name). However, in some Northern Italian regions, “ciccio” is also used as an endearing term among friends. Either way, the user comments on the reconfiguration of male/female objects/portrayals in the video and comments on the sexual identity of the actor in the video, move beyond the focus of the majority of the comments which center on superficially liking or disliking the video.</p><p>For example, of the 506 comments and replies analyzed regarding this video, approximately 16% reflect metalinguistic commentary (language about language) and 16% reflect a social commentary fostered by the content of the video and either connected to local, emplaced (Italian) issues or related to a “shared moral community…[that is] non-geographical” [<ref target="https://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Anthropology-Contemporary-Critical-Readings/dp/0190253541"><hi rend="underline color(1155CC)">Cavanaugh in Brondo 2017</hi></ref>, 95].

Also, it is not clear by my analysis who exactly the users of the page and site are (although the comments analyzed are mostly in Italian or Neapolitan) or even how far reaching the Neapolitan diaspora extends globally. Future studies that include a global mapping of Neapolitan social media users/producers and that incorporate their voices through ethnographic methods such as interviews would offer a more holistic, participatory representation of a population that is consistently referred to as a “popolino” (small or lesser people) in the national Italian imaginary. Still, this case offers a beginning interrogation on how to potentially extend (perhaps even preserve) a statistically derived “endangered” linguistic and cultural heritage beyond national boundaries, illustrates how digital Neapolitan content communities on YouTube and, perhaps, other social media platforms might work collectively against the socio-political structures that have historically silenced Neapolitans, devalued their language, and dismissed the cultural materiality that informs their lived experiences. Neapolitan on YouTube offers a way for minority cultures (Italian and other) to revise the historical and digital cultural record that has kept them on the linguistic and material periphery of their national positionality.</p></div><div><head>Works Cited</head><p>Allen, Beverly, and Mary Russo. <hi rend="italic">Revisioning Italy: National Identity and Global Culture</hi>.
