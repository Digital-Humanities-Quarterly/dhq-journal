                  <p>It is difficult to discuss pre- and early post-European contact
                     life in the Caribbean. In part, this is due to the nature of European record
                     keeping, which often failed to fully capture Amerindian practices.
                     Archaeologists have long attempted to resolve these difficulties through the
                     analysis of early colonial Caribbean materials and objects that reflect both
                     Spanish and Amerindian influence. Through the use of computer modeling it is
                     possible to approach this issue from a new perspective, that of discerning
                     mainland–island or inter–island connections across the pre–Columbian and
                     historic divide. Modeling hypothetical canoe routes based on the location of
                     inhabited sites (between 1000 AD – 1550 AD) across Trinidad and the mainland
                     coast of South America towards the Windward Islands can help to explore possible
                     avenues of travel that were changed or interrupted during the early colonial
                     period. This paper will approach this debate by looking for the location of
                     early colonial Amerindian sites and determining if connections between them
                     would reflect use of European influenced areas in this region.

                        inicial en el Caribe. En parte, esto se debe a la naturaleza de los
                        registros europeos, que a menudo no lograron capturar completamente las
                        prácticas amerindias. Los arqueólogos han intentado durante mucho tiempo
                        resolver estas dificultades mediante el análisis de materiales y objetos del
                        Caribe provenientes del período colonial temprano que reflejan tanto la
                        influencia española como la amerindia. A través del uso o modelado por
                        computadora, es posible abordar este tema desde una nueva perspectiva, que
                        distingue las conexiones entre las islas y el continente o entre las islas a
                        través de la división precolombina e histórica. El modelado de las rutas
                        hipotéticas de canoas basadas en la desaparición o aparición de sitios entre
                        Trinidad y la costa continental de Sudamérica hacia las Islas de Barlovento
                        puede ayudar a explorar posibles vías de viaje que fueron cambiadas o
                        interrumpidas durante el período colonial temprano. Este artículo aborda
                        este debate explorando la ubicación de los primeros sitios amerindios
                        durante el período colonial temprano y determinando si las conexiones entre
                        ellos pudieran reflejar esfuerzos para evitar las áreas controladas por

                     early colonial encounters on Amerindian life in the Caribbean. Documents that
                     reference Amerindian practices provide insight into everything from foodstuffs
                     to the basics of canoe use or construction (ex. Benozi 1563; Columbus 1498;
                     Mendez 1933; Oviedo Valdes 1851). In turn, there are some detailed references to
                     the movement of these, and the people who used them, between different islands.
                     The specific routes by which these goods moved, and their alteration after the
                     arrival of Europeans, are unfortunately difficult to trace through text and
                     traditional archaeological analysis alone. Inconsistencies in the areas of
                     coastline surveyed, the small number of objects relating to seafaring tool kits
                     documented in the archaeological record, and the limited references concerning
                     the specifics of canoe use by Amerindians in the historical record make these
                     investigations challenging. Yet knowledge of the location of these pathways
                     would help us understand specifics about Amerindian connections and social
                     interactions not made explicit in the historical record.

                     into connections that developed long before Columbus’ arrival and continued as

                     traditional seafaring lines well into the 1700s. Contacts between Amerindian
                     peoples from South America and Europeans as referenced in early colonial

                     arrived in the Caribbean at the end of the 15th century, peoples from the north
                     coast of South America to the Windward Islands formed complex groups of

                     comes from the archaeological record, we also see support for these connections
                     in ethnohistoric accounts. The first written information about peoples from
                     Trinidad and Tobago appears in the logs of Columbus’ third voyage in 1498 <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#columbus1498">#columbus1498</a></span> (see also [<a class="ref" href="#boomert2016">Boomert 2016</a>, 61]).
                     Later writers reported on Spanish efforts to take over the Orinoco River area as
                     well as the islands off what today is the Venezuelan coast (Boomert 2016). Due
                     to their proximity to Amerindians, these early chroniclers were thus able to
                     view the comings and goings of seafarers between specific regions and islands,
                     accounts often document the location of prominent canoe travel corridors used by
                     Amerindians moving from the mainland to the Windward Islands and back. One of
                     the earliest records of such a voyage comes from Columbus on his first voyage,
                     where he mentions abducting a man mid-voyage between two points. Others also
                     have made note of these types of voyages. Raymond Breton wrote during his stay
                     on Dominica (1635): 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>They are descended from the people
                           of the mainland closest to the island… The friendship they maintain with
                           them and their commerce with them are signs of it. [Breton and la Paix

                     for Europeans meddling in Amerindian transportation routes from the time of
                     initial contact. Breton, in addition to mentioning voyages near Dominica,
                     recounted that South American Kaliña had branched out from their coasts to
                     colonize the islands [<a class="ref" href="#davis1990">Davis and Goodwin 1990</a>]. Others disagreed and considered
                     these connections between Island Carib peoples on St. Vincent at the period in
                     question were mere associations and not deeper ties, as suggested by de
                     Rochefort [<a class="ref" href="#davis1990">Davis and Goodwin 1990</a>]. Another example comes from reference to

                     examine seafaring routes. An isochrone method simply refers to a model that
                     evaluates movement over the generated environmental surface based on where an
                     “agent,” or individual, can move within a particular set
                     time (see [<a class="ref" href="#hagiwara1989">Hagiwara 1989</a>]

                     based on Hagiwara, where movement is calculated using a variant of Dijkstra's
                     algorithm. Specifically, I focused on the distance it is possible for a modeled
                     canoe to move from where the boat was launched within a set time period.
                     Although many possible directions of travel are evaluated, consecutive route
                     segments are chosen based on the direction of travel where the canoe can move
                     the furthest during the set time period [<a class="ref" href="#slayton2018">Slayton 2018</a>] derived

                     understanding of the environment or the anticipation of all possible routes.
                     This process is repeated until the landing point — in most cases a known
                     settlement area — is reached. These segments are then linked together to form a
                     continuous route that suggests where it would have been easiest for canoes to
                     travel between two points (see for example Figure 2).

                     Keeping with the theme of modeling hypothetical travel corridors taken by real

                     speed is reflective of the paddling power of those on board. Here, the canoe
                     speed was set at 3 knots (see also [<a class="ref" href="#slayton2018">Slayton 2018</a>]) or the typical

                     a particularly robust iteration period, i.e., the time intervals over which
                     environmental data is captured; new current or wind is data generated which
                     allows for the model to evaluate updated currents every three hours.
                     Additionally, the Amseas 3D program captures information every 3 km2, while the
                     GFS can only return information in 25 km segments. As a result, the tool
                     includes a function that allows for these surfaces to be interpolated, or
                     meshed, together. In this way current and wind are both reflected in the

                     ended by the time Europeans arrived in this region, it does support the link
                     between settlement use and the trajectory of routes returned by this model. The
                     strong connection between the suggested routes and active use by Amerindians
                     indicates that other modeled routes can stand in for past avenues of mobility.
                     We might also ask archaeologists to question why natural stopping points used in
                     earlier periods are not reestablished after European contact, as many sites or
                     areas are typically part of a habitation seasonal or cycle in the ceramic
                     age.

                     making contact with the Península de Paria. Peoples moving along more westerly
                     routes could potentially have made contact with the active mobility corridors
                     around coastal Venezuela. Pathways like these would also have brought peoples
                     from Trinidad and the Guianas into contact with Europeans who settled within
                     this region to gain access to pearl harvesting areas (see [<a class="ref" href="#boomert2016">Boomert 2016</a>]). The intensity of use of these routes thus may have
                     been altered due to this presence. This may explain why ceramics at sites like
                     Blanchisseus, inhabited or before conflict, show a change in this period.
                     However, it may also be that increased raiding activity in the region or
                     conflict between peoples on the west coast of Trinidad and the Venezuelan coast
                     linked to this avoidance, as well. Re-evaluating routes within this mobility
                     corridor, from the coast of Venezuela towards the Windward Islands, needs to be
                     done alongside considerations of materials found within the sites used as origin
                     points needs to be done. It may help researchers to understand better if or when
                     peoples traveled from the Guianas to the north coast of Trinidad post AD

                     Guyana’s coast show movement past Tobago comports with the multiple references
                     in the historical record that point to the island’s importance to Amerindian
                     peoples as a waypoint for travel between the Windward Islands and the mainland.
                     These references make note of altercations between Amerindians and Europeans,
                     where the former was perhaps intimidating the others who were populating Tobago
                     [<a class="ref" href="#boomert2002">Boomert 2002</a>]. Efforts to keep the island clear may have been
                     linked to its prominence as a waypoint, with the need to protect travel
                     corridors between Windward Islands settlements and the mainland
                     “homeland” communities. That Tobago is referred to

                     further highlights the island’s significance.

                     protect Tobago, and its lack of European settlement until the late eighteenth
                     century, indicates that these corridors of movement may have been only partially
                     disrupted by Spanish settlement on islands off the Venezuela coast. Even the
                     east coast of Trinidad remained relatively free of European influence,
                     protecting through lines of traffic from disruption. As such, it is likely that
                     only towards the eighteenth century did these routes truly suffer the full

                     is a vital addition to traditional modes of analysis of Amerindian mobility

                     archaeological record. The fact that the possible location of these corridors in
                     some cases lie close to known archaeological sites from this period support some
                     preliminary theories as to the underlying process of movement between these
                     groups. However, to what extent Europeans encountered Amerindian peoples, and
                     vice versa, cannot be learned through modeling alone. These modeled routes can
                     only be discussed as a reflection of the singular least–cost path between two
                     areas rather than as corridors reactive to social stressors. Further examination
                     of textual resources, archaeological sites, and additional modelled routes needs
                     to be conducted in order to determine if shifts in Amerindian population areas
