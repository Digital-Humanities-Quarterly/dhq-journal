         <dhq:abstract>
            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>Lots of approaches for automated video analysis have been suggested since the
               1990ies, which have the potential to support quantitative and qualitative analysis in
               film studies. However, software solutions for the scholarly study of film that
               utilise video analysis algorithms are still relatively rare. In this paper, we aim to
               provide an overview of related work in this field, review current developments in
               computer vision, compare machine and human performance for some visual recognition
               tasks, and outline the requirements for video analysis software that would optimally
               support scholars of film studies.</p>

         <div xml:id="section01">
            <head>1 Introduction</head>
            <p>In contrast to the field of computer-assisted research in the arts that has been
               established for several years <ptr target="#anitha2013"/>
               <ptr target="#johnson2008"/>
               <ptr target="#klein2014"/>
               <ptr target="#resig2014"/>, there is a need to catch up in scientific approaches to
               film (represented in the fields of New Film History and Stylometry). An important
               reason is the lack of practical software solutions available to date and the
               incompatibility of quantitative research designs with existing methodologies for film
               studies. In this context, some researchers criticise above all the appropriation of a
               technicistic, unrelated mission statement, which advocates of digital humanities
               apply to their own subject following other principles <ptr target="#liu2012"/>
               <ptr target="#missomelius2014"/>. However, more recent research <ptr
                  target="#heftberger2016"/>
               <ptr target="#sittel2017"/> has shown that qualitative and quantitative analysis are
               by no means mutually exclusive, but can be integrated in order to enrich film studies
               with new impulses.</p>
            <p>The statistical film analysis developed by the physicist Salt thus holds the
               potential of a methodological guideline for quantifying filmic characteristics <ptr
                  target="#salt2006"/>
               <ptr target="#salt2009"/>. This methodology focuses on quantifiable factors in the
               formal structure of a film such as camera shot length, which is considered an
               objective unit because it can be measured over time. The various forms of camera
               usage and movement (such as tracking shots, pans and tilts, camera distance, i.e.,
               shot size) as well as other techniques (such as zoom-in and -out or the use of a
               camera crane) are also relevant for quantification. Casting this set of techniques as
               measuring instruments, it is possible to obtain data that scientists can relate to
               verifiable criteria in terms of film production history and to formulate hypotheses
               that allow conclusions to be drawn about the formal stylistic development of the
               selected films. To this end, Salt's concept allows for complete traceability of the
               measurement results and thus also of the numerical values to a theory set.</p>
            <p>The concept was criticized for its reductionism <ptr target="#fluckiger2011"/>, which
               prevents it from being connected to the qualitative research methods that dominate
               film studies. However, research in digital humanities has shown that quantitative
               parameters such as shot length are a suitable foundation for various analytical tools
               when it comes to the qualitative investigation of data (<ref target="#tsivian2008"
                  >Tsivian 2008</ref>; <ref target="#buckland2009">Buckland 2009</ref>; many
               others). In this way, quantitative research according to Salt makes it possible to
               validate stylistic changes in the work of emigrated European directors due to
               technical opportunities of the American studio system, or even to collect the average
               shot lengths of numerous productions from the beginning of film history to the
               present. Such research allows researchers to draw conclusions about the progressive
               acceleration of editing and thus provides information about the development of film
               technology and changes in our viewing habits. These questions concerning stylistic
               research in film studies cannot be examined without a corresponding quantitative
               research design, although Salt's concept remains too inflexible for broader
               application.</p>
            <p>In this context, <ref target="#korte2010">Korte's work (2010)</ref> is regarded as
               pioneering (especially in German-speaking countries) in transferring quantitative
               methods into the framework of a qualitative analysis immanent in the work. An example
               for this is Rodenberg's analysis of Zabriskie Point (directed by Michelangelo
               Antonioni, 1970) in Korte's introduction to systematic film analysis (2010), which
               graphically depicts the stylistic structure of the film in an innovative way. Thus,
               for a detailed analysis Rodenberg visualises the adaption and alignment of editing
               rhythms to the characterisations of the persons in the narrative, and makes the
               alignment of music and narration comprehensible using diagrams. <ref
                  target="#heftberger2016">Heftberger (2016)</ref>, for example, combines the
               analysis of historical sources such as editing diagrams and tables by the Russian
               director Vertov with computer-aided representations of digital humanities in order to
               provide insights into the filmmaker's working methods. Heftberger starts with copies
               of Vertov's films, which were analysed for structural features using the annotation
               software ANVIL <ptr target="#kipp2001"/>, but also for dissolves or condition-related
               factors (e.g. markings in the film rolls or damage to the film). Within the framework
               of single and overall analyses, the data serve to elucidate the director’s
               intentions.</p>

            </figure>
            <p><ref target="#sittel2016">Sittel (2016)</ref> investigated the principle of increase
               and decrease of shot lengths in Michelangelo Antonioni’s <title rend="italic">Blow
                  Up</title> (1966). The visualization in Figure 1 was created during this study
               with the video analysis software Videana <ptr target="#ewerth2009"/> and gives an
               insight into this pattern. This technique, which is increasingly used in film
               editing, represents a structuring feature of the second half of the film and can be
               interpreted as a message with regard to the film content. </p>

               <head>Average shot length of all Antonioni films in chronological order.</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Using Salt's paradigm as a guideline, an analysis of all Antonioni films makes it
               possible to identify a clear change in style based on shot sizes and camera
               movements, which extends existing, non-qualitative approaches in a differentiated
               way. Figure 2 shows that the average shot length becomes shorter across nearly all
               films. To this end, a principle of systematic camera movement (longer shots) and thus
               an abandonment of montage gradually gives way to the increasing use of editing.</p>
            <p>Research efforts like this benefit from automated computer-based methods that measure
               basic features of filmic structure. Similar to former work <ptr target="#estrada2017"
               />, we present a comprehensive survey of related software tools for video annotation,
               but particularly focus on methods for visual content analysis for film studies.
               First, we examine major software tools for video analysis with a focus on automated
               analysis algorithms and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. In addition, related
               work that applies automated video analysis to film studies is discussed. Moreover, we
               summarise current progress in computer vision and visual content analysis with a
               focus on deep learning methods. Besides, a comparison of machine vs. human
               performance in annotation tasks that are relevant for video content analysis is
               provided. Finally, we discuss future desirable functionalities for automated analysis
               in software tools for film studies.</p>

            <head>2 Software Tools and Algorithms for Quantitative Film Studies </head>
            <p>Researchers who want to utilise quantitative strategies to analyse film as presented
               in Figure 1 and 2 usually have to evaluate larger films or video corpora. However,
               existing software tools so far, with a few exceptions, require a high degree of
               manual annotation. As a consequence, many current film productions are difficult to
               evaluate due to ever shorter shot lengths. This section provides an overview of
               software solutions for film studies and their degree of automation in terms of
               capturing basic filmic features. While there are numerous existing annotation and
               video analysis tools, the focus lies on ready-to-use software applications most
               suitable for quantitative film studies. An overview of the functionalities provided
               by the selected applications and their current status of availability is presented in
               Table 1. We also distinguish between application areas in Table 1, since not all of
               the tools were originally proposed for scholarly film studies as targeted here. </p>

               <p>In the Cinemetrics project <ptr target="#tsivian2009"/>, Yuri and Gunnar Tsivian
                  took up Salt’s methodology and used it for the first time as conceptual guidelines
                  for the implementation of digital analytical instruments, which are freely
                  available as a Web-based platform since 2005.<note><ref
                        target="http://www.cinemetrics.lv/">http://www.cinemetrics.lv/</ref></note>
                  The tool allows the user to synchronously view and annotate video material, or to
                  systematically comb through AVI video files. In the advanced mode, customized
                  annotation criteria can be defined in addition to basic features (e.g. frequency
                  and length of shots). The data sets obtained are then collected within an online
                  database according to the principle of crowdsourcing. With metadata for more than
                  50,000 films to date, it acts as a comprehensive research data archive that
                  documents the development and history of film style. Cinemetrics is the only
                  platform based on Web 2.0 principles that consistently aggregates film data and
                  makes it publicly accessible. However, the analysis of film data is not
                  systematic. Moreover, Cinemetrics relies exclusively on the manual acquisition of
                  data such as shot changes, camera distances, or camera movements. The accurate
                  evaluation of video material such as feature films therefore requires an effort of
                  several hours and is unsuitable for broader studies. Nonetheless, the platform
                  enjoys a high level of visitor traffic. Between 2010 and 2013, the number of users
                  almost doubled (2010: 4,500 clicks per day, 2013: 8,326). The program is regularly
                  used in seminars at the Universities of Chicago, Amsterdam, Taiwan and at the
                  Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz.</p>

                  <ptr target="#sloetjes2008"/> are visual annotation tools, which were originally
                  designed for psycholinguistics and gesture research. They are suitable for the
                  differentiated graphical representation of editing rhythms or for the annotation
                  of previously defined structural features at the shot and sequence level, though
                  it usually requires the export of the data to another statistical software or
                  Microsoft Excel. In contrast to Cinemetrics, ANVIL and ELAN allow the user to
                  directly interact with the video material. They offer a much greater
                  methodological scope, especially through the option of adding several feature
                  dimensions to the video material in the form of tracks. Both systems work
                  according to a similar principle, to which the video segments or the collected
                  shots can be viewed and annotated with metadata. Annotations can also be arranged
                  hierarchically by means of multiple layers which are called tiers. Thus,
                  annotations can be cross-referenced to other annotations or to corresponding shots
                  or video segments, making the programs particularly suitable for a fine-grained
                  analysis of the structure of individual works. However, if several parameters are
                  to be recorded during an evaluation run, repeated viewing of a film is required in
                  order to label the individual tracks with the respective characteristics and
                  features.</p>

                  developed between 2007 and 2011 by the Institut de recherche et d’innovation du
                  Centre Pompidou. The tool provides a graphical timeline-based representation of
                  the material and allows for selecting temporal segments in order to annotate
                  different types of modality (video, audio, text) of the corresponding sequence in
                  the movie, or add information in the form of images or external links. Moreover,
                  it is possible to generate colour-coded annotations aligned with the shots by
                  choosing from a range of available RGB colour values. This function can be
                  implicitly used for colour analysis. However, a single colour cannot represent a
                  holistic image or even an entire shot. Ligne de temps enables the automated
                  detection of shot boundaries in the video, as only few of the presented tools do.
                  But there is no information available about the algorithm used and its performance
                  on benchmark data sets.</p>

                  is an ongoing project for the annotation of digital videos that also provides a
                  format to share annotations. The tool has been developed since 2002 and is freely
                  available as a cross-platform desktop application.<note><ref
                        target="https://www.advene.org">www.advene.org</ref></note> It provides a
                  broader number of functionalities compared with the former tools. In particular,
                  the tool enables textual as well as graphical annotations to augment the video and
                  also provides automatically generated thumbnails for each shot. Moreover, it is
                  possible to edit and visualise hypervideos consisting of both the annotations and
                  the video. Target groups are film scholars, teachers and students who want to
                  exchange multimedia comments and analyses about videos such as movies,
                  conferences, or courses. The tool has also been used for reflexive interviews of
                  museum visitors, or with regard to on-demand video providers and movie-related
                  social networks. However, the automatic analysis options that Advene provides are
                  restricted to shot boundary detection and temporal segmentation of audio tracks. </p>

                  primarily serves as a platform for collaboratively working and sharing annotations
                  for multimedia and is therefore actively used in classroom environments at various
                  universities, also including courses on film studies. However, it does not provide
                  automated analysis capabilities such as shot detection. In addition, film studies
                  researches wanting to use the web application need a certain degree of expertise
                  to individually deploy the openly available source code. </p>

               <head>2.5 Videana</head>
               <p>The video analysis software Videana was developed at the University of Marburg
                     <ptr target="#ewerth2009"/>. Videana is one of the few software tools to offer
                  more than simple analysis functions such as the detection of shot changes <ptr
                     target="#ewerth2004b"/>
                  <ptr target="#ewerth2009a"/>. For example, the software integrates algorithms for
                  text detection <ptr target="#gllavata2004a"/>, video OCR <ptr
                     target="#gllavata2004b"/>, estimation of camera motion <ptr
                     target="#ewerth2004a"/> and of object motion <ptr target="#ewerth2007a"/>, and
                  face detection <ptr target="#viola2004"/>. Further functionalities, which are
                  however not part of the standard version, are the recognition of dominant colour
                  values, person recognition and indexing <ptr target="#ewerth2007b"/>, or the
                  temporal segmentation of the soundtrack. The many available features and the
                  possibility to combine them allow for the flexible formulation of complex research
                  hypotheses and their empirical verification. For example, Videana was used for a
                  media study to investigate user behaviour in Google Earth Tours <ptr
                     target="#abend2011"/>
                  <ptr target="#abend2012"/>. However, the software has not been updated since 2012
                  and therefore does not rely on current state-of-the-art methods in video analysis.
                  Another drawback of the tool is the lack of enhanced visualizations that go beyond
                  simple cut frequency diagrams and event timelines. Finally, the software is not
                  usable through a Web browser, but only available as a desktop software.</p>

                     Technology and Aesthetics</title><note><ref target="https://filmcolors.org/"
                        >https://filmcolors.org/</ref></note> at the University of Zurich, the tool
                  VIAN <ptr target="#fluckiger2017"/> for video analysis and annotation is currently
                  being developed with a focus on film colour patterns. In comparison to
                  general-purpose annotation tools like ELAN, VIAN particularly addresses aesthetic
                  analyses of full feature films. The tool is also planned to allow a variety of
                  (semi)-automatic tools for the analysis and visualisation of film colours based on
                  computer vision and deep learning methods such as figure-ground separation and
                  extraction of the corresponding colour schemes. Although the tool is not released
                  yet (announced to be open source), VIAN seems to be a very promising tool with
                  regard to state-of-the-art visual content analysis methods.</p>

               <head>2.7 Other Tools and Approaches</head>
               <p>There are some other tools that offer video and film analysis and (to a lesser
                  extent) provide functions similar to the previously introduced applications for
                  automatic film analysis. The Semantic Annotation Tool (SAT) is launched in the
                  context of the Media Ecology Project (MEP) (<ref
                     target="http://mediaecology.dartmouth.edu/sat/"
                     >http://mediaecology.dartmouth.edu/sat/</ref>). It allows for the annotation
                  and sharing of videos on the Web in free-text form, by a controlled set of tags,
                  or polygonal regions in a frame. It targets classroom as well as research
                  environments. The tool itself does not provide (integrated) quantitative measures.
                  However, it can be fed with external machine-generated metadata (by automated
                  video analysis methods). The Distant Viewing Toolkit<note><ref
                        target="https://www.distantviewing.org/labs/"
                        >https://www.distantviewing.org/labs/</ref></note> is a python package that
                  provides computational analysis and visualisation methods for video collections.
                  The software extracts and visualises semantic metadata from videos using standard
                  computer vision methods as well as exploring more high-level patterns such as
                  screen time per character. Another project is eFilms<note><ref
                        target="http://efilms.ushmm.org">http://efilms.ushmm.org</ref></note> that
                  provides a web-based film player that is supplemented with contextual meta
                  information such as date, geolocation or visual events for the footage. Its main
                  use case is the contextualization of historical footage of the Nazi era. The
                  project also provides a film annotation editor to insert the context annotations.
                  However, as for the aforementioned projects as well, the source code needs to be
                  deployed first and thus is no off-the-shelf and ready-to-use solution for film
                  scholars. Furthermore, the SAT and eFilms tools only offer manual annotation.</p>
               <p>Many other works exist that deal with analysis and visualisation of certain filmic
                  aspects. Some early works by Adams et al. transfer concepts of film grammar to
                  computational measures for automated film analysis. <ref target="#adams2000">Adams
                     and Dorai (2000)</ref> introduce a computational measure of movie tempo based
                  on its filmic definition and use it to automatically extract dramatic sections and
                  events from film. Furthermore, <ref target="#adams2001">Adams et al. (2001)</ref>
                  present a computational model for extracting film rhythm by deriving classes for
                  different motion characteristics in order to identify narrative structures and
                  dramatic progression. Another work deals with the extraction of narrative act
                  boundaries, in particular the 3-act-story telling paradigm using a probabilistic
                  model <ptr target="#adams2005"/>. </p>
               <p><ref target="#pause2016">Pause and Walkowski (2016)</ref> address the

                  Itten's method of seven colour contrasts <ref target="#pause1961">(1961)</ref> and

                     (2014)</ref> propose a tool to visualise the relationships between characters

                  representation of so-called semantic frames, simple keywords, hierarchical
                  annotations, as well as keywords for categories and similarities. Hohman et al
                  (2017) propose a method to explore individual videos (entertainment, series) on
                  the basis of colour information (dominant colour, etc.) as well as texts from
                  dialogues and evaluate the approach on the basis of two use cases for the series

            <head>3 Current Developments in Computer Vision and Video Analysis</head>
            <p>Apart from analysing film style (shot and scene segmentation, use of camera motion
               and colours, etc.), film studies are also concerned with question(s) such as: <q>Who
                  (or what) did what, when, and where?.</q> To answer such questions, algorithms for
               recognising persons, location and time of shots, etc. are required. There are some
               state-of-the-art approaches that basically target these questions (e.g., visual
               concept detection, geolocation and date estimation of images) and might be applicable
               to film style and content analysis – at least in future work.</p>
            <p>A central question in computer vision approaches is the choice of a feature
               representation for the visual data. Classical approaches rely on hand-crafted feature
               descriptors. While global descriptors like <term>Histogram of Oriented
                  Gradients</term> (HOG) are considered to represent an image holistically,
               descriptors based on <term>Scale Invariant Feature Transform</term> (SIFT) <ptr
                  target="#lowe2004"/> or <term>Speeded Up Robust Features</term> (SURF) <ptr
                  target="#bay2008"/> have proven to be particularly suitable for local features
               since they are invariant to coordinate transformations, and robust to noise as well
               as to illumination changes. With the emergence of deep learning, however, feature
               representations based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) largely replaced
               hand-crafted low-level features. Nowadays, CNNs and deep features are the
               state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks <ptr target="#brejcha2017"/>

               <head>3.1 Shot Boundary Detection </head>
               <p>Shot boundary detection (SBD) is an essential prerequisite for video processing
                  and for video content analysis tasks. Typical techniques in SBD <ptr
                     target="#baber2011"/>
                  <ptr target="#lankinen2013"/>
                  <ptr target="#li2010"/> rely on low-level features, consisting of global or local
                  frame features that are used to measure the distance between consecutive frames.
                  One notable approach <ptr target="#apostolidis2014"/> utilises both colour
                  histograms and SURF descriptors <ptr target="#bay2008"/> along with GPU
                  acceleration to identify abrupt and gradual transitions in real time. This
                  approach achieves a F1 accuracy score of 0.902 on a collection of 15 videos
                  gathered from different video archives while being 3x faster than real-time
                  processing on GPU. In order to enhance detection, especially for more subtle
                  gradual transitions, several CNN-based proposals have been introduced. They
                  extract and employ representative deep features for frames <ptr target="#xu2016"/>
                  or train networks that detect shot boundaries directly <ptr target="#gygli2018"/>.
                  Xu et al. conduct experiments on TRECVID 2001 test data and achieve F1 scores of

               <head>3.2 Scene Detection</head>
               <p>Given the shots, it is often desirable to segment a broadcast video into higher
                  level scenes. A scene is considered as a sequence of shots, which are related in a
                  spatio-temporal manner. For this purpose, <ref target="#baraldi2015b">Baraldi et
                     al. (2015b)</ref> detect superordinate scenes describing shots by means of
                  colour histograms and subsequently apply a hierarchical clustering approach. The
                  approach is applied to a collection of ten randomly selected broadcasting videos
                  from the RAI Scuola video archive constituting the RAI dataset. The method
                  achieves a F1 score of 0.70 at 7.7x real-time on CPU. <ref
                     target="#sidiropoulos2011">Sidiropoulos et al. (2011)</ref> suggest an
                  alternative approach, where shots constitute nodes in a graph representation and
                  edges between shots are weighted by shot similarity. Exploiting this
                  representation, scenes can be determined by partitioning the graph. On a test set
                  of six movies as well as on a set of 15 documentary films, the approach obtains a
                  F1 accuracy of 0.869 and 0.890 (F1 score on RAI dataset of <ref
                     target="#baraldi2015b">Baraldi et al. 2015b</ref>: 0.54), respectively. Another
                  solution <ptr target="#baraldi2015a"/> is to apply a multimodal deep neural
                  network to learn a metric for rating the difference between pairs of shots
                  utilizing both visual and textual features from the transcript. Similarity scores
                  of shots are used to segment the video into scenes. Beraldi et al. evaluate the
                  approach on 11 episodes from the BBC educational TV series <title rend="italic"

               <head>3.3 Camera Motion Estimation </head>
               <p>Camera motion is considered as a significant element in film production. Thus,
                  estimating the types of camera motion can be helpful in breaking down a video
                  sequence into shots or for motion analysis of objects. Some techniques for camera
                  motion estimation perform direct optical flow computation <ptr
                     target="#nguyen2010"/>, while others consider motion vectors that are available
                  in compressed video files <ptr target="#ewerth2004a"/>. On four short movie
                  sequences Nguyen et al. individually obtain 94.04% to 98.26% precision (percentage
                  of correct detections). The latter approach is evaluated on a video test set
                  consisting of 32 video sequences including all kinds of motion types. It detects
                  zooming with 99%, tilting (vertical camera movement) with 93% and panning
                  (horizontal camera movement) with 79% precision among other motion types. This
                  approach achieved the best results in the task of zoom detection at TRECVID 2005.
                  More recent works in this field couple the camera motion problem with similar
                  tasks in order to train neural networks in a joint unsupervised framework <ptr

               <head>3.4 Object Detection and Visual Concept Classification</head>
               <p>Object detection is the task of localising and classifying objects in an image.
                  Motivated by the first application of CNNs to object classification <ptr
                     target="#krizhevsky2012"/>, regions with CNN features (R-CNN) were introduced
                  in order to (localize and) classify objects based on region proposals <ptr
                     target="#girschick2014"/>. However, since this approach is computationally very
                  expensive, several improvements have been proposed. Fast-R-CNNs <ptr
                     target="#girshick2015"/> were designed to jointly train feature extraction,
                  classification and bounding box regression in an unified network. Additionally
                  integrating a region proposal subnetwork enabled Faster-R-CNNs <ptr
                     target="#ren2017"/> to significantly speed up the formerly separate process of
                  generating regions of interest. Thus, Faster-R-CNNs achieve an accuracy of 42.7
                  mAP (mean Average Precision) at a frame rate of 5 fps (frames per second) on the
                  challenging MS COCO detection dataset <ptr target="#lin2014"/> (MSCOCO: Microsoft
                  Common Objects in Context). Furthermore, mask R-CNNs <ptr target="#he2018"/>extend
                  the Faster-R-CNN approach for pixel-level segmentation of object instances by
                  predicting object masks. Running at 5 fps, this approach predicts object boxes as
                  well as segments with an accuracy of 60.3 mAP and 58.0 mAP on the COCO dataset. In
                  contrast to region proposal based methods, <ref target="#redmon2016">Redmon et al.
                     (2016)</ref> introduced YOLO,  a single shot object detector that predicts
                  bounding boxes and associated object classes based on a fixed-grid regression.
                  While YOLO is very fast in terms of inference time, further extensions <ptr

                  <ptr target="#redmon2018"/> employ anchor boxes and make several improvements on
                  network design also boosting the overall detection accuracy to 57.9 mAP at 20 fps
                  on the COCO dataset. In order to detect a wide variety of over 9000 object
                  categories, <ref target="#redmon2017">Redmon and Farhadi (2017)</ref> also
                  introduced the real-time system YOLO9000, which was simultaneously trained on the
                  COCO detection dataset as well as the ImageNet classification dataset <ptr
                     target="#deng2009"/>. Apart from detecting objects, there were also many
                  approaches and more importantly datasets introduced for classifying images into
                  concepts. The SUN database <ptr target="#zhou2014"/> provides up to 5400
                  categories of objects and scenes. Current image concept classification approaches
                  typically rely on deep models trained with state-of-the-art architectures <ptr

               <p>Motivated by the significant progress in object classification, deep learning
                  methods have also been applied to face recognition. In this context, DeepFace <ptr
                     target="#taigman2014"/> is one of the first approaches that is trained to
                  obtain deep features for face verification and, moreover, enhances face alignment
                  based on explicit 3D modelling of faces. This approach achieves an accuracy of
                  97.35% on the prominent as well as challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)
                  benchmark set. While DeepFace uses a cross-entropy loss (cost function) for
                  feature learning, <ref target="#schroff2015">Schroff et al. (2015)</ref>
                  introduced with FaceNet a novel and more sophisticated loss based on training with
                  triplets of roughly aligned matching and nonmatching face patches. On the LFW
                  benchmark, FaceNet obtains an accuracy of 99.63%.</p>
               <p>In the context of broadcast videos, the task of detecting faces and clustering
                  them for person indexing of frames or shots has been widely studied (e.g., <ref
                     target="#ewerth2007b">Ewerth et al. 2007b</ref>). While <ref
                     target="#muller2016">Müller et al. (2016)</ref> present a semi-supervised
                  system for automatically naming characters in TV broadcasts by extending and

                     (2017)</ref> both detect faces and cluster them by identity in full-length
                  movies. For content-based video retrieval in broadcast videos face recognition as
                  well as concept detection based on deep learning have also been proven to be

               <head>3.6 Recognition of Places and Geolocation</head>
               <p>Recognising a place in a frame or shot might yield also useful information for
                  film studies. The Places database contains over 400 unique place categories for
                  scene recognition. Along with the dataset, <ref target="#zhou2014">Zhou et al.
                     (2014;</ref>
                  <ref target="#zhou2018">2018</ref>) provide CNN models trained with various
                  architectures on the Places365 dataset. Using the ResNet architecture <ptr
                     target="#he2016"/>, for example, a top-5 accuracy of 85.1% can be obtained on
                  the Places365 validation set. <ref target="#mallya2018">Mallya and Lazebnik
                     (2018)</ref> introduce PackNet for training multiple tasks in a single model by
                  pruning redundant parameters. Thus, the network is trained on classes of the
                  ImageNet as well as the Places365 dataset. Being trained on multiple tasks, the
                  model yields a top-5 classification error of 15.6% for the Places365 classes on
                  the validation set, while the individually trained network by <ref
                     target="#zhou2018">Zhou et al. (2018)</ref> shows a top-5 error rate of 16.1%.

                  unit called SE block, which enables a network to use global information to
                  selectively emphasise informative features and suppress less useful ones by
                  performing dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration. This approach was trained
                  on the Places365 dataset as well and shows a top-5 error rate of 11.0% on the
                  corresponding validation set. </p>
               <p>For the task of earth scale photo geolocation two major directions have been taken
                  so far. Im2GPS, one fundamental proposal for photo geolocation estimation, infers
                  GPS coordinates by matching the query image against a reference database of
                  geotagged images <ptr target="#hays2008"/>
                  <ptr target="#hays2015"/> and was recently enhanced by incorporating deep learning
                  features <ptr target="#vo2017"/>. In this context, the Im2GPS test set consisting
                  of 237 challenging photos (only 5% are depicting touristic sites) was introduced.
                  The latest deep feature based Im2GPS version <ptr target="#vo2017"/> achieves an
                  accuracy of 47.7% at region scale (location error less than 200 km). Other major
                  proposals cast the task as a CNN-based classification approach by partitioning the
                  earth into geographical cells <ptr target="#weyand2016"/> and considering
                  combinatorial partitioning of maps, which facilitate more accurate and robust
                  class predictions <ptr target="#seo2018"/>. These frameworks called PlaNet and
                  CPlaNet achieve 37.6% and 42.6% accuracy at region scale on the benchmark,
                  respectively. Current state-of-the-art results (51.9% accuracy at region scale)
                  are achieved by similarly combining hierarchical map partitions and additionally
                  distinguishing three different settings (indoor, urban, and rural) through
                  automatic scene recognition <ptr target="#muller-budack2018"/>. </p>

               <p>While unrestricted photo geolocation estimation is well covered by several
                  studies, the problem of estimating the date of arbitrary (historical) photos was
                  addressed less frequently in the past. The first unrestricted work in this context
                     <ptr target="#palermo2012"/> dates historical colour images from 1930 to 1980
                  utilizing colour descriptors that model the evolution of colour imaging processes
                  over time. Thus, Palermo et al. report an overall accuracy of 45.7% on a set of
                  1375 Flickr images which are uniformly distributed across the considered decades.
                  A recent deep learning approach <ptr target="#muller2017"/> dates images from 1930
                  to 1999 considering the task either as a classification or a regression problem.
                  Müller et al. introduce the Date Estimation in the Wild test set consisting of
                  1120 Flickr images, which cover every year uniformly, and report a mean estimation
                  error of less than 8 years for both the classification and regression models. </p>

            <head>4 Human and Machine Performance in Annotation Tasks</head>
            <p>When applying computer vision approaches to film studies, the question arises whether
               their accuracy is sufficiently high. In this respect, we provide a comparison of
               human and machine performance based on own previous work <ptr target="#ewerth2017"/>
               for some specific visual recognition tasks: face recognition, geolocation estimation
               of photos, date estimation of photos, as well as visual object and concept detection
                  (<ref target="#table02">Table 2</ref>). </p>
            <p>A major field where human and machine performance has been compared frequently is
               visual concept classification. For a long time human annotations were (significantly)
               superior to machine-generated ones, as demonstrated by many studies <ptr
                  target="#jiang2011"/>
               <ptr target="#parikh2010"/>
               <ptr target="#xiao2010"/> on datasets like PASCAL VOC or SUN. However, the accuracy
               of machine annotations could be significantly raised by deep convolutional neural
               networks. The error rate of 6.7% reported with GoogLeNet <ptr target="#szegedy2015"/>
               on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014 was already
               close to that of humans (5.1 %), until in 2015 the error rate of neural networks <ptr
                  target="#he2015"/> was slightly lower (error rate: 4.94%) than human error on the
               ImageNet challenge. However, the human error rate is only based on a single
               annotator. Hence, no information about human inter-annotator agreement is
               available.</p>

            <p>A comparison of face identification capabilities of humans and machines was made for
               the first time in a Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) study in 2006 <ptr
                  target="#phillips2006"/>. Thus, it has been shown - interestingly, already nearly
               15 years ago - that industry-strength methods can compete with human performance in
               identifying unfamiliar faces under illumination changes. On the more recent as well
               as more challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark, human performance has
               also been reached by several approaches. Among several others, DeepFace <ptr

            <p>While humans are relatively good at recognising persons, estimating or guessing the

               rely on an extensive retrieval database. Current state-of-the-art results are reached
               by considering hierarchical as well as scene information of photos within the
               established classification approach, while using only 5 million training images <ptr
                  target="#muller-budack2018"/>. Since human performance reported on the established
               Im2GPS benchmark <ptr target="#vo2017"/> is relatively poor in this task, the system
               clearly surpasses human ability to guess geolocation by 48.1% accuracy within a
               tolerated distance level of 200 km (predictions at region level). </p>
            <p>The creation date of (historical) photos is very hard to judge for periods of time
               that are quite similar. Therefore, a fundamental work <ptr target="#palermo2012"/>
               predicts the decade of historical colour photos with an accuracy of 45.7% exceeding
               that of untrained humans (26.0% accuracy), <ref target="#muller2017">Müller et al.
                  (2017)</ref> suggest a deep learning system that infers the capturing date of
               images taken between 1930 and 1999 in terms of 5-year periods. When comparing human
               and machine annotations by means of absolute mean error in years, the deep learning
               system achieves better results nearly at all periods and improves the overall mean
               error by more than three years.</p>
            <p>In general, the promising performance of the computer vision approaches compared to
               humans in Table 2 makes a strong case for their use in film studies. Although these
               methods are still prone to errors (to a lesser or greater extent), they can highly
               raise the exploration of media sources and help in finding patterns. In spite of the
               impressive performance of the selected approaches, computer vision approaches still
               have some shortcomings. Such approaches are optimized for specific visual content
               analysis tasks and rely on custom training data. Therefore, they have limited
               flexibility and cannot adapt to arbitrary images across different genres. While they
               perform well in basic computer vision tasks, humans are by far superior in grasping
               and interpreting images in their context, for example, in identifying gradual
               transitions between shots or in captioning images/videos.</p>

            <head>5 Conclusions and Future Prospects for Software Tools in Film Studies </head>
            <p>In this paper, we have reviewed off-the-shelf software solutions for film studies.
               Since quantitative approaches to film content analysis are a handy way to effectively
               explore basic filmic features (see <ref target="#section01">Section 1</ref>), we have
               put a focus on offered functionalities regarding automated film style and content
               analysis. In this respect, only the tools Videana and VIAN offer a wider range of
               automated video analysis methods. However, with Videana not being developed anymore
               and the most recent tool VIAN focusing on film colour patterns, the field still lacks
               available tools that provide powerful state-of-the-art methods for visual content
               analysis. We discuss needed functionality in detail in the latter part of this
               section. Furthermore, we have outlined recent advances in the (automated) analysis of
               film style (shot and scene segmentation, use of camera motion or colours) as well as
               current developments and progress in the field of computer vision. As also discussed
               in the beginning of this paper, quantitative approaches are partially criticised for
               being incompatible with qualitative film analysis. To showcase the chances of basic
               computer vision approaches, we have compared machine and human performance in visual
               annotation tasks. We have shown that machine annotations are of similar quality to
               those of humans for some basic tasks like object classification, face recognition or
               geolocation estimation. Even when these methods do not reach human abilities, they
               can build a valid basis for exploring media sources for further manual inspection. </p>
            <p>What kind of basic and extended functionality for automated analysis and
               visualisation should a software tool have in order to support research in film
               studies? Previous practical experience with the basic functions of Videana has shown
               that such software is basically suitable for effectively supporting film research and
               teaching. However, film scholars often need more advanced functions tailored to their
               particular domain that allow the automatic detection of complex stylistic film
               elements such as the shot-reverse-shot technique. This requires, for example,
               detecting a series of alternating close-ups with a dialogue component and can be
               detected through the syntactic interaction of different factors. Starting from the
               smallest discontinuity in film, the cut, it is also possible to detect changing
               colour values or certain structural semantic properties such as the position of an
               object within consecutive shots. These could also allow drawing conclusions about
               changes within the storyline. Such forms of automatic segmentation and creating
               individual segments of events can be relevant in the context of narrative analyses.
               Researchers could be offered an effective structuring and orientation aid, which can
               undergo further manual differentiation based on content-related or motivic aspects.
               Therefore we envision a program that also offers a high degree of flexibility with
               regard to manual annotation opportunities. For a specific film or film corpus,
               individual survey parameters must be generated in order to judge their correlation
               with other parameters - depending on which hypotheses are to be applied to the object
               of investigation or can be formulated on the basis of the film material.</p>
            <p>Considering, for example, a film as a system of information mediation as in
               quantitative suspense research <ptr target="#junkerjurgen2001"/>
               <ptr target="#weibel2008"/>
               <ptr target="#weibel2017"/>, individual shots and sequences could be detected using
               automatic methods and manually be supplemented with further content parameters. Here,
               classifications such as the degree of information shared between the film character
               and the viewer (if the film viewer knows more or less than the character), the degree
               of correspondence between narrative time (duration of the film) and narrated time
               (time period covered by the filmic narrative), or the degree of narrative relevance
               (is the event only of relevance within the sequence or does it affect the central
               conflict of the narrative) are considered in order to draw conclusions about the
               suspense potential of a sequence. In the outlined framework, these factors favour the
               exploitation of the viewer's anticipation of damage - in particular their emotional
               connection to a film character - through a principle of delay, as primarily applied
               in battle sequences typical of action films. Due to the principle of delaying the
               resolution of a conflict, they have a low information gain in view of the entire
               narrative. The principles of this parameterisation can now be used to check which
               dramaturgical context is characterised by which formal characteristics in comparison
               with the editing parameters of Salt. This concept of data acquisition can be extended
               by further parameters such as the application of digital visual effects in individual
               sequences, which provides a differentiated insight into the internal dynamics and
               proportions of filmic representation systems. Especially with regard to
               computer-generated imagery, which is subject to development processes spanning
               decades, it is possible to examine on a longitudinal scale how this process has had a
               concrete effect on production practices. However, such highly complex interwoven data
               structures require sophisticated statistical models with which these hypotheses can
               be tested.</p>
            <p>Finally, a software tool adapted to the research object should be developed in a
               productive dialogue between computer science and film science. Such software for film
               studies could be based on experiences with software such as Videana or VIAN that
               allows for the evaluation of larger film corpora on a differentiated and reliable
               data basis, which cannot be generated with previous analysis instruments.
               Furthermore, it is desirable to include specific forms of information visualisations
               tailored to the needs of film scholars. Cinemetrics or Ligne de temps, as software
               designed for film studies, are also limited to a graphical representation that cannot
               take into account the requirements of narrative questions. Since an all-in-one
               approach will not fit to all analysis and visualisation requirements, such a tool
               should also provide an interface for plugins that offer additional functionality.
               Using these approaches, a large collection of research data can be gathered and
               exported for further processing, but the lack of a working digital environment for
               media science continues to be a problem. Statistical software or Microsoft Excel were
               not designed for the visualization of editing rhythms or narrative structures, which
               makes it difficult to process the corresponding data. An interdisciplinary
               cooperation could foster research in designing an optimal solution for scholarly film
               studies that allows direct interaction with the automatically determined parameters
               as well as their method-dependent annotation and graphical processing.</p>
            <p>In summary, the development of a comprehensive software solution for scientists who
               systematically carry out film or video analysis would be desirable. This group
               includes media and film scientists, but also scientists from other disciplines (e.g.,
               applications in journalism and media education, analysis of propaganda videos and
               political video works, image and educational films, television programmes). Also,
               empirical studies of media psychology in the field of event indexing require the
               annotation and analysis of structural properties of audiovisual research data.
               Factors such as the duration of an action segment as well as temporal, spatial,
               figure-related or action-related changes within the sequences (four dimension
               models), but also shot lengths are integrated into the research design and are
               prerequisites for the formulation of hypotheses and their empirical validation <ptr
                  target="#huff2014"/>.</p>
            <p>An interdisciplinary all-in-one software tool of this kind should be openly available
               on a web-based platform, intuitive, easy to use and rely on state-of-the-art
               algorithms and technology. On the one hand, by providing automatic methods for the
               quantitative analysis of film material, large film and video corpora could become the
               object of investigation and hypotheses could, for example, be statistically tested;
               on the other hand, the interpretation would be simplified by different possibilities
               of visualisation. Last but not least, legal questions regarding the storage,
               processing and use of moving image material should be clarified and taken into
               account in the technical implementation.</p>
