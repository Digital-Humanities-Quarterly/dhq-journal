            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>Lots of approaches for automated video analysis have been suggested since the
               1990ies, which have the potential to support quantitative and qualitative analysis in
               film studies. However, software solutions for the scholarly study of film that
               utilise video analysis algorithms are still relatively rare. In this paper, we aim to
               provide an overview of related work in this field, review current developments in
               computer vision, compare machine and human performance for some visual recognition
               tasks, and outline the requirements for video analysis software that would optimally
               support scholars of film studies.</p>

            <head>1 Introduction</head>
            <p>In contrast to the field of computer-assisted research in the arts that has been
               established for several years (Anitha et al. 2013; Johnson et al. 2008; Klein et al.
               2014; Resig 2014), there is a need to catch up in scientific approaches to film
               (represented in the fields of New Film History and Stylometry). An important reason
               is the lack of practical software solutions available to date and the incompatibility
               of quantitative research designs with existing methodologies for film studies. In
               this context, some researchers criticise above all the appropriation of a
               technicistic, unrelated mission statement, which advocates of digital humanities
               apply to their own subject following other principles (Liu 2012; Missomelius 2014).
               However, more recent research (Heftberger 2016; Sittel 2017) has shown that
               qualitative and quantitative analysis are by no means mutually exclusive, but can be
               integrated in order to enrich film studies with new impulses.</p>
            <p>The statistical film analysis developed by the physicist Salt thus holds the
               potential of a methodological guideline for quantifying filmic characteristics (Salt
               2006; 2009). This methodology focuses on quantifiable factors in the formal structure
               of a film such as camera shot length, which is considered an objective unit because
               it can be measured over time. The various forms of camera usage and movement (such as
               tracking shots, pans and tilts, camera distance, i.e., shot size) as well as other
               techniques (such as zoom-in and -out or the use of a camera crane) are also relevant
               for quantification. Casting this set of techniques as measuring instruments, it is
               possible to obtain data that scientists can relate to verifiable criteria in terms of
               film production history and to formulate hypotheses that allow conclusions to be
               drawn about the formal stylistic development of the selected films. To this end,
               Salt's concept allows for complete traceability of the measurement results and thus
               also of the numerical values to a theory set.</p>
            <p>The concept was criticized for its reductionism (Fl√ºckiger 2011), which prevents it
               from being connected to the qualitative research methods that dominate film studies.
               However, research in digital humanities has shown that quantitative parameters such
               as shot length are a suitable foundation for various analytical tools when it comes
               to the qualitative investigation of data Tsivian 2008; Buckland 2009; many others).
               In this way, quantitative research according to Salt makes it possible to validate
               stylistic changes in the work of emigrated European directors due to technical
               opportunities of the American studio system, or even to collect the average shot
               lengths of numerous productions from the beginning of film history to the present.
               Such research allows researchers to draw conclusions about the progressive
               acceleration of editing and thus provides information about the development of film
               technology and changes in our viewing habits. These questions concerning stylistic
               research in film studies cannot be examined without a corresponding quantitative
               research design, although Salt's concept remains too inflexible for broader
               application.</p>
            <p>In this context, Korte's work (2010) is regarded as pioneering (especially in
               German-speaking countries) in transferring quantitative methods into the framework of
               a qualitative analysis immanent in the work. An example for this is Rodenberg's
               analysis of Zabriskie Point (directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, 1970) in Korte's
               introduction to systematic film analysis (2010), which graphically depicts the
               stylistic structure of the film in an innovative way. Thus, for a detailed analysis
               Rodenberg visualises the adaption and alignment of editing rhythms to the
               characterisations of the persons in the narrative, and makes the alignment of music
               and narration comprehensible using diagrams. Heftberger (2016), for example, combines
               the analysis of historical sources such as editing diagrams and tables by the Russian
               director Vertov with computer-aided representations of digital humanities in order to
               provide insights into the filmmaker's working methods. Heftberger starts with copies
               of Vertov's films, which were analysed for structural features using the annotation
               software ANVIL (Kipp 2001), but also for dissolves or condition-related factors (e.g.
               markings in the film rolls or damage to the film). Within the framework of single and
               overall analyses, the data serve to elucidate the director‚Äôs intentions.</p>
            <p>Figure 1. Increase and decrease of shot lengths in Antonioni‚Äôs Blow Up (1966) using
               Videana.</p>
            <p>Sittel (2016) investigated the principle of increase and decrease of shot lengths in
               Michelangelo Antonioni‚Äôs <hi rend="italic">Blow Up</hi> (1966). The visualization in
               Figure 1 was created during this study with the video analysis software Videana
               (Ewerth et al. 2009) and gives an insight into this pattern. This technique, which is
               increasingly used in film editing, represents a structuring feature of the second
               half of the film and can be interpreted as a message with regard to the film content. </p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Figure 2. Average shot length of all Antonioni films in chronological order.</p>
            <p>Using Salt's paradigm as a guideline, an analysis of all Antonioni films makes it
               possible to identify a clear change in style based on shot sizes and camera
               movements, which extends existing, non-qualitative approaches in a differentiated
               way. Figure 2 shows that the average shot length becomes shorter across nearly all
               films. To this end, a principle of systematic camera movement (longer shots) and thus
               an abandonment of montage gradually gives way to the increasing use of editing.</p>
            <p>Research efforts like this benefit from automated computer-based methods that measure
               basic features of filmic structure. Similar to former work (Estrada et al. 2017), we
               present a comprehensive survey of related software tools for video annotation, but
               particularly focus on methods for visual content analysis for film studies. First, we
               examine major software tools for video analysis with a focus on automated analysis
               algorithms and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. In addition, related work that
               applies automated video analysis to film studies is discussed. Moreover, we summarise
               current progress in computer vision and visual content analysis with a focus on deep
               learning methods. Besides, a comparison of machine vs. human performance in
               annotation tasks that are relevant for video content analysis is provided. Finally,
               we discuss future desirable functionalities for automated analysis in software tools
               for film studies.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews existing
               software tools and algorithms for quantitative approaches in film analysis. Section 3
               discusses recent advancements in the field of video analysis and computer vision. A
               comparison of human and machine performance in different annotation tasks is provided
               in Section 4. Section 5 describes requirements for software tools in scholarly film
               studies and outlines areas for future work.</p>
            <p>2 Software Tools and Algorithms for Quantitative Film Studies </p>
            <p>Researchers who want to utilise quantitative strategies to analyse film as presented
               in Figure 1 and 2 usually have to evaluate larger films or video corpora. However,
               existing software tools so far, with a few exceptions, require a high degree of
               manual annotation. As a consequence, many current film productions are difficult to
               evaluate due to ever shorter shot lengths. This section provides an overview of
               software solutions for film studies and their degree of automation in terms of
               capturing basic filmic features. While there are numerous existing annotation and
               video analysis tools, the focus lies on ready-to-use software applications most
               suitable for quantitative film studies. An overview of the¬†functionalities provided
               by the selected applications and their current status of availability is presented in
               Table 1. We also distinguish between application areas in Table 1, since not all of
               the tools were originally proposed for scholarly film studies as targeted here. </p>

               analysis, characterised by their degree of automation regarding video content
               analysis tasks. While ‚Äúm‚Äù denotes manual annotation, ‚Äúa‚Äù refers to automated
               annotation. </p>

               <head>2.1 Cinemetrics</head>
               <p>In the Cinemetrics project (Tsivian 2009), Yuri and Gunnar Tsivian took up Salt‚Äôs
                  methodology and used it for the first time as conceptual guidelines for the
                  implementation of digital analytical instruments, which are freely available as a
                  Web-based platform since 2005 (http://www.cinemetrics.lv/). The tool allows the
                  user to synchronously view and annotate video material, or to systematically comb
                  through AVI video files. In the advanced mode, customized annotation criteria can
                  be defined in addition to basic features (e.g. frequency and length of shots). The
                  data sets obtained are then collected within an online database according to the
                  principle of crowdsourcing. With metadata for more than 50,000 films to date, it
                  acts as a comprehensive research data archive that documents the development and
                  history of film style. Cinemetrics is the only platform based on Web 2.0
                  principles that consistently aggregates film data and makes it publicly
                  accessible. However, the analysis of film data is not systematic. Moreover,
                  Cinemetrics relies exclusively on the manual acquisition of data such as shot
                  changes, camera distances, or camera movements. The accurate evaluation of video
                  material such as feature films therefore requires an effort of several hours and
                  is unsuitable for broader studies. Nonetheless, the platform enjoys a high level
                  of visitor traffic. Between 2010 and 2013, the number of users almost doubled
                  (2010: 4,500 clicks per day, 2013: 8,326). The program is regularly used in
                  seminars at the Universities of Chicago, Amsterdam, Taiwan and at the Johannes
                  Gutenberg University of Mainz.</p>

               <p>ANVIL (Kipp 2001, available at http://www.anvil-software.org/) and ELAN (<hi
                     rend="italic">EUDICO Linguistic Annotator,</hi> Sloetjes and Wittenburg 2008,
                  available at https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/) are visual annotation
                  tools, which were originally designed for psycholinguistics and gesture research.
                  They are suitable for the differentiated graphical representation of editing
                  rhythms or for the annotation of previously defined structural features at the
                  shot and sequence level, though it usually requires the export of the data to
                  another statistical software or Microsoft Excel. In contrast to Cinemetrics, ANVIL
                  and ELAN allow the user to directly interact with the video material. They offer a
                  much greater methodological scope, especially through the option of adding several
                  feature dimensions to the video material in the form of tracks. Both systems work
                  according to a similar principle, to which the video segments or the collected
                  shots can be viewed and annotated with metadata. Annotations can also be arranged
                  hierarchically by means of multiple layers which are called tiers. Thus,
                  annotations can be cross-referenced to other annotations or to corresponding shots
                  or video segments, making the programs particularly suitable for a fine-grained
                  analysis of the structure of individual works. However, if several parameters are
                  to be recorded during an evaluation run, repeated viewing of a film is required in
                  order to label the individual tracks with the respective characteristics and
                  features.</p>

               <p>The analysis tool Ligne de temps (<ref
                     target="http://www.iri.centrepompidou.fr/outils/lignes-de-temps-2/"
                     >http://www.iri.centrepompidou.fr/outils/lignes-de-temps-2/</ref>) was
                  developed between 2007 and 2011 by the Institut de recherche et d‚Äôinnovation du
                  Centre Pompidou. The tool provides a graphical timeline-based representation of
                  the material and allows for selecting temporal segments in order to annotate
                  different types of modality (video, audio, text) of the corresponding sequence in
                  the movie, or add information in the form of images or external links. Moreover,
                  it is possible to generate colour-coded annotations aligned with the shots by
                  choosing from a range of available RGB colour values. This function can be
                  implicitly used for colour analysis. However, a single colour cannot represent a
                  holistic image or even an entire shot. Ligne de temps enables the automated
                  detection of shot boundaries in the video, as only few of the presented tools do.
                  But there is no information available about the algorithm used and its performance
                  on benchmark data sets.</p>

               <head>2.4 Advene, Mediathread</head>
               <p>Advene (Annotate Digital Video, Exchange on the NEt, Aubert and Pri√© 2005) is an
                  ongoing project for the annotation of digital videos that also provides a format
                  to share annotations. The tool has been developed since 2002 and is freely
                  available as a cross-platform desktop application (www.advene.org). It provides a
                  broader number of functionalities compared with the former tools. In particular,
                  the tool enables textual as well as graphical annotations to augment the video and
                  also provides automatically generated thumbnails for each shot. Moreover, it is
                  possible to edit and visualise hypervideos consisting of both the annotations and
                  the video. Target groups are film scholars, teachers and students who want to
                  exchange multimedia comments and analyses about videos such as movies,
                  conferences, or courses. The tool has also been used for reflexive interviews of
                  museum visitors, or with regard to on-demand video providers and movie-related
                  social networks. However, the automatic analysis options that Advene provides are
                  restricted to shot boundary detection and temporal segmentation of audio tracks. </p>
               <p>Mediathread (https://mediathread.info) was developed by <ref
                     target="https://ctl.columbia.edu/">Columbia University‚Äôs Center for Teaching
                     and Learning (CTL)</ref> and first launched in 2010. It is a web application
                  for multimedia annotations enabling collaboration on video and image analysis.
                  Similar to Advene, Mediathread primarily serves as a platform for collaboratively
                  working and sharing annotations for multimedia and is therefore actively used in
                  classroom environments at various universities, also including courses on film
                  studies. However, it does not provide automated analysis capabilities such as shot
                  detection. In addition, film studies researches wanting to use the web application
                  need a certain degree of expertise to individually deploy the openly available
                  source code. </p>

               <head>2.5 Videana</head>
               <p>The video analysis software Videana was developed at the University of Marburg
                  (Ewerth et al. 2009). Videana is one of the few software tools to offer more than
                  simple analysis functions such as the detection of shot changes (Ewerth and
                  Freisleben 2004; 2009). For example, the software integrates algorithms for text
                  detection (Gllavata et al. 2004a), video OCR (Gllavata et al. 2004b), estimation
                  of camera motion (Ewerth et al. 2004) and of object motion (Ewerth et al. 2007a),
                  and face detection (Viola &amp; Jones 2004). Further functionalities, which are
                  however not part of the standard version, are the recognition of dominant colour
                  values, person recognition and indexing (Ewerth et al. 2007b), or the temporal
                  segmentation of the soundtrack. The many available features and the possibility to
                  combine them allow for the flexible formulation of complex research hypotheses and
                  their empirical verification. For example, Videana was used for a media study to
                  investigate user behaviour in Google Earth Tours (Abend et al. 2011; Abend et al.
                  2012). However, the software has not been updated since 2012 and therefore does
                  not rely on current state-of-the-art methods in video analysis. Another drawback
                  of the tool is the lack of enhanced visualizations that go beyond simple cut
                  frequency diagrams and event timelines. Finally, the software is not usable
                  through a Web browser, but only available as a desktop software.</p>

               <p>Within the project ‚ÄúFilm Colors - Bridging the Gap Between Technology and
                  Aesthetics‚Äù (<ref target="https://filmcolors.org/">https://filmcolors.org/</ref>)
                  at the University of Zurich, the tool VIAN (Fl√ºckiger et al. 2017, Halter et al.
                  2019) for video analysis and annotation is currently being developed with a focus
                  on film colour patterns. In comparison to general-purpose annotation tools like
                  ELAN, VIAN particularly addresses aesthetic analyses of full feature films. The
                  tool is also planned to allow a variety of (semi)-automatic tools for the analysis
                  and visualisation of film colours based on computer vision and deep learning
                  methods such as figure-ground separation and extraction of the corresponding
                  colour schemes. Although the tool is not released yet (announced to be open
                  source), VIAN seems to be a very promising tool with regard to state-of-the-art
                  visual content analysis methods.</p>

               <head>2.7 Other Tools and Approaches</head>
               <p>There are some other tools that offer video and film analysis and (to a lesser
                  extent) provide functions similar to the previously introduced applications for
                  automatic film analysis. The Semantic Annotation Tool (SAT) is launched in the
                  context of the Media Ecology Project (MEP) (<ref
                     target="http://mediaecology.dartmouth.edu/sat/"
                     >http://mediaecology.dartmouth.edu/sat/</ref>). It allows for the annotation
                  and sharing of videos on the Web in free-text form, by a controlled set of tags,
                  or polygonal regions in a frame. It targets classroom as well as research
                  environments. The tool itself does not provide (integrated) quantitative measures.
                  However, it can be fed with external machine-generated metadata (by automated
                  video analysis methods). The Distant Viewing Toolkit
                  (https://www.distantviewing.org/labs/) is a python package that provides
                  computational analysis and visualisation methods for video collections. The
                  software extracts and visualises semantic metadata from videos using standard
                  computer vision methods as well as exploring more high-level patterns such as
                  screen time per character. Another project is eFilms (<ref
                     target="http://efilms.ushmm.org">http://efilms.ushmm.org</ref>) that provides a
                  web-based film player that is supplemented with contextual meta information such
                  as date, geolocation or visual events for the footage. Its main use case is the
                  contextualization of historical footage of the Nazi era. The project also provides
                  a film annotation editor to insert the context annotations. However, as for the
                  aforementioned projects as well, the source code needs to be deployed first and
                  thus is no off-the-shelf and ready-to-use solution for film scholars. Furthermore,
                  the SAT and eFilms tools only offer manual annotation.</p>
               <p>Many other works exist that deal with analysis and visualisation of certain filmic
                  aspects. Some early works by Adams et al. transfer concepts of film grammar to
                  computational measures for automated film analysis. Adams and Dorai (2000)
                  introduce a computational measure of movie tempo based on its filmic definition
                  and use it to automatically extract dramatic sections and events from film.
                  Furthermore, Adams et al. (2001) present a computational model for extracting film
                  rhythm by deriving classes for different motion characteristics in order to
                  identify narrative structures and dramatic progression. Another work deals with
                  the extraction of narrative act boundaries, in particular the 3-act-story telling
                  paradigm using a probabilistic model (Adams et al. 2005). </p>
               <p>Pause and Walkowski (2016) address the characterization of dominant colours in
                  film and discuss the limitations of the k-means clustering approach. Furthermore,
                  they propose to proceed according to Itten's method of seven colour contrasts
                  (1961) and outline how it can be implemented algorithmically. Burghardt et al.
                  (2016) present a system that automatically extracts colour and language
                  information using k-means clustering as well as subtitles and propose an
                  interactive visualisation. Hoyt et al. (2014) propose a tool to visualise the
                  relationships between characters in a movie. John et al. (2017) present a visual
                  analytics approach (for the analysis of single or a set of videos) that combines
                  automatic data analysis and visualisation. The interface supports the
                  representation of so-called semantic frames, simple keywords, hierarchical
                  annotations, as well as keywords for categories and similarities. Hohman et al
                  (2017) propose a method to explore individual videos (entertainment, series) on
                  the basis of colour information (dominant colour, etc.) as well as texts from
                  dialogues and evaluate the approach on the basis of two use cases for the series
                     <hi rend="italic">Game of Thrones</hi>. </p>
               <p>Tseng (2013b) provides an analysis of plot cohesion in film by tracking film
                  elements such as characters, objects, settings, and character action. Furthermore,
                  Tseng (2013a) distinguishes basic narrative types in visual images by
                  interconnecting salient people, objects and settings within single and across
                  sequential images. Bateman (2014) reviews empirical, quantitative approaches to
                  the analysis of films and, moreover, suggests employing discourse semantics for
                  more systematic interpretative analysis in order to overcome the difficulty of
                  relating particular technical film features to qualitative interpretations. </p>

               (shot and scene segmentation, use of camera motion and colours, etc.), film studies
               are also concerned with question(s) such as: ‚ÄúWho (or what) did what, when, and
               where?‚Äù. To answer such questions, algorithms for recognising persons, location and
               time of shots, etc. are required. There are some state-of-the-art approaches that
               basically target these questions (e.g., visual concept detection, geolocation and
               date estimation of images) and might be applicable to film style and content analysis
               ‚Äì at least in future work.</p>
            <p>A central question in computer vision approaches is the choice of a feature
               representation for the visual data. Classical approaches rely on hand-crafted feature
               descriptors. While global descriptors like <hi rend="italic">Histogram of Oriented
                  Gradients</hi> (HOG) are considered to represent an image holistically,
               descriptors based on <hi rend="italic">Scale Invariant Feature Transform</hi> (SIFT)
               (Lowe 2004) or <hi rend="italic">Speeded Up Robust Features</hi> (SURF) (Bay et al.
               2008) have proven to be particularly suitable for local features since they are
               invariant to coordinate transformations, and robust to noise as well as to
               illumination changes. With the emergence of deep learning, however, feature
               representations based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) largely replaced
               hand-crafted low-level features. Nowadays, CNNs and deep features are the
               state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks (Brejcha and Cadik 2017; Rawat and
               Wang 2017; Wang and Deng 2018).</p>

               <head>3.1 Shot Boundary Detection </head>
               <p>Shot boundary detection (SBD) is an essential prerequisite for video processing
                  and for video content analysis tasks. Typical techniques in SBD (Baber et al.
                  2011; Lankinen and K√§m√§r√§inen 2013; Li et al. 2010) rely on low-level features,
                  consisting of global or local frame features that are used to measure the distance
                  between consecutive frames. One notable approach (Apostolidis and Mezaris 2014)
                  utilises both colour histograms and SURF descriptors (Bay et al. 2008) along with
                  GPU acceleration to identify abrupt and gradual transitions in real time. This
                  approach achieves a F1 accuracy score of 0.902 on a collection of 15 videos
                  gathered from different video archives while being 3x faster than real-time
                  processing on GPU. In order to enhance detection, especially for more subtle
                  gradual transitions, several CNN-based proposals have been introduced. They
                  extract and employ representative deep features for frames (Xu et al. 2016) or
                  train networks that detect shot boundaries directly (Gygli 2018). Xu et al.
                  conduct experiments on TRECVID 2001 test data and achieve F1 scores of 0.988 and
                  0.968 for cut and gradual transitions, respectively. Gygli (2018) reports a F1
                  score of 0.88 on the RAI dataset (Baraldi et al. 2015b) outperforming previous
                  work, while being extremely fast (more than 120x real-time on GPU).</p>

               <head>3.2 Scene Detection</head>
               <p>Given the shots, it is often desirable to segment a broadcast video into higher
                  level scenes. A scene is considered as a sequence of shots, which are related in a
                  spatio-temporal manner. For this purpose, Baraldi et al. (2015b) detect
                  superordinate scenes describing shots by means of colour histograms and
                  subsequently apply a hierarchical clustering approach. The approach is applied to
                  a collection of ten randomly selected broadcasting videos from the RAI Scuola
                  video archive constituting the RAI dataset. The method achieves a F1 score of 0.70
                  at 7.7x real-time on CPU. Sidiropoulos et al. (2011) suggest an alternative
                  approach, where shots constitute nodes in a graph representation and edges between
                  shots are weighted by shot similarity. Exploiting this representation, scenes can
                  be determined by partitioning the graph. On a test set of six movies as well as on
                  a set of 15 documentary films, the approach obtains a F1 accuracy of 0.869 and
                  0.890 (F1 score on RAI dataset of Beraldi et al. 2015b: 0.54), respectively.
                  Another solution (Beraldi et al. 2015a) is to apply a multimodal deep neural
                  network to learn a metric for rating the difference between pairs of shots
                  utilizing both visual and textual features from the transcript. Similarity scores
                  of shots are used to segment the video into scenes. Beraldi et al. evaluate the
                  approach on 11 episodes from the BBC educational TV series <hi rend="italic"
                     >Planet Earth </hi>and report a F1 score of 0.62.</p>

               <head>3.3 Camera Motion Estimation </head>
               <p>Camera motion is considered as a significant element in film production. Thus,
                  estimating the types of camera motion can be helpful in breaking down a video
                  sequence into shots or for motion analysis of objects. Some techniques for camera
                  motion estimation perform direct optical flow computation (Nguyen et al. 2010),
                  while others consider motion vectors that are available in compressed video files
                  (Ewerth et al. 2004). On four short movie sequences Nguyen et al. individually
                  obtain 94.04% to 98.26% precision (percentage of correct detections). The latter
                  approach is evaluated on a video test set consisting of 32 video sequences
                  including all kinds of motion types. It detects zooming with 99%, tilting
                  (vertical camera movement) with 93% and panning (horizontal camera movement) with
                  79% precision among other motion types. This approach achieved the best results in
                  the task of zoom detection at TRECVID 2005. More recent works in this field couple
                  the camera motion problem with similar tasks in order to train neural networks in
                  a joint unsupervised framework (Zhou et al. 2017, Yin and Shi 2018, Ranjan et al.
                  2019). </p>
               <p>3.4 Object Detection and Visual Concept Classification</p>
               <p>Object detection is the task of localising and classifying objects in an image.
                  Motivated by the first application of CNNs to object classification (Krizhevsky et
                  al. 2012), regions with CNN features (R-CNN) were introduced in order to (localize
                  and) classify objects based on region proposals (Girshick et al. 2014). However,
                  since this approach is computationally very expensive, several improvements have
                  been proposed. Fast-R-CNNs (Girshick 2015) were designed to jointly train feature
                  extraction, classification and bounding box regression in an unified network.
                  Additionally integrating a region proposal subnetwork enabled Faster-R-CNNs (Ren
                  et al. 2017) to significantly speed up the formerly separate process of generating
                  regions of interest. Thus, Faster-R-CNNs achieve an accuracy of 42.7 mAP (mean
                  Average Precision) at a frame rate of 5 fps (frames per second) on the challenging
                  MS COCO detection dataset (Lin et al. 2014; MSCOCO: Microsoft Common Objects in
                  Context). Furthermore, mask R-CNNs (He et al. 2017) extend the Faster-R-CNN
                  approach for pixel-level segmentation of object instances by predicting object
                  masks. Running at 5 fps, this approach predicts object boxes as well as segments
                  with an accuracy of 60.3 mAP and 58.0 mAP on the COCO dataset. In contrast to
                  region proposal based methods, Redmon et al. (2016) introduced YOLO, ¬†a single
                  shot object detector that predicts bounding boxes and associated object classes
                  based on a fixed-grid regression. While YOLO is very fast in terms of inference
                  time, further extensions (Redmon and Farhadi 2017; 2018) employ anchor boxes and
                  make several improvements on network design also boosting the overall detection
                  accuracy to 57.9 mAP at 20 fps on the COCO dataset. In order to detect a wide
                  variety of over 9000 object categories, Redmon and Farhadi (2017) also introduced
                  the real-time system YOLO9000, which was simultaneously trained on the COCO
                  detection dataset as well as the ImageNet classification dataset (Deng et al.
                  2009). Apart from detecting objects, there were also many approaches and more
                  importantly datasets introduced for classifying images into concepts. The SUN
                  database (Zhou et al. 2014) provides up to 5400 categories of objects and scenes.
                  Current image concept classification approaches typically rely on deep models
                  trained with state-of-the-art architectures (He et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2017;
                  Szegedy et al. 2016). </p>

               <head>3.5 Face Recognition and Person Identification </head>
               <p>Motivated by the significant progress in object classification, deep learning
                  methods have also been applied to face recognition. In this context, DeepFace
                  (Taigman et al. 2014) is one of the first approaches that is trained to obtain
                  deep features for face verification and, moreover, enhances face alignment based
                  on explicit 3D modelling of faces. This approach achieves an accuracy of 97.35% on
                  the prominent as well as challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark
                  set. While DeepFace uses a cross-entropy loss (cost function) for feature
                  learning, Schroff et al. (2015) introduced with FaceNet a novel and more
                  sophisticated loss based on training with triplets of roughly aligned matching and
                  nonmatching face patches. On the LFW benchmark, FaceNet obtains an accuracy of
                  99.63%.</p>
               <p>In the context of broadcast videos, the task of detecting faces and clustering
                  them for person indexing of frames or shots has been widely studied (e.g., Ewerth
                  et al. 2007b). While M√ºller et al. (2016) present a semi-supervised system for
                  automatically naming characters in TV broadcasts by extending and correcting
                  weakly labelled training data, Jin et al. (2017) both detect faces and cluster
                  them by identity in full-length movies. For content-based video retrieval in
                  broadcast videos face recognition as well as concept detection based on deep
                  learning have also been proven to be effective (M√ºhling et al. 2017). </p>

               <head>3.6 Recognition of Places and Geolocation</head>
               <p>Recognising a place in a frame or shot might yield also useful information for
                  film studies. The Places database contains over 400 unique place categories for
                  scene recognition. Along with the dataset, Zhou et al. (2014; 2018) provide CNN
                  models trained with various architectures on the Places365 dataset. Using the
                  ResNet architecture (He et al. 2016), for example, a top-5 accuracy of 85.1% can
                  be obtained on the Places365 validation set. Mallya and Lazebnik (2018) introduce
                  PackNet for training multiple tasks in a single model by pruning redundant
                  parameters. Thus, the network is trained on classes of the ImageNet as well as the
                  Places365 dataset. Being trained on multiple tasks, the model yields a top-5
                  classification error of 15.6% for the Places365 classes on the validation set,
                  while the individually trained network by Zhou et al. (2018) shows a top-5 error
                  rate of 16.1%. Hu et al. (2018) introduce a novel CNN architecture unit called SE
                  block, which enables a network to use global information to selectively emphasise
                  informative features and suppress less useful ones by performing dynamic
                  channel-wise feature recalibration. This approach was trained on the Places365
                  dataset as well and shows a top-5 error rate of 11.0% on the corresponding
                  validation set. </p>
               <p>For the task of earth scale photo geolocation two major directions have been taken
                  so far. Im2GPS, one fundamental proposal for photo geolocation estimation, infers
                  GPS coordinates by matching the query image against a reference database of
                  geotagged images (Hays and Efros 2008; 2015) and was recently enhanced by
                  incorporating deep learning features (Vo et al. 2017). In this context, the Im2GPS
                  test set consisting of 237 challenging photos (only 5% are depicting touristic
                  sites) was introduced. The latest deep feature based Im2GPS version (Vo et al.
                  2017) achieves an accuracy of 47.7% at region scale (location error less than 200
                  km). Other major proposals cast the task as a CNN-based classification approach by
                  partitioning the earth into geographical cells (Weyand et al. 2016) and
                  considering combinatorial partitioning of maps, which facilitate more accurate and
                  robust class predictions (Seo et al. 2018). These frameworks called PlaNet and
                  CPlaNet achieve 37.6% and 42.6% accuracy at region scale on the benchmark,
                  respectively. Current state-of-the-art results (51.9% accuracy at region scale)
                  are achieved by similarly combining hierarchical map partitions and additionally
                  distinguishing three different settings (indoor, urban, and rural) through
                  automatic scene recognition (M√ºller-Budack et al. 2018). </p>

               <head>3.7 Image Date Estimation</head>
               <p>While unrestricted photo geolocation estimation is well covered by several
                  studies, the problem of estimating the date of arbitrary (historical) photos was
                  addressed less frequently in the past. The first unrestricted work in this context
                  (Palermo et al. 2012) dates historical colour images from 1930 to 1980 utilizing
                  colour descriptors that model the evolution of colour imaging processes over time.
                  Thus, Palermo et al. report an overall accuracy of 45.7% on a set of 1375 Flickr
                  images which are uniformly distributed across the considered decades. A recent
                  deep learning approach (M√ºller et al. 2017) dates images from 1930 to 1999
                  considering the task either as a classification or a regression problem. M√ºller et

            <head>4 Human and Machine Performance in Annotation Tasks</head>
            <p>When applying computer vision approaches to film studies, the question arises whether
               their accuracy is sufficiently high. In this respect, we provide a comparison of
               human and machine performance based on own previous work (Ewerth et al. 2017) for
               some specific visual recognition tasks: face recognition, geolocation estimation of
               photos, date estimation of photos, as well as visual object and concept detection
               (Table 2). </p>
            <p>A major field where human and machine performance has been compared frequently is
               visual concept classification. For a long time human annotations were (significantly)
               superior to machine-generated ones, as demonstrated by many studies (Jiang et al.
               2011; Parikh and Zitnick 2010; Xiao et al. 2010) on datasets like PASCAL VOC or SUN.
               However, the accuracy of machine annotations could be significantly raised by deep
               convolutional neural networks. The error rate of 6.7% reported with GoogLeNet
               (Szegedy et al. 2014) on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
               (ILSVRC) 2014 was already close to that of humans (5.1 %), until in 2015 the error
               rate of neural networks (He et al. 2015) was slightly lower (error rate: 4.94%) than
               human error on the ImageNet challenge. However, the human error rate is only based on
               a single annotator. Hence, no information about human inter-annotator agreement is
               available.</p>

            <p>A comparison of face identification capabilities of humans and machines was made for
               the first time in a Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) study in 2006 (Phillips et
               al. 2006). Thus, it has been shown - interestingly, already nearly 15 years ago -
               that industry-strength methods can compete with human performance in identifying
               unfamiliar faces under illumination changes. On the more recent as well as more
               challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark, human performance has also
               been reached by several approaches. Among several others, DeepFace (Taigman et al.
               2014) and FaceNet (Schroff et al. 2015) are prominent deep learning approaches
               reporting human-level (97.53%) results of 97.35% and 99.63% accuracy on the
               benchmark, practically solving the LFW dataset.</p>
            <p>While humans are relatively good at recognising persons, estimating or guessing the
               location and date of an image imposes a more difficult task for subtle spatial as
               well as temporal differences. Various systems have been proposed for earth scale
               photo geolocation that outperform human performance in this task. The latest of these
               (Seo et al. 2018; Vo et al. 2017; Weyand et al. 2016) employ deep learning methods
               consuming up to 90 million training images for an imposed classification task of
               cellular earth regions and/or rely on an extensive retrieval database. Current
               state-of-the-art results are reached by considering hierarchical as well as scene
               information of photos within the established classification approach, while using
               only 5 million training images (M√ºller-Budack et al. 2018). Since human performance
               reported on the established Im2GPS benchmark (Vo et al. 2017) is relatively poor in
               this task, the system clearly surpasses human ability to guess geolocation by 48.1%
               accuracy within a tolerated distance level of 200 km (predictions at region level). </p>
            <p>The creation date of (historical) photos is very hard to judge for periods of time
               that are quite similar. Therefore, a fundamental work (Palermo et al. 2012) predicts
               the decade of historical colour photos with an accuracy of 45.7% exceeding that of
               untrained humans (26.0% accuracy)., M√ºller et al. (2017) suggest a deep learning
               system that infers the capturing date of images taken between 1930 and 1999 in terms
               of 5-year periods. When comparing human and machine annotations by means of absolute
               mean error in years, the deep learning system achieves better results nearly at all
               periods and improves the overall mean error by more than three years.</p>
            <p>In general, the promising performance of the computer vision approaches compared to
               humans in Table 2 makes a strong case for their use in film studies. Although these
               methods are still prone to errors (to a lesser or greater extent), they can highly
               raise the exploration of media sources and help in finding patterns. In spite of the
               impressive performance of the selected approaches, computer vision approaches still
               have some shortcomings. Such approaches are optimized for specific visual content
               analysis tasks and rely on custom training data. Therefore, they have limited
               flexibility and cannot adapt to arbitrary images across different genres. While they
               perform well in basic computer vision tasks, humans are by far superior in grasping
               and interpreting images in their context, for example, in identifying gradual
               transitions between shots or in captioning images/videos.</p>

            <head>5 Conclusions and Future Prospects for Software Tools in Film Studies </head>
            <p>In this paper, we have reviewed off-the-shelf software solutions for film studies.
               Since quantitative approaches to film content analysis are a handy way to effectively
               explore basic filmic features (see Section 1), we have put a focus on offered
               functionalities regarding automated film style and content analysis. In this respect,
               only the tools Videana and VIAN offer a wider range of automated video analysis
               methods. However, with Videana not being developed anymore and the most recent tool
               VIAN focusing on film colour patterns, the field still lacks available tools that
               provide powerful state-of-the-art methods for visual content analysis. We discuss
               needed functionality in detail in the latter part of this section. Furthermore, we
               have outlined recent advances in the (automated) analysis of film style (shot and
               scene segmentation, use of camera motion or colours) as well as current developments
               and progress in the field of computer vision. As also discussed in the beginning of
               this paper, quantitative approaches are partially criticised for being incompatible
               with qualitative film analysis. To showcase the chances of basic computer vision
               approaches, we have compared machine and human performance in visual annotation
               tasks. We have shown that machine annotations are of similar quality to those of
               humans for some basic tasks like object classification, face recognition or
               geolocation estimation. Even when these methods do not reach human abilities, they
               can build a valid basis for exploring media sources for further manual inspection. </p>
            <p>What kind of basic and extended functionality for automated analysis and
               visualisation should a software tool have in order to support research in film
               studies? Previous practical experience with the basic functions of Videana has shown
               that such software is basically suitable for effectively supporting film research and
               teaching. However, film scholars often need more advanced functions tailored to their
               particular domain that allow the automatic detection of complex stylistic film
               elements such as the shot-reverse-shot technique. This requires, for example,
               detecting a series of alternating close-ups with a dialogue component and can be
               detected through the syntactic interaction of different factors. Starting from the
               smallest discontinuity in film, the cut, it is also possible to detect changing
               colour values or certain structural semantic properties such as the position of an
               object within consecutive shots. These could also allow drawing conclusions about
               changes within the storyline. Such forms of automatic segmentation and creating
               individual segments of events can be relevant in the context of narrative analyses.
               Researchers could be offered an effective structuring and orientation aid, which can
               undergo further manual differentiation based on content-related or motivic aspects.
               Therefore we envision a program that also offers a high degree of flexibility with
               regard to manual annotation opportunities. For a specific film or film corpus,
               individual survey parameters must be generated in order to judge their correlation
               with other parameters - depending on which hypotheses are to be applied to the object
               of investigation or can be formulated on the basis of the film material.</p>
            <p>Considering, for example, a film as a system of information mediation as in
               quantitative suspense research (Junkerj√ºrgen 2001; Weibel 2008, 2017), individual
               shots and sequences could be detected using automatic methods and manually be
               supplemented with further content parameters. Here, classifications such as the
               degree of information shared between the film character and the viewer (if the film
               viewer knows more or less than the character), the degree of correspondence between
               narrative time (duration of the film) and narrated time (time period covered by the
               filmic narrative), or the degree of narrative relevance (is the event only of
               relevance within the sequence or does it affect the central conflict of the
               narrative) are considered in order to draw conclusions about the suspense potential
               of a sequence. In the outlined framework, these factors favour the exploitation of
               the viewer's anticipation of damage - in particular their emotional connection to a
               film character - through a principle of delay, as primarily applied in battle
               sequences typical of action films. Due to the principle of delaying the resolution of
               a conflict, they have a low information gain in view of the entire narrative. The
               principles of this parameterisation can now be used to check which dramaturgical
               context is characterised by which formal characteristics in comparison with the
               editing parameters of Salt. This concept of data acquisition can be extended by
               further parameters such as the application of digital visual effects in individual
               sequences, which provides a differentiated insight into the internal dynamics and
               proportions of filmic representation systems. Especially with regard to
               computer-generated imagery, which is subject to development processes spanning
               decades, it is possible to examine on a longitudinal scale how this process has had a
               concrete effect on production practices. However, such highly complex interwoven data
               structures require sophisticated statistical models with which these hypotheses can
               be tested.</p>
            <p>Finally, a software tool adapted to the research object should be developed in a
               productive dialogue between computer science and film science. Such software for film
               studies could be based on experiences with software such as Videana or VIAN that
               allows for the evaluation of larger film corpora on a differentiated and reliable
               data basis, which cannot be generated with previous analysis instruments.
               Furthermore, it is desirable to include specific forms of information visualisations
               tailored to the needs of film scholars. Cinemetrics or Ligne de temps, as software
               designed for film studies, are also limited to a graphical representation that cannot
               take into account the requirements of narrative questions. Since an all-in-one
               approach will not fit to all analysis and visualisation requirements, such a tool
               should also provide an interface for plugins that offer additional functionality.
               Using these approaches, a large collection of research data can be gathered and
               exported for further processing, but the lack of a working digital environment for
               media science continues to be a problem. Statistical software or Microsoft Excel were
               not designed for the visualization of editing rhythms or narrative structures, which
               makes it difficult to process the corresponding data. An interdisciplinary
               cooperation could foster research in designing an optimal solution for scholarly film
               studies that allows direct interaction with the automatically determined parameters
               as well as their method-dependent annotation and graphical processing.</p>
            <p>In summary, the development of a comprehensive software solution for scientists who
               systematically carry out film or video analysis would be desirable. This group
               includes media and film scientists, but also scientists from other disciplines (e.g.,
               applications in journalism and media education, analysis of propaganda videos and
               political video works, image and educational films, television programmes). Also,
               empirical studies of media psychology in the field of event indexing require the
               annotation and analysis of structural properties of audiovisual research data.
               Factors such as the duration of an action segment as well as temporal, spatial,
               figure-related or action-related changes within the sequences (four dimension
               models), but also shot lengths are integrated into the research design and are
               prerequisites for the formulation of hypotheses and their empirical validation (Huff
               et al. 2014).</p>
            <p>An interdisciplinary all-in-one software tool of this kind should be openly available
               on a web-based platform, intuitive, easy to use and rely on state-of-the-art
               algorithms and technology. On the one hand, by providing automatic methods for the
               quantitative analysis of film material, large film and video corpora could become the
               object of investigation and hypotheses could, for example, be statistically tested;
               on the other hand, the interpretation would be simplified by different possibilities
               of visualisation. Last but not least, legal questions regarding the storage,
               processing and use of moving image material should be clarified and taken into
               account in the technical implementation.</p>
