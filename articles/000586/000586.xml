            <p>Access to audio collections is often restricted by institutions for copyright,
               privacy, and preservation reasons, but it is the lack of descriptive metadata and
               annotations that stands in the way of all levels of access and use. Libraries,
               archives, and museums (LAMs) often hold physical audio artifacts that are unmarked
               and lacking important identifiable information such as title, date, location,
               subject, participants, or context. Annotating is only one of a list of scholarly
               primitives including discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and
               representing <ptr target="#unsworth2000"/>. IIIF (International Image
               Interoperability Framework) is one standardized solution that LAMs have adopted for
               giving users the ability to perform these primitives with images held in cultural
               heritage institutions. The AudiAnnotate project builds on the new IIIF standards for
               AV to address the gaps in engaging with audio by developing a solution to bring
               together free audio annotation tools and the Web as a standardized collaboration and
               presentation platform. The AudiAnnotate use case presented here includes a
               presentation by Tanya Clement titled <title rend="quotes">Zora Neale Hurston's WPA
                  field recordings in Jacksonville, FL (1939)</title> which provides context to
               three recordings of Hurston created during the Works Project Administration Federal
               Writers Project from 1937-1942 and made available online at the Library of Congress

            <p>In recent years, increased concern over media degradation and obsolescence combined
               with the decreasing cost of digital storage has led libraries, archives, and museums
               (LAMs) to digitize audiovisual (AV) materials for improved access and long-term
               preservation. Yet, improving preservation and access must go far beyond digitization.
               The fact that digital AV collections are not well-represented in our national and
               international digital platforms, such as Europeana and the Digital Public Library of
               America (DPLA), demonstrates complicated factors surrounding how LAM institutions
               manage and facilitate access to digital surrogates. As of July 2020, Europeana
               comprised 55% images and 42% text objects, but only 1% sound objects and .5% video
               objects <ptr target="#europeana"/>. DPLA included 67% images and 32% text, with less
               than 1% sound objects, and moving image objects <ptr target="#dpla"/>. AV collections
               often include lectures, panels, and speeches; performances such as story-telling,
               oral histories, and poetry or dance performances; and other documentary AV historical
               artifacts. Yet, even while they are sometimes the only record of an event or an
               aural, visual, or performance tradition, AV digital artifacts remain underused and
               understudied. The goal of the AudiAnnotate Extensible Workflow (AWE) project is to
               accelerate access to, promote scholarship and teaching with, and extend understanding
               of significant digital AV collections in the humanities.</p>
            <p>
               <title rend="italic">The State of Recorded Sound Preservation in the United States: A
                  National Legacy at Risk in the Digital Age</title> (2010) by the Council on
               Library and Information Resources and the Library of Congress reports that if AV
               collections go unused, libraries and archives that hold AV collections from a diverse
               range of time periods, cultures, and contexts will not prioritize their preservation
                  <ptr target="#clir2010"/>. One successful response to the 2010 report has been the
               Radio Preservation Task Force (RPTF) of the Library of Congress. Created 2014, the
               RPTF’s primary goal has been <quote rend="inline">to support collaboration between
                  faculty researchers and archivists toward the preservation of radio
                  history</quote> by developing an online inventory of extant American radio
               archival collections and pedagogical guides for utilizing radio and sound archives
                  <ptr target="#rptf"/>. While significant work, this kind of inventory only
               provides surface-level access to limited information about some artifacts. A
               persistent lack of descriptive metadata about the content of AV materials continues
               to stand in the way of further levels of access and use. </p>
            <p> While increasingly more AV objects might be digitized, under-resourced LAMs must
               still spend valuable human labor listening to or watching AV media in real time to
               generate the basic metadata required to make these items indexable, searchable, and
               accessible online. LAMs often hold physical media artifacts that are unmarked and
               lacking important identifiable information such as title, date, location, subject,
               participants, or context. Beyond creating access and discovery points for
               researchers, this basic information can help LAM professionals organize these
               materials as well as decide whether there are cultural sensitivity, privacy, or
               copyright concerns at play in creating access to them. Generating the needed metadata
               is prohibitively time-consuming, and automatic, machine-generated metadata is an
               expensive process still very much in research and development and certainly not
               accessible to all.<note> The massive Media Digitization &amp; Preservation Initiative
                  at Indiana University, for example, has had to pursue a subsequent project — the
                  Mellon-funded AMP (<ref
                     target="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/21982">Audiovisual
                     Metadata Platform</ref>) — to develop a platform with automated mechanisms such
                  as machine learning to generate and manage basic library and archive metadata at
                  scale.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Even with simple metadata, AV materials may not include enough information to pique
               researcher and student engagement. Annotations are what John Unsworth has called
                  <term>a scholarly primitive</term> — an essential humanities method for adding
               context and meaning to cultural objects of study for use in research, teaching, and
               publication <ptr target="#unsworth2000"/>. Researchers annotate books when they are
               taking notes; students annotate print-outs of poems when they are discussing them in
               class; friends annotate faces on images on social media when they are trying to
               direct attention to a person on their post. With AV materials, users may want to
               annotate particular events such as when a speaker is speaking and who they are; the
               presence of chickens, gunshots, helicopters, or feedback from the crowd for a better
               sense of context; or when a speaker laughs, sings, yodels, plays an instrument, or
               switches languages in order to understand the genre of or audience for a performance.
               Annotations have been the basis for engaging audiences with cultural objects from the
               era of monks creating commentary on medieval manuscripts to current online scholarly
               pages, editions, and exhibits <ptr target="#clement2021"/>. Sometimes, if an AV
               object is not available online, annotations can provide context, like being able to
               read liner notes for a missing album. Further possibilities for access include the
               ability for scholars, students, or the public involved in larger projects across
               institutions to systematically, collaboratively annotate or the ability for LAMs to
               showcase user annotations by including them back into their digital asset management
               (DAM) systems. Presently, however, even when AV materials are made accessible by LAM
               institutions, these digital objects remain inaccessible for annotation and therefore
               inaccessible for learning, public comment, scholarship, and general use.</p>
            <p>Annotating is only one of a list of scholarly primitives including discovering,
               comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing <ptr
                  target="#unsworth2000"/>.<note> Clement and Fischer address how annotation
                  practices go back to the Medieval ages <ptr target="#clement2021"/>.</note> IIIF
               (International Image Interoperability Framework) is one standardized solution that
               LAMs have adopted to give users the ability to perform these primitives with images
               held in cultural heritage institutions. Comprising 56 global members including major
               research universities, national libraries, and world-renowned museums, archives,
               software companies, and other organizations, the IIIF Consortium has worked together
               since Fall 2011 to create, test, refine, implement, and promote the IIIF
               specifications for interoperable functionality and collaboration across repositories.
               IIIF uses linked data and W3C web standards to facilitate sharing digital image data,
               migrating across technology systems, and using third-party software to enhance access
               to images, allowing for viewing, zooming, comparing, manipulating, and working with
               annotated images on the Web. With IIIF, users can reference images linked from LAMs
               into software that allows them to manipulate the images in new ways without impacting
               the institution’s presentation of the item. Universal Viewer, for example, which has
               been under development by Digirati since 2012, is a community-developed open source
               project that allows users to zoom into an image using the IIIF image application
               programming interface (API), create annotations, and generate links to the zoomed,
               annotated regions. As a result, a user can focus on one part of Vincent Van Gogh’s
               painting <title rend="italic">Irises</title> at the J. Paul Getty Museum and annotate
               a particular brush-stroke. She can save this view, compare it against another part of
               the painting or another painting, and share this view with others. Storiiies is
               another project that demonstrates how third-party software can help users engage
               images at holding institutions to generate digital stories. In both cases, the
               institutions’ use of IIIF allows researchers to implement a broad range of online
               tools to discover, compare, refer, sample, illustrate, and represent their
               interpretations of these cultural heritage objects, which in turn encourages their
               broader use.</p>
            <p>As of June 2020, the IIIF-AV Technical Specification Group has extended the existing
               IIIF Presentation API (version 3) to accommodate rendering AV in a web browser. The
               AV group is actively welcoming contributions to their collection of AV user stories,
               mockups, and prototypes in order to make sure IIIF-AV is used by a broad audience.
               While IIIF has shared use cases for different kinds of AV manifests, including for
               album covers, oral histories, multi-track recordings, and AV with sign language,
               tools for exposing and playing these manifests are still under development.<note> See
                  the <title rend="quotes">IIIF Cookbook</title> and the example for a video viewer
                  with aligned transcripts as part of the Open Hypervideo Project and as part of the
                     <ref
                     target="http://universalviewer.io/examples/?manifest=http://wellcomelibrary.org/iiif/b17307922/manifest#?c=&amp;m=&amp;s=&amp;cv=&amp;manifest=http%3A%2F%2Fwellcomelibrary.org%2Fiiif%2Fb17307922%2Fmanifest"
                     >Universal Viewer</ref>.</note> Freely available, Universal Viewer displays
               annotations as captions on AV materials, but the annotations cannot be used to
               navigate the object or be shown separately from the AV object, a necessity for
               oft-restricted AV materials. The AWE project builds on these IIIF accomplishments,
               addressing the gaps in engaging with AV by developing a solution to bring together
               free AV annotation tools and the Web as a standardized collaboration and presentation
               platform.</p>
            <p>In response to the need for a workflow that supports IIIF manifest creation,
               collaborative editing, flexible modes of presentation, and permissions control, the
               AudiAnnotate Extensible Workflow (AWE) connects open source tools for annotation
               (such as Audacity), public code and document repositories (GitHub), and the
               AudiAnnotate web application for creating and sharing IIIF manifests and annotations.
               Usually limited by proprietary software and LAM systems with restricted access to AV,
               researchers can use AWE as a complete sequence of tools and transformations for
               accessing, identifying, annotating, and sharing annotations. LAMs will benefit from
               AWE as it facilitates metadata generation, is built on W3C web standards in IIIF for
               sharing online scholarship, and generates static web pages that are lightweight and
               easy to preserve and harvest. AWE represents a new kind of AV ecosystem where the
               exchange is opened between institutional repositories, annotation software, online
               repositories and publication platforms, and researchers.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Technical Development</head>
            <p>AWE owes much of its architectural direction to two projects that are built on the
               tenets of minimal computing: Readux (produced by the Emory Center for Digital
               Scholarship) and Ed. (developed by Alex Gil, in collaboration with Susanna Allés
               Torrent, Terry Catapano, and Johann Gillium). Readux is a tool for visually
               annotating digitized books and publishing the annotated texts as free-standing
               editions. Although the Readux application is a traditional web application (based on
               Django running against a Postgres database), when researchers export their editions,
               the images, text, and commentary are converted into static websites built using
               Jekyll and published to GitHub Pages. Ed. accomplishes a similar goal — producing
               static sites hosting digital editions — but uses an even simpler, Jekyll-based
               architecture to convert TEI-XML source or Markdown to web pages. Using Jekyll-based
               static sites and free hosting on GitHub pages is a sustainable model for hosting
               digital scholarship.<note> Later in this discussion we address how GitHub creates
                  other kinds of sustainability limitations and how to address those limitations.
               </note> The combination of a full web application for scholarly annotation and data
               processing with an export to a static site for preservation and presentation is the
               basis of the AWE approach.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Architecture</head>
            <p>The AudiAnnotate web application architecture is lightweight. Researchers create
               their own time-stamped annotations, provide a URL to the AV item, and upload the
               annotations to the AudiAnnotate application, which creates a static site that
               includes a playable edition or exhibit where the artifact, the annotations, and any
               introductory or other explanatory material can be viewed together. As a Ruby-on-Rails
               application that does not store data locally, the AudiAnnotate application eliminates
               the need to run a database or datastore. The application can be installed on a small,
               cloud instance, a 1GB Linode shared instance costing $5 USD per month. A further
               advantage to a databaseless architecture is that if the AudiAnnotate web application
               goes offline, the artifacts it produces will still be available on GitHub. Users with
               a basic understanding of Jekyll or Markdown can edit AudiAnnotate-created sites
               without the web application running at all. Furthermore, any other installation of
               the AudiAnnotate web application will have access to the same data created by
               previous installations, allowing projects to be transported from one institution to
               another without data migration.</p>
            <p>The AudiAnnotate workflow (AWE) is built on what coders call <term>glue code</term> —
               code that sticks a bunch of things together to make something useful. Annotation
               tools such as Audacity give users robust AV analysis and labelling tools from which a
               simple text file can be exported and used in AudiAnnotate. The AudiAnnotate
               application wraps references to online AV files and annotations in IIIF manifests to
               make them presentable in the Universal Viewer and publishes the sites using Jekyll to
               generate static pages.  Even the app itself takes advantage of the Ruby on Rails web
               framework, Open Source libraries for authentication and displaying tables, and GitHub
               to store everything it produces.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Implementation</head>
            <p>Researchers log into the AudiAnnotate web application using their GitHub account
               (enabled via GitHub’s OpenAuth implementation), which in turn enables the application
               to read from and write to that user’s repositories on GitHub. In order to prevent
               AudiAnnotate from modifying other projects under a researcher’s GitHub account, the
               application restricts its access to repositories tagged with the topic
                  <q>audiannotate.</q><note> This approach, and the use of the <ref
                     target="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search"><title rend="italic"
                        >GitHub</title> search API</ref> was suggested by similar functionality in
                     <ref target="https://cwrc-writer.cwrc.ca/">CWRC-Writer</ref> and conversations
                  with the CWRC-Writer team.</note> Once logged into the application, a researcher
               can start a new project, which creates a new repository under their account and
               populates it with a Jekyll template built to read AWE projects. It is important to
               note that the AudiAnnotate software does not store AV files or provide a means to
               generate annotations.<note> Some researchers have used the <ref
                     target="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</ref> or Audacity as storage and
                  annotating platforms. </note> A researcher adds an item to their project through
               the AudiAnnotate web form by providing a URL to an online AV object, a file that
               contains time-stamped annotations to that AV object, and minimal metadata about the
               AV source. When a user adds an item, the web application converts their form input
               into a IIIF v3.0 manifest JSON file, and saves it to the _data directory of the
               Jekyll site along with a stub page for the item. The resulting static site serves
               both the IIIF manifest as JSON and presents the AV file and its metadata on a static
               page embedding the Universal Viewer for playing the AV. When a researcher uploads the
               time-stamped annotation file they have already created, the AudiAnnotate application
               builds WebAnnotation JSON files, which are rendered into a static site by Jekyll and
               linked to the embedded viewer, allowing users to play related segments of AV by
               clicking on an annotation. Further interactivity — like sorting or filtering
               annotations — is provided through the JavaScript library DataTables.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Disadvantages</head>
            <p>Dependency on GitHub is the biggest limitation on the process of producing
               AudiAnnotate sites. Since AudiAnnotate relies not only on Git but on the GitHub API,
               producing new AudiAnnotate sites would be impossible without GitHub. In addition,
               legal sanctions prevent scholars in Iran, Cuba, and other countries from using GitHub
                  <ptr target="#github"/>. However, once the AudiAnnotate application creates a
               static site that is published to GitHub, that site does not have to stay on GitHub. A
                  <term>git clone</term> command or a zip download copies the site to a local
               computer, after which it can be run locally, served from any web server, or stored in
               a digital preservation system.</p>
            <p>While the system works well when only a few people are building AudiAnnotate sites,
               its reliance on GitHub can be a bottleneck when larger groups like a workshop or
               classroom all attempt to build sites at the same time. AudiAnnotate’s first workshop
               ran into a <q>Too many requests</q> error from GitHub because participants were
               pinging the GitHub API to simply list their existing AudiAnnotate projects. This was
               a limitation of the <soCalled>no database</soCalled> architecture — the AudiAnnotate
               app had no data to show without a connection to GitHub. Consequently, the
               application’s GitHub API connection was updated to use the authenticated user
               everywhere possible, which reduced the number of requests via the unauthenticated API
               connection. While the issue was resolved for the second workshop, delays still
               occurred in responses to API requests and when building sites. Because GitHub did not
               return a web page immediately when a request was kicked off, some users experienced
               errors. Ultimately, using the freely available services of a corporate-funded system
               like GitHub can be useful, especially for projects and teams with less funding, but
               it is one that comes with limitations.</p>

            <head>AudiAnnotate Use Case Examples</head>
            <p>The use case examples presented here include four kinds of projects that demonstrate
               how AWE provides new kinds of access to audio and video artifacts. The first example
               is an audio scholarly edition by Tanya Clement titled <ref
                  target="https://tanyaclement.github.io/znh_jacksonville_1939/"><title
                     rend="quotes">Zora Neale Hurston's WPA field recordings in Jacksonville, FL
                     (1939),</title></ref> which includes three recordings created during the Works
               Project Administration (WPA) Federal Writers Project from 1937-1942 and made
               available online at the Library of Congress as part of the
               Florida Folklife Collections’ Florida Memory project. Zora Neale Hurston was an
               African American ethnographer, novelist, and dramatist, a collector, speaker,
               performer, and writer of other people’s stories and her own. In the 1930s alone,
               Hurston wrote numerous short stories, journal articles, books, and musicals based on
               her ethnographic field work in Alabama, the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia, Haiti,
               Jamaica, and New Orleans.<note>

                     >The Great Day</title>, and <title rend="italic">Singing Steel</title>.
                  Posthumous publications that were also written during this time period include

                     <title rend="italic">Barracoon</title> (2018).</note> These specific recordings
               of Hurston performing songs she had collected were created on June 18, 1939 in the
               WPA offices in Jacksonville, Florida under the direction of Herbert Halpert with
               Carita Doggett Corse and Stetson Kennedy. In order to make Hurston’s performances
               more accessible, the Florida Memory project extracted 21 moments when Hurston sings
               and talks from the longer recordings.<note> The Florida Memory project titled their
                  playlist <title rend="italic">Dust Tracks</title>, after the title of Hurston’s
                  autobiography <title rend="italic">Dust Tracks on a Road</title> (1942).</note> In
               contrast to the Florida Memory abridged <q>playlist,</q> Clement’s scholarly edition
               is based on the full recordings and, consequently, facilitates listening to Hurston
               sing and talk within the context of the other songs, stories, and people recorded
               that day. Including stories shared by Beatrice Lange, which were told to her by the
               descendent of a rice plantation owner from South Georgia as well as Art Pages, the
               pianist for a Cuban band, and Rev. H. W. Stuckey of South Carolina, Buford County,
               the edition shows that listening to Hurston’s performances in context is important.
               As an African American woman and ethnographer from Florida, educated at Columbia
               University as well as in turpentine camps and juke joints in the Jim Crow South,
               Hurston played multiple roles in the WPA office as both collector and performer, as
               subject and object of inquiry, and as an authorized and unauthorized agent of the
               narrativization of African American folklore. The presentation of Hurston’s songs in
               the context of the other performances allows Clement to highlight conversations with
               Herbert Halpert, the white male lead and authorized <q>collector</q> as well as
               Carita Doggett Corse, Hurston’s white, female benefactor, and the songs and stories
               of the other performers, both white and Black, male and female, who provide a complex
               picture of the racialized and gendered endeavor that was folklore collecting in
               Florida in 1939.</p>
            <p>The second example, <ref

                     ><title rend="quotes">Example Sensitive Audio Lesson: John Beecher, McComb
                     ‘Criminal Syndicalism’ Case,</title></ref> is a lesson plan on using sensitive
               archival materials in the classroom developed by Bethany Radcliff and Kylie
               Warkentin. Radcliff and Warkentin base the lesson plan around a 1964 recording of a
               Civil Rights activism event from the John and Barbara Beecher Collection at the Harry
               Ransom Center (HRC) at the University of Texas in Austin. On the HRC website, the
               recording had been made accessible without any trigger or other warnings. While this
               recording highlights the voices of community activists, it also includes racist
               slurs, descriptions of imprisonment of Black high schoolers, and testimonies from
               concerned parents. In an attempt to practice trauma-informed pedagogy and avoid
               replicating oppression, the authors use the apparatus that AWE provides to present
               this audio within a context that guides students and instructors in their approaches
               to the conversation. A <q>Lesson Introduction and Overview</q> for the instructor
               gives resources on trauma-informed pedagogy, an overview of how to create a GitHub
               account and AWE project, and a full lesson plan for engaging students in audio
               annotation and working with sensitive materials. The next sections, <q>1. Considering

               <q>2. Analysis and Potential Annotation Routes,</q> and <q>3. Further Analysis and
                  Annotation in Groups,</q> comprise different activities for students including
               providing an annotated, time-stamped version of a clip from the audio, marked with
               trigger warnings for sensitive sections, and activities to lead students through a
               collaborative process of critical analysis with audio using annotation. The final
               sections <q>4. Presentation</q> and <q>Extension Activity Using Hypothesis</q> focus
               on using AudiAnnotate to present findings and introduce how to integrate Hypothes.is,

               to promote further discussion through collaborative annotation. </p>
            <p>The third and fourth use case examples are graduate student essays that demonstrate

               often proposes. In this multimedia essay, sections include scenes from the film with

               mark key scenes of interest as well as a discussion of the influence that annotation
               had on their scholarship. During the annotation process, the author’s perception of
               silent and early sound film shifted as they re-watched scenes dozens of times for
               minute details easily overlooked by audiences. The author discusses how this process
               helped them reconsider the editing techniques and industrial shifts in film editing
               of a hundred years ago. This project also deploys Hypothes.is as a means to invite
               public comment. The author starts the public conversation through Hypothes.is by
               creating her own Hypothes.is annotations as examples, including notes on background
               information on lesbian cinema history and on the role of production collaborators for
               the filming of <title rend="italic">Camille</title>. For this author, the ability to

            <p>These four projects (a scholarly edition, a lesson-plan, and two essays) show that
               increasing the use of AV in research and teaching — and therefore its preservation —

               order to make these collections more accessible. AWE facilitates such rich projects
               because it enables collaborative AV annotation and presentation through a minimalist
               computing workflow that depends on preexisting, free annotation software and on
               standardized web protocols the use of which is shared by free, community-rich
               platforms and tools such as GitHub and Hypothes.is. AWE is a sustainable and
               easy-to-use method that enhances how researchers and students are able to deploy
               scholarly primitives that, as the use cases show, go beyond annotation to include
               discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing.
               Increasing the use of AV materials and their preservation requires facilitating the
               production of new knowledge in sustainable ways.</p>
