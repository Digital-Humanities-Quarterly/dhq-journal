                  <p>Access to audio collections is often restricted by institutions for copyright,
                     privacy, and preservation reasons, but it is the lack of descriptive metadata and
                     annotations that stands in the way of all levels of access and use. Libraries,
                     archives, and Museusms (LAMs) often hold physical audio artifacts that are unmarked
                     and lacking important identifiable information such as title, date, location,
                     subject, participants, or context. Annotating is only one of a list of scholarly
                     primitives including discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and
                     representing (Unsworth). <a href="https://iiif.io/" onclick="window.open('https://iiif.io/'); return false" class="ref">IIIF (International Image

                     cultural heritage institutions. The AudiAnnotate project builds on the new IIIF

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In recent years, increased concern over media degradation and obsolescence combined
                     with the decreasing cost of digital storage has led libraries, archives, and museums
                     (LAMs) to digitize audiovisual (AV) materials for improved access and long-term
                     preservation. Yet, improving preservation and access must go far beyond digitization.
                     The fact that digital AV collections are not well-represented in our national and
                     international digital platforms, such as Europeana and the Digital Public Library
                     of
                     America (DPLA), demonstrates that complicated factors surrounding how LAM
                     institutions manage and facilitate access to digital surrogates. As of July 2020,
                     Europeana comprised 55% images and 42% text objects, but only 1% sound objects and
                     .5% video objects [<a class="ref" href="#europeana">Europeana</a>]. DPLA included 67% images and 32% text,
                     with less than 1% sound objects, and moving image objects [<a class="ref" href="#dpla">Digital Public Library of America</a>]. AV
                     collections often include lectures, panels, and speeches; performances such as
                     story-telling, oral histories, and poetry or dance performances; and other
                     documentary AV historical artifacts. Yet, even while they are sometimes the only
                     record of an event or an aural, visual, or performance tradition, they remain
                     underused and understudied. The goal of the AudiAnnotate Extensible Workflow (AWE)
                     project is to accelerate access to, promote scholarship and teaching with, and extend
                     understanding of significant digital AV collections in the humanities.</div>

                        National Legacy at Risk in the Digital Age</span> (2010) by the Council on Library
                     and Information Resources and the Library of Congress reports that if AV collections
                     go unused, libraries and archives that hold AV collections from a diverse range of
                     time periods, cultures, and contexts will not prioritize their preservation [<a class="ref" href="#clir2010">CLIR 2010</a>]. One successful response to the 2010 report has been the
                     Radio Preservation Task Force (RPTF) of the Library of Congress. Created 2014, the
                     RPTF’s primary goal has been “to support collaboration between
                     faculty researchers and archivists toward the preservation of radio
                     history” by developing an online inventory of extant American radio
                     archival collections and pedagogical guides for utilizing radio and sound archives
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rptf">Radio Preservation Task Force</a>]. While significant work, this kind of inventory only
                     provides surface-level access. A persistent lack of descriptive metadata about the
                     content of AV materials continues to stand in the way of further levels of access
                     and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> While increasingly more AV objects might be digitized, under-resourced LAMs must
                     still spend valuable human labor listening to or watching AV media in real time to
                     generate the basic metadata required to make these items indexable, searchable, and
                     accessible online. LAMs often hold physical media artifacts that are unmarked and
                     lacking important identifiable information such as title, date, location, subject,
                     participants, or context. Beyond creating access and discovery points for
                     researchers, this basic information can help LAM professionals organize these
                     materials as well as decide whether there are cultural sensitivity, privacy, or
                     copyright concerns at play in creating access to them. Generating the needed metadata
                     is prohibitively time-consuming, and automatic, machine-generated metadata is an
                     expensive process still very much in research and development and certainly not
                     accessible to all.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e240">[1]</a>

                     researcher and student engagement. Annotations are what John Unsworth has called
                     <em class="term">a scholarly primitive</em> — an essential humanities method for adding
                     context and meaning to cultural objects of study for use in research, teaching, and
                     publication [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2000">Unsworth 2000</a>]. Researchers annotate books when they are
                     taking notes; students annotate print-outs of poems when they are discussing them
                     in
                     class; friends annotate faces on images on social media when they are trying to
                     direct attention to a person on their post. With AV materials, users may want to
                     annotate particular events: when a speaker is speaking and who they are; the presence
                     of chickens, gunshots, helicopters, or feedback from the crowd for a better sense
                     of
                     context; or when a speaker laughs, sings, yodels, plays an instrument, or switches
                     languages in order to understand the genre of or audience for a performance.
                     Annotations have been the basis for engaging audiences with cultural objects from
                     the
                     era of monk’s creating commentary on medieval manuscripts to current online scholarly
                     pages, editions, and exhibits. Sometimes, if an AV object is not available online,
                     annotations can provide context, like being able to read liner notes for a missing
                     album. Further possibilities for access include the ability for scholars, students,
                     or the public involved in larger projects across institutions to systematically,
                     collaboratively annotate or the ability for LAMs to showcase user annotations by
                     including them back into their digital asset management (DAM) systems. Presently,
                     however, even when AV materials are made accessible by LAM institutions, these
                     digital objects remain inaccessible for annotation and therefore inaccessible for
                     learning, public comment, scholarship, and general use.</div>

                     (International Image Interoperability Framework) is one standardized solution that
                     LAMs have adopted to give users the ability to perform these primitives with images
                     held in cultural heritage institutions. Comprising 56 global members including major
                     research universities, national libraries, and world-renowned museums, archives,
                     software companies, and other organizations, the IIIF Consortium has worked together
                     since Fall 2011 to create, test, refine, implement, and promote the IIIF
                     specifications for interoperable functionality and collaboration across repositories.
                     IIIF uses linked data and W3C web standards to facilitate sharing digital image data,
                     migrating across technology systems, and using third-party software to enhance access
                     to images, allowing for viewing, zooming, comparing, manipulating and working with
                     annotated images on the Web. With IIIF, users can reference images linked from LAMs
                     into software that allows them to manipulate the images in new ways without impacting
                     the institution’s presentation of the item. Universal Viewer, for example, which has
                     been under development by Digirati since 2012, is a community-developed open source
                     project that allows users to zoom into an image using the IIIF image application
                     programming interface (API), create annotations, and generate links to the zoomed,
                     annotated regions. As a result, a user can focus on one part of Vincent Van Gogh’s
                     painting <cite class="title italic">Irises</cite> at the J. Paul Getty Museum and annotate
                     a particular brush-stroke. She can save this view, compare it against another part
                     of
                     the painting or another painting, and share this view with others. Storiiies is
                     another project that demonstrates how third-party software can help users engage
                     images at holding institutions to generate digital stories. In both cases, the
                     institutions’ sue of IIIF allows users to use a broad range of online tools to
                     discover, compare, refer, sample, illustrate, and represent their interpretations
                     of
                     these cultural heritage objects, which in turn encourages their broader use.</div>

                     Torrent, Terry Catapano, and Johann Gillium). Readux is a tool for visually
                     annotating digitized books and publishing the annotated texts as free-standing
                     editions. Although the Readux application is a traditional web application (based
                     on
                     Django running against a Postgres database), when researchers export their editions,
                     the images, text, and commentary are converted into static websites built using
                     Jekyll and published to GitHub Pages. Ed. accomplishes a similar goal — producing
                     static sites hosting digital editions — but uses an even simpler, Jekyll-based
                     architecture to convert TEI-XML source or Markdown to web pages. Using Jekyll-based
                     static sites and free hosting on GitHub pages is a sustainable model for hosting
                     digital scholarship<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e290">[4]</a>. The combination of a full web application for scholarly annotation and data
                     processing with an export to a static site for preservation and presentation is the
                     basis of the AWE approach.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The AudiAnnotate web application architecture is lightweight. Researchers create
                     their own time-stamped annotations, provide a URL to the AV item, and upload the
                     annotations to the AudiAnnotate application, which creates a static site that
                     includes a playable edition or exhibit where the artifact, the annotations, and any
                     introductory or other explanatory material can be viewed together. As a Ruby-on-Rails
                     application that does not store data locally, the AudiAnnotate application eliminates
                     the need to run a database or datastore. The application can be installed on a small,
                     cloud instance, a 1GB Linode shared instance costing $5 USD per month. A further
                     advantage to a databaseless architecture is that if the AudiAnnotate web application
                     goes offline, the artifacts it produces will still be available on GitHub. Users with
                     a basic understanding of Jekyll or Markdown can edit AudiAnnotate-created sites
                     without the web application running at all. Furthermore, any other installation of
                     the AudiAnnotate web application will have access to the same data created by
                     previous installations, allowing projects to be transported from one institution to
                     another without data migration.</div>

                     to read from and write to that user’s repositories on GitHub. In order to prevent
                     AudiAnnotate from modifying other projects under a researcher’s GitHub account, the
                     application restricts its access to repositories tagged with the topic
                     “audiannotate.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e314">[5]</a> Once logged into the application, a researcher can start a new
                     project, which creates a new repository under their account and populates it with
                     a
                     Jekyll template built to read AWE projects. It is important to note that the
                     AudiAnnotate software does not store AV files or provide a means to generate
                     annotations.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e326">[6]</a> A researcher
                     adds an item to their project through the AudiAnnotate web form by providing a URL
                     to
                     an online AV object, a file that contains time-stamped annotations to that AV object,
                     and minimal metadata about the AV source. When a user adds an item, the web
                     application converts their form input into a IIIF v3.0 manifest JSON file, and saves
                     it to the _data directory of the Jekyll site along with a stub page for the item.
                     The
                     resulting static site serves both the IIIF manifest as JSON and presents the AV file
                     and its metadata on a static page embedding the Universal Viewer for playing the AV.
                     When a researcher uploads the time-stamped annotation file they have already created,
                     the AudiAnnotate application builds WebAnnotation JSON files, which are rendered into
                     a static site by Jekyll and linked to the embedded viewer, allowing users to play
                     related segments of AV by clicking on an annotation. Further interactivity–like
                     sorting or filtering annotations–is provided through the Javascript library

                     AudiAnnotate sites. Since AudiAnnotate relies not only on Git but on the GitHub API,
                     producing new AudiAnnotate sites would be impossible without GitHub. In addition,
                     legal sanctions prevent scholars in Iran, Cuba, and other countries from using GitHub
                     [<a class="ref" href="#github">GitHub and Trade Controls</a>]. However, once the AudiAnnotate application creates a

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">While the system works well when only a few people were building AudiAnnotate sites
                     at a time, its reliance on GitHub can be a bottleneck when larger groups like a
                     workshop or classroom all attempted to build sites at the same time. AudiAnnotate’s
                     first workshop ran into a “Too many requests” error from GitHub because
                     participants were pinging the GitHub API to simply list their existing AudiAnnotate
                     projects. This was a limitation of the “no database” architecture
                     — the AudiAnnotate app had no data to show without a connection to GitHub.
                     Consequently, the application’s GitHub API connection was updated to use the
                     authenticated user everywhere possible, which reduced the number of requests via the
                     unauthenticated API connection. While the issue was resolved for the second workshop,
                     delays still occurred in responses to API requests and when building sites. Because
                     GitHub did not return a web page immediately when a request was kicked off, some
                     users experienced errors. Ultimately, using the freely available services of a
                     corporate-funded system like GitHub can be useful, especially for projects and teams
                     with less funding, but it is one that comes with limitations.</div>

                     how AWE provides new kinds of access to audio and video artifacts. The first example
                     is an audio scholarly edition by Tanya Clement titled “Zora Neale
                     Hurston's WPA field recordings in Jacksonville, FL (1939),” which includes
                     three recordings created during the Works Project Administration (WPA) Federal
                     Writers Project from 1937-1942 and made available online at the Library of Congress
                     as part of the Florida Folklife Collections’ Florida Memory project. Zora Neale
                     Hurston was an African American ethnographer, novelist, and dramatist, a collector,
                     speaker, performer, and writer of other people’s stories and her own. In the 1930s
                     alone, Hurston wrote numerous short stories, journal articles, books and musicals
                     based on her ethnographic field work in Alabama, the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia,
                     Haiti, Jamaica, and New Orleans.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e366">[7]</a> These specific recordings of Hurston
                     performing songs she had collected were created on June 18, 1939 in the WPA offices
                     in Jacksonville, Florida under the direction of Herbert Halpert with Carita Doggett
                     Corse and Stetson Kennedy. In order to make Hurston’s performances more accessible,
                     the Florida Memory project extracted 21 moments when Hurston sings and talks from
                     the
                     longer recordings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e394">[8]</a> In contrast to the Florida Memory abridged
                     “playlist,” Clement’s scholarly edition is based on the full recordings and,
                     consequently, facilitates listening to Hurston sing and talk within the context of
                     the other songs, stories, and people recorded that day. Including stories shared by
                     Beatrice Lange, which were told to her by the descendent of a rice plantation owner
                     from South Georgia as well as Art Pages, the pianist for a Cuban band, and Rev. H.
                     W.
                     Stuckey of South Carolina, Buford County, the edition shows that listening to
                     Hurston’s performances in context is important. As an African American woman and
                     ethnographer from Florida, educated at Columbia University as well as in turpentine
                     camps and juke joints in the Jim Crow South, Hurston played multiple roles in the
                     WPA
                     office as both collector and performer, as subject and object of inquiry, and as an
                     authorized and unauthorized agent of the narrativization of African American
                     folklore. The presentation of Hurston’s songs in the context of the other
                     performances allows Clement to highlight conversations with Herbert Halpert, the
                     white male lead and authorized “collector” as well as Carita Doggett Corse,
                     Hurston’s white, female benefactor, and the songs and stories of the other
                     performers, both white and Black, male and female, who provide a complex picture of
                     the racialized and gendered endeavor that was folklore collecting in Florida in
                     1939.</div>

                     sensitive archival materials in the classroom developed by Bethany Radcliff and Kylie
                     Warkentin. Radcliff and Warkentin base the lesson plan around a 1964 recording of
                     a
                     Civil Rights activism event from the John and Barbara Beecher Collection at the Harry

                     recording had been made accessible without any trigger or other warnings. While this
                     recording highlights the voices of community activists, it also includes racist
                     slurs, descriptions of imprisonment of Black high schoolers, and testimonies from
                     concerned parents. In an attempt to practice trauma-informed pedagogy and avoid
                     replicating oppression, the authors use the apparatus that AWE provides to present
                     this audio within a context that guides students and instructors in their approaches
                     to the conversation. A “Lesson Introduction and Overview” for the instructor
                     gives resources on trauma-informed pedagogy, an overview of how to create a GitHub
                     account and AWE project, and a full lesson plan for engaging students in audio
                     annotation and working with sensitive materials. The next sections, “1. Considering

                     “2. Analysis and Potential Annotation Routes,” and “3. Further Analysis and
                     Annotation in Groups,” comprise different activities for students including
                     providing an annotated, time-stamped version of a clip from the audio, marked with
                     trigger warnings for sensitive sections, and activities to lead students through a
                     collaborative process of critical analysis with audio using annotation. The final
                     sections “4. Presentation” and “Extension Activity Using Hypothesis” focus
                     on using AudiAnnotate to present findings and introduce how to integrate Hypothes.is,

                     shape scholarship. “The Kindergarten Teacher” by Zoe
                     Bursztajn-Illingworth is an investigation of poetic voice and address on screen in
                     Sarah Colangelo’s film The Kindergarten Teacher (2018). The project shows that
                     annotating scenes from the film shaped the author’s dissertation chapter, “Right Voice, Wrong Body: The Kindergarten Teacher, Poetic Address,
                     and Voice as Possession.” Through the process of annotation, the author
                     observed how the film’s form reveals poetic voice as dialogic and public as opposed
                     to a monologic, private utterance as lyric theory often proposes. In this multimedia
                     essay, sections include scenes from the film with timestamped annotations alongside
                     prose sections where the scenes are discussed further in the larger context of film

                     part of a Masters thesis on reception studies and queer interest in early Hollywood
                     film. Again, this author provides access to Camille<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e438">[9]</a> with annotations that
                     mark key scenes of interest as well as a discussion of the influence that annotation
                     had on their scholarship. During the annotation process, the author’s perception of
                     silent and early sound film shifted as they re-watched scenes dozens of times for
                     minute details easily overlooked by audiences. The author discusses how this process
                     helped them reconsider the editing techniques and industrial shifts in film editing
                     of a hundred years ago. This project also deploys Hypothes.is as a means to invite
                     public comment. The author starts the public conversation through Hypothes.is by
                     creating her own Hypothes.is annotations as examples, including notes on background

                     discussion around Camille means their project “is as much about
                     the preservation of these endangered silent films as it is about my thesis

                     increasing the use of AV in research and teaching — and therefore its preservation
                     —
                     is about more than just creating access. The State of Recorded Sound Preservation
                     in
                     the United States: A National Legacy at Risk in the Digital Age includes a survey
                     of
                     scholars whose work is primarily with audio and concluded that scholars wanted
                     unfettered access and better discovery tools for <em class="term">deep listening</em> or
                     “listening for content, in note, performance, mood, texture,
                     and technology”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#clir2010">CLIR 2010</a>, 41; 157]. The report also suggests that training for
                     archivists and librarians in sound preservation must include <em class="term">critical
                        listening</em> skills [<a class="ref" href="#clir2010">CLIR 2010</a>, 147] because librarians and
                     archivists need to know what scholars and students want to do with sound artifacts
                     in
                     order to make these collections more accessible. AWE facilitates such rich projects
                     because it enables collaborative AV annotation and presentation through a minimalist
                     computing workflow that depends on preexisting, free annotation software and on
                     standardized web protocols the use of which is shared by free, community-rich
                     platforms and tools such as GitHub and Hypothes.is. AWE is a sustainable and
                     easy-to-use method that enhances how researchers and students are able to deploy
                     scholarly primitives that, as the use cases show, go beyond annotation to include
                     discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing.
                     Increasing the use of AV materials and their preservation requires facilitating the
                     production of new knowledge in sustainable ways.</div>
