         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>In this article we propose different methods of encoding, according to the TEI
               Guidelines, three different cases of genetic or compositional textual variants found
               in the autographs of the Italian contemporary poet Valerio Magrelli. These encoding
               experiments reflect the diverse nature of the artifacts and represent a critical
               assessment of the effectiveness of present encoding practices for the
               multidimensional and pragmatic aspects of authorial drafts. Thus far, it seems that
               the TEI has yet to offer a convincing theoretical model and adequate practical
               solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally present in
               manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general. Our conclusion is that there
               is a potential conflict between the linear and hierchical nature of current formal
               language systems such as XML, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing
               process. In such cases we may have to rethink present models of document modeling,
               and to develop, within an adequate epistemological framework, a new theory of digital
               text.</p>

            <p>In this paper we shall try to uncover, through some experiments in digital
               text-encoding, the complex multidimensional and interactive reality of the process of
               composition. This complexity emerges as a result of problems encountered in the
               description and representation of a series of autographic literary texts. The
               historical and theoretical background of our work is represented by various
               philological-critical schools such as the Italian criticism of variants (<foreign xml:lang="it">critica delle varianti</foreign>), French genetic criticism and the
               Anglo-American tradition of textual bibliography.<note>Of the number of studies on
                  the dynamics of the textual process (mostly modern and contemporary) the first
                  proposals for computational solutions appeared at the beginning of the 90s; see in
                  particular <ptr target="#brockbank1991"/>, <ptr target="#lebrave1991"/>, <ptr target="#mordenti1992"/> and <ptr target="#ferrer1995"/>. However, it is Jerome
                  McGann <ptr target="#mcgann2001"/>, perhaps more than any other scholar in the
                  last few years, who has advanced the idea of text dynamics by developing a
                  theoretical direction begun by Donald F. McKenzie <ptr target="#mckenzie1986"/>,
                  and by applying it to important digital projects. Useful overviews of the
                  connections between genetic criticism, Anglo-American textual bibliography and
                  other European philological schools of thought are provided by <ptr target="#morras1999"/>, <ptr target="#lernout1996"/> and more recently by
                  contributions to the first volumes of <emph>Variants,</emph> the review of the
                     <ref target="http://www.textualscholarship.eu/">European Society for Textual
                     Scholarship</ref>. For a reconstruction of the historic and theoretical links
                  between Italian variant criticism and French genetic criticism see <ptr target="#giaveri1993"/>, and the recent contributions in the international
                  journal <title rend="italic">Ecdotica</title>.</note> Each one of these traditions
               have developed, since the beginning of the 20th century, different critical
               instruments and approaches; however they all seem to share a common idea: a literary
               work (and in general every <q>script act</q>) can be regarded not merely as a
               product, but as the result of a dynamic process of interaction between several
               factors and influences of a linguistic, cultural and social nature.<note>On this
                  basis, referring to Hans Zeller <ptr target="#zeller1975"/>, Peter Shillingsburg
                  and Jerome McGann (although omitting to mention Italian variant criticism and
                  French genetic criticism), Susan Schreibman has coined the term
                     <term>versioning</term> to describe the new editorial theory, which ought to be
                  reserved for the development of digital <foreign>variorum</foreign> editions <ptr target="#schreibman2002" loc="288"/>. For a recent attempt to import French
                  textual scholarship into the Anglo-American context see <ptr target="#bushell2007"/>.</note> This attention to processes is also studied in pragmatics <ptr target="#austin1976"/>, whose contribution to the study of textual fluidity has
               been explicitly recognised in the text-critical domain in a recent article by Peter
               Shillingsburg <ptr target="#shillingsburg2006"/>.<note>Shillingsburg developed the
                  concept of <q>script acts</q> mentioned above.</note> Although there is no room
               here to investigate the pragmatic aspects of autographic writing, it is obvious that
               the typical illocutory and dialogic nature of the textual and graphic-semantic
               elements of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">avant-texte</foreign> constitutes a relatively
               fertile area for pragmatic analysis.<note>French genetic criticism refers to a single
                  or multiple authorial writing artifact as <emph>avant-texte</emph> (pre-text),
                  while the entire corpus of manuscripts, drafts, notes, etc., is termed
                     <emph>dossier genetique.</emph>
               </note> The <foreign xml:lang="fr">avant-texte</foreign> is a <emph>communicative
                  system</emph>: the signs on the manuscript page are primarily interpretations of
                  <q>actions,</q> and the dialogue involves the author not only as a subject in
               multiple roles (author/reader, author/corrector, author/critic, etc.), but also in
               triangular relations such as editor/author/editor as in the case of
               proof-editing.</p>
            <p>One of the main issues that emerged from our encoding experiment can also be
               formulated as a question: can the multidimensional and pragmatic nature of different
               writing stages/sketches be represented with the help of digital instruments? As we
               will see, a tentative answer to this question leads to the admission that any
               transformation from paper to bits, apart from leading to certain developments, all
               potentially <q>intrusive</q> for the document, is no ordinary event, nor is it
               technically neutral. The first stage is the conversion of the textual content and
               structure of the original document into digital form. This process, far from
               representing a simple copying of a document from one medium to another, is actually a
               hermeneutic and semiotic process, for in the moment in which a text is transcribed
               through the selection and the use of markup this creates meaning in itself. It is
               also a pragmatic process, since markup is not only able to represent but also to
                  <emph>create</emph> actions <ptr target="#renear2005" loc="28"/>. In the words of
               one of the Italian pioneers of humanities computing:</p>
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block" source="#gigliozzi1998">We must understand and keep in mind that at the moment of data
                  entry the text (the entire quantity of information contained within it) is being
                  entrusted to a different channel from that in which it has survived until now (if
                  one of the elements of the system of communication changes, the others necessarily
                  change as well). We must also always remember that transcription is in any case an
                  interpretative act that manifests itself at the very moment in which we take any
                  decision: from the simplest — is this element a full stop, the end of an
                  abbreviation or a dash? – to the more complex — is this other case a verse, a
                  single verse on two printed lines, or two verses?</quote>
               <ptr target="#gigliozzi1998" loc="228"/>
            </cit>
            <p>Such <q>decisions</q> imply a perspective, a selection of aspects, a method of
               analysis and a choice of an encoding model, to arrive at a representation of the text
               out of so many possibilities — an encoding that we realize through a markup language
               permits us to formally describe the structure of a text, and to analyze the data in
               depth. Its utility will be in proportion to how much information it can set out,
               include and preserve. However, it will not be possible, and would hardly be
               desirable, to represent all aspects an ideal reader would see in a text. The printing
               bias has forced us to think of a text as a stable product, but if we either look at
               the different historical representations of a given text or at its documented writing
               stages, we realize that there is not one text, but many texts, as many as there are
               mechanisms of writing, material production, intertextual paths and methodologies of
               reconstruction.</p>
            <p>Nowadays the most powerful device for the representation and digital analysis of
               literary texts is XML (Extensible Markup Language), which provides a rigorous syntax
               for representing the deep structure of a text. XML is a metalanguage, that is to say
               a system for defining tags that describe the role played by every element within a
               text. Apart from technical advantages (portability, standardisation, flexibility,
               representational power) markup languages have been credited with allowing the scholar
               to make his own interpretation of the text more explicit <ptr target="#ciotti2005" loc="9–42"/>.</p>
            <p>Of course, markup languages, like any other technological instrument, are not
               perfect. They impose a hierarchical structure, which is normally used as a container
               for the text.<note>Even non-XML based markup systems like LMNL and TexMECS still
                  model the text as a hierarchical structure (although not as a tree). In any case
                  they are described as <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#johnsen2007">purely experimental</quote>
                     <ptr target="#johnsen2007"/>
                  </cit> and <cit>

                     <ptr target="#tennison2009"/>
                  </cit> by their own authors, and so are not yet practical alternatives. COCOA,
                  though often cited as allowing non-hierarchical structures, in fact imposes no
                  real structure on the text other than to define a reference system <ptr target="#hockey1988"/>.</note> This can lead to major difficulties in cases
               where the text cannot be reduced to such a structure. The <q>well-formedness</q> of
               XML, the requirement that every element, except for the document root, must be
               contained in some other element, gives the text an explicit and unambiguous
               structure. This principle is in contrast with what Buzzetti defines as the <cit>

                  <ptr target="#buzzetti2002"/>
               </cit>. A number of recent papers have underlined the seriousness of the problems
               that such dynamic instability poses for XML markup. For example, <ptr target="#vetter2003"/> explore the main techniques for recording variants taken
               from the TEI Guidelines, as well as several ad hoc methods for interlinking them in
               the poetry of Emily Dickinson. They conclude rather negatively that no method for
               recording Dickinson’s variants proves to be <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#vetter2003">entirely satisfactory</quote>
                  <ptr target="#vetter2003" loc="151"/>
               </cit>. <ptr target="#vanhoutte2006"/> likewise, in applying modern encoding
               techniques to record the variation of the manuscript antecedents of a classic Flemish
               novel, remarks, <quote rend="inline" source="#vanhoutte2006">The modern manuscript shows a much more
                  complicated web of interwoven and overlapping relationships of elements and
                  structures</quote> [than the printed book]. And although not a case of a modern
               manuscript, <ptr target="#bart2006"/> describes the problems of encoding variation in
               the Ht manuscript of Piers Plowman, such as variation in line numbering and the
               encoding of variants between physical versions, for which the author had often to
               resort to <quote rend="inline" source="#bart2006">the shameless application of technical duct
                  tape.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Specific cases can always be dismissed as anomalies, but these problems appear to be
               serious enough to warrant further investigation. Since we work on modern manuscripts,
               and on visualising the encoding of such texts, we are interested in discovering
               whether the <title rend="italic">Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines</title> (TEI)
               are in fact sufficient to encode modern manuscript material. Investigation of
               specific cases does have the advantage of providing a wealth of fine detail that
               can’t be derived from purely theoretical or technical investigations.</p>
            <p>The TEI offers a rich collection of guidelines, originally for the encoding of
               ancient texts, although in later editions it has included specific guidelines for the
               textual phenomena of modern and contemporary texts <ptr target="#burnard2007" loc="Ch. 11"/>. The encoding of these elements, which Vanhoutte calls the <quote rend="inline" source="#vanhoutte2003">temporal unity</quote> of writing, is often problematic <ptr target="#vanhoutte2003" loc="12"/> or <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#pierazzo2007">very complicated, if not impossible</quote>
                  <ptr target="#pierazzo2007" loc="151"/>
               </cit>. Any movement of the text <emph>forwards</emph> or <emph>backwards</emph> in
               time (cf. below § 2.3) naturally tends to generate overlapping structures. However,
               the spatial dimension can also represent a problem: we need only think of modern
               poetic texts, in which it is often very difficult to recover the structure of a
               composition in strophes and verses. The following paragraphs are an attempt to
               confront these clashes of theory and practice via a case study: the encoding of three
               compositions and their various writing phases by the Italian poet and writer Valerio
               Magrelli.</p>

            <head>2. TEI-XML Encoding of the Poetry of Valerio Magrelli</head>
            <p>Our encoding experiment focuses on the three poems (<title rend="quotes">Molto
                  sottrae il sonno alla vita,</title>
               <title rend="quotes">Essere matita è segreta ambizione,</title>
               <title rend="quotes">Ecco la lunga palpebra della donna</title>) written between 1975
               and 1979, which then appeared in the first section (<title rend="quotes">Rima
                  palpebralis</title>) of the anthology <title rend="italic">Ora serrate
                  retinae</title> edited by Feltrinelli in 1980.</p>
            <p>For each poem we have been able to access and scan the author’s original version,
               which in its natural state <foreign>in fieri</foreign> poses the most important and
               significant problems of representation. There are also further typewritten versions,
               gathered and <emph>recatalogued</emph> by the author in various notebooks,<note>For a
                  description of these materials see on the web site the introduction by Tommaso
                  Lisa (now in <ptr target="#lisa2004" loc="9–23"/>).</note> in which we find again
               the strong presence of textual variation, the definitive printed edition and in some
               cases a printed version in French. The author continued to edit his own texts until
               the appearance of the printed version, but our work is concentrated on the first two
               stages of the process of writing the three poems mentioned above: the two autographs
               of the first two poems (<title rend="quotes">Molto sottrae il sonno alla vita</title>
               and <title rend="quotes">Essere matita è segreta ambizione</title>) and two
               typescripts with corrections in the author’s hand in the case of the third (<title rend="quotes">Ecco la lunga palpebra della donna</title>).<note>A TEI-XML encoding
                  of all the writing drafts (autographs, typewritten and printed versions) of a
                  corpus of approximately ten compositions by Valerio Magrelli is available in <ptr target="#martiradonna2004"/>.</note>

               </head>
               <p>In our encoding we have tried to represent the movement of writing, whose
                  intention was to produce, by each new editorial action and variation, a new text
                  and a new context. As Allen Renear noted <ptr target="#renear2005"/>, it is
                  possible to apply the categories of pragmatic analysis, and in particular the
                  notion of illucotory acts, to better analyse and define the scope and specific
                  uses of markup. As will be seen, we are forced to use markup to favour the
                  illocutory force of the author’s own text (its dialogic-contextual dimension)
                  rather than limit ourselves to recording phenomena in a sequential and, as it
                  were, <q>external</q> fashion. In philological terms this means that after a
                  process, here outlined, consisting of sketches, proofs and discards, we have
                  decided to favour the diachronic aspect, establishing different phases of writing
                  and rewriting, and emphasising the significance of the author’s interaction with
                  the text. As a result, since the choice of encoding is never neutral, either the
                  graphical aspect of the page or the synchronic actions of writing will be
                  sacrificed. Also because, as we noted above, as a result of the limits imposed by
                  the instruments of encoding, often the simultaneous representation of both aspects
                  becomes excessively difficult if not absolutely impossible.</p>

                  customised modules such as Drama and MS. These contain a selection of various
                  parts of the overall Guidelines and help reduce the complexity and size of the
                  tagset. The TEI also provides specific elements for the representation of poetic
                  texts. The basic plan is the following:</p>
               <p>
                  <eg> &lt;lg&gt; &lt;l&gt;verse&lt;/l&gt; &lt;l&gt;verse&lt;/l&gt;
                     &lt;l&gt;verse&lt;/l&gt; &lt;/lg&gt; </eg>
               </p>
               <p>The <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> tag groups the strophe as a unit, while the
                     <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> element specifies the verse.<note>As expected by all
                     markup languages derived from SGML (such as HTML), elements are required to
                     start with an opening tag and end with a closing tag (the forward slash
                        <code>/</code> indicates the closing of a tag). Since there is no room here
                     for a precise description of TEI-XML we are constrained to refer to the manual
                     of Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen <ptr target="#burnard2005"/> or to the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org">TEI website</ref>.</note> In our analysis we
                  chose not to use this model (which is more applicable to the representation of
                  non-contemporary poetry), primarily because the author’s originals in this case
                  don’t always contain an explicit division into verses, which was often added by
                  the author at a later time or not at all; and secondly because this subdivision is
                  itself subject to alteration and hence must be considered as part of the
                  phenomenon of textual variation.</p>
               <p>We see here the first example of the complexity of the textual phenomena from the
                  encoding of a fragment of the autograph of <title rend="quotes">Molto
                     Sottrae</title>
                  <ref target="#figure01">Figure 01</ref>, the poem that opens the collection both

               <div>
                  <head>2.1.1 First Encoding</head>
                  <p>The first attempt at encoding had the objective of describing the physical
                     structure of the page, and considered the autograph at one instant in its
                     history rather than as the result of a succession of events. It was immediately
                     noticed (fortunately for us) that the original layers of correction could be
                     identified by the use of two colors: a red pen for the first draft (<title rend="quotes">Il sonno è l'indiscreto ospite // irresistibile</title>) and a
                     blue pen for corrections and additions (<title rend="quotes">&lt;E&gt; si
                        allarga &lt;nel corpo&gt; come un secondo corpo intollerabile...</title>).
                     As we will see later, thanks to the use of color we can discern with certainty
                     at least four successive stages of corrections by the author, assuming they
                     were carried out at different times.</p>
                  <p>Since we regarded the rigid division into line-groups (<code>&lt;lg&gt;</code>)
                     and verses (<code>&lt;l&gt;</code>) as inadequate, we initially marked the end
                     of each “typographic” line with the empty element <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code>
                     (line break) and, since it was impossible to consider this as a suitable mark
                     for a strophic unit, we enclosed a group of verses or the text of the autograph
                     in general within a generic element <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> (anonymous block).
                     In addition, we also marked the end of the poetic verse with another empty
                     element <code>&lt;milestone/&gt;</code>, qualified by an attribute
                        <code>unit="verse"</code>. Here is the result of the first attempt:</p>
                  <p>
                     <eg> &lt;handNote xml:id="blue" scribe="Magrelli" medium="blue biro"/&gt;
                        &lt;add hand="#blue" place="left"&gt;E&lt;/add&gt; Il sonno &lt;subst&gt;
                        &lt;del hand="#blue" type="overstrike"&gt;è l'indiscreto
                        ospite&lt;lb/&gt;irresistibile&lt;/del&gt; &lt;add hand="#blue"&gt;si
                        allarga &lt;add hand="#blue"&gt;nel corpo/&lt;milestone unit="verse"/&gt;
                        come un secondo&lt;lb/&gt; corpo intollerabile./&lt;milestone
                        unit="verse"/&gt;&lt;/add&gt; &lt;/subst&gt; </eg>
                  </p>
                  <p>We resorted to the empty elements <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> and
                        <code>&lt;milestone/&gt;</code>, representing respectively the end of the
                     typographic line and the end of the verse, to avoid problems of
                        overlap.<note>For a discussion and a proposal for other hacks to avoid
                        overlapping hierarchies, see for example <ptr target="#bauman2005"/>.</note>
                     In the autograph, in fact, the portion of text cancelled by the stroke of a
                     blue pen (<title rend="quotes">è l’indiscreto ospite // irresistibile</title>)
                     crosses the end of the typographic line and, if we had used a tag like
                        <code>&lt;l&gt;verse&lt;/l&gt;</code> or even the more generic
                        <code>&lt;seg&gt;verse&lt;/seg&gt;</code> to represent the verse unit, we
                     would have generated a case of overlap: cancellation followed by replacement in
                     this case involves a unit longer than a verse.</p>
                  <p>In any case, although the differentiation between the end of the verse and the
                     end of the typographic line by means of the empty elements <code>&lt;milestone
                        unit="verse"/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> resolves the problem
                     of overlap, it also generates a redundancy. These elements in fact fulfil the
                     same function: both mark the end of a portion of text without qualifying it as
                     belonging to either. This poses a problem whenever the two elements refer at
                     the same moment to a common piece of text.</p>
                  <p>Even though it is possible to represent the author’s own substitutions,
                     deletions and insertions via the tags <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> (addition) and
                        <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> (deletion), this choice of markup cannot represent
                     the chronological sequence of corrections. For example, it doesn’t take into
                     account the fact that the initial verse extends onto two lines (although it is
                     one unit), or the subdivision of the initial verse into two, after <foreign>
                        <q>nel corpo/</q>
                     </foreign> was added, or the subsequent introduction of a metrical structure
                     (the subdivision into verses indicated by Magrelli’s use of the forward slash
                        <hi rend="italic">/</hi>). In the proposed encoding the state of the
                     metrical scheme was regarded as already decided: the insertion of the metrical
                     structure is anticipated and reshaped by the editor, when in reality it happens
                     at a later point in the process. Also, by this selection we lose important
                     information concerning the relations between the author’s interventions and
                     their order. In conclusion, it is not possible to represent both phenomena: the
                     metrical (spatial) structure and that of the (temporal) variation, without
                     violating the syntax of XML. And in the case of the other canto it would
                     perhaps not be appropriate to speak of the typographical design of the page for
                     an object like a manuscript, which is not strictly speaking a publication.</p>
                  <p>The autograph is in fact considered as an open semiotic system, a <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#ferrer2002">field of action</quote>

                     </cit> interdependent on its various possible concrete realizations (among
                     which are printed publications, whether intermediate or definitive). </p>

               <div>
                  <head>2.1.2 Second Encoding</head>
                  <p>In this second attempt we will utilise the elements defined for the
                     transcription of the critical apparatus of a manuscript, merging the elements
                     defined in chapters 11 and 12 of the TEI Guidelines.<note>Chap. 11 <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html">Representation of primary sources</ref>; Chap. 12 <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html">Critical Apparatus</ref>.</note> An apparatus is usually understood as
                     an instrument that records the sequence of variants between multiple texts,
                     whereas here it is used to represent the variants within a single manuscript.
                     In our case then we have represented textual variation with the
                        <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> (apparatus) tag which, instead of recording, as in
                     its standard use, variants from several manuscripts, here contains the
                     different stages of composition of a single text (our fragment). Each phrase is
                     represented by the tag <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> (reading), qualified with a
                        <code>varseq</code> attribute (variant sequence), which in its turn supplies
                     a number to indicate the sequence. After having identified the various levels
                     of stratification in the text, which occur uniformly throughout the autograph,
                     we assigned a successive number to each reading via the attribute
                        <code>varseq</code>. The number indicates the stage of intervention,
                     according to our interpretation, to which the segment of text contained there
                     belongs. As will be seen, in keeping with our intentions, we will represent
                     both the stages of the writing process and the interventions by the author on
                     the metrical structure of the poetry: </p>

                  <p>We have chosen to mark the verse by the <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code> element, which
                     is used generically to mark a segment of uncategorised text, giving it an
                     attribute <code>"l"</code>, which identifies that segment as a verse unit that
                     we have reconstructed. Examination of the whole autograph reveals four stages:
                     the red biro represents the first form given to the composition by its author,
                     and what may be the second stage consists of the author’s interventions —
                     deletions, rewritings and corrections — with the same implement. The use of the
                     blue pen indicates a later stage, the third, followed by corrections on top
                     with the same instrument (fourth stage). In the chosen fragment <ref target="#figure01">Figure 01</ref>, however, only three stages are visible:
                     the first, the third and the fourth.</p>
                  <p>The initial verse is thus the following: <quote rend="block" source="#magrelli1996">1. <foreign xml:lang="it">Il sonno è l’indiscreto ospite irresistibile</foreign> (red
                        biro).</quote> Subsequently the author inserted with the blue biro an <hi rend="italic">E</hi> and modified the verse, deleting a portion of it
                        (<foreign xml:lang="it">è l’indiscreto ospite // irresistibile</foreign>)
                     and added some new text (<foreign xml:lang="it">si allarga come un secondo
                        corpo intollerabile</foreign>). Hence we have <quote rend="block" source="#magrelli1996">3.
                           <foreign xml:lang="it">E il sonno si allarga come un secondo // corpo
                           intollerabile</foreign>
                     </quote> The result of the final revision is the integration of <foreign xml:lang="it">
                        <q>nel corpo/</q>
                     </foreign> and the introduction of a metrical structure (the character <hi rend="italic">/</hi> indicates the end of a verse): <quote rend="block" source="#magrelli1996">4.
                           <foreign xml:lang="it">E il sonno si allarga nel corpo / come un secondo
                           // corpo intollerabile /</foreign>
                     </quote> In the encoding, we have chosen to represent not only the actions of
                     the author and hence the physical data (cancellation, rewriting, insertion of
                     elements which subdivide the verse unit) but also the consequences of these
                     actions (the first portion of text is substituted by another, forming a new
                     verse; this is turn undergoes variation to form two new verses). Then, by
                     eliminating the empty milestone element and inserting the <code>&lt;seg
                        type="l"&gt;</code> tag, we make one reconstruction of the verse explicit,
                     while marking the end of the typographic line with <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code>. </p>
                  <p>In this way, we resolve some of the problems that emerged from the first
                     encoding:</p>
                  <list type="ordered">
                     <item>We represent textual variation with the <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> tag and
                        indicate the sequence of the author’s corrections with the
                           <code>varseq</code> attribute;</item>
                     <item>We contain the textual variation within the element <code>&lt;seg
                           type="l"&gt;</code>, representing the reconstruction of the verse
                        unit;</item>
                     <item>We avoid the redundancy of empty elements by specifying which unit
                        undergoes textual variation.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>It is obvious that these choices not only constitute a specific (and
                     questionable) interpretation of the process of writing, but they do not account
                     for the external aspect of the autograph. And from the point of view of a
                     palaeographer or an archivist, this would be a serious loss of information.
                     Insofar as our proposed encoding can be revised, perfected and extended, we
                     find ourselves facing the central theoretical crux of the representation of
                     digital documents: encoding has the virtue of requiring us to explain and
                     justify our choices, but at the same time this assumption of responsibility
                     (useful and correct in the eyes of the scientific community) declares, as it
                     were, its epistemic limit: not all knowledge can be represented with the
                     present digital tools.</p>

               <head>2.2 Alternative or Variant? Encoding of <title rend="italic">Ecco la lunga
                     palpebra della donna</title>
               </head>
               <p>The second composition we examine allows us to observe which phenomena shed light
                  on the encoding of deletions, substitutions, and insertions within the same
                  autograph, in particular the problematic distinction between hierarchies of
                  variants.</p>
               <p>As in the preceding case, it is possible to reconstruct the chronology of
                  Magrelli's interventions by examining the graphical elements, and see how a change
                  in pen color indicates a subsequent addition, or by examining the spatial
                  elements, such as the place where the author puts the added text. But such
                  interpretations are insufficient to interpret and encode the process of
                  composition. In the autograph of <title rend="italic">Ecco la lunga palpebra della
                     donna</title>, we are faced with words that are cancelled and substituted not
                  by another word but by two different ones, by additions above the line
                  (supralinear) or below the line (sublinear). In the fragment of the poem that we
                  chose to examine <ref target="#figure02">Figure 02</ref> the text is spread over
                  five lines (which we shall only call verses by the laws of post hoc), and is rich
                  in intratextual and pragmatic phenomena of both the textual and graphical kinds
                  (e.g. arrows, marks of emphasis, cross references etc.) In particular the
                  adjectives were subject to close attention by the author and could be reduced to
                  two lists of variants, which Magrelli drew up within the autograph (of which one
                  is visible in <ref target="#figure02">Figure 02</ref>: the four adjectives written
                  in the bottom right in capitals).</p>
               <figure xml:id="figure02">
                  <head/>
                  <figDesc/>
                  <graphic url="..../000082/resources/figure02.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>As can be seen, the adjectives <foreign xml:lang="it">stupito, perplesso</foreign>
                  and <foreign xml:lang="it">inquieto</foreign> on the last line (bottom left of
                     <ref target="#figure02">Figure 02</ref>) could have been added at the same
                  moment, or <foreign xml:lang="it">stupito</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="it">inquieto</foreign> could have been inserted subsequently and could be
                  considered as the two variants parallel in time to <foreign xml:lang="it">perplesso.</foreign> For this reason we have considered them as a list of
                  variants within the line, whose chronological succession we will not attempt to
                  reconstruct. Immediately following this are two other variants, <foreign xml:lang="it">canta</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="it">sogna,</foreign> which
                  serve as replacements for <foreign xml:lang="it">suona.</foreign> In this case one
                  can suppose a chronological sequence (<foreign xml:lang="it">suona</foreign>
                  replaced by <foreign xml:lang="it">canta</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="it">sogna</foreign>), which explicitly retains the value of the coexisting variant
                  alternatives. Here is the encoding of the entire fragment:</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here also we have used the TEI Guidelines for transcription of an apparatus
                  criticus, enclosing the textual variation in the <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> tag, and
                  assigning to each reading (<code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>) of the verse a sequence
                     number.<note> It can be seen here how the act of encoding, by forcing us to
                     represent through discrete elements the writing process continuum, could
                     produce redundant structures. In fact, the registration of the writing stages
                     includes also the already represented elements: see for example the
                        <q>clone</q> of <code>&lt;list&gt;</code> (bottom list of adjectives), which
                     we can find both in the second (<code>varSeq="2"</code>, r. 42) and third
                     passage (<code>varSeq="3"</code>, r. 55) of the encoding of the fourth verse
                     line (Table 1, lines 39-70). This redundancy reflects <q>spatially</q> the idea
                     that each textual movement (each modification) should be considered as an
                     independent system which, in its turn, needs a separate
                     encoding/representation.</note> In the final verse (lines 71-94) we find the
                  alternation of two variants, <foreign xml:lang="it">canta e sogna</foreign> (lines
                  87-88), which replace the cancelled word <foreign xml:lang="it">suona;</foreign>
                  in the final passage we use the empty element <code>&lt;delSpan/&gt;</code>
                  <note>Also where the empty element is necessary to avoid overlap.</note>, which
                  marks a portion of cancelled text, to indicate the deletion via an oblique line of
                  the three variants altogether (<foreign xml:lang="it">suona, canta</foreign> and
                     <foreign xml:lang="it">sogna</foreign>). This triple cancellation is anchored
                  via the <code>&lt;anchor/&gt;</code> element to the point at which the
                  cancellation finishes (line 89).</p>
               <p>To represent the references between the list and the elements in the text we
                  assigned to each adjective an identifier using the n-attribute (preceded by the
                     <code>“adj”</code> attribute: <code>adj_1, adj_2,</code> etc.) The adjectives
                  recur several times in the text and the author attached a particular importance to
                  them, circling or underlining them. To render this emphasis we have used the
                     <code>&lt;emph&gt;</code> tag, giving it a <code>rend</code> attribute which
                  explains what type it is (circled or underlined). The encoding of the fourth verse
                  (lines 39-70) presents one solution to a complex set of interrelationships among
                  elements in various areas of the autograph. Subsequently, probably during the
                  insertion of <foreign xml:lang="it">nasce il canto,</foreign> the author inserted
                  an arrow, which refers to a list of four adjectives written in capitals at the
                  foot of the page (<ref target="#figure02">Figure 02</ref>, bottom left). This type
                  of indication can be interpreted as an <q>action</q> of the author directed
                  towards producing certain effects — but not results, because the author is, in a
                  certain sense, also engaged in a dialog with himself. To record this dialectic we
                  have chosen to represent the arrow with a note, via the metatextual
                     <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element (line 44), giving it the attribute
                     <code>type="arrow"</code>, and inserting it in the text containing a list of
                  the adjectives as alternatives (each distinguished from the others by
                     <code>&lt;item&gt;</code>). Since we maintain that the list/note of four
                  adjectives was inserted during the second draft, we assign it to the second
                  version (<code>&lt;rdg varSeq="2"&gt;</code>). In the facsimile the arrow is
                  joined to the o of <foreign xml:lang="it">[nasce il] canto</foreign> (added above
                  the fourth line of the autograph). In summary, our reading of the fourth verse
                  treats the variants within the text as components (<code>&lt;item&gt;</code>s) of
                  a list (<code>&lt;list&gt;</code>), which we connect back to a collection of
                  alternatives placed by the author at the foot of the page. Obviously, this
                  solution, which thus inverts the spatial distribution of the elements in relation
                  to how they are presented in the autograph (the list occurs at the end of the
                  fifth verse and not within the fourth as in the encoding), is one possible
                  workaround for representing such complex phenomena. This is a further example of
                  how encoding of the writing process can imply, through the
                  remodelling/reconstruction brought about by markup languages, the overturning of
                  the spatial dimension. In other words, what appears in the material reality of the
                  document as a particular region, determined visually, in the pragmatic dimension
                  of the process may be located on several temporal levels. Since to encode means to
                  select one point of view, in our case we are forced to represent, through the
                  linear instruments of markup, something which is not linear by its very nature.
                  This is a dimension which the author indicates <q>performatively</q> through
                  signals that are not exclusively textual, as if to show that the dimension of the
                  process cannot be cognitively reduced to a hierachical sequence.</p>

                     ambizione</title>
               </head>
               <p>It is appropriate that this last example of encoding explores the relationship
                  between writing and time. In this case we shall analyse a composition in which the
                  material succession of witnesses does not coincide with the temporal succession of
                  the various writing phases. We possess numerous versions of <title rend="italic">Essere matita è segreta ambizione,</title> which reveal, in addition to a
                  complex process of composition, a classification peculiar to Valerio Magrelli.
                  Each witness is contained in a notebook representing a specific phase of writing.
                  Altogether there are eight witnesses: the autograph, the second typewritten
                  version, contained in the notebook <title rend="quotes">Foglietti I,</title> the
                  photocopy of the second version (also in <title rend="quotes">Foglietti
                  I</title>), the third in <title rend="quotes">Foglietti II,</title> the fourth in
                     <title rend="quotes">Libro — parte I,</title> the fifth printed, the sixth,
                  which will be the definitive printed version, and a printed version in French.
                  What follows are the images of two versions of the first part of the poem <title rend="italic">Essere matita è segreta ambizione:</title>
               </p>
               <list type="ordered">

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The sixth version (B) is a photocopy of the first version (A). It thus follows it
                  in time, but, as can be seen, it also precedes the insertion of later corrections
                  in the original. The cancellation in pencil of <foreign xml:lang="it">la sua rete
                     di vene sottili</foreign> in fact will not appear in subsequent versions, not
                  even the final one <ptr target="#magrelli1996" loc="13"/>. The temporal inversion
                  then generates another case of overlap: the correction in A before B is a typical
                  case of <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#ferrer1995">genetic order</quote>
                     <ptr target="#ferrer1995" loc="143"/>
                  </cit>, which contrasts with the material order. In reality we are faced with
                  three dimensions of the text: <list type="ordered">
                     <item>The yellow page preceding the corrections (A0)</item>
                     <item>The photocopy without corrections (B)</item>
                     <item>The yellow page with corrections (A).</item>
                  </list> In the encoding at this point we have two options, both probably
                  unsatisfactory: to emphasize the genetic aspect, representing the writing phases
                  from A0 (no longer in material existence, but genetically real), or to catalog the
                  witnesses, maintaining their material succession without taking account of the
                  writing phases. We chose the second of these two options for our proposed
                  encoding, although we also decided to highlight the temporal sequence by inserting
                  an editorial note at the point where the correction occurs and so establish a link
                  with the second photocopied version, explaining that the correction is subsequent
                  to the photocopy. In this case then, the paratextual elements of TEI, in a rather
                  paradoxical way, serve to come to assistance of that temporal dimension which the
                  TEI-XML model implicitly rejects.</p>

            <head>Conclusions: The Epistemology of Variation</head>
            <p>In this paper we have described and analyzed some methods for representing textual
               phenomena of the writing process by means of the TEI-XML Guidelines. The term
                  <term>epistemology of variation</term>,<note>Although never explicitly cited, we
                  recognize both by use of this term, and also through our first reflections on the
                  concept, our debt to <ptr target="#cerquiglini1989"/>.</note> invoked here for the
               first time, may help to express what is at stake in this representation: not simply
               an account of evidence whose significance begins and ends with the data, but an
               account of a system of knowledge in which the relation between states is as important
               as any state taken alone. As already mentioned, markup languages appear to be — at
               the moment — the most flexible scientific and economical solution for the
               representation of digital text. However, as already explained, it would be naive and
               probably counterproductive to claim that we are satisfied. Many (but not all) of the
               phenomena described here can be represented only with great effort or with an
               unacceptable level of imprecision. XML, like its predecessor SGML, was originally
               designed as an instrument for archiving and information retrieval, whereas the
                  <foreign>mouvance</foreign> of the text poses challenges for the encoding and
               representation that can only be resolved by the development of a different model of
               encoding, and by the design of an adequate user interface on the application level.
               Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that without an adequate theoretical
               reflection on text in the digital era no instrument can offer satisfying solutions.
               The variant is <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#benozzo2004">complex stratified knowledge</quote>
                  <ptr target="#benozzo2004" loc="52"/>
               </cit> which embodies an epistemological and cultural status. In fact, variation,
               from evolutionary biology <ptr target="#edelman2006"/> to cognitive anthropology <ptr target="#sperber1996"/>, is at the heart of the phenomena and processes of
               diffusion of culture. In other words, a certain degree of instability is immanent to
               the transmission of knowledge. Variation therefore calls into question the notion of
                  <q>repeatability,</q> an important concept in disciplines concerned with the
               transmission of information — including philology. The <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#ferrer2002">failure to repeat</quote>
                  <ptr target="#ferrer2002" loc="52"/>
               </cit> is thus an annoying spanner in the conceptual works of any procedure based on
               recursive structures. This happens because the variant, understood as a symptom of
               the processual (rather than the editorial) dimension is an <q>equally valid
                  alternative,</q> which does not expect the attainment of <q>truth.</q> The new
               epistemological law revealed to us by the dynamics of the writing process is part of
               the actual paradigm-shift which concerns the sciences of language, where it emerges
               as a dialectic between the concept of <q>system</q> and that of <q>process</q> (or in
               our case between text and writing):</p>
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block" source="#sornicola2005">Of particular interest appears to be the recent deepening of the
                  notion of <q>process,</q> which emerges in a separate but convergent manner from
                  the study of phonetics and phonology, and from morphology and syntax ... These
                  results converge towards a vision that is much more complex and empirically
                  founded on the problem of the linearity of linguistic phenomena, showing that at
                  each level of analysis global planes come into play behind the apparent seriality
                  of linguistic production. ... One significant consequence of the creation of these
                  new methods is that they succeed in reducing interest in the notion of process to
                  the second level to the benefit of the notion of process.</quote>

            </cit>
            <p>Even though it is always risky to propose analogies, this epistemological turn can be
               compared to that <q>second phase</q> in the history of physics, which is the subject
               of the work of the chemist and epistemologist Ilya Prigogine. For Prigogine
               post-Newtonian physics, having discovered disequilibrium, ceased to describe
               phenomena in terms of stability and uniformity, as Boltzmann had done, construing a
               model — whose results echo those of the forest of <quote rend="inline" source="#pregogine1988">bifid
                  trees</quote> discovered by Bédier — <quote rend="inline" source="#pregogine1988">from the irreversible
                  evolution of the population of particles towards a state of equilibrium,</quote>
               which has the effect of describing, exactly as Bédier noted on the subject of the
               tradition of the <title rend="italic">Lai de l’ombre</title> (Bédier 1929-1985), <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#pregogine1988">an evolution towards uniformity</quote>
                  <ptr target="#pregogine1988" loc="25–26"/>
               </cit>. At the centre of Prigogine’s argument is the accusation directed against
               Newtonian physics that it ignores time: <quote rend="inline" source="#pregogine1988">...opposed to dynamic
                  eternity is the second principle of thermodynamics... Physics was finally able to
                  describe, like the other sciences, a world open to history.</quote> The second
               phase of physics <quote rend="inline" source="#pregogine1988">is that of the instability of the elementary
                  particles and their complexity</quote>; subsequently he adds <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#pregogine1988">the discovery of structures not in equilibrium, which
                     overturns the dogma that assimilates the growth of entropy to molecular
                     disorder</quote>
                  <ptr target="#pregogine1988" loc="44"/>
               </cit>. This <q>non-equilibrium</q> greatly resembles the notion of process developed
               and analysed in various areas of the humanities: <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#pregogine1988">If one can say, <hi rend="italic">
                        <foreign>a posteriori</foreign>
                     </hi>, that this second period has seen the discovery of a world of processes
                     of creation, far removed from the correct world of eternal laws, which
                     characterised the ideal of classical physics</quote>
                  <ptr target="#pregogine1988" loc="44"/>
               </cit>. The analogy could continue, for example, by noting that the philological
               concept of <q>original text</q> presupposes a dismissal of time, establishing a
               principle of reversability: apart from certain effects (the tradition) it is always
               possible to jump back to the cause (the original). But in both cases — in the physics
               of Boltzman and the philology of Lachmann — to go back to the cause is a metaphysical
               undertaking: texts and elementary particles are both ascribed to a world which cannot
               be interpreted or represented in genealogical terms or by following rigid principles
               of causality.</p>
            <p>Applied to our case, that is, the representation and use of digital text, this vision
               of time, open to history, forces us to <list type="ordered">

                        cognitive linguist Langacker <ptr target="#langacker1987"/> language cannot
                        be considered a module separated from other mental activities and operations
                        (cf. <ptr target="#formigari2001" loc="271"/>). In applying this conceptual
                        model to the text, we could say that the abstract, material and procedural
                        aspects of writing are all responsible for building the <q>meaning</q> of

            <p>The Encoding Model for Genetic Editions being proposed as a new chapter of the TEI

            <p>Although this work is the result of shared research and discussion, the physical
               draft paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are the work of D. Fiormonte and the XML encoding of all
               the autographs is the work of V. Martiradonna, as are the relevant analytical
               comments in sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Desmond Schimdt translated the text into
               English, suggested important corrections and additions in all sections, and revised
               the encoding according to the P5 recent developments. The authors would like to thank
               Fabio Ciotti for his help in the more complex aspects of the variant encoding and
               Valerio Magrelli for his generosity in making his original materials available. This
