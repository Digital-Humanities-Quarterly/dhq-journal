                <p>In this article, we present our reflections on hermeneutic data visualizations
                    for digital literary studies. Hermeneutic approaches in the digital humanities
                    have been rather agnostic about the epistemological premises of hermeneutic
                    theory. These can be summarized as (1) differentiation author/text, (2)
                    hermeneutic circle and (3) dependency text/recipient. In this article, we
                    present the concept of hermeneutic visualization as a means of bridging the gap
                    between <soCalled>classic</soCalled> literary hermeneutics and the emerging
                    practice of digital literary hermeneutics. Since data visualization is based on
                    epistemological premises stemming from the natural or social sciences, it is not
                    well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. In this article, we argue that the
                    digital humanities can meet hermeneutic demands through a critical interface and
                    visualization concept. We discuss four postulates that can be used as guidelines
                    and help transform <soCalled>more traditional</soCalled> data visualization into
                    hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the epistemological foundations of
                    hermeneutic theory. We demonstrate the usefulness of the postulates with an
                    interactive prototype Stereoscope designed to support them.<note>In our article
                        we refer to the discussions and results of the three-year research project
                            <title rend="italic">Three-Dimensional Dynamic Data Visualisation and
                            Exploration for Digital Humanities Research</title> (3DH) at the
                        University of Hamburg (04/2016–12/2018). The considerations on hermeneutic
                        visualizations presented here are therefore the result of a very productive
                        collaboration. Therefore we cannot claim the presented ideas as our
                        own.</note></p>

                <head>1. Introduction</head>
                <p>Data visualization has become a prolific method in digital literary studies to
                    represent the results of a research process. While it is most commonly used to
                    communicate these results to a scholarly audience, there is an increasing number
                    of cases that exhibit an analytical use of the method in order to gain a better
                    understanding of the textual data under investigation (cf. <ref
                        target="#jessop2008">Jessop 2008, 283</ref>; <ref target="#sinclair2013"
                        >Sinclair et al. 2013</ref>). A common definition of data visualization is:
                        <quote rend="inline">The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual
                        representations of abstract data to amplify cognition</quote>
                    <ptr target="#card1999"/>. Although literary text can be transformed into
                    abstract data with the help of statistical or computational methods like natural
                    language processing, this is not the kind of data that literary scholars
                    practicing an hermeneutic approach are concerned with. Here, scholars are
                    dealing with subjective and ambiguous data, usually in the form of text
                    annotations, for which conventional data visualization is not adequate (cf. <ref
                        target="#drucker2018">Drucker 2018</ref>). Precisely this discrepancy
                    between conventional data visualizations used and the interpretative data and
                    processes to be visualized is the starting point of our considerations for a
                    more reflective interface and visualization concept for literary analysis and
                    interpretation processes.</p>
                <p>As Meister et al. (2017) point out: <quote rend="inline">Most current DH
                        visualizations are thus epistemological one-way avenues toward knowledge,
                        from data via rendering algorithm to visual display.</quote> But the process
                    of understanding texts and other cultural artifacts in the humanities is a
                    continuous, dynamic interplay of modeling as well as reasoning operations. These
                    operations repeatedly affect a dynamic data model in form of enrichment and
                    reconfiguration (cf. <ref target="#gius2017">Gius et al. 2017, 115</ref>). The
                    hermeneutic approach is a specific form of the process of But the process of

                    reconfiguration (cf. Gius et al. 2017, 115). The hermeneutic approach is a
                    specific form of the process of understanding, which has significance especially
                    for literary and cultural studies. In the humanities, the term
                        <term>hermeneutic</term> (<foreign>hermeneuein</foreign> in Greek means
                        <quote rend="inline">to say, to explain, to translate</quote>
                    <ptr target="#palmers1969" loc="13"/>) generally stands <quote rend="inline">for
                        the practice of exegesis (i. e. interpretation) that leads to understanding,
                        [...] [as well as] for the theory of interpretation as a reflection on the

                        quoted or paraphrased above are translated by the authors of this
                        paper.</note>. Already developed as a practice in ancient times,
                    hermeneutics took different forms over the 19th century, especially in
                    Schleiermacher’s and Herder’s approach, then around 1900 in Dilthey’s conception
                    and finally in the 20th century in the thinking of Heidegger, Gadamer and the
                        <title rend="quotes">Konstanzer Schule</title>. As a result, the following
                    distinction has become established in the humanities. On the one hand,
                    hermeneutic refers to a literary-philological art theory of the interpretation
                    of texts (and other cultural artefacts). We speak of <term>literary
                        hermeneutics</term>. On the other hand, hermeneutic is a philosophical
                    discipline with an universalistic claim that is concerned with the conditions of
                    humanistic understanding per se (cf. <ref target="#nunning2008">Nünning 2008,
                        281f</ref>; <ref target="#stiening2016">Stiening 2016, 54</ref>). In this
                    context, we are talking of hermeneutic philosophy. However, both meanings of the
                    term are strongly interdependent and partly overlap in different theories of the
                    humanities.</p>
                <p>In digital humanities research, there has been some discussion on how the digital
                    humanities might live up to expectations and methodological requirements
                    associated with a digitally supported hermeneutic practice (cf. <ref
                        target="#zundert2016">van Zundert 2016</ref>; <ref target="#rockwell2016"
                        >Rockwell, Sinclair 2016</ref>). Often a very broad notion of hermeneutics
                    as a theory of understanding (as opposed to explaining) is applied. We can
                    observe results that have arisen from these discussions in a number of software
                    tools (e.g. <title rend="italic">Catma</title>, <title rend="italic"
                        >Voyant</title>). These tools are, for example, replicating traditional
                    scholarly activities that are considered a part of the interpretation process.
                    Unsworth (<ref target="#unsworth2000">2000</ref>) gives a systematic account of
                        <soCalled>scholarly primitives</soCalled>, as he calls these activities,
                    some of which are applied by scholars during the interpretative process. Among
                    these are annotation, comparison and representation. As for annotation, this is
                    often the starting point of hermeneutic practice: highlighting parts of a
                    document and writing down comments in the margins are two of the oldest
                    scholarly techniques.</p>
                <p>While the integration of these primary activities into digital tools certainly is
                    a step towards hermeneutics in the digital realm (or <term>digital literary
                        hermeneutics</term>), most of these efforts have been rather agnostic about
                    the epistemological premises of hermeneutic theory. We argue that visualization
                    could serve as the missing link between fundamental hermeneutic premises and
                    digital (literary) hermeneutics. We claim that visualizations not only have to
                    fulfill certain conditions to adequately support literary analysis and
                    interpretation. Rather, we assert that, in referring to the traditional theory
                    of hermeneutics, these qualities can be distinctively described and designed
                    for. We define <term>hermeneutic visualization</term> as: <quote rend="block"
                        >The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of text
                        annotations to manipulate, reconfigure and explore them in order to create
                        visual interpretations that can be used as arguments and allow a critical
                        reflection of the hermeneutic process in light of a research
                        question.</quote> By clarifying the premises and postulates for hermeneutic
                    visualization, we address two research desiderata: First, a systematic
                    elaboration of the implicit premises of hermeneutic text interpretations is
                    still missing. What premises of hermeneutics do we have to consider when we want
                    to use visualizations as tools for the interpretation process? We propose four
                    premises for hermeneutic visualizations. These can be summarized as (1)
                    differentiation author/text, (2) hermeneutic circle and (3) dependency
                    text/recipient.</p>
                <p>A second problem, in our view, is that the relationship between visualizations
                    and the data to be visualized is primarily limited to a representational
                    function. The current data visualization paradigm in the digital humanities
                    foregrounds operations and transformations of input data at the expense of the
                    human user whose agency as producer and interpreter of visualizations is largely
                    ignored. This has triggered a conceptual and technical reification of
                    visualization that invites its misinterpretation as an objective representation.
                    At worst, visualizations are taken as quasi-objects that appear to exist on the
                    same ontological level as the objects whose properties they claim to faithfully
                    represent. But especially in digital literary studies, we are dealing with data
                    that rather refer to an interpretation process. Polyvalence is a characteristic
                    of this data generated by interpretation. Because of the assumed objective
                    nature of the data, polyvalence is not accounted for in the visual
                    representation of the visual variables, which raises a range of questions: What
                    demands must be made on a critical interface and visualization concept for
                    hermeneutic text interpretations? What do hermeneutic visualizations look like?
                    How do we create them? In answering these questions, our conceptual starting
                    point are four postulates for hermeneutic visualizations: <title rend="italic"
                        >Two Way Screen, Quality, Parallax</title> and <title rend="italic"
                        >Discourse</title> (cf. <ref target="#meister2017">Meister et al.
                    2017</ref>; <ref target="#drucker2018">Drucker 2018</ref>). These four
                    postulates serve as guidelines for creating hermeneutic visualizations and
                    embedding them in user interfaces, and we will demonstrate their usefulness with
                    the help of the interactive visualization prototype <title rend="quotes"
                        >Stereoscope</title> based on these postulates.</p>
                <p>With our article we want to raise awareness for the extent to which research in
                    digital humanities always contributes to the <quote rend="inline">epistemic

                    reflection of the epistemological principles at work. Our article represents an
                    attempt to think visualization in terms of literary hermeneutics. Moreover,
                    contrary to the current narrative of an <quote rend="inline">end of
                        theory</quote> (cf. <ref target="#anderson2008">Anderson 2008</ref>) or a
                    post-theoretical era (cf. <ref target="#scheinfeldt2012">Scheinfeldt 2012</ref>)
                    in the DH, we argue for a productive discussion of theories, in our case
                    literary theories. Against this background, we believe that the question of
                    hermeneutic visualizations gains an exemplary status. We are not only interested
                    in demonstrating possibilities of operationalization for the singular case of
                    hermeneutic visualizations. Rather, we believe that our case of hermeneutic
                    visualization can be regarded as a prototypical procedure with respect to the
                    question of methodology in digital humanities research in general. The issue of
                        <soCalled>hermeneutic visualization</soCalled> is, we argue, both a
                    demonstration object and a medium of reflection.</p>
                <p>Here is the structure of our argument: In part 2, we will begin with a short
                    synopsis of the development of classic hermeneutics and an exposition and
                    explanation of the three epistemological premises. Against this backdrop, we
                    will discuss how visualizations are well-suited to represent these activities,
                    but are also lacking qualities in order to meet the epistemological premises.
                    Part 3, will address these lacking qualities by discussing four postulates. In
                    part 4, we will then demonstrate how these postulates have been addressed in a
                    software prototype. The article will close with a conclusion (part 5).</p>

                    Visualizations</head>
                <p>This section is initially dedicated elaborating implicit premises in hermeneutic
                    literary theory. These premises are then the lens through which we discuss
                    current hermeneutical approaches in digital humanities, especially with regard
                    to the <soCalled>problematic</soCalled> role of visualizations.</p>

                        Studies</head>
                    <p>Among the main activities of researchers working in the field of literary
                        studies one can count the following: interpretation, development and
                        application of literary theory and of methods, argumentation. These core
                        practices form part of the wider literary studies framework and therefore
                        warrant closer inspection. In order to investigate hermeneutic
                        visualizations we think that work on our terminology is required.</p>
                    <p>Interpretation is considered one of the main activities of literary studies
                        (cf. <ref target="#albrecht2015">Albrecht et al. 2015, 1</ref>).<note>We
                            acknowledge that the chosen terms overlap with terms for example like
                                <term>heuristic, technique, practice</term>.</note> The term
                            <term>interpretation</term>, a derivation from the Latin word <quote
                            rend="inline">interpretatio: understand, explain, translate</quote>, is
                        defined as <quote rend="inline">the methodically induced result of
                            understanding texts in their totality</quote>
                        <ptr target="#spree2000" loc="168f."/> as well as <quote rend="inline">the
                            formulation of hypotheses about aspects of meaning in literary
                            texts</quote>
                        <ptr target="#gius2017" loc="236"/>. Following Winko (<ref
                            target="#winko2003">2003, 597</ref>) the synthesizing interpretation
                        can, on the one hand, presuppose the results of a rather descriptive and
                        analytical text analysis. Analysis and interpretation are thus considered in
                        a procedural relationship. On the other hand, text analysis and
                        interpretation can be determined as synonyms, since both terms are based on
                        the same rules of meaning-making treatment of the text. Despite the idea of
                        a reasoning process that does not require any principles or the claim of
                        some literary scholars <quote rend="inline">that literary texts are
                            ambiguous or <q>polyvalent</q> by nature</quote>, as Gius &amp; Jacke
                            (<ref target="#gius2017">2017, 234</ref>) point out, a literary
                        interpretation is based on rules (cf. <ref target="#jannidis2003">Jannidis
                            et al. 2003, 6</ref>). These rules, which are applied in a reasoning
                        process, can be provided by different theoretical approaches (cf. <ref
                            target="#spree2000">Spree 2000, 169</ref>).</p>
