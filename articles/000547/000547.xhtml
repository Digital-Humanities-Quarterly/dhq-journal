                  <p>In this article, we present our reflections on hermeneutic data visualizations
                     for digital literary studies. Hermeneutic approaches in the digital humanities
                     have been rather agnostic about the epistemological premises of hermeneutic
                     theory. These can be summarized as (1) differentiation author/text, (2)
                     hermeneutic circle and (3) dependency text/recipient. In this article, we
                     present the concept of hermeneutic visualization as a means of bridging the gap
                     between “classic” literary hermeneutics and the emerging
                     practice of digital literary hermeneutics. Since data visualization is based on
                     epistemological premises stemming from the natural or social sciences, it is not
                     well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. In this article, we argue that the
                     digital humanities can meet hermeneutic demands through a critical interface and
                     visualization concept. We discuss four postulates that can be used as guidelines
                     and help transform “more traditional” data visualization into
                     hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the epistemological foundations of
                     hermeneutic theory. We demonstrate the usefulness of the postulates with an
                     interactive prototype <cite class="title italic">Stereoscope</cite> designed to
                     support them.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e196">[1]</a></p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Data visualization has become a prolific method in digital literary studies to
                     represent the results of a research process. While it is most commonly used to
                     communicate these results to a scholarly audience, there is an increasing number
                     of cases that exhibit an analytical use of the method in order to gain a better
                     understanding of the textual data under investigation (cf. <a href="#jessop2008">Jessop 2008, 283</a>; <a href="#sinclair2013">Sinclair et al. 2013</a>). A common definition of data visualization is:
                     “The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual
                     representations of abstract data to amplify cognition”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#card1999">Card et al. 1999</a>]. Although literary text can be transformed into
                     abstract data with the help of statistical or computational methods like natural
                     language processing, this is not the kind of data that literary scholars
                     practicing an hermeneutic approach are concerned with. Here, scholars are
                     dealing with subjective and ambiguous data, usually in the form of text
                     annotations, for which conventional data visualization is not adequate (cf. <a href="#drucker2018">Drucker 2018</a>). Precisely this discrepancy
                     between conventional data visualizations used and the interpretative data and
                     processes to be visualized is the starting point of our considerations for a
                     more reflective interface and visualization concept for literary analysis and
                     interpretation processes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">As Meister et al. point out: “Most current DH visualizations
                     are thus epistemological one-way avenues toward knowledge, from data via
                     rendering algorithm to visual display”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#meister2017">Meister et al. 2017</a>]. But the process of understanding texts and other
                     cultural artifacts in the humanities is a continuous, dynamic interplay of
                     modeling as well as reasoning operations. These operations repeatedly affect a
                     dynamic data model in form of enrichment and reconfiguration (cf. <a href="#gius2017">Gius et al. 2017, 115</a>). The hermeneutic approach is
                     a specific form of the process of understanding, which has significance
                     especially for literary and cultural studies. In the humanities, the term
                     <em class="term">hermeneutic</em> (<span class="foreign i">hermeneuein</span> in Greek means
                     “to say, to explain, to translate”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#palmers1969">Palmers 1969</a>, 13]) generally stands “for
                     the practice of exegesis (i. e. interpretation) that leads to understanding,
                     [...] [as well as] for the theory of interpretation as a reflection on the
                     conditions and norms of understanding and linguistic utterance in
                     general”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mittelstrab2008">Mittelstraß 2008</a>, 364]<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e262">[1]</a>. Already developed as a practice in ancient times,
                     hermeneutics took different forms over the 19th century, especially in
                     Schleiermacher’s and Herder’s approach, then around 1900 in Dilthey’s conception
                     and finally in the 20th century in the thinking of Heidegger, Gadamer and the
                     “Konstanzer Schule”. As a result, the following
                     distinction has become established in the humanities. On the one hand,
                     hermeneutic refers to a literary-philological art theory of the interpretation
                     of texts (and other cultural artefacts). We speak of <em class="term">literary
                        hermeneutics</em>. On the other hand, hermeneutic is a philosophical
                     discipline with an universalistic claim that is concerned with the conditions of
                     humanistic understanding per se (cf. <a href="#nunning2008">Nünning 2008,
                        281</a>; <a href="#stiening2016">Stiening 2016, 54</a>). In this
                     context, we are talking of <em class="emph">hermeneutic philosophy</em>. However, both
                     meanings of the term are strongly interdependent and partly overlap in different
                     theories of the humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In digital humanities research, there has been some discussion on how the digital
                     humanities might live up to expectations and methodological requirements
                     associated with a digitally supported hermeneutic practice (cf. <a href="#zundert2016">van Zundert 2016</a>; <a href="#rockwell2016">Rockwell, Sinclair 2016</a>). Often a very broad notion of hermeneutics
                     as a theory of understanding (as opposed to explaining) is applied. We can
                     observe results that have arisen from these discussions in a number of software
                     tools (e.g. <cite class="title italic">Catma</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Voyant</cite>). These tools are, for example, replicating traditional
                     scholarly activities that are considered a part of the interpretation process.
                     Unsworth (<a href="#unsworth2000">2000</a>) gives a systematic account of
                     “scholarly primitives”, as he calls these activities,
                     some of which are applied by scholars during the interpretative process. Among
                     these are annotation, comparison and representation. As for annotation, this is
                     often the starting point of hermeneutic practice: highlighting parts of a
                     document and writing down comments in the margins are two of the oldest
                     scholarly techniques.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">While the integration of these primary activities into digital tools certainly is
                     a step towards hermeneutics in the digital realm (or <em class="term">digital literary
                        hermeneutics</em>), most of these efforts have been rather agnostic about
                     the epistemological premises of hermeneutic theory. We argue that visualization
                     could serve as the missing link between fundamental hermeneutic premises and
                     digital (literary) hermeneutics. We claim that visualizations not only have to
                     fulfill certain conditions to adequately support literary analysis and
                     interpretation. Rather, we assert that, in referring to the traditional theory
                     of hermeneutics, these qualities can be distinctively described and designed
                     for. We define <em class="term">hermeneutic visualization</em> as: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of text
                           annotations to manipulate, reconfigure and explore them in order to create
                           visual interpretations that can be used as arguments and allow a critical
                           reflection of the hermeneutic process in light of a research
                           question.
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> By clarifying the premises and postulates for hermeneutic
                     visualization, we address two research desiderata. First, a systematic
                     elaboration of the implicit premises of hermeneutic text interpretations is
                     still missing. What premises of hermeneutics do we have to consider when we want
                     to use visualizations as tools for the interpretation process? We propose four
                     premises for hermeneutic visualizations. These can be summarized as (1)
                     differentiation author/text, (2) hermeneutic circle and (3) dependency
                     text/recipient.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Second, data visualizations within the DH scholarship are often limited to a
                     representational usage. The current data visualization paradigm in the digital
                     humanities foregrounds operations and transformations of input data at the
                     expense of the human user whose agency as producer and interpreter of
                     visualizations is largely ignored. This has triggered a conceptual and technical
                     reification of visualization that invites its misinterpretation as an objective
                     representation. At worst, visualizations are taken as quasi-objects that appear
                     to exist on the same ontological level as the objects whose properties they
                     claim to faithfully represent. But especially in digital literary studies, we
                     are dealing with data that rather refer to an interpretation process.
                     Polyvalence is a characteristic of this data generated by interpretation.
                     Because of the assumed objective nature of the data, polyvalence is not
                     accounted for in the visual representation of the visual variables, which raises
                     a range of questions: What demands must be made on a critical interface and
                     visualization concept for hermeneutic text interpretations? What do hermeneutic
                     visualizations look like? How do we create them? In order to tackle these
                     questions we propose four postulates for hermeneutic visualizations: <cite class="title italic">Two Way Screen, Quality, Parallax</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Discourse</cite> (cf. <a href="#meister2017">Meister et
                        al. 2017</a>; <a href="#drucker2018">Drucker 2018</a>). These four
                     postulates serve as guidelines for creating hermeneutic visualizations and
                     embedding them in user interfaces. To get our postulates on a concrete footing,
                     we will demonstrate their usefulness with the help of the interactive
                     visualization prototype “Stereoscope”.

                     digital humanities always contributes to the “epistemic
                     self-enlightenment”

                     aims to show how digital humanities research is based on a thorough and
                     continuous reflection of the epistemological principles at work. Our article
                     represents an attempt to think visualization in terms of literary hermeneutics.
                     Contrary to current narratives of an “end of theory”
                     (cf. <a href="#anderson2008">Anderson 2008</a>) or a post-theoretical era
                     (cf. <a href="#scheinfeldt2012">Scheinfeldt 2012</a>) in the DH, we argue
                     for a productive discussion of theories, in our case literary theories. Against
                     this background, we believe that the question of hermeneutic visualizations

                     possibilities of operationalization for the singular case of hermeneutic
                     visualizations. Rather, we believe that our case of hermeneutic visualization
                     can be regarded as a prototypical procedure with respect to the question of
                     methodology in digital humanities research in general. The issue of
                     “hermeneutic visualization” is, we argue, both a
                     demonstration object and a medium of reflection.

                        analytical text analysis. Analysis and interpretation are thus considered in
                        a procedural relationship. On the other hand, text analysis and

                        authorship or the relevance of contexts, but also contain an implicit idea
                        of meaning. During decades of theoretical debates and throughout different
                        turns, the parameters indicating or representing meaning have shifted (cf.
                        <a href="#jannidis2003">Jannidis et al. 2003, 7</a>). Besides the
                        epistemological implications, this also changed the definition of what

                        dialectical methods compared to the more general operations such as reading

                        validation. One issue, for example, is the idea of “evidentiary transparency”

                           Hermeneutics</cite> (<a href="#szondi1995">1995, 1</a>) reads:
                        “Literary hermeneutics is the study of the
                        interpretation [...] of literary works.” Köppe &amp; Winko (<span class="error"><a href="#winko2013">2013, 19</a></span>) point out that the hermeneutic
                        approach is a “precursor” theory, which is not practiced
                        anymore. But according to introductions into literary studies, hermeneutic
                        theory is not only still widespread, it is often also mentioned before all
                        other theories (cf. <span class="error"><a href="#jebing2012">Jeßing, Köhnen 2012,

                        approaches, hermeneutic theory and its methodological tradition constitute
                        an essential approach to text interpretation.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14">Essential for hermeneutic theory is the idea of an understanding, which aims
                        to reach a deeper meaning or hidden reason of a text. Consequently, it is
                        assumed that (literary) texts have a meaning, which can be exposed under
                        certain conditions. This meaning does not have an objective, but rather an
                        observer-dependent and contextual status. In that regard, the hermeneutic
                        approach differs widely, for example, from Derrida’s deconstruction (cf.
                        <a href="#derrida1967">Derrida 1967</a>). In his work <cite class="title italic">Hermeneutik und Kritik mit besonderer Beziehung auf das
                           Neue Testament</cite> (1838) Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834)
                        stresses two important epistemological premises of the hermeneutic
                        understanding of meaning. First, Schleiermacher differentiates between the
                        intentions of the author and the expressions in the text. Schleiermacher’s
                        distinction leads to the idea of an autonomous intention of the text, which
                        is not necessarily congruent with the intention of the author. Therefore,
                        the text is regarded as an artificial and aesthetic work of art with a
                        specific meaning (cf. <a href="#selbmann2002">Selbmann 2002, 38</a>).
                        Second, Schleiermacher argues that a profound understanding of the text
                        corresponds with the holistic dependency of parts and the whole. He proposes
                        the “Grundsatz der Ganzheit” : “[T]he same way that the whole is, of course, understood in
                        reference to the individual, so too, the individual can only be
                        understood in reference to the whole” (cf. <a href="#schleiermacher1838">Schleiermacher</a>, Mantzavinos
                        2016).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p15">Moreover, the philologist Friedrich Ast (1778–1841) and later Schleiermacher
                        emphasize the circular procedure of interpretation, i.e., the hermeneutic
                        circle. In literary studies, the hermeneutic circle or spiral is regarded as
                        an instrument for the formulation of a hypothesis connecting a meaningful
                        whole and its elements (cf. <a href="#otoole2018">O’Toole 2018</a>).
                        In Gadamer’s conception of hermeneutic experience, understanding is also
                        determined as a circular movement that arises precisely through the
                        examination of the text. The circular structure of understanding thereby
                        aims to change the view of the world in a way that reveals something new or
                        revises old experiences and prejudices (cf. <a href="#rese2010">Rese
                           2010, 176</a>). The negation of certain experiences through the
                        reading and analysis of a text leads to the transformation of the horizon of
                        understanding (cf. <span class="error"><a href="#gadamer1990">Gadamer 1990</a></span>).
                        “Textual understanding”, as Gius &amp; Jacke (<a href="#gius2017">2017, 236</a>) describe it, “is
                        attained in the interplay between (contextual) assumptions about the
                        text on the one hand, and textual data on the other hand […].”
                        Thus, the act of interpretation constitutes a specific practice of a “reading and questioning […], back and forth, shifting the
                        focus of one’s attention and revising interim interpretations and
                        judgements along the way”

                     <div class="ptext" id="p16">Another premise of the hermeneutic method – besides the differentiation
                        between author and text intention and the holistic premise – is the highly
                        valued co-dependency between the text and the recipient. The co-dependency
                        is linked to the issue of context and subjective or social perceptions and
                        views. According to Gadamer’s <em class="emph">fusion of horizons</em>, a recipient,
                        who engages with the text in a productive way, generates partial and
                        subjective knowledge. This generated knowledge in the form of meaning “can neither be deduced theoretically, nor be fully
                        articulated, but rests on a kind of tact or sensitivity that is only
                        exhibited in the form of exemplary judgments and interpretations”

                        meaning through an iterative, non-deterministic, and subjective procedure.
                        Essential for this approach are three premises, as explicated in the

                        </ol> The hermeneutic approach is one possibility to tackle the complexity
                        of text comprehension. Further research could investigate visualization in
                        other literary interpretative processes based on Derrida’s idea of
                        deconstruction or Foucauldian parameters of discourse, for example.

                              text interpretation, such as when Katherine Hayles (2012) uses the
                              phrase “hermeneutic close reading”. Yet from several paragraphs and
                              sections in the literature the emergence of a debate seems

                        hermeneutics and what digital literary hermeneutics should encompass.
                        Generally speaking, the debate is dominated by attempts to digitally

                        of “reconfiguration, reorganization or
                        restructuring”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#armaselu2017">Armaselu et al. 2017</a>], or as Samuels &amp; McGann (<a href="#samuels1999">1999</a>) describe it, “deformance”. Rockwell (<a href="#rockwell2003">2003,
                           213</a>) calls the results of algorithmic analysis of texts “hybrid texts” that operate as “interpretive aids”: “[T]hey are generated by
                        processes of taking information apart and putting it back together into
                        new configurations for the purposes of discovery and reflection.”
                        This reconfiguration can be carried out automatically by an algorithm, as is
                        the case, for example, in concordances, or by manual annotations and
                        comments of text passages by scholars (cf. <a href="#rapp2017">Rapp
                           2017</a>; <a href="#jacke2018">Jacke 2018</a>). While the former
                        is idiosyncratic to the digital realm, the latter has been practiced in

                        reconfigure and restructure, however, the digital world grants considerably
                        more freedom than analog annotations. Bradley (<a href="#bradley2008">2008, 266</a>) describes a research software prototype called <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> that is guided by scholarly practice of
                        interpretation in the analog world: 
                        <blockquote>

                        them in spatial proximity or by nesting notes to account for hierarchical

                        critical potential of data visualizations in the humanities. The starting
                        point is often the criticism of the purely instrumental function of
                        visualizations. Visualizations serve, following Card et al. (<a href="#card1999">1999, 5</a>), as “external
                        aids”. Hinrichs et al. (<a href="#hinrichs2019">2019</a>)
                        critically conclude that visualizations have been considered only as tools
                        “to facilitate quantitative and qualitative analysis
                        processes, potentially within any research discipline or
                        practice.” Further the authors explain that “this pragmatic approach risks overlooking the research value of
                        visualization and relegating computer science and design to
                        service-based roles.” Moreover, Correll (<a href="#correll2019">2019</a>) even argues “that
                        visualization is a bad neighbor to the digital humanities: it
                        exacerbates the worst tendencies of DH scholarship and promotes
                        parasitic, technocratic collaborations.” In this context, he
                        pleas not only for new alliances between the humanities and visualization
                        research. Rather, he points out, that “[w]e need to
                        humanize visualization before we visualize the humanities.”
                        Traditionally, visualizations have been developed and used in scientific
                        contexts. Drucker (<a href="#drucker2011">2011</a>) explains that
                        “realist models of knowledge” have been
                        instrumental in forming these representations and that “we need to take on the challenge of developing graphical expressions
                        rooted in and appropriate to interpretative activity.”

                        reconsidered by means of concepts or function in a humanities context.
                        Seifert et al. (<a href="#seifert2014">2014, 190</a>) speak of
                        visualization as “an effective enabler for exploratory
                        analysis, making it a powerful tool for gaining insight into unexplored
                        data sets.” Dörk et al. (<a href="#dork2013">2013</a>) go
                        one step further and show a critical approach to information visualization.
                        Disclosure, plurality, contingency, and empowerment are presented as the
                        main characteristics of critical information visualization. In the context
                        of trans-disciplinary research in the digital humanities, Hinrichs et al.
                        (<a href="#hinrichs2019">2019</a>) advocate for the concept of
                        “sandcastles”, which they describe as “tailored, unique, often stunning yet also transient and
                        unstable interactive visualizations.” With this, the authors
                        oppose the reification of data and refer to an iterative process of
                        understanding. In contrast to a conception of visualization as tools, they
                        “elicit critical insights, interpretation,
                        speculation and discussions within and beyond scholarly
                        audiences.”

                              materials and advance an argument about an artifact’s role in the world.
                              Our purpose here is to follow the implications of a hermeneutical

                        convincingly point out, Galey &amp; Ruecker’s concept of argument refers
                        rather to the interface of the digital artifact than to the contents of the
                        text which is supposed to be analyzed with the digital tool. Relating to our
                        earlier comment on argumentation in the context of literary studies as a
                        formal or logical organization of single observations that serve as
                        arguments “to provide evidence in favor of some point of
                        view”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#groarke2017">Groarke 2017</a>], visualizations could serve as another
                        non-linear form of argument that complements textual explications in an
                        argumentation (cf. <a href="#meirelles2019">Meirelles 2019, 169</a>).
                        In a similar vein, Ramsay &amp; Rockwell also sees visualization tools
                        behaving “like hermeneutical theories”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2012">Ramsay, Rockwell 2012</a>] that offer new perspectives on the research
                        object. Kath et al. (<a href="#kath2015">2015</a>) have already

                        visualizations are the approaches from visual text analysis. Although there
                        is a large selection of mainly generic visualization tools scholars can
                        choose from (The TAPoR website<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e865">[5]</a> with its large collection gives a good
                        overview), some tools have gained significant popularity for certain use
                        cases and can almost be considered the de facto standard. Stylometry, for
                        example, is usually conducted with the <cite class="title italic">Stylo</cite><a class="noteRef" href="#d4e871">[6]</a>

                        character networks (cf. <a href="#barbot2019">Barbot et al. 2019</a>).
                        These visualization tools and techniques offer quite complex user interfaces
                        to control the appearance of a visualization. However, a direct manipulation
                        of the resulting visualization is often not possible and so the process is
                        split into two parts: Manipulation of the interface followed by the
                        generation of a static visualization image as an end result. The image does
                        not contain any information on how the scholar got there and what other
                        possible visual configurations might have been possible by changing the
                        parameters and the data used.

                              is devoted to recording a scholar’s or analyst’s observations and

                     <div class="ptext" id="p33">According to Gius &amp; Jacke, what constitutes Piez’s approach to
                        hermeneutical markup is that it is precisely the polyvalence and context
                        sensitivity of literary texts that are taken into account. In order for
                        visualizations to meet hermeneutical requirements, they need to be linked to
                        annotations as interpretative endeavors (cf. <span class="error"><a href="#zirker2016">Zirker &amp; Bauer 2016</a></span>, <a href="#nantke2020">Nantke &amp;
                           Schlupkothen 2020</a>). Polyvalence in particular is not only the
                        decisive feature of interpretative data. Rather, the acknowledgement of
                        polyvalence is one of the conceptual requirements that need to be taken into
                        account in the sense of our hermeneutical premises when using
                        visualizations. This is also linked to the distinction of data and capta, as
                        emphasized by Drucker. In other words, in order to serve this purpose of
                        polyvalence, hermeneutic visualizations must value the performative and
                        theoretical aspect of an interpretative endeavor (modelling, theorizing,
                        critique and discourse) higher than the declarative visual output (results,
                        experimental validation, applicability).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">As we have seen, one issue of the current approaches to digital hermeneutics is
                     the disregard of the epistemological premises of hermeneutics, i.e., the
                     differentiation between intention of author and text, the holistic idea of the
                     understanding of the whole and its parts (circularity of the interpretation
                     process), as well as the dependency between the text and the recipient
                     (subjective and context-dependent reasoning process). Second, the visualizations
                     used in the DH seem to contradict the hermeneutical premises. We see a
                     distortion of the hermeneutic interpretation process, for example, in the use of
                     visualizations that do not take into account the polyvalence of interpretative
                     data. However, in order for visualizations to be used as the missing link in the
                     process of “becoming hermeneutical” in the digital
                     humanities, we need a concept of visualizations that meets the following four
                     postulates as guidelines: <cite class="title italic">Two Way Screen, Quality, Parallax
                        and Discourse</cite>. We understand these postulates as transformers of and
                     mediators between the theoretical hermeneutic model and the concrete visual
                     arrangement.

                     interface, which should not be restricted to rendering, but allow manipulation
                     as well. More precisely, a commitment to the <cite class="title italic">Two Way
                        Screen</cite> implies that the screen serves as an interactive and visual
                     environment in which interpretation (ranging from low-level annotation and
                     structuring to high-level theorizing activity) takes place, not only gets
                     displayed (cf. <a href="#drucker2018">Drucker 2018, 252</a>).

                     an interpretative result. Rather, the interface provides incentives to engage
                     and to change bidirectionally between the representation of text data and the
                     modelling of text data. This means that actions taken by changing any graphical
                     feature as an act of interpretation are registered as new data and/or as changes
                     in the data model on the fly. The underlying principle is to get away from the
                     flat screen as a space of display by acknowledging the additional dimension of
                     interpretative activity (cf. <a href="#drucker2016">Drucker 2016</a>). The
                     postulate of the <cite class="title italic">Two Way Screen</cite> is based on the
                     holistic premise, as it allows a continuous shift between exploring the
                     visualization to learn something about the text (the whole) and applying that
                     new knowledge to change text data (the part), in consequence, creating new
                     representations. Here, as well as in the postulate of <cite class="title italic">Quality</cite>, the constructedness of the data becomes apparent and we
                     can grasp it “as capta, taken and constructed”

                     Ambiguity, as Berndt (<a href="#berndt2009">2009, 122</a>) points out,
                     “denotes a fundamental ‘equivocalness’ that engenders
                     ‘uncertainty’ and ‘doubt’.” The visualization in its
                     parallax function, hence, provokes an ambiguity of a maybe
                     “assumed” certainty or evidence. This provocation
                     generated by the visualization relates to the premise of dependency between text
                     and recipient once more and puts the situatedness and partialness of the
                     hermeneutic reasoning process into effect. Moreover, the ambiguity evokes a

                     represent our arguments changes the way in which we argue” (cf. <a href="#hinrichs2017">Hinrichs &amp; Forlini 2017</a>), we think that a
                     hermeneutic visualization fosters the critical reflection of the hermeneutic
                     process itself. An argumentation comprised of text as well as visualizations as
                     single observations differs from the mere textual form. The connection between
                     visualization, annotations (the object of study) and textual arguments enables a
                     complex, non-linear movement between these entities that does not restrict
                     scholars to one possible reading, but allows a multitude of readings.
                     Furthermore, the direct connection between annotations and visualizations
                     creates a transparency of individual arguments that invites the author as well
                     as the audience to critically reflect the argumentation. In this way, it lives
                     up to the evaluation criteria rigor, intersubjectivity and validation mentioned
                     in 2.1 and leads to an iterative refinement of the argumentation and an
                     oscillation between part and whole, addressing the holistic premise in that
                     way.

                     to them (Fig. 2). All these parts are connected with each other, so that

                        attribute values to selected annotations (or glyphs, respectively). This is
                        exemplified with two attributes scholars can add: certainty and importance.
                        Both attributes take values on a scale from 1 to 5. Setting these values
                        changes the appearance of the glyphs and saves the changes in the underlying
                        JSON format (see Fig. 5). The altered JSON file can be downloaded for each
                        individual view (by clicking on the respective icon on the thumbnail image
                        in the views area). This functionality provides an example of the postulate

                        categories, for example. Generally, when thinking about applying our concept
                        to a full-fledged software tool, it would be desirable to integrate full
                        annotation functionality into the system, while allowing the manipulation of

                        On another level, the ambiguity mentioned in the postulate is exemplified by

                     the connection of digital literary hermeneutics with digital approaches, since
                     they address the epistemological premises of hermeneutics, as we have shown in
                     our exemplary prototypical implementation guided by the postulates.

                     they have an appearance similar to traditional visualizations. This leads us
                     back to the question formulated in the introduction: What do hermeneutic
                     visualizations look like? In other words: Are we able to name distinctive
                     qualities of hermeneutic visualizations?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p63">The answer to this is to be found in the nature of hermeneutic theory expressed
                     by the three premises and operationalized by the four postulates. While
                     certainty and importance are typical examples of partial, contextual, and
                     subjective knowledge and are expressed with the help of visual variables in the
                     prototype, the central holistic premise demands an iterative, circular process
                     of generating meaning and forming arguments that becomes visible in the
                     structure of the user interface, but not primarily in individual
                     visualizations.

                     which might result in more examples of visual variables depicting partial,
                     contextual and subjective knowledge or even completely new visualizations.
                     Newness for its own sake, however, has not been our concern here.

                        Strafkolonie</cite>), we are interested to learn more about other scholars’
                     experience with the prototype in order to further study the appropriateness of
                     the postulates and the idea of hermeneutic visualization. To this end, the
                     prototype has been launched on a website for other scholars to use.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1377">[12]</a> In
                     addition, the source code has been published on BitBucket<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1382">[13]</a> in order to give
                     interested scholars the opportunity to contribute to the development. Being
                     aware that our prototype cannot address all eventualities of hermeneutic
                     activity, we deemed it important to enable scholars to extend the repertoire of
                     hermeneutic visualizations that can be used as arguments. The source code
                     provides a visualization template that can be used to develop other
                     visualizations. Following Hinrichs et al. (<a href="#hinrichs2019">2019</a>), we encourage scholars to come up with new visualizations and
                     adjust existing hermeneutic practices, in that way building
                     “sandcastles” and experimenting with hermeneutic
                     visualizations. The prototype itself necessarily has to be a generic tool, that
                     is capable of supporting a diverse range of hermeneutic scenarios.

                     what premises need to be considered in order for visualization to benefit other
                     interpretative approaches. Since some attributes like ambiguity are not specific
                     to hermeneutics, but common to all theories of interpretation, this research
                     might serve as a starting point for the development of respective approaches in
