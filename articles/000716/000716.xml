        <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
        <p>Late Latin literature is characterized by numerous references to classical texts and authors. For Jerome of
          Stridon in particular, manual-hermeneutic research has revealed various intertextuality phenomena usually published
          in encyclopaedic collections of quotations. In this paper, we present a digital-hermeneutic analysis toolkit
          primarily designed to detect <q>short</q> text-text congruencies that have a high chance of being evaluated as an
          intentional quotation. We favour a mixed-methods approach, which is based on findings from manual-hermeneutic
          research. Our aim is to focus on Jerome's citation technique: Based on hermeneutic analysis of confirmed
          quotations, we formulate differentiated criteria that lead to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of quoting
          and thus also have the potential to optimize our toolkit.</p>

        <p>A central goal of the DFG project <title rend="quotes">Quoting as a narrative strategy: A digital-hermeneutic
          analysis of intertextual phenomena using the example of the letters of Church Father Jerome</title><note>Funded by
          the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), project no. 382880410.</note> is to develop
          and establish a differentiated classification system for the analysis of quotations and allusions that sheds more
          light on quoting as a discursive-narrative strategy and enables a deeper understanding of the cultural
          hybridization processes of Christian Late Antiquity. The epistolary corpus of the biblical scholar Jerome is at the
          center of this investigation because it is particularly characterized by references to (very often pagan)
          pre-texts.<note> Cf., for example: <ptr target="#Luebeck1872"/>, <ptr target="#Hagendahl1958" loc="91–328"/>, <ptr
          target="#Godel1964"/>, <ptr target="#Voß1969"/>, <ptr target="#Burzacchini1975"/>, <ptr target="#Burzacchini1978"
          />, <ptr target="#Jakobi2006"/>, <ptr target="#Cain2013"/>, <ptr target="#Adkin2011"/>, and <ptr
          target="#Feichtinger2021"/>. A synopsis of Jerome’s own statements on the Christian use of classical literature are
          collected by Mohr (<ref target="#mohr2007">2007</ref>).</note></p>
        <p>A methodological focus of the study lies (1) on the critical discussion of the consequences of using digital
          matching processes for citation detection and the understanding of citations in general and (2) on the (further)
          development and optimization of automated detection procedures themselves. Particular attention is paid to the
          transparency of the applied filtering processes since only this guarantees insightful links to hermeneutic
          intertextuality analyses. Moreover, procedures are to be developed that can be applied universally to any text (of
          Latin literature).</p>
        <p>This paper presents the results of considerations relating to citation theory, which support the development of a
          highly precise digital-hermeneutic analysis toolkit for <term>short</term> citations.<note>On the term
          <term>short</term> citation, which is used throughout the paper, see below p. 12.</note> Firstly, the digital
          analysis process is discussed with regard to its links to manual-hermeneutic research as well as relevant contexts
          within the field of digital humanities. After establishing the necessary terminology, corpus requirements, and
          principles of optimization, the steps and procedures of the digital-hermeneutic analysis toolkit are introduced.
          Lastly, we formulate differentiated criteria based on hermeneutic analysis of confirmed <term>short</term>
          quotations that lead to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of quoting and thus also have the potential to
          optimize our toolkit.</p>

        <head>I. Classification of the digital analysis process</head>
        <p>Manual-hermeneutic approaches of <hi rend="italic">Quellenforschung</hi> and intertextuality research have
          predominantly revealed <term>longer</term> text-text congruencies and clearly marked allusions, which — due to the
          high degree of congruency — can usually unambiguously be evaluated as quotations. Additionally, the digitally
          supported investigation process, which is also capable of holistically detecting two-word <hi rend="italic">loci
          similes</hi> in particular, increasingly brings to light parallels that consist of only a small amount of shared
          word material and can therefore, for the time being, only be classified as potential quotations.<note>Analytical
          approaches to the digital detection of intertextuality phenomena have been presented by Bamman and Crane (2008),
          Hohl Trillini and Quassdorf (2010), and Schubert and Heyer (2010) with the <hi rend="italic">Citationgraph</hi> of
          the <hi rend="italic">eAqua</hi> project, Büchler et al. (2014) with the <hi rend="italic">Tracer</hi> of the <hi
          rend="italic">eTrap</hi> project und Manca et al. (2011) within the project <hi rend="italic">Musisque Deoque</hi>.
          The approach of Coffee et al. (2013), which focuses on two-word <hi rend="italic">loci similes</hi>, pursues,
          within the <hi rend="italic">Tesserae</hi> project, an operationalization approach specifically pertaining to
          classical philology, cf. Burns (2017), Diddams and Gawley (2017) as well as the contributions in Coffee et al.
          (2020). However, problems arise in the concrete application of the filter settings (lack of transferability of once
          calibrated settings, lack of explicability and transparency of the selection and insufficient adjustment
          possibilities), so that this project environment is not used for the development of a differentiated classification
          system of citations.</note></p>
        <p>The first digital-hermeneutic mixed-methods approach to treat these matches analytically was presented by Revellio
          (2022). Designed for the detection of (previously undetected) <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> citations and
          allusions, it also analyses Jerome’s citation practice in more detail.</p>
        <p>Revellio’s study thus sheds light <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> on the outer limits of quoting as a phenomenon
          and discusses the question of to what extent and under what conditions textual coincidences of only two identical
          words can at all be declared a quotation. In contrast to unambiguous quotations consisting of a few words or half,
          full, and multiple-verse quotations, these two-word syntagms represent a special category of textual
          correspondences. Here, rather weak citation signals play a role and are still to be determined in more detail. To
          evaluate the citation potency of these new <term>short</term> congruencies, Revellio created a citation typology
          (cf. Revellio, 2022, pp. 189–290, esp. pp. 189–192), incorporating into her proposed categorization morphological,
          syntactic, lexical, idiomatic, and phraseological justifications.</p>
        <p>However, these (hermeneutic) analyses and classification processes are only practicable for a moderate number of
          computer-generated matches. For a universal detection procedure of citations, which is applicable also to larger
          corpora, an even more sophisticated (pre-)selection of actual citations from the pool of found matches is
          mandatory. This goal shall now be achieved through the development of adequate filtering procedures and the
          implementation of a <q>calibrated</q> detection and classification process comprising several phases.</p>

        <head>II. Principles, preconditions, and definitions</head>
        <div>
          <head>Corpus requirements</head>
          <p>One advantage of the detection method presented here is its universal applicability.<note>The present project,
            unlike <hi rend="italic">Tesserae</hi>, does not rely on pre-existing corpora. At the same time this circumstance
            ensures that the criteria arising from the demands for transparency in the filtering process are satisfied (see
            above fn. 4).</note> In principle, any (Latin) text can be used as an input, as long as it is available as an
            appropriately prepared <hi rend="italic">.txt</hi> file. However, this also means that accessibility to
            electronic full texts is essential for the compilation of specific research corpora.<note>Although, in theory,
            the Copyright Act attempts to enable precisely this with regulations on text and data mining for the purposes of
            scientific research, in practice — in our experience — negotiations remain necessary.</note> That said, at the
            present time, the acquisition of the required digital texts is not always easy and even structurally
            problematic.</p>
          <p>The databases accessible without license agreements usually offer the text of older editions, which does not
            always reflect current research. The quality of the texts usually required in the discipline is more likely to be
            ensured in the case of licensed databases since these offer more up-to-date editions. Here, however,
            time-consuming and (in some cases) cost-intensive coordination and negotiation processes with rights holders
            associated with various institutes are necessary. In addition — both in the case of license-free and in the case
            of licensed texts — the accompanying information from critical apparatus is (mostly) missing.</p>
          <p>For the current project, the required classical texts of current editions (without critical apparatus) were
            procured on the one hand through an adaptation of an already existing database license, on the other hand through
            renegotiating a license for the specific use case with regards to methods of text-data-mining.<note>In the first
            case, the texts of the relevant classical authors were made available directly by the publisher without further
            negotiations within the framework of an existing license. In the second case, the situation was more difficult
            because the question of which institution holds the rights to the electronic (!) texts remained unclear until the
            end, even for the publishers involved. In addition, the cost of making the texts available within the existing
            license offer was estimated to be very high, which made negotiations about the cost framework
            necessary.</note></p>
          <p>From a science perspective, however, the use of licensed text editions structurally prevents the transparency
            and reproducibility of the digital analysis processes actually envisaged by the project. After all, in order to
            keep the citation analysis processes replicable, the texts used should also be allowed to be disclosed.<note>The
            copyright exceptions for text-mining methods (especially for research purposes) are limited by regulations
            surrounding the publication of the texts within the context of research results.</note></p>
          <p>All texts provided by the publishers had to be converted into a uniform format for entry into the algorithmic
            processing. This was done using custom <hi rend="italic">Python</hi> code to transform and (re)organize all the
            required paratextual information from the <hi rend="italic">XML</hi> and .<hi rend="italic">txt</hi> formats into
            the final .<hi rend="italic">txt </hi>file formats used.<note>For this step in particular, it would be important
            for publishers to provide texts in a systematic and consistent manner in order to avoid time-consuming adaptation
            processes for singular and divergent text formats.</note> The described detection process is based on the <hi
            rend="italic">Python</hi> programming language in version 3.8.<note>The individual analysis steps, so far, are
            stored in individual scripts. The aim is to combine the scripts into a <hi rend="italic">pipeline</hi>, not least
            for the sake of user-friendliness. It is our intention to publish the code base on the GitHub development
            platform.</note></p>

          <head>Terminology</head>
          <p>The concept of quoting is based on the lexical understanding of citations as it is applied within the existing
            research tradition (i.e., the ancient concept of <hi rend="italic">loci similes</hi>). The entire filtering
            process is thus fundamentally based on finding shared words in Jerome’s corpus of letters as the target text on
            the one hand and in the works of Virgil, Cicero, and other classical authors as source texts on the other.
            According to the <hi rend="italic">loci similes</hi> concept, shared words are identical word forms in a certain
            number.<note>Thus, the citation pair Verg. <hi rend="italic">ecl</hi>. 4,60–61 (<hi rend="italic">Incipe, parue
            puer, </hi>risu <hi rend="italic">cognoscere</hi> matrem<hi rend="italic">: / matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia
            menses</hi> – <hi rend="italic">Begin, baby boy, to recognize your mother with a smile: ten months have brought

          <head>Step 0: Preparing the texts</head>
          <p>The texts, in the form of .<hi rend="italic">txt</hi> files, are subdivided by chapters (for prose) or by verses
            (for poetry). It is important to emphasize that the analysis process can be carried out with any source
            text.<note>On the universal applicability of the detection processes, see above p. 3 with fn. 5.</note></p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Step 1: Separation of sentences und text comparison through Simillima</head>
          <p>These <q>raw</q> texts are examined for two-word congruences by means of the script-based tool <hi rend="italic"
            >Simillima</hi>. These are pairs in which both the source text and the target text contain at least two
            (distinct) words in exactly the same word form.<note>In this routine, the matching process with <hi rend="italic"
            >Simillima</hi> replaces <hi rend="italic">Tesserae</hi> in its basic function of text comparison, cf. Revellio,
            2022, p. 123. Nevertheless, the process is structurally clearly comparable to <hi rend="italic"
            >Tesserae</hi>.</note> The actual comparison of texts is based, in essence, on a <hi rend="italic">matching of
            certain units</hi> of target and source text: each unit of Jerome’s corpus of letters, for example, is compared
            with each unit of the <hi rend="italic">Eclogae</hi>. The whole sentence is taken as the matching unit.<note>
            During the algorithmic procedure the end of a sentence is indicated by a period, question mark, and exclamation
            mark. Of course, the modern punctuation is not an unproblematic criterion, whose employment and effects on the
            results of the study must always be reflected; cf. Revellio, 2022, p. 116 fn. 384. Separation of sentences is
            also performed when a colon and quotation marks are combined, i.e., at the beginning of quoted speech. If, on the
            other hand, a period, question mark, or exclamation mark occur within a parenthesis (marked, for example, by
            brackets), separation of sentences is suppressed in order to keep the parenthesis and the surrounding sentence
            together as one unit. However, insertions marked by dashes can only be addressed programmatically in a few cases,
            because dashes can also occur individually (whereas brackets always occur in pairs). Therefore, the separation of
            sentences is not suppressed for an insertion marked by dashes with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark.
            This can be considered unproblematic, since insertions with such punctuation marks are usually long and it is
            therefore unlikely that quote-constituting split word material can be found around this insertion (distance
            criterion). Sentences of direct speech which are interrupted by speech-introducing words such as <hi
            rend="italic">inquit</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ait</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dixit</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
            >dicit</hi> are also held together. The fact that only the most common speech introductions can be considered
            here is negligible, because it is rather unlikely that a quotation within a literal speech is interrupted (if at
            all) by an insertion other than these standardized variants. Additionally, in order to improve the algorithm,
            periods as part of abbreviations should be treated as exceptions during the separation of sentences. These
            exceptions have so far not been implemented, as <hi rend="italic">Georgics, Eclogues, Aeneid</hi> and Jerome’s
            letters do not contain any abbreviations. Naturally, with a view to other corpora (e.g., Cicero), this is
            necessary and proposed. Moreover, the sentence-tokenization feature of the<hi rend="italic"> Classical Language
            Toolkit</hi> (CLTK) is currently being tested as an alternative.</note> The output file of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Simillima</hi> program contains for each pair a match number, the actual text reference,<note>In the case of
            poetry, the line in which a sentence <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> is taken as the text reference.</note> the
            respective texts (the shared words being highlighted), and finally the shared words themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Step 2: Applying the Complura filter</head>
          <p>The <hi rend="italic">Complura</hi> filter returns matches whose shared word material consists of at least four
            consecutive shared words. The pairs found in this way are at the same time already final (albeit partial)
            results: due to the accumulation of shared words, they are unambiguous quotations that do not require further
            automated analysis.<note>On this filter approach, cf. Revellio, 2022, p. 158. By focusing on the number of
            consecutive <hi rend="italic">shared words</hi> and disregarding their actual order, which may be different in
            the target and source text, there are indeed false (i.e., irrelevant) matches, but only in small numbers. For the
            <hi rend="italic">Georgica</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Eclogae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeneis</hi>, for example,
            the <hi rend="italic">Complura</hi> filter yields 76 correctly identified matches and only five <q>false</q>
            matches, which can be rejected at first glance with little manual effort.</note> Especially in the case of
            clustered synsemantic words (grammatical words such as conjunctions, subjunctions, prepositions, pronouns,
            auxiliary verbs) such citations would also not be detectable in the further digital analysis process.<note>This
            is due to the removal of stopwords, cf. step 3.</note> An example of this phenomenon is a quotation of Virgil in
            Jerome’s letter 52, which has been identified by traditional scholars:</p>

        <div>
          <head>Step 3: Applying filters based on semantic and distance criteria</head>
          <p>Since after the first matching process the number of pairs of sentences is clearly too high for the phase of
            close reading (for example, the matching of the corpus of Jerome’s letters with the <hi rend="italic"
            >Eclogae</hi> yields 408,393 results, that with the <hi rend="italic">Georgica</hi> 1,217,441 results, and that
            with the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 4,525,752 results), filtering criteria of semantic quality and distance
            are applied, as already in Revellio (2022).<note>On the deduction of these criteria and discussion thereof, cf.
            Revellio, 2022, pp. 136–145.</note> First, synsemantic words that are usually not sufficient for proving a
            text–text relationship (i.e. a quotation) are removed with the help of stoplists.<note>On the application of such
            stoplists, cf. Revellio, 2022, pp. 156–159. In addition to the standard list of the <hi rend="italic"
            >Perseus</hi> project, seven corpus-based stoplists consisting of the <hi rend="italic">most frequent words</hi>
            are used. Despite the combination of Virgil’s three works with Jerome’s <hi rend="italic">Epistulae</hi>, the
            stoplists show a strong dominance of Jeromean word material with respect to the autosemantics contained by the
            <hi rend="italic">most-frequent-words</hi> approach. For example, in the first stoplist containing the words
            occurring at least 250 times, the word <hi rend="italic">Christi</hi> (445 times) appears more frequently than
            many synsemantics such as <hi rend="italic">quoque</hi> (<hi rend="italic">too,</hi> 441 times) or <hi
            rend="italic">tu</hi> (<hi rend="italic">you</hi>, 433 times). For comparison, the word <hi rend="italic"
            >Aeneas</hi> only appears in the list of words that occur at least 150 times. Approaches of a differentiated
            weighting of the two texts or of taking into account the frequency of a word within the text (cf. Zou et al.,
            2006) by way of which such disproportions could be corrected have been considered here but could not yet be
            implemented.</note> If two shared words are still contained, their distance is calculated. Then, if a maximum of
            two words are found between them, the matched pair is kept and written into the output file.<note>The distance of
            2 was preferred to the distance of 3 based on previous observations <ptr target="#Revellio2022" loc="144"/>. On
            the implementation, cf. Revellio, 2022, pp. 156–159.</note></p>
          <p>After processing this step the algorithm outputs several result lists (one for each stoplist). One goal in the
            development of the detection process is to determine the one stoplist for which the highest possible number of
            actual quotations can be found among returned matches, but for which, at the same time, the <q>surplus</q> is as
            small as possible.<note>So far, for Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Eclogae</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Georgica</hi>, and
            <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, stoplist 6, which contains words with more than 100 occurrences in the <hi
            rend="italic">Eclogae</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Georgica</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, and Jerome’s <hi
            rend="italic">Epistulae</hi>, has turned out to be optimal in this regard.</note> The number of potential new
            quotations remains comparatively high after this step: for the three mentioned works of Virgil alone, the
            selection of stoplist 6 (at least 100 occurrences) results in 862 pairs for review. Although the number of
            potential new quotations can thus be decimated compared to the first matching process, the algorithm proves to be
            deficient at this stage — especially in view of significantly larger text corpora such as those of late-antique
            authors.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Step 4: Applying the Auctoritas filter</head>
          <p>The <hi rend="italic">Auctoritas</hi> filter bundles these potential new findings that are clearly recognizable
            as intentional citations by explicit reference to authors, works, and the like. Thus, for instance, the phrase
            <hi rend="italic">sceleratum frigus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the villainous cold</hi>) in Jerome’s letter 121 is
            explicitly marked as a citation because the name <hi rend="italic">Uergilius</hi> is mentioned and because there
            is actually a citation marker in the form of the predicate <hi rend="italic">appellet</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
            >calls</hi>):</p>

            filter contains (partially) final results. These are to be classified as quotations due to the explicit reference
            to the respective source text and therefore do not have to go through any further selection processes.</p>

          <head>Step 5: Applying the Scissa filter </head>
          <p>The <hi rend="italic">Scissa</hi> filter eliminates potential new quotations whose shared words — in at least
            one of the two texts (source or target) — do not belong to one syntactic unit. The indicators for separation of
            the word material are <q>soft</q> punctuation marks (comma, colon, and semicolon).<note>After applying the
            filter, pairs are kept where the split word material is separated by the same number of <q>soft</q> punctuation
            marks. In this case, there could be a longer quotation containing, for instance, a subordinate clause.</note>
            Since colons, commas, and semicolons indicate <q>weaker</q> syntactic separations than periods, question marks,
            and exclamation marks, they are not used in step 1 to separate sentences, in order to prevent the heavy
            fragmentation of source and target text. Nevertheless, the caesurae marked in this way can — in this phase of
            more detailed analysis — be used as indicators for syntactic separation of quoted material. This is illustrated
            by a match resulting from the matching of Jerome’s letters with Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> as an
            example:</p>

            characterizes the subject implicitly contained in <hi rend="italic">respondit</hi>. The fact that these shared
            words are thus bound to two different predicate verbs (which is indicated accordingly by commas in the underlying

            object of <hi rend="italic">diluit</hi>) is irrelevant with regard to the separation of the word material in the

            new quotations by 28% for the <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>, by 22% for the <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> and
            by 30% for the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>.<note>The numbers refer to returned matches after stoplist 6 is
            applied. The filter is currently being tested at an early stage. It also can only be applied to potential new
            quotations that have exactly two shared words after application of the stoplists. Beyond an extension of the
            filter’s general capabilities, there is potential for further optimization in two respects. Currently, only an
            unequal number of punctuation marks between the shared words is used as a decisive criterion (i.e., a match is
            rejected as soon as one of the two texts has more commas than the other). In addition, it would also be possible
            to set a maximum limit for the number of allowed <q>soft</q> punctuation marks between the <hi rend="italic"
            >shared words</hi> since the plausibility of the finding being an actual quotation decreases even with the same
            high number of intervening <q>soft</q> punctuation marks. Second, there is a need to optimize the filter also
            with respect to cases where one of the two shared words is contained more than once in a phrase. For example,
            when applying the filter to Verg. <hi rend="italic">ecl</hi>. 10,52–54 (<hi rend="italic">certum est in siluis
            inter spelaea ferarum / malle pati tenerisque</hi> *meos* <hi rend="italic">incidere</hi> *amores*<hi

            you, my love, will grow with them</hi>; shared words: <hi rend="italic">meos</hi>; <hi rend="italic">amores</hi>
            [2x]) two text segments are examined for their <q>soft</q> punctuation marks: | incidere | between <hi
            rend="italic">meos</hi> and the first instance of <hi rend="italic">amores</hi> as well as | incidere amores /
            arboribus: crescent illae, crescetis, | between <hi rend="italic">meos</hi> and the second instance of <hi
            rend="italic">amores</hi>. This results in 0 or 2 commas and 0 or 1 colon. At the moment, this finding is
            retained as soon as the text of Jerome also contains either 0 or 2 commas and either 0 or 1 colon. Thus the find
            is only eliminated if both combinations do not match the text material of Jerome.</note></p>

            implementation of the <hi rend="italic">HTRG</hi> filter.</note> </head>
          <p>The <hi rend="italic">HTRG</hi> filter developed by Revellio is placed after the <hi rend="italic">Scissa</hi>
            filter:</p>
          <p>“Potentielle Funde des computergestützten Textvergleichs, deren übereinstimmendes Wortmaterial der
            Wortartenstruktur nach aus mindestens zwei Nomina oder zwei Verben sowie aus der Kombination dieser beiden

            146–152.</note></p>
          <p>Accordingly, the shared words of each match are analyzed by <hi rend="italic">part-of-speech tagging</hi>.
            Information on whether the combination of shared words satisfies the HTRG rule (N–N; V–V; N–V; V–N) is added to
            each match. Thus, this filter does not eliminate matches but increases the <q>resolution</q> of the output
            data.<note> On the implementation of the filter, cf. Revellio, 2022, pp. 159–160.</note></p>
          <p>The steps of the digital analysis tools described so far are already performed in an automated way. In what
            follows, new optimization strategies are presented that are currently in an experimental stage but seem to be
            target-oriented and promising. By implementing these approaches into the routine, the automation process shall be
            extended and the amount of work in the close-reading phase shall thus be made manageable by further reducing the
            number of returned matches.</p>

        <head>IV. Optimization strategies based on the analysis of published</head>
        <p>quotations of Virgil in Jerome</p>
        <p><term>Short</term> quotations make up only a small proportion of the total amount of quotations of Virgil in
          Jerome’s corpus of letters, a fact that is evident from analyzing the research-based gold standard of published
          Virgilian quotations from the <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Georgics,</hi> and the <hi
          rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>. At the same time, precisely these <term>short</term> quotations are the core result of
          the digital detection process. Because of this discrepancy, the results have to be considered all the more
          critically. In order to filter out further non-relevant (i.e., false) matches prior to the phase of hermeneutic
          close reading, further strategies are presented below, derived from the phenomenological characteristics of known
          and published (i.e., contained in the gold standard) <term>short</term> quotations of Virgil in Jerome. The pairs
          of quotations discussed below — together with the quotation of Verg. <hi rend="italic">georg</hi>. 2,256b–257a in
          Hier. <hi rend="italic">epist</hi>. 121,10,5 discussed in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Auctoritas</hi>
          filter — represent the complete list of Virgilian quotations in Jerome that have two exactly identical word forms
          and can thus be termed <term>short</term>.<note>The complete list of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Virgilian
          quotations in Jerome will be the subject of a further publication.</note></p>
        <p>It should be noted that a match with two <hi rend="italic">shared words</hi> can in actual fact have other
          <q>shared</q> words of identical form. However, these often belong to the category of synsemantics and are
          subsequently removed by applying the stoplists. In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>, <hi
          rend="italic">Georgica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, many of the potential new quotations selected by the
          algorithm do indeed share other words in addition to two shared words <note>These include words such as <hi
          rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ac</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ad</hi>, <hi

          mostly irrelevant for the evaluation of the match as a quotation. <note>For the <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>,
          the following numbers result: Of 89 potential new quotations (stoplist 6 applied), 87 have exactly two shared
          words; of these, 46 share additional words (53%). Similarly in the case of <hi rend="italic">Georgica</hi>: Of 167
          potential citation pairs (stoplist 6 applied), 153 have exactly two shared words; of these, 122 share further
          material (80%). Finally, the following numbers are obtained for the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>: Of 606 potential
          new quotations (stoplist 6 applied), 583 have exactly two shared words; of these, 414 share further words
          (71%).</note> This disregard of synsemantic words among additional shared words indeed does mimic a <q>manual</q>
          hermeneutic reading but still justifies the use of the term <hi rend="italic">short</hi> instead of the term <hi
          rend="italic">two-word citation</hi> (where it would always need to be stated whether only shared words or all
          identical word forms are meant).</p>
        <p>1. Optimization strategy: Taking into account the direct environment of shared words</p>
        <p>The presented algorithm successfully outputs the quotation of Verg. <hi rend="italic">ecl</hi>. 4,60–63 in Hier.

        <p>The syntactic relationship of the two nouns, which are in ablative and accusative case respectively, remains
          unclear at first. Nevertheless, this match can undoubtedly be regarded as an actual quotation. This is confirmed by
          the surrounding text environment. In it, additional <q>material</q> from Virgil’s poem is <q>recycled</q> (but not
          in exactly the same form!): <hi rend="italic">infans paruulus</hi> can be traced back to the twice appearing <hi
          rend="italic">parue puer</hi>, but neither the synonym (<hi rend="italic">infans</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
          >puer</hi>) nor the diminutive (<hi rend="italic">paruulus</hi> &#x2192; <hi rend="italic">paruus</hi>) are
          <q>visible</q> for the algorithm. Moreover, the verb <hi rend="italic">cognoscere</hi> is present in the target
          text, albeit in inflected form, which, in both target and source text, forms the syntactic connection between the
          shared words (<hi rend="italic">matrem</hi>: direct object; <hi rend="italic">risu</hi>: instrumental
          ablative).</p>
        <p>This results in the optimization strategy of making <q>invisible</q> language material, which can be traced back
          to the target text, <q>visible</q> to the algorithm. As the above <term>short</term> quotation shows, this
          additional material in the target text can be connected to the forms of the source text in three different ways: by
          lemmatization (cf. <hi rend="italic">cognoscat</hi> – <hi rend="italic">cognoscere</hi>), by finding synonyms (cf.
          <hi rend="italic">infans</hi> – <hi rend="italic">puer</hi>), and by detecting etymologically related forms (cf.
          <hi rend="italic">paruulus</hi> – <hi rend="italic">paruus</hi>). Through these approaches more quoted words can be
          detected. By marking those quotations that consist of only two shared words but have further similar meaningful
          forms in the same sentence, these filters could significantly support the close reading.</p>
        <p>2. Optimization strategy: Considering the syntactic complexity of highly frequent phrases</p>
        <p>In book 9 of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, Iris urges the Rutulian king Turnus to attack the Trojan camp with

          by poets, is used by Jerome in letter 130, where he writes: <hi rend="italic">rumpe moras omnes</hi> (<hi

          Pliny the Younger; in <hi rend="italic">ep</hi>. 5,10 to Suetonius he uses the words <hi rend="italic">rumpe iam

          250–255, esp. p. 254: “Da Plinius’ <hi rend="italic">rumpe iam moras</hi> nicht mit letzter Sicherheit einer

        <p>It is obvious that despite the presence of two shared words (<hi rend="italic">summo</hi>; <hi rend="italic"
          >culmine</hi>) there is no reference to Virgil’s line. This is due to the different nature of the prepositional
          phrases in which the shared words are found. Besides the semantic difference in the prepositions themselves (<hi
          rend="italic">de</hi> vs. <hi rend="italic">in</hi>), it is then, above all, the greater syntactic complexity of
          Jerome’s phrasing; the identical <hi rend="italic">culmine</hi> is complemented by an attribute genitive (<hi
          rend="italic">uirtutum</hi>). In particular, the addition of this attribute genitive <q>activates</q> the
          figurative meaning of <hi rend="italic">culmen</hi> (<hi rend="italic">summit</hi>), whereas in Virgil <hi
          rend="italic">culmen </hi>refers to a roof ridge.<note>The same phenomenon is even more noticeable in another
          returned match consisting of Verg <hi rend="italic">georg</hi>. 1,401–403 (<hi rend="italic">at nebulae magis ima
          petunt campoque recumbunt, / solis et occasum seruans</hi> de<hi rend="italic"> *</hi>culmine<hi rend="italic">*

          prone to seek the valleys, and rest on the plain, and the owl, as she watches the sunset from some high peak,
          vainly plies her evening song</hi>) and Hier. <hi rend="italic">epist</hi>. 116,5,2 (<hi rend="italic">immo uero
          sanctam scripturam</hi> in<hi rend="italic"> *</hi>summo<hi rend="italic">* </hi>et caelesti auctoritatis<hi

          I should read the holy scriptures, set on the highest, heavenly summit of validity, firmly convinced of their
          truth</hi>), a letter by Augustine written <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Jerome and thus irrelevant for Jerome’s
          quoting style. Again, there are the same two shared words <hi rend="italic">culmine</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
          >summo</hi>. However, in addition to the semantically different prepositions (<hi rend="italic">de</hi> vs. <hi
          rend="italic">in</hi>) as well as the attribute genitive (<hi rend="italic">auctoritatis</hi>) activating the
          figurative meaning, the expression is even more complex because of a second attribute (<hi rend="italic"
          >caelesti</hi>).</note></p>
        <p>The analysis of syntactic complexity thus highlights a difference of source and target text,<note>Virgil:
          preposition + propositional object + attribute adjective; Jerome: preposition + attribute adjective I [+
          conjunction] + attribute adjective II + attribute genitive + propositional object.</note> which seems to make
          semantic shifts detectable for the algorithm. Based on these considerations, a filter (to be implemented after <hi
          rend="italic">part-of-speech tagging</hi>) is being developed that analyzes the syntactic structure underlying the
          shared words and checks whether the syntactic complexity is similar in both source and target text. Increased
          syntactic complexity in one of the two texts considerably reduces the plausibility of a citation. Additionally, the
          absence of complexity (i.e., especially the absence of one or more attributes) seems to be an indication that there
          is no citation, especially in simple adverbial ablative phrases like <hi rend="italic">sole orto</hi> and <hi
          rend="italic">toto orbe</hi>. Frequent adverbials of place and time could be eliminated in this way.</p>
        <p>3. Optimization strategy: Taking into account the manuscript tradition</p>
        <p>A fundamental problem that largely eludes the digital analysis tools is the consideration of the manuscript
          tradition. The algorithm presented here can only take into account a single wording. For example, for the citation
          pairs of Hier. <hi rend="italic">epist</hi>. 126,2,2/129,4,3 = Verg. <hi rend="italic">Aen</hi>. 4,42–43 shown
          below, the digital analysis produces only two shared words (<hi rend="italic">lateque</hi>; <hi rend="italic"
          >Barcaei</hi>). In fact, the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> also give the reading <hi
          rend="italic">uagantes</hi> (<hi rend="italic">roaming</hi>) in addition to <hi rend="italic">furentes</hi> (<hi
          rend="italic">raging</hi>), which Jerome obviously refers to<note>The status as an intentional quotation of the <hi
          rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> cannot be questioned because of the references to <hi rend="italic">Uergilius</hi> (Hier.
          <hi rend="italic">epist</hi>. 126,2,2) and the <hi rend="italic">poeta eloquentissimus</hi> (129,4,3).</note> — and
          not just in this passage.<note>Another occurrence of the phrase within the works of Jerome can be found in <hi
          rend="italic">In Isaeam</hi> 5,21,13–17. Hagendahl (1958, p. 230 fn. 4) already points to the fact that <hi
          rend="italic">uagantes</hi> is present in a number of late manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>.
          Indeed, the critical apparatus of Conte’s <hi rend="italic">Teubner</hi> edition lists <hi rend="italic"
          >uagantes</hi> as another reading instead of <hi rend="italic">furentes</hi>, which can, besides Jerome, also be
          traced back to two <hi rend="italic">Codices Bernenses</hi> from the 9th and 10th century.</note> If <hi
          rend="italic">uagantes</hi> was chosen in the underlying digital text of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, the
          digital analysis process could have detected (depending on the respective stoplist) up to three shared words<hi
          rend="italic">.</hi></p>

              Aeneas. We have faced his fierce weapons, and fought him hand to hand: trust one who has experienced it, how
              huge he looms above his shield, with what whirlwind he hurls his spear! Had Ida’s land borne two others like

              have collected his books, I confess; and therefore, I do not follow errors, because I know all that he has
              written. Trust the one who has experienced it, as if I speak to Christians as a Christian; poisoned are his
              doctrines, strange in relation to the sacred writings, because they do violence to them. Yes, I have read, I
              say, I have read Origen, and, if in reading there is an offense, I confess it — and my purse emptied
              Alexandrian leaves — : If you believe me, I was never a follower of Origen; if you do not believe me, I have

        <p>Due to the shortness of the phrase — and also since it is not the only possible source<note>Cf., for example, Ov.
          <hi rend="italic">ars</hi> 3,511; Sen. <hi rend="italic">Thy</hi>. 81.</note> — this match does not look like an
          obvious quotation at first glance. Nevertheless, the instance in Jerome is accepted as a quotation of Virgil by
          scholars. The key indicator for this verdict is the reuse of the quotation, albeit in shorter form: Jerome has
          already quoted these lines of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> in full in <hi rend="italic">epist</hi>. 50,4,2.
          For the evaluation of potential new quotations, this observation results in the strategy of comparing several
          instances (if any) of <term>short</term> quotations. If a short quotation occurs elsewhere as part of a longer
          quotation, familiarity with the pre-text seems plausible and thus increases the match’s potential to be an actual
          quotation.</p>

      <div>
        <head>V. Concluding remarks and outlook</head>
        <p>From the analysis of published <term>short</term> quotations of Virgil in Jerome consequences arise in two
          respects. On the one hand, concrete optimization strategies for the algorithm can be deduced from phenomenological
          properties of the text passages. These are (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the lemmatization of the close environment of
          quotations, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the analysis of syntactic complexity, especially of compact frequent
          phrases, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the consideration of the manuscript tradition, and (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)
          the testing for iteration of quotations or quotation fragments. On the other hand, independent of the aptitude and
          effectiveness of the filters developed on the basis of these considerations, the analysis of the <term>short</term>
          quotations of Virgil in Jerome also expands the horizon of the manual-hermeneutic reading process: strikingly, none
          of the quotations result only from the sum of the shared words. Indeed, an intentional quotation is only
          recognizable when (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) either further quoted words (inflected or replaced by synonyms) or an
          explicit reference (e.g. naming the source author) are found in the environment, when (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
          high-frequency phrases are quoted in their exact syntactic structure (and thus at the same time are
          <term>longer</term> quotations), when (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) editorial changes obscure further shared words
          (precisely a problem of computer-aided access to digital texts), or when (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) finally the
          reuse of a quotation fragment can be proven.</p>
        <p>These findings, which also shed light on Jerome’s citation technique, are of central importance for any further
          systematization of citation recognition processes, as they define initial <q>minimum standards</q> for citations
          and thus make the structured parameters of citation theory visible and transparent — and easier to
          operationalize.</p>
