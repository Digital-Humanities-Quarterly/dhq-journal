                  <p>Late Latin literature is characterized by numerous references to classical texts and
                     authors. For Jerome of
                     					Stridon in particular, manual-hermeneutic research has revealed various intertextuality
                     phenomena usually published
                     					in encyclopaedic collections of quotations. In this paper, we present a digital-hermeneutic
                     analysis toolkit
                     					primarily designed to detect “short” text-text congruencies that have a high chance of being evaluated as an
                     					intentional quotation. We favour a mixed-methods approach, which is based on
                     findings from manual-hermeneutic
                     					research. Our aim is to focus on Jerome's citation technique: Based on hermeneutic
                     analysis of confirmed
                     					quotations, we formulate differentiated criteria that lead to a deeper understanding
                     of the phenomenon of quoting
                     					and thus also have the potential to optimize our toolkit.</p>

                     textual coincidences of only two
                     					identical words can at all be declared a quotation. In contrast to unambiguous
                     quotations consisting of a few words

                     					evaluate the citation potency of these new “short” congruencies, Revellio created a citation typology (cf.
                     					Revellio, 2022, pp. 189–290, esp. pp. 189–192), incorporating into her proposed

                     prepositional
                     					phrases in which the shared words are found. Besides the semantic difference
                     in the prepositions themselves (<span class="hi italic">de</span> vs. <span class="hi italic">in</span>), it is then, above all, the greater syntactic complexity of
                     					Jerome’s phrasing; the identical <span class="hi italic">culmine</span> is complemented by an attribute genitive (<span class="hi italic">uirtutum</span>). In particular, the addition of this attribute genitive ‘activates’ the figurative
                     					meaning of <span class="hi italic">culmen</span> (<span class="hi italic">‘summit</span>; top’), whereas in Virgil <span class="hi italic">culmen </span>refers to a roof ridgewhereas in Virgil the meaning of culmen is ‘roof ridge’.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1980">[40]</a>

                     					the shared words and checks whether the syntactic complexity is similar in both
                     source and target text. Increased
                     					syntactic complexity in one of the two texts considerably reduces the plausibility
                     of a citation. Additionally, the

                     seems to be an indication that

                     the situation was more difficult

                     criterion, whose
                     							employment and effects on the results of the study must always be reflected;

                     							384. Separation of sentences is also performed when a colon and quotation marks
                     are combined, i.e., at the
                     							beginning of quoted speech. If, on the other hand, a period, question mark,
                     or exclamation mark occur within a
                     							parenthesis (marked, for example, by brackets), separation of sentences is
                     suppressed in order to keep the
                     							parenthesis and the surrounding sentence together as one unit. However, insertions
                     marked by dashes can only be
                     							addressed programmatically in a few cases, because dashes can also occur individually
                     (whereas brackets always
                     							occur in pairs). Therefore, the separation of sentences is not suppressed for
                     an insertion marked by dashes
                     							with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark. This can be considered unproblematic,
                     since insertions with
                     							such punctuation marks are usually long and it is therefore unlikely that quote-constituting
                     split word
                     							material can be found around this insertion (distance criterion). Sentences
                     of direct speech which are
                     							interrupted by speech-introducing words such as <span class="foreign i">inquit, ait, dixit</span>, or
                     								<span class="foreign i">dicit</span> are also held together. The fact that only the most common speech
                     							introductions can be considered here is negligible, because it is rather unlikely
                     that a quotation within a
                     							literal speech is interrupted (if at all) by an insertion other than these
                     standardized variants. Additionally,
                     							in order to improve the algorithm, periods as part of abbreviations should
                     be treated as exceptions during the
                     							separation of sentences. These exceptions have so far not been implemented,
                     as <cite class="title italic">Georgics</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Eclogues</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Aeneid</cite> and Jerome’s
                     							letters do not contain any abbreviations. Naturally, with a view to other corpora
                     (e.g.e.g., Cicero), this is
                     							necessary and proposed. Moreover, the sentence-tokenization feature of the
