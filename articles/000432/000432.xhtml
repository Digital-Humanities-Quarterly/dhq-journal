                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Gamers, Amanda Phillips says, have always been in trouble. One could not agree more.
                     In their book, they push the
                     					boundaries of such trouble; questioning it rather than categorizing it, choosing
                     to “run towards the trouble”
                     					rather than against it. <cite class="title italic">Gamer Trouble</cite> is an exploration of the discomfort, chaos, and
                     					confusion of video gaming culture, as well as an examination of how structural
                     hierarchies inform, and are often
                     					reinforced by, the process of game design, creation, and play. The book uses
                     queer and feminist theory, film
                     					studies, media studies, as well as race theory, to probe into gaming culture.
                     While games have been discussed using
                     					these concepts before, Phillips’ book is characterized by an important element
                     — chaos. Unlike most other
                     					scholarship, which tries to taxonomize game theory into neat categories, Phillips
                     not only accepts but encourages
                     					the chaos inherent in the form; accepting the mutability of gaming rather than
                     attempting to pin it down, leads to
                     					a nuanced, fertile analysis that does not build boundaries for itself.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">It is oft-discussed that video games perpetuate several forms of discrimination and
                     violence, but rather than
                     					dismissing games altogether, Phillips chooses to get into the thick of things.
                     Phillips emphasizes the dichotomy
                     					between the necessity of the simple pleasure of gaming and the frustration that
                     accompanies the recognition of how
                     					games are contributing to social inequality — in that context, Phillips engages
                     with sexism, homophobia, and racism
                     					in video gaming, while also being a gamer and a video game fan themself. That
                     is crucial — their double-pronged
                     					approach of being both an academic and a fan means that they can critique effectively
                     while also being aware of
                     					more quotidian perspectives, giving the work an edge over several others in the
                     field. Phillips also analyses the
                     					discipline of game studies as a whole — while occupying a position within the
                     field, they critique the exclusionary
                     					aspects not just of video games themselves but also the ways of discussing them.
                     Phillips’ concept of
                     						<em class="term">trouble</em> is also an invocation of the genealogies of conversations about feminism and
                     					intersectionality, which meet, diverge, and cross each other, creating another
                     chaotic landscape that is used as a
                     					lens to view game production and content. In addition, trouble also refers to
                     the simultaneous materiality and
                     					subjectivity of video games — which are hardware, software, story, interactivity,
                     and more. Phillips’
                     						<em class="term">trouble</em> has several meanings, and the book covers all these implications in some detail.</div>

                     					<cite class="title italic">Gamer Trouble</cite> goes beyond just the console to think about how video games come to be,
                     					how they are played, and how they are talked about. The book is both specific
                     and comprehensive — along with some
                     					detailed close reading of games, the book covers several important aspects of
                     the video game scene. While the
                     					second chapter goes into the technological aspects of gaming, specifically character
                     creation and the biases
                     					involved, the third and fourth chapters cover representation in a few case study
                     games: <cite class="title italic">Portal</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Bayonetta,</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">Mass Effect</cite>
                     					trilogy. The first chapter, meanwhile, discusses discourses about gaming, including
                     sexist campaigns like
                     					#GamerGate and responses to them.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">The first chapter thinks about the histories of video gaming to come to the crucial
                     conclusion that #GamerGate was
                     					ordinary rather than extraordinary. It critiques discourses in video game communities,
                     arguing that their
                     					vitriolic, sexist nature is not new. Phillips frames this using <cite class="title italic">Dickwolves</cite>, a 2010
                     					controversy where gamers retaliated to a rape joke featured in a popular comic
                     <cite class="title italic">Penny
                        						Arcade</cite>. They discuss the figures of the “mean mommy,”
                     					“angry feminist,”
                     					“based mom,” and “killjoy,” derogatory terms given to feminist gamers, most often people of minoritized
                     					genders and of colour, for daring to disrupt sexist status quos with their critique.
                     In gaming spaces, such
                     					critique has often been and continues to be, misrepresented, laughed at, and
                     eventually dismissed due to
                     					(falsified) reasons of a lack of gaming aptitude. Their statement of the ordinariness
                     of #GamerGate can be mistaken
                     					as Phillips trivialising it; however, their assertion is not that it was insignificant,
                     but that such practices
                     					have been occurring for a long time. With the <cite class="title italic">Dickwolves</cite> example, they demonstrate
                     					that the issue does not start with #GamerGate, but has origins much farther behind
                     than that, compelling readers to
                     					look differently at gaming history. It is also important here to take non-academic
                     discourses very seriously —
                     					through their methodologies, Phillips recognises that video games are not made
                     for studying; they are primarily for
                     					playing, so conversations had on platforms like forums, social media threads,
                     and stream comments are
                     					indispensable. Crucially, Phillips’ argument is not limited to gamer discourse
                     itself — they also point to academic
                     					conversations about games, or the field of game studies itself. Here, they trace
                     how it has, until recently, been
                     					male-dominated, and analyses the academic writing (or lack thereof) around <cite class="title italic">Grand Theft
                        						Auto</cite> to demonstrate how the field has been selective in its scholarship and, as a result,
                     prohibitive for
                     					marginalized communities.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">In the second chapter, Phillips considers how games are created — examining animation
                     and development processes,
                     					and how technology reflects sociocultural biases about race and gender. Phillips
                     invokes <em class="term">quantization</em>,
                     					or the “chunking up of a thing like the human face into discrete numbers, in order to explore
                     						the ways that the numerical fictions about bodies overwrite the complexities
                     of actual identity”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#phillips2020">Phillips 2020</a>, 22–23]. The chapter begins with an exploration of <cite class="title italic">Kara,</cite> a short film by Quantic Dreams created to demonstrate the animation potential of
                     the company’s new
                     					game engine. Here, Phillips discusses how that was done through motion capture
                     technology that brought together
                     					multiple actors of various racial identities, whose differences were erased in
                     favour of homogenous whiteness while
                     					also reaffirming a unidimensional concept of diversity through Kara’s ability
                     to, say, perform a Japanese lullaby
                     					with native fluency. Situating such analyses in the racial science of physiognomy,
                     which attempts to read
                     					personality traits into face features, Phillips goes on to analyse avatar creation,
                     using <cite class="title italic">Fallout 3</cite> as a case study. As methodologies to understand the workings of the black boxes behind
                     					interfaces, they consider both deformance, or manipulating interfaces to the
                     extreme to unravel how they work, and
                     					modding, playing around existing code to explore how much, and in what ways,
                     the game can be remoulded. Phillips
                     					invokes Gloria Anzaldúa’s “hacienda caras,” and claims that gamers’
                     					interactions with avatar creation interfaces are models of navigating oppressive
                     structures through masks (the
                     					avatar itself); limitations on avatar creation possibilities, therefore, represent
                     a “wrinkle
                     						in the power envelope”
                     					[<a class="ref" href="#phillips2020">Phillips 2020</a>, 23] that differentially affects minoritized gamers. Here, Phillips’ technical
                     					know-how comes into good use: using effective technological methodologies combined
                     with literary theory to generate
                     					innovative analyses.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">From analysing the impacts of avatar creation possibilities, Phillips moves on to
                     representations of the
                     					characters themselves. Here, they use Laura Mulvey’s concept of the <em class="term">male gaze,</em> popularized by film and
                     					media studies, to look at video game characters, specifically from <cite class="title italic">Portal</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Bayonetta</cite>. They consider how gaze operates differently in video games, considering the
                     					presence of user-controlled cameras and of multiple objects which compete for
                     attention. For <cite class="title italic">Portal</cite>, they analyze GLaDOS, the disembodied female antagonist of the game, juxtaposed with
                     Chell, the
                     					female avatar players inhabit. Chell is upheld in feminist gamer circles for
                     being brown and wearing a
                     					full-coverage jumpsuit — which Phillips complicates in discussing her ambiguous
                     brownness, arguing that Chell’s
                     					character caters to concerns about representation using a least-risk model, intending
                     to maximise market value at
                     					the expense of specificity. Meanwhile, the sexy titular character of <cite class="title italic">Bayonetta,</cite> who,
                     					with her unrealistic proportions and improbable body contortions, was very controversial,
                     is more than an appeal to
                     					the male gaze — Phillips moves beyond authorial intent to read Bayonetta’s mixed-race
                     heritage, interactions with
                     					other female characters, as well as movements, to argue that the character defies
                     heteronormativity and challenges
                     					accepted narratives of gender. Ultimately, the third chapter argues for an updated
                     lens of considering questions of
                     					race and gender in video gaming, making the case that gendered power dynamics
                     are “more
                     						troubled than they seem.”</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The last chapter looks at FemShep, the female version of <cite class="title italic">Mass Effect’s</cite> customisable
                     					hero, Commander Shepard. The chapter begins with the question of whether Femshep
                     exists, and ends with the
                     					assertion that FemShep should not exist. FemShep is known for her sexual interactions
                     with characters of various
                     					genders, thus being heralded as a depiction of queerness in gaming; however,
                     Phillips studies game animations to
                     					show that FemShep’s animations, even in sexual contexts, are not very different
                     from BroShep (the male Commander
                     					Shepard); more than being a queer woman, FemShep runs on the code and motion
                     of a man, simply with the appearances
                     					of a woman. Phillips also considers how FemShep was not a part of the initial
                     promotions of <cite class="title italic">Mass Effect</cite>, such decisions later reversed only in favour of a white, redheaded, stereotypically
                     					attractive FemShep being shown in such promotions. Using Audre Lorde’s concept
                     of “house of
                     						difference”, as well as Kara Keeling’s “I=Other”, Phillips moves beyond
                     					neoliberal notions of diversity and advocates, instead, for difference.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Like the word “trouble” in its title, <cite class="title italic">Gamer Trouble</cite> is a book that defies
                     					categories — it derives its meaning from its muchness, from its difficulty to
                     pin down or confine. It is here,
                     					there, everywhere, in the best way possible. It looks at video games through
                     feminist history, queer theory, and
                     					race-related scholarship, asking important questions and creating a landscape
                     that is generative more than
                     					destructive. The book does not draw rigid boundaries, and neither does Phillips,
                     who is a gamer, researcher,
                     					writer, and video game fan, all of which are brought to the writing, making it
                     vibrant, dynamic, and colourful.
                     					Though it is a tad technical, <cite class="title italic">Gamer Trouble</cite> is fairly accessible too, readable by most
                     					audiences. The conversations Phillips creates are chaotic; they engage you more
                     than placate you, surprise you more
                     					than satisfy you, and challenge you more than gratify you. <cite class="title italic">Gamer Trouble</cite> does not give
                     					you answers to your questions — it makes you search for them yourself, and embark
                     on a wonderful journey.</div>
