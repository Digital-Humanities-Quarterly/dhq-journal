                <p>Skillful identification and interpretation of arguments is a cornerstone of
                    learning, scholarly activity and thoughtful civic engagement. These are
                    difficult skills for people to learn, and they are beyond the reach of current
                    computational methods from artificial intelligence and machine learning, despite
                    hype suggesting the contrary. In previous work, we have attempted to build
                    systems that scaffold these skills in people. In this paper we reflect on the
                    difficulties posed by this work, and we argue that it is a serious challenge
                    which ought to be taken up within the digital humanities, in particular, and,
                    more generally, in related efforts to computationally support scholarly
                    practice. Network analysis, bibliometrics, and stylometrics, essentially leave
                    out the fundamental humanistic skill of charitable argument interpretation
                    because they touch very little on the meanings embedded in texts. We present a
                    problematisation of the design space for potential tool development, as a result
                    of insights about the nature and form of arguments in historical texts gained
                    from our attempt to locate and map the arguments in one corner of the HathiTrust
                    digital library.</p>

                <p><quote rend="inline">We speak, for example, of an <q>angry</q> wasp.</quote> This
                    sentence appears in the first edition of Margaret Floy Washburn’s textbook
                        <title rend="italic">The Animal Mind: An Introduction to Comparative
                        Psychology</title>, published in 1908. It occurs as part of an argument she
                    presents against the anthropomorphic idea that we humans can use our
                    introspection of anger to understand the emotions of organisms so
                    physiologically and anatomically different from us. One suspects that Washburn,
                    whose story deserves more space than we can give it here, was intimately
                    familiar with anger. She was the first woman to earn a PhD in psychology in the
                    United States—albeit not from Columbia University, where she wanted to study.
                    Columbia were unwilling to set the precedent of admitting a woman for doctoral
                    studies. Instead she received her degree from Cornell University, where she was
                    accepted to the Sage School of Philosophy under the mentorship of Edward B.
                    Titchener, the pioneering psychologist who pursued a combined introspective and
                    experimental approach to the human mind. Washburn’s textbook would go through
                    four editions, spaced roughly a decade apart, spanning one of the most
                    consequential periods for psychology in its protracted separation from
                    philosophy as a new experimental discipline. After World War II, Washburn’s book
                    faded from view. We discovered it in the digital haystack of the HathiTrust with
                    the assistance of computational methods we deployed to help us locate
                    argumentative needles such as the sentence leading this paragraph, the kind of
                    process one of the present authors describes elsewhere as <cit><quote
                            rend="inline" source="#allen2017">guided serendipity</quote>
                        <ptr target="#allen2017"/></cit>.</p>
                <p>Our goal in this essay is to urge more attention in the digital and computational
                    humanities to the important scholarly practice of interpreting arguments. We
                    describe what we learned from our attempt to take an argument-centered approach
                    to humanistic enquiry in a big digital repository. We acknowledge that the
                    methods and approach we adopted represents an initial attempt to explore a
                    complex digital humanities problem, and can be improved upon, as one of our main
                    aims is to draw attention to this problem and spur further work in this area. We
                    believe we have provided a road map to guide future work—or, at least, an
                    analogue to one of those early maps of the world drawn by explorers, no doubt
                    distorting the major land masses, but better than nothing. If not dragons, wasps
                    lie here, and although much of the work described here involved good
                    old-fashioned human interpretation, our discovery of Washburn’s textbook and the
                        <q>angry</q> wasps therein can be credited to the power of the computational
                    methods we used to locate arguments about the anthropomorphic attribution of
                    mental qualities such as anger to nonhuman animals.</p>
                <p>Some of our work has been previously outlined in other publications that focused
                    on our multi-level computational approach <ptr target="#murdocketal2017"/> and a
                    technical investigation of the challenges of automated argument extraction <ptr
                        target="#lawrence2014"/>. Here, for the first time, we provide more detail
                    about the human component of argument identification, extraction and
                    representation scaffolded by the use of topic models to find relevant content.
                    Through a two-stage, topic-modeling process, we drilled down from a book-level
                    model of a large corpus (too large to read in a decade) a page-level model of a
                    smaller subcorpus (still representing at least a year’s reading). This allowed
                    us to select a few dozen pages from six books containing arguments that were
                    mapped in detail within a few weeks by a team member with no prior expertise in
                    psychology or the history and philosophy of science. The argument maps produced
                    by this step of human interpretation allowed us to identify statements that
                    could be fed back into a third level of topic modeling, drilling down to the
                    level of sentences in a single book. In this way we were able to discover other
                    relevant arguments within the same text, including the one about “angry” wasps
                    and another about the cognitive powers of spiders.</p>
                <p>Automated argument extraction, also known as argument mining, has significant
                    challenges and remains a holy grail of artificial intelligence research (e.g.,
                    see <ptr target="#mochales2011"/>; <ptr target="#acl2018"/>). Our approach
                    contributes only minimally to solving that problem <ptr target="#lawrence2014"/>
                    and, in fact, we doubt it is truly solvable with existing methods. Nevertheless,
                    we propose that the digital humanities should invest more effort in developing
                    argument-centered approaches to computational text analysis. We could be
                    provocative and say that stylometrics and bibliometrics are the low-hanging
                    fruit of digital humanities, and it is time for the digital humanities to take
                    up challenges that may be harder, but which have more real-world impact. The
                    skill of interpreting arguments is a cornerstone of education, scholarship, and
                    civic life. Arguments are fundamental to human meaning making and to the
                    maintenance, and reform of social norms. Even if the field of artificial
                    intelligence is a long way from being able to properly interpret arguments in
                    context, humanities scholars can use tools that are not so far out of reach to
                    assist in their analysis and interpretation of the arguments that structure
                    discourse in both academic and public domains. Interpreting arguments as they
                    appear in historical documents brings them alive, allowing scholars, students,
                    and citizens to understand their relevance for current issues. But before the
                    arguments can be interpreted, they must first be found. As we demonstrate in
                    this paper, available computational methods can strongly assist with that.</p>

                <head>Exploring Arguments in the Digital Sphere: Animal Minds as a Proxy
                    Domain</head>
                <p>We focused on the early 20th Century debate about animal minds because, in the
                    aftermath of Darwin’s revolutionary effect on biology, it was a particularly
                    fertile arena for historically important arguments that were still poised
                    between scientific and literary styles of writing, and also for the pragmatic
                    reason that it fitted our prior expertise in psychology, ethology, and
                    philosophy of cognitive science. The debate remains lively in academic circles
                    more than a century since Washburn published her book, and it is, of course,
                    important to the ongoing public debates about animal welfare and animal rights.
                    A close reading of Washburn’s text reveals to a modern reader a mixture of
                    familiar and unfamiliar arguments, many of which deserve revisiting today. Our
                    work also led us to five other texts (described below), which present a similar
                    mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar. Anyone who engages closely with the
                    arguments in these books learns much about the trajectory that psychology in the
                    English-speaking world was on, and also comes to understand how current debates
                    about animal minds are dependent on the paths laid down these earlier
                    authors.</p>
                <p>The late 19th century and early 20th century was a period of significant
                    development for psychology that was characterised by important and competing
                    arguments. Experimental methods were on the rise, and psychologists, who had
                    often been housed in the same university department as the philosophers, were
                    professionalising, forming their own associations and journals, and their own
                    departments. Philosophy could be seen as retreating from the arguments based on
                    experimental evidence increasingly favored by psychologists, while psychologists
                    were wondering which of their received concepts and theories should be
                    jettisoned, and which could form the basis of further empirical investigation.
                    Such questions were particularly acute in animal comparative psychology. On the
                    one hand, Darwin’s theory of evolution exerted a strong pull towards the idea of
                    mental continuity between humans and animals. On the other hand, many Darwinians
                    were seemingly content with anecdotal evidence of animal intelligence to make
                    their case on analogical grounds to human behaviour, leading experimentally
                    inclined psychologists to reject such anecdotes and analogies as
                        <q>anthropomorphic</q>. Even as the disciplines of psychology and philosophy
                    were formally disassociating themselves, philosophical arguments about the
                        <q>proper</q> way to study animal psychology were becoming even more
                    prominent among the psychologists themselves.</p>
                <p>While comparative psychology in the immediate post-Darwin era was a particularly
                    fertile era for the interplay between philosophy and science, the domain we
                    selected is not special. It serves as a proxy for any domain where
                    interpretation remains open and debate inevitably ensues. The lessons learned
                    from our attempt to find and interpret text about anthropomorphism in
                    comparative psychology generalise to other domains. There is no substitute for
                    reading the relevant texts closely, but there is similarly no substitute for
                    computational <q>distant reading</q> of such a massive repository as the
                    HathiTrust in order to select which texts are the best candidates for close
                    reading and extraction of their arguments.</p>
                <p>The skills involved in interpreting arguments are essential in supporting and
                    developing critical thinking and writing skills – even, and especially, where
                    digital media predominate (e.g., <ptr target="#wegerif2007"/>; <ptr
                        target="#ravenscroftetal2008"/>; <ptr target="#ravenscroft2010"/>; <ptr
                        target="#pilkington2016"/>). The volume and variety of this digital sphere
                    provides opportunities for thinking, learning and writing within and across
                    educational, professional and civic contexts. Across these contexts the need to
                    identify, understand, and critically compare arguments is particularly important
                    today to counteract a discourse in which accusations of <q>fake news</q> and
                    appeals to emotion are used to promote simplistic, insufficiently contextualised
                    arguments and propositions, often overriding well evidenced and supported
                    positions on a subject. There is a pressing need to support and promote
                    scholarly practices focused on identifying, understanding and comparing written
                    arguments that can occur within texts in massive data or document
                    repositories.</p>
                <p>The availability of massive document collections transforms the scale and
                    complexity of the tasks of searching for and interpreting arguments, but these
                    collections hold out great potential for understanding the academic and broader
                    cultural contexts in which these arguments were historically and are presently
                    situated. A key inspiration for our approach was to help inexperienced scholars
                    simulate the way an experienced or expert scholar moves from macro-level views
                    of document collections to micro-level close reading and interpretation of the
                    key arguments in particular texts.</p>
                <p>Of course, there will always be ethical issues, linked to any sociological and
                    political framing around decisions about which digital collections to focus on.
                    For example, the extent to which these may or may not be not-for-profit and
                    available to the public. In our case, we worked with the HathiTrust collection,
                    because it is a consortium of mostly public state universities – spearheaded by
                    Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana – who retain ownership of the scanned content,
                    up to the limits of the applicable copyright laws, although Google supported
                    work to accelerate the scanning of these materials. The original
                    proof-of-concept tool-set that we are proposing and discussing in this article
                    is aimed at gaining insights, both conceptual and technological, about finding
                    and interpreting arguments in digital repositories of any kind in principle.
                    Therefore this work is aiming to be relatively generic in its positioning around
                    what repository to focus on, although for pragmatic reasons also, the HathiTrust
                    was particularly suitable because project members, and one co-author (Allen),
                    were working at Indiana University at the time of this project, which
                    facilitated the cooperation with the HathiTrust Research Center.</p>

                <head>Investigation by Design</head>
                <p>Our approach was also inspired by prior work on the methodology of <title
                        rend="quotes">Investigation by Design</title> by one of the authors <ptr
                        target="#ravenscroftandpilkington2000"/>. This work was originally developed
                    to model and simulate collaborative argumentation practices (<ptr
                        target="#mcalister2004"/>; <ptr target="#ravenscroft2007"/>) leading to
                    learning and conceptual development (<ptr target="#ravenscroftetal1999"/>; <ptr
                        target="#ravenscroft2000"/>). A key idea behind this approach is that
                    technology which effectively enhances scholarship and learning practices should
                    balance existing practices with the technological possibilities for enhancing
                    that practice. In other words, we should not try to fundamentally disrupt the
                    way that people approach texts, but seek to amplify and enhance their processes
                    and practices so as to support more powerful learning and scholarly
                    interpretation across a wider variety of contexts. In our application the
                    existing practice consists of skimming texts for arguments followed by close
                    critical reading of them, and the technological enhancements are (1) topic
                    modelling to improve the searching and (2) argument mapping to improve the
                    identification, analysis and interpretation of the arguments. The semi-formal
                    nature of the mapping tool used in the second component forced us to reflect on
                    what is required of close critical reading during the analysis, construction and
                    representation processes. Furthermore, we believe the level at which we have
                    designed our approach satisfies what Edwards et al. (2012) refer to as
                            <cit><quote rend="inline">below the level of the work</quote>, i.e., a
                        level where <quote rend="inline">Neither the exact implementation of

                <p>Consider the challenge facing learners and researchers confronted with massive,
                    digitised document collections that are not readily browsable in the way that
                    shelves of library books once were. For one thing, many of the books of interest
                    have been physically shifted to deep storage facilities and must be called up
                    one-by-one rather than whole shelves at a time. (In a previous issue of this
                    journal, Jennifer Edmond (2018) laments the loss of serendipity this entails.)
                    For another, the digitised collection represented by the HathiTrust Digital
                    Library is an order of magnitude larger than any single library collection, so
                    what was one shelf may have become the digital equivalent of ten. When browsing
                    shelves of physical books, readers might pull a book off the shelf, sample a few
                    pages from the book, and decide whether to put it back or to check it out of the
                    library for closer reading. In the digital library, that decision takes on a
                    different character: on the one hand there is a sense in which we don’t have to
                    put anything back as we can carry out macroscopic analyses of very large numbers
                    of texts; on the other hand we must still make selections for the closer
                    readings that provide valuable insights that are currently beyond the reach of
                    algorithms.</p>
                <p>It is our view that a tool that links searching of massive document collections
                    to close critical reading of key arguments therein would have significant value
                    across educational contexts. It could make the practices of experienced scholars
                    more systematic, efficient and powerful. Perhaps more importantly, it could
                    empower and support less experienced learners to engage in systematic critical
                    thinking and reasoning linked to identifying and understanding arguments, which
                    is a well-attested challenge throughout education (e.g., see <ptr
                        target="#ravenscroftetal2007"/>; <ptr target="andrews2009"/>; <ptr
                        target="#ravenscroft2010"/>). Although previous research has shown the value
                    of argument mapping to support greater <q>sense making</q> and learning in
                    general, this work has involved <q>standalone</q> mapping tools <ptr
                        target="#kirschner2012"/> that do not link the maps to the larger textual
                    and intellectual context in which they arise.</p>
                <p>At the time we conducted the work upon which we base our discussion here, public
                    access to the HathiTrust Digital Library was restricted to the approximately
                    300,000 volumes outside copyright and in the public domain in the United States.
                    Now, the HathiTrust provides non-consumptive access to over 14 million volumes,
                    increasing the challenge of identifying key texts from unreadable quantities of
                    text for the purpose of close reading and argument extraction, making it even
                    more important to develop techniques and tools such as those we discuss here. A
                    primary challenge at this scale concerns how to identify and compare
                    argumentation and arguments within and across texts, in a way that is analogous
                    to the way a scholar works, moving from a macro-level view of texts to the close
                    critical reading of particular arguments within and across texts. This work
                    (whose technical details are reported by <ptr target="#mcalister2014"/> and <ptr
                        target="#murdocketal2017"/>) represented the first time that topic modeling
                    and argument mapping had been combined in a process that allowed a scholar to
                    identify pages within texts that should be fed into the argument mapping task,
                    both necessitating and supporting a close critical reading of those texts by the
                    individual engaged in the process. This work, through ostensibly technical work,
                    included a broader exploration of the possibilities for integrating science
                    mapping and visualization, along with an initial attempt at argument extraction
                        <ptr target="#mcalister2014"/>. In this paper we provide a detailed critical
                    examination of the nature and form of arguments that were identified in the
                    texts, and we consider the centrality of the interpreter and the interpretative
                    processes in extracting these arguments given their historical and cultural
                    contexts. This critical examination supports our wider reflections on the role
                    of such technical methods in supporting the identification, interpretation and
                    comparison of important historical arguments. These reflections provide the
                    basis for our <q>bigger vision</q> concerning the important challenge of
                    understanding arguments via the digital humanities, and the broader implications
                    for any field where identifying and interpreting digital arguments is important,
                    or vital.</p>

                <head>Searching and interpreting as a pedagogical practice: The challenge of
                    identifying, analysing and understanding arguments in texts</head>
                <p>Texts do not give up their meanings easily, and different branches of the
                    humanities bring different interpretative strategies to bear on the very same
                    texts. For instance, philosophy students and scholars seek to understand
                    conceptual frameworks and arguments that are typically not fully explicit in the
                    texts they study. History students and scholars studying the very same texts may
                    seek different kinds of clues to assist in their interpretations, such as facts
                    about the social and cultural milieu in which they were written, or the specific
                    contacts and experiences that led to particular acts of authorship. Literature
                    students and scholars may focus on narrative structure in those texts, and the
                    extent to which a given piece of work follows or flaunts literary
                    conventions.</p>
                <p>When the goal is also to exploit large datasets in support of traditional
                    humanities research and learning, it is necessary to answer the question of how
                    computational methods might help these kinds of students and scholars alike. For
                    instance, consider the history scholar or student who already knows the
                    biographical details of a 19th Century author, but wants to understand the
                    narrative or argumentative structure of specific passages in that author's work.
                    Scientometric methods such as the analysis of co-author and citation networks
                        (<ptr target="#shiffrin2004"/>), and text mining methods such as named
                    entity recognition (<ptr target="#nadeau2007"/>) may provide hints about
                    influences on a given author, but unless these are linked to more powerful tools
                    for textual analysis and critical work, the role of these methods is limited to
                    very early stages of investigation for scholars pursuing disciplinary research
                    within the humanities. Likewise, while search engines may be useful for
                    discovering and retrieving individual documents and even key passages, they do
                    not help with the interpretative task of distinguishing between passages where
                    an author is accepting a particular concept, making a particular argument, or
                    following a particular convention, and passages where those concepts, arguments,
                    and conventions are being attacked or rejected.</p>
                <p>To serve scholars and their students well, it is necessary to develop techniques
                    for deeper analysis of the texts they care about. Sophisticated quantitative
                    analysis of the full contents of texts will be needed. But computational methods
                    alone will not suffice. Progress towards more effective use of massive text
                    repositories will require a combination of computational techniques, digital
                    curation by experts, and a better understanding of the way texts are critically
                    understood and used in scholarly practices. No single method alone holds the
                    key. Researchers and students need to be able to engage with the texts and
                    discuss them with peers. Students and interested amateurs can in turn benefit
                    from the discussions among experts if those can be adequately summarised and
                    represented. People participating in debates may benefit from being able quickly
                    to locate sources, both ancient and modern, that support or controvert their
                    positions. There are many open research questions here about the design of
                    effective systems that can serve scholars, and facilitate the representation of
                    their knowledge in ways that others, experts and non-experts alike, can make use
                    of in their critical engagement with the texts.</p>

                <head>FROM MASSIVE DOCUMENT REPOSITORIES TO ARGUMENT IDENTIFICATION</head>
                <p>It is somewhat self-evident that massive document repositories offer access to an
                    unparalleled number of texts across historical and disciplinary dimensions,
                    opening up new possibilities for learning and scholarly activity. But, in
                    practice, with so much choice about what to read, how do we decide which texts
                    and parts of texts to focus on? And similarly, how can we focus on the key
                    arguments within these texts to support the close reading and understanding of
                    them? This is not just valuable in itself, it also counters the practice of
                    reading texts in a fast, superficial and uncritical way, which is the temptation
                    when we have access to such a massive quantity of text and information.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Why topic modelling to locate arguments?</head>
                <p>Previous attempts at automated argument identification (e.g., <ptr
                        target="#moens2007"/>) have focused on key words and phrases which may
                    indicate the introduction of premises (<q>for this reason</q>, <q>in virtue
                        of</q>, …) or conclusions (<q>hence</q>, <q>therefore</q>, …). However,
                    given a) the enormous variety of such markers, b) the historically shifting
                    patterns of usage, and c) how many arguments are presented without such markers,
                    such approaches can have significant limitations. Even when enhanced to use
                    grammatical structure <ptr target="#palau2009"/> they face the additional
                    weakness that that they do not capture the semantic content of arguments.</p>

                <p>The set of documents accessible via the HathiTrust provide a robust test of our
                    approach, as particular difficulties of understanding arguments from this
                    historical era are: a) not all the content is congruent with the style of
                    scientific thought and writing that we have come to expect in the modern era
                    (e.g., the heavier reliance on anecdotal evidence in earlier times); b) the
                    language used even in scientific publications is indirect, and verbose compared
                    with its modern-day equivalent (e.g., there may be long digressions), and c)
                    what passes for acceptable argument may well have been different in that era
                    (e.g., the variety of rhetorical strategies). This problematisation contrasts
                    significantly with other formal approaches to argument modeling, that have
                    focused on articles with a modern, formulaic structure, e.g., in legal contexts
                    (Moens et al. 2007) or in the context of ‘modern’ scientific articles (<ptr
                        target="#teufel2009"/>; <ptr target="#merity2009"/>) where
                        <q>Introduction</q>, <q>Results</q>, <q>Conclusions</q> etc., are explicitly
                    identified. The type of texts we were interested in were historically and
                    scientifically important, but written in a common and more natural style, so we
                    were deliberately giving ourselves a hard problem, but one with high
                    authenticity and relevance. The task of understanding, identifying and mapping
                    arguments in these more <q>free running</q> social science or philosophical (and
                    historical) texts could be considered an <q>order of magnitude</q> more
                    challenging than previous work into argument mapping (e.g., <ptr
                        target="#lawrence2012"/>; <ptr target="#kirschner2012"/>).</p>

                <p>Most scholars are interested in arguments not simply for arguments’ sake, but
                    because of the underlying topics and issues that are addressed in those
                    arguments. Computational methods offer a variety of ways for capturing semantic
                    relations in text. Some, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (<ptr
                        target="#landauer1997"/>) are good at capturing word-document relations,
                    others are good at capturing word-word relationships (e.g., Word2Vec<note><ref
                            target="#https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec"
                            >https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec</ref></note>). For argument
                    analysis, however, the right <q>chunks</q> for analysis are somewhere between
                    words and whole documents. We chose to explore LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
                    topic modelling (<ptr target="#blei2003"/>) as a means to find
                    appropriately-sized, content-rich sections of text within books, which could
                    then be subjected to further scrutiny for argument analysis and mapping. So, our
                    assumption was that the parts of texts that were rich in a particular topic
                    would also be rich in the arguments that included that topic, and that
                    assumption would be tested through our design and its application in the target
                    domain.</p>

                <p>LDA topic modelling (LDA-TM) is by now a familiar technique in the digital
                    humanities. It uses machine learning to represent documents as mixtures of
                    “topics” and these are represented as probability distributions of the words in
                    the corpus on which the model is trained. The training process automatically
                    assigns probabilities to the topic-document and word-topic distributions in such
                    a way that a relatively small set of topics (set by the modeler via a
                    hyperparameter <q>K</q>) can account for the word distributions found in a
                    relatively much larger set of documents comprising the corpus. As such, then,
                    topic models accomplish a form of data compression, enabling common themes to be
                    identified within a large corpus. Appropriate selection of the hyperparameter K
                    for the number of topics depends on various factors including the size of the
                    corpus and the pragmatic goals of the scholars using the model. As described in
                    more detail below, we explored several different values of K, and settled on a
                    number of topics that served our goal of identifying passages of interest for
                    our argumentative analysis and interpretation. Also described in more detail
                    below is the process we followed to select among and within the books. We made a
                    number of design choices which reflected our pragmatic aim of designing a
                    prototype toolkit that could demonstrate proof of concept, rather than pursuing
                    a systematic investigation of the space of all possible measures and
                    methods.</p>

                <p>Going beyond the previous overview of our work by Murdock et al. (<ptr
                        target="#murdocketal2017"/>), here we focus in more detail on the
                    pedagogical practice, through the link between the original <q>drill-down</q>
                    topic modelling work and the nature, form and structure of the many arguments
                    contained in these texts from the digital library. The detailed interpretation
                    of the texts leading to semi-formal representation of the found arguments allow
                    us, in this paper, to assess the importance and relevance of the <q>discovered
                        arguments</q>, and to problematise the design space.</p>

                <head>TOPIC MODELING AND SELECTION OF TEXTS</head>
                <p>Automated selection from large volume sets is necessary because one cannot hope
                    to inspect by eye the whole collection. For example, although a standard keyword
                    search in the HathiTrust collection, using <q>Darwin</q>, <q>comparative
                        psychology</q>, <q>anthropomorphism</q>, and <q>parsimony</q>, reduced over
                    300,000 public domain works to a list of 1,315 volumes, this many books is on
                    the order of Charles Darwin’s entire personal library, accumulated and read over
                    several decades. To help us to decide <q>what to read?</q> we chose to adapt
                    topic modeling to our purposes. This technique is useful for information
                    retrieval because it allows a higher level of semantic abstraction than keyword
                    searching.</p>

                <p>LDA topic modelling (LDA-TM) was first introduced by Blei et al. (2003), and it
                    has been subsequently deployed in a variety of applications (<ptr
                        target="#wei2006"/>; <ptr target="#heinrich2009"/>; <ptr
                        target="#medlar2017"/>) including applications in the humanities (e.g., <ptr
                        target="#tangherlini2013"/>). A key innovation of our approach is that we
                    adopted a multilevel approach to a scholarly workflow (<ptr
                        target="#murdocketal2017"/>). We first applied LDA-TM to these 1,315 volumes
                    treating each book as a document<note>The results of this step of the topic
                        modeling can be explored at <ref
                            target="https://www.hypershelf.org/htrc1315/"
                            >https://www.hypershelf.org/htrc1315/</ref>. All models were built using
                        the InPhO project’s Topic Explorer open source package (<ptr
                            target="#murdock2015"/>) available for download at <ref
                            target="https://github.com/inpho/topic-explorer/README.md"
                            >https://github.com/inpho/topic-explorer/README.md</ref>.</note>. The
                    resulting topic model was scanned by a person who selected thresholds on the
                        topics<note>3 We took a <soCalled>naïve</soCalled> approach to this, simply
                        using the proportions of the documents assigned by the model to the topics
                        of interest, and then choosing a threshold on the proportions that seemed to
                        the person making the choice to be sufficient to capture the books relevant
                        to comparative psychology (along with many irrelevant ones; i.e., we
                        preferred recall over precision at this stage). See <ptr
                            target="#murdocketal2017"/> for details.</note> to extract 86 volumes
                    from the original 1,315, as those most closely related to our focus on
                    anthropomorphism and animal minds. Amongst other advantages, the topic models
                    allowed us to disambiguate discussions of anthropomorphism in the animal context
                    from uses of the term in the context of comparative religion, allowing us to
                    drill down efficiently to the most relevant materials. We then re-applied LDA-TM
                    to these 86 volumes treating every page as a document. A further step of
                    topic-model assisted selection rated books according to the number of pages
                    containing a high density<note>At this stage we preferred precision over recall.
                        We again used a naïve approach, taking the mathematically expedient approach
                        of summing the proportions across all pages and choosing an arbitrary
                        threshold on the sums. Future work should explore more sophisticated
                        information theoretic measures of relevance.</note> of the topics we were
                    interested in. This yielded six books of central interest for our argument
                    analysis. It was notable that none of these texts appeared in the first ten
                    results of HathiTrust’s standard keyword searching.</p>

                <head>Selection of rated pages and argument maps</head>
                <p>We decided to adopt the visual argument mapping approach for a number of related
                    reasons. Previous research has strongly supported the value of argument mapping
                    for: greater <q>sense-making</q> of argumentative texts <ptr
                        target="#kirschner2012"/>; providing standardized and comparable semi-formal
                    and visual representations to support the investigation and analysis of
                    arguments generally <ptr target="#reed2007etal"/>; and, providing visual
                    representations that could be rendered into a generic computational format, the
                    Argument Interchange Format (AIF), see Chesnevar et al. (2006), that can be
                    re-used and shared between applications. In our case, this meant that the
                    argument mapping approach that we adopted (see below) supported the close
                    critical reading of the text selections through an argument <q>lens</q> and
                    provided a standard representational scheme that could be applied across the
                    different texts, showing the <q>found</q> arguments in each. Once mapped, these
                    representations can be potentially re-used and shared in further argument
                    inquiry or tool development. Further details of the mapping tool and process,
                    and how it was used to interpret the texts and arguments that are specific to
                    our study are provided below.</p>
                <p>The rating of pages according to their loading on topics of interest was taken as
                    an indicator of material worthy or argument analysis and mapping, but these
                    ratings were not used to limit arguments that started before or ended after the
                    rated pages. Thus, each argument selected by the person doing the mapping
                    spanned rated pages, but may also have spanned unrated bordering pages
                    occasionally. Also, not all rated pages that dealt with the chosen topic
                    contained argument. Table 1 (below) shows the Pages that were selected from each
                    Volume, following our topic modelling approach, and also the number of Maps for
                    each Volume. This shows that the first three of the listed volumes, according to
                    our topic modelling returns were potentially <q>argument rich</q>, with their
                    arguments therein creating 15, 10 and 8 maps respectively. For The Animal Mind,
                    which contained many more rated pages than listed in the table, we chose to
                    limit our analysis to 40 pages constituting the largest blocks of contiguous
                    pages containing pages with greater than 90% loading on the topics of
                    interest.</p>
                <p>The latter three in the list were potentially less rich in argument, creating 2,
                    5 and 3 maps respectively. This difference indicates the variability in writing
                    style during this historical period, with some texts showing clearer lines of
                    argument than others. <title rend="italic">General Biology</title> is a textbook
                    that follows a more didactic, less argumentative style, and differs from
                    Washburn’s psychology textbook, in that the there is a less controversial set of
                    accepted <q>facts</q> to present. The fifth text is based on predominantly
                    personal observation, so, it is a piece of anecdotal comparative psychology, and
                    not concerned with the methodological questions that lead to the argumentative
                    structure of Washburn’s book. The final text has fewer arguments because it is a
                        <q>pop-science</q> book and is more engaged in telling a triumphal narrative
                    of scientific progress, rather than dealing with controversies in the field. It
                    does have a section on animals that emphasises the discoveries that seem to show
                    how intelligent they are, so it does not aim for the sort of complex analysis
                    that is provided by Washburn. So, considering these findings lends support to
                    our assumption that the <q>topic rich</q> texts according to our topic modeling
                    method also approximate the degree to which the content is <q>argument
                    rich</q>.</p>

                <head>Argument Interpretation: Identification, Analysis, and Mapping</head>
                <p>To identify the form and structure of the arguments contained in the selected
                    texts we adapted a generic approach for manual argument analysis described by
                    Lawrence et al. (2014). Through considering this work we developed a bespoke
                    rubric that standardised and described the interpretative process that linked
                    the analysis of our <q>historical</q> texts to the argument format of the
                    mapping tool. This was informed by the members of the team with expertise in the
                    humanities, who were familiar with the styles of writing about this topic for
                    this historical period, and the researcher who was performing the mapping
                    process. This was important in our case because, as mentioned earlier, the
                        <q>natural</q> arguments contained in these texts, demanded more
                    sophisticated interpretation compared with other applications where the
                    arguments were more clearly defined. The full detail of this interpretative
                    rubric can be accessed online<note><ref

                <p>Through interpreting and mapping the identified arguments in these texts the
                    researcher produced the 47 OVA+ maps covering the selections from the six

                        dragging the diagram. </note>, with the maps sequentially numbered and
                    linked to each volume. An example is included in <ref target="#figure01">Figure
                        1</ref>. It shows an argument from the first text, Argument 3 (Arg 3) from
                    The Animal Mind. The links drawn on the maps between propositions are of two
                    types – supporting and counter-supporting (links labeled RA and CA
                    respectively). Although OVA+ supports more link types these were not used in
                    this study. Instead we paid particular attention to interpreting the meaning and
                    representing the sub-components of the argumentative text. Conclusions must be
                    supported by at least one premise. Often the maps have sub-conclusions leading
                    to main conclusions. Propositions that expand or explain other propositions are
                    seen as lending support to them. A link connecting two propositions always links
                    from one to another, with an arrow showing direction, where a supporting premise
                    links to (points to) a conclusion or sub-conclusion.</p>

                <p>The argument map (Arg 3) above contains text taken from <title rend="italic">The
                        Animal Mind</title> by Washburn (1908). The argument consists of 3
                    propositions (in the large boxes on the left) that support two related
                    conclusions (in the large boxes on the right). The <q>RA</q> boxes contained in
                    the directional arrows demonstrates that the propositions on the left (P1, P2,
                    P3) support the conclusions on the right (P5, P6), where the latter are also
                    interconnected, as indicated through pointing to a shared relation (an
                    <q>RA</q>). In this example P2 and P3 combine to support the conclusion P4. The
                    close reading of the content of this argument would emphasise Washburn’s
                    sensitivity to the contrast between Descartes’ view and that of his predecessor
                    Montaigne, and her emphasis on Descartes’ use of the exquisite functioning of
                    the behaviour of diverse species of animal as evidence for a sophisticated view
                    of the relationship between consciousness and thought (one that is often
                    obscured in current presentations of Descartes’ views on animal minds) along
                    with her sensitivity to the shifting meanings of these terms over the centuries.
                    How this particular argument fits into the more extensive close reading of the
                    arguments is covered in the next Section (5).</p>
                <p>This approach was particularly appropriate for the volumes that we analysed,
                    where, in some cases, the same topic is pursued for a complete chapter and so
                    there are opportunities to map the extended argument. Given the way the
                    arguments were differentially expressed, with some text being more easily mapped
                    compared to others, the mapping process was quite sophisticated, yet followed
                    the standardised rubric to maintain consistency of interpretation.</p>

                <p>This <q>deep</q> identification, representation and interpretation process linked
                    to the subsequent argument maps, including careful reading of the identified

                    interpretative platform than if these methods had not been applied. The
                    identification, representation and mapping process was performed by a researcher
                    who was familiar with the basics of argument mapping, but who was neither a
                    domain expert in <title rend="italic">Comparative Psychology</title> nor
                    experienced with extracting arguments from this kind of textual
                        material<note>The depth of analysis we were seeking in this study would not
                        have been feasible with a multi-user study, hence we focused on the pathway
                        of one individual towards the process of extracting arguments as scaffolded
                        by the available technologies.</note>. Below we describe his
                    interpretations. In the descriptions below, for accuracy and evidence, we refer
                    to the argument maps that the descriptions refer to that are accessible online
                    (see footnote 4), as there isn’t the space to display them in this article. The
                    importance and level of scholarly merit and detail of these argument
                    interpretations is the test of our approach. In particular, we were interested
                    in whether a researcher who knew nothing about the domain could be supported
                    through sophisticated and deep reading of the arguments when guided by the topic
                    models and the argument mapping process. A sample and summary of the subsequent
                    close readings and argument descriptions of the first two volumes, which
                    generated the most maps (15 and 10 respectively), are given below for the
                    purposes of this paper. And these descriptions are then followed by a summary of
                    the interpretations across the texts to demonstrate how the arguments in the
                    individual texts could be considered collectively to improve the understanding
                    of the topic (of Animal Psychology) in general. The full close readings of the
                    47 Maps linked to the six volumes is given in McAlister et al. (2014). The

                <head>Volume 1 analysis – The Animal Mind, 1908</head>
                <p>[In this first edition of her textbook, destined for four editions] Washburn sets
                    the context for the debate on animal consciousness. She meets the charge that
                    animal psychology is necessarily anthropomorphic straight away, and admits there
                    is a problem (Arg1). She introduces Montaigne’s arguments for animal
                    intelligence based upon the similarity of human and animal behaviours (Arg2) and
                    follows with Descartes’s opposing argument, that animals are clock-like
                    machines, with no capacity for thought (Arg3). Washburn next presents Darwin as
                    arguing on the basis of analogical claims, such as that animals reason because
                    they are <q>seen to pause, deliberate and resolve.</q> She asserts that Darwin's
                    aim of defending his theory of evolution in face of ongoing controversy about
                    the mental and moral gulf between man and animals, means that his claims cannot
                    be taken at face value (Arg4). In contrast many physiologists argue that psychic
                    interpretations are less preferable than biological explanations of animal
                    behaviour in terms such as tropism [unconscious reaction to stimulation] (Arg5). </p>

                <p>Washburn next summarises three main anti-mentalist camps or positions in the
                    field (Arg6). She criticises the physiologists, the first camp, for ignoring or
                    simplifying phenomena to fit a predetermined theory, and she argues that their
                    approach yields a reductio ad absurdum when applied to human behaviour (Arg7).
                    Washburn outlines the arguments of ant expert Erich Wasmann [see next section],
                    representing the second camp. Wasmann’s definition of intelligence explicitly
                    excludes animals on the grounds that they act only on instinct. He readily
                    generalises from ants to all animals, stating that ants are superior to other
                    animals (Arg8). The third camp is represented by Bethe [who belongs to an
                    ultra-Cartesian group], holding that animals lack even sensation. Washburn
                    identifies an inconsistency between his acknowledging that modifiability of
                    behaviour is an indicator of consciousness, while considering this improper if
                    applied to animals. He condemns all psychology as subjective and unknowable, and
                    asserts that only chemical and physiological processes should be the object of
                    scientific investigation (Arg9 and Arg10).</p>

                <p>Washburn argues for a cautious approach to animal psychology, acknowledging
                    pitfalls and problems but seeking scientific methods to overcome them (Arg11).
                    She introduces Lloyd Morgan’s [famous] Canon whereby the simplest level of
                    psychic faculty for an animal should be assumed that can fully explain the facts
                    of a case. She argues that the choice may not always be the right one, but at
                    least it reduces anthropomorphism by compensating for a known bias (Arg12).
                    Washburn next argues against Loeb’s suggestion that <q>learning by
                        experience</q> is a conclusive criterion for mind, but cautions that absence
                    of proof does not amount to disproof. She maintains that rapid learning
                    practically assures mind, but holds that great uncertainty remains about
                    consciousness in lower animals (Arg13 and Arg14). Morphology and similarity of
                    animals’ physiology to humans’ must be taken into account in deciding if an
                    animal is conscious or not, and degrees of similarity indicate a gradation of
                    consciousness, from lower to higher animals, with no possibility of drawing a
                    sharp line between animals with and without consciousness (Arg15).</p>

                <head>Volume 2 analysis - Psychology of Ants, 1905</head>
                <p>[Eric Wasmann was a Jesuit priest and naturalist, publicly renowned for his books
                    about the variety of amazing ant behaviours.] Wasmann’s concept that
                        <q>intelligence is a spiritual power</q> leads him to the claim that if
                    animals had this spiritual power “they would necessarily be capable of
                    language”. Animals don’t speak, so animals don’t have intelligence (Arg1). He
                    supports his views of ants by reference to observations made by Aristotle,
                    Stagirite, St Augustine, [and Wasmann’s contemporary naturalist] Dubois-Reymond
                    (Arg3). Wasmann denigrates suggestions by ‘modern sociologists’ that ant
                    “states” and human republics can be equated, explaining that class differences
                    arise from <q>conditions of life</q> or <q>intelligent</q> free choice in Man,
                    but ant castes arise from organic laws of polymorphism [multiple body forms]
                    (Arg4). Wasmann asserts animal intelligence is really sensile cognition and
                    sensuous experience, but if higher animals are credited with intelligence, it
                    would be inconsistent to deny ants the same (Arg5). He argues that ants achieve
                    a more perfect level of social cooperation than even the higher vertebrates,
                    such as apes (Arg7).</p>

                <p>Wasmann criticises Darwin for his anthropomorphic stance towards the <q>silence
                        and obedience</q> of a group of baboons, which Wasmann reinterprets as
                        <q>fidelity and obedience</q>, and takes to imply <q>reasonable, voluntary
                        subjection to the demands of duty and authority</q>. He argues that the more
                    likely explanation is <q>the instinctive association of certain sensile
                        perceptions with certain sensile impulses</q> (Arg6). This association
                    removes the need to allow animals thought; instead, instinct is a sufficient
                    explanation (Arg10). The author explains that instinct has two elements,
                        <q>automatism</q> of behaviour (generally found in lower orders of animals)
                    and <q>plasticity</q> of behaviour (generally found in higher orders). Because
                    the architecture of ants’ nests varies from species to species even when the
                    physical attributes of the ants are highly similar, he argues that a simple
                    explanation of the variety of architecture linked to physical attributes will
                    not do; rather the decisive factor is the psychic disposition of the ant species
                    (Arg8). Wasmann maintains that while ants <q>verge on heroic unselfishness</q>
                    towards their young, only <q>Man</q> is conscious of duty and the morals of
                    parental love. Although he admits that some aspects of motherly love in humans
                    are instinctual, motherly love cannot be attributed to animals because it is
                        <q>spiritual</q>, based on awareness of duty that is unique to humans
                    (Arg9). </p>

                <head>Summary of interpretation of arguments across six volumes</head>
                <p>The section above demonstrates a sophisticated close reading of a sample of the
                    arguments in the two selected texts, through incorporating the mapping approach
                    into the interpretation process. For example, the comparison and contrast
                    afforded by Washburn’s survey of the arguments in the literature and her attempt
                    to articulate a good scientific methodology for comparative psychology. This
                    contrasts with Wasmann’s more polemical and theological approach to the
                    perfection of behaviour through instinct, which reveals that despite Darwin’s
                    work, published nearly 50 years earlier, much of the controversy revolves around
                    whether humans have a special, perhaps God-given position, separate from the
                    animal world.</p>

                <p>A number of historically important themes emerged from the interpretation of the
                    arguments in the six volumes that are given in full in McAlister et al. (2014).
                    These demonstrated the ability of our selection and argument mapping methods to
                    allow a reader, who was previously unfamiliar with the scholarship in this area,
                    to zero in on the relevant passages and then acquire an understanding of the key
                    themes, which is a measure of the success of those methods. Although it was not
                    a primary goal of our project to produce new insights into the domain-specific
                    content, these would somewhat hopefully and inevitably emerge from the close
                    critical reading of the key arguments. So it is worth making some concise
                    content-specific remarks here about two of the themes that emerged from the six
                    volumes, to demonstrate the potential value of the proposed approach.</p>

                <p>(i) Animal Flexibility. All the authors, evolutionists and non-evolutionists
                    alike, were willing to recognise hitherto unacknowledged flexibility and
                    variability in behaviour of individual animals. They all identify the same
                    extremes – excessive anthropomorphism on the one hand, and the conception of
                    animals as automatic reflex machines on the other – but each claims the middle
                    ground for their quite different positions! Even Wasmann, the lone
                    anti-evolutionist in our sample, denies that individual ants are reflex
                    machines, claiming that the flexibility of individual ants is of a <q>psychic
                        variety</q> not <q>mechanical automatism</q>, although he attributes this
                    flexibility to <q>instinct</q> not reason.</p>

                <p>(ii) Developmental Approaches. Three of the authors, Mills (1888), Reid (1906),
                    and Needham (1910), explicitly advocate a developmental approach to the study of
                    animal mind, operating within the framework of a strong nature-environment
                    distinction (corresponding to today’s <q>nature-nurture</q> distinction). They
                    make the case for comparative developmental studies, particularly experimentally
                    rearing animals in isolation.</p>

                <p>Although the accounts (above) of the interpretation of the arguments are
                    relatively concise, they demonstrate a successful <q>close reading</q> of the
                    arguments located within the selected texts. And while the themes discovered
                    should be compared with scholarly treatments of the same (e.g., <ptr
                        target="#richards1987"/>), nevertheless we believe that despite the
                    variations in language (vocabulary and style), the crisscrossing overlap among
                    the arguments discovered in these books indicates that our methods identified
                    pages that were thematically relevant to tracking the scientific and
                    philosophical debates about anthropomorphic attributions to animals in the late
                    19th and early 20th centuries. This provides confidence in our claim that the
                    big-data analytic technique of topic modeling, linked to argument mapping, can
                    support close reading of texts in a content-relevant, argument-guided way.</p>

                <head>Discussion</head>
                <p>The approach described in this article offers an initial prototype of a design
                    for scholarly interaction with technology that begins with topic model-assisted
                    search of massive document repositories and leads to close critical reading of
                    the arguments in the texts therein. It has also produced important insights
                    about the way these arguments are <q>rendered</q> and interpreted by a person
                    new to such historical texts and work in the humanities. The automated content
                    selection and categorization work described in this article demonstrated the
                    feasibility and reliability of large-scale, fine-grained topic-based
                    categorization across a range of topics in science and philosophy using
                    documents defined at a variety of scales (whole books, book pages, and
                    individual sentences in books). Categorization and selection are essential
                    first-steps in the scholarly process of identifying further structures, such as
                    arguments, in large data sets. Although it might have been possible to construct
                    more sophisticated keyword searches using Boolean operators to identify the same
                    pages of interest for our analysis, this would have required painstaking trial
                    and error, whereas the topic modeling provided a relatively straightforward
                    semi-automatic approach to narrowing down. A number of insights emerged from
                    performing the human interpretation of texts that were delivered by our topic
                    modeling techniques and then mapped in argumentative terms through the
                    argument-mapping tool OVA+.</p>

                <p>Topic modeling was successful in helping someone identify the texts (chapters and
                    pages) that contained the <q>stuff</q> of arguments linked to the keywords and
                    topics that were searched for, strongly supporting our assumption that we could
                    approximate <q>topic rich</q> texts as also being <q>argument rich</q>. These
                    could be sorted through rankings that allowed just the <q>topic rich</q> texts
                    to be the focus of further analysis. This is very valuable in itself, as it
                    allowed us to identify and extract 6 argument rich texts from a big data text
                    repository (HathiTrust). Secondly the (human) argument identification and
                    analysis produced 47 argument maps (in OVA+), that provided interpretations from
                    six volumes, that also showed how the type and degree of argument in historical
                    texts can be quite different, with the different texts producing different
                    amounts of argument maps (ranging from fifteen to two). So, the quantitative and
                    qualitative methodologies that we developed also enabled us to represent and
                    distinguish different levels of argument within texts in a broad-brush way. The
                    outcome is a set of powerful descriptive and comparative interpretations of
                    arguments within and across texts, and linked to particular authors (see <ptr
                        target="#mcalister2014"/> for a full account).</p>

                <p>Furthermore, we were able to leverage the human-constructed argument maps against
                    a micro-level topic model trained on a single book with each sentence treated as
                    a <q>document</q>. Such an approach to Washburn’s <title rend="italic">The
                        Animal Mind</title> led us from sentences represented in the maps to
                    sentences in other parts of the book that were judged similar within the model
                    and despite being wholly disjoint in vocabulary, including the <q>angry</q>
                    wasp. Close reading was essential to determine why certain sentences were
                    selected by this method. For example, the relevance to anthropomorphism of the
                    sentence, <q>This, of course, does not refer to the power to judge distance,</q>
                    was not immediately evident. The context of this sentence in Washburn’s footnote
                    on p.238 is as follows: <quote rend="block">Porter observed that the distance at
                        which spiders of the genera <emph>Argiope</emph> and <emph>Epeira</emph>
                        could apparently see objects was increased six or eight times if the spider
                        was previously disturbed by shaking her web. This, of course, does not refer
                        to the power to <emph>judge</emph> distance [Italics in original.]</quote>
                    Here, then, we see Washburn cautioning the reader not to jump to a high-level
                    interpretation of the spider behaviour. The spiders may perceive objects at
                    various distances but they don’t judge it, where judgement is understood to be a
                    high-level cognitive capacity. This belongs to a more elaborate argument against
                    anthropomorphically over-interpreting the behavior of species remote from
                    humans.</p>

                <p>To summarise, here are <emph>five key points</emph> from this study: <list>
                        <item>We have demonstrated that topic modelling finds topic-rich text that
                            is also potentially argument rich and worthy of careful argumentative
                            analysis.</item>
                        <item>Mapping these topic-rich regions of historical texts using a
                            computerised mapping tool (OVA+) and a suitable rubric supports, and
                            necessitates, close critical reading of the arguments and the
                            texts.</item>
                        <item>he argument mapping was often a complex process, needing
                            interpretation and sometimes <q>gap filling</q> by the mapper, but this
                            was cognitively valuable in supporting argument identification,
                            representation and understanding linked to close critical reading. Some
                            types of argument, e.g., historical arguments, are not simply latent and
                            waiting for identification and representation. Rather, the arguments
                                <q>come alive</q> through interpretation and the processes of
                            mapping and then writing about them.</item>
                        <item>The exercise of mapping the arguments required critical reading by the
                            non-expert. It manifestly contributed to his deeper understanding of the
                            arguments and their scientific and philosophical contexts than simply
                            reading the books alone without the scaffolding we provided. This is
                            evidenced by his accounts covering all the found arguments and the
                            summary and comparison of all of these (<ref>see also <ptr
                                    target="#mcalister2014"/></ref>).</item>
                        <item>Further development of this approach should accept points 1-4 above,
                            and emphasise support for the process of understanding, representing and
                            refining argument representations and related conceptualizations. This
                            means those who design such tools should focus more on the cognitive
                            processes of actively reconstructing arguments from complex texts,
                            rather than assuming that arguments might simply be identified and
                                <q>extracted</q> from a frame provided by grammatical and
                            terminological markers of arguments.</item>

            <div>
                <head>Critique and further work</head>
                <p>Our emphasis on investigating and testing the feasibility of our computational
                    tools to support existing scholarly practices of identifying and understanding
                    arguments in digitised texts has meant that thus far we have deliberately
                    prioritised validating technical possibilities over systematic empirical testing
                    with different texts and/or different scholars. This suggests the need for
                    further research that would incorporate technical and empirical strands into the
                    development of the human-computer interaction.</p>
                <p>The technical implications are that the next tool-set, should more closely
                    connect the topic modelling to the argument mapping. Robust tools for topic
                    modeling already exist in the form of MALLET <ptr target="#mccallum2002"/> and
                    the InPhO Topic Explorer <ptr target="#murdock2015"/>. Both are well integrated
                    with the HathiTrust Research Center Workset Toolkit so that now even copyrighted
                    materials may be modeled<note><ref
                            target="https://htrc.github.io/HTRC-WorksetToolkit/cli.html"
                            >https://htrc.github.io/HTRC-WorksetToolkit/cli.html</ref></note>.
                    However, these tools need to be better integrated with tools for visually
                    structuring argument maps such as OVA+ so that the scholarly work potentially
                    enhanced by these tools becomes more seamless. The system should scaffold the
                    interpretation process from identified texts to argument mapping, as this
                    reasoning and re-representation process is cognitively valuable in achieving
                    better understanding of arguments. Similarly, once the text is identified and
                    the related maps are produced, other scaffolding or visualization techniques
                    could assist coordinating between these two related representations of argument,
                    and among the different representations produced by learners having diverse
                    interests and goals. In this respect, further work could draw upon the large
                    body of work into the use of external representations for learning <ptr
                        target="#ainsowrth2006"/>.</p>
                <p>Once a more integrated and user-friendly version of the toolkit is developed, it
                    would support more systematic empirical investigation of the interaction between
                    user and machine. Our hypotheses are that compared to unassisted argument
                    identification and understanding, this approach would: find the argumentative
                    parts of relevant texts much faster and with greater accuracy; scaffold deeper
                    understanding; and, provide flexible and permanent representations that could be
                    reflected upon, extended and re-used. Further and more generally, future work
                    will accept the need to move towards an environment for constructing and
                    developing representations of argument rather than simply mapping them.</p>

                <p>The above appears a sensible conceptualization for future work, because through
                    implementing our methods it became apparent that arguments were rarely neatly
                    and clearly structured and defined explicitly in the texts. The historical
                    distance to these texts, and the shift in academic writing styles over the past
                    century served to make the task of <q>extracting</q> the arguments even more
                    challenging. Indeed, rather than being set structures transmitted through the
                    texts, instead these arguments came alive through the practice of interpreting,
                    understanding and (re)constructing them. This raises the questions, <q>Do
                        arguments actually exist in clearly defined forms within (certain) texts?
                        Or, do arguments only take form when readers focus on understanding
                        them?</q> When today’s reader encounters the seemingly verbose yet strangely
                    enthymematic nature of yesterday’s arguments, what can we learn about the
                    interaction between readers and texts, and about the minds of the authors and
                    their original readers?</p>

                <p>While these questions are too big to be answered by our original study, their
                    potential validity as important questions are, we argue, supported. The notion
                    that textual arguments are constructed through human interpretation is also
                    supported by the observation that argument structure is notoriously difficult
                    for people, even after training, to determine (<ref>see <ptr
                            target="#oppenheimer2011"/>, <ptr target="#oppenheimer2017"/> and <ptr
                            target="#garbacz2012"/> for an interesting example of disagreement among
                        experts about how to formalise Anselm’s famous <q>ontological argument</q>
                        in way that is adequate for computational validation</ref>). Of course, this
                    should come as no surprise when even textbooks of argument analysis disagree
                    with one another on the simplest of real-world examples. Yet the goal of using
                    texts to construct arguments that satisfy disciplinary canons of interpretation
                    of those texts defines an important scholarly activity. The abstraction provided
                    by such efforts provides a regulative ideal that aids comprehension of difficult
                    texts, and the representation of these abstractions in artifacts such as
                    argument maps provides concrete targets for collaborative meaning making and
                    deeper discussions about alternative interpretations of complex texts. The skill
                    of generating such maps and interrogating their meanings is a legitimate aspect
                    of mental agility and perspective taking, supporting a more sophisticated view
                    of knowledge. The development of these skills, and the tools that support them,
                    is essential for informed citizenship, particularly in our contemporary social
                    media milieu.</p>

                <p>Design investigations such as the one we have described here must remain mindful
                    of the reconstructive nature of argument extraction<note>Although we have argued
                        that <q>extraction</q> is the wrong metaphor, we recognise that the term
                            <q>argument extraction</q> is likely to continue to be used for the
                        actual constructive, interpretative process involved. Similarly, we continue
                        to talk of the sun coming up even though we know it is really just coming
                        into view with the Earth’s rotation.</note>. Despite the claims of some A.I.
                    proponents, computer scientists seem a long way from being able to design
                    algorithms that match the interpretive skills and subtlety of human readers.
                    Nevertheless, we believe we have supplied one proof of the concept that machine
                    learning applied to big data sets can support this essential aspect of human
                    scholarship by supplying tools for both discovery and representation of specific
                    arguments in a specific content domain. And if we now return to the broad
                    context of critical reading and writing in which our research is placed, we
                    argue that we have made significant technical and conceptual steps in moving
                    towards tools that could enhance and empower this process for learners and
                    scholars alike. This is particularly important in our contemporary digital
                    landscape, where there is arguably an increasing need within the academy and
                    without, to identify and understand reasoned and evidenced argument, to combat,
                    for example, just simply <q>agreeing</q> or <q>disagreeing</q>, or
                    <q>liking</q>, or not, simple emotive propositions and arguments</p>

                <p>In the application of digital tools to the humanities, we must also be mindful
                    that high-sounding rhetoric about civic engagement, the democratization of
                    scholarship, etc., can be undermined by the facts surrounding the choice of
                    sources and limitations of access to the materials analysed. In our case,
                    because of the association between HathiTrust and Google Books, some may worry
                    (incorrectly in our estimation) that, despite its origins and continuation in
                    publicly-funded universities, the HathiTrust nevertheless represents sort of
                    corporatisation of higher education that some find undesirable. Whereas we
                    accept that there will always be challenging issues concerning which
                    repositories to focus on, from a scholarly practice perspective our position is
                    clear. We want to improve and democratize the scholarly practice of finding and
                    interpreting arguments, so that argumentative and critical meaning making is
                    potentially more inclusive, in addition to supporting deeper inquiry for those
                    who are already engaging in such practice.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>The research described in this article tackled a complex problem of how to
                    investigate and design a technological platform that empowers and supports, or
                        <q>scaffolds</q>, humanistic practices guiding a non-expert to perform the
                    kind of search, argument identification, and interpretation of an experienced or
                    expert scholar. We investigated this within our approach through using
                        <q>drill-down</q> topic modelling to move from macro-level views of a big
                    data document repository, through identifying the main areas of interest in
                    specific texts, then subjecting these areas to close critical reading through
                    semi-formal argument identification, analysis and interpretation. We were also
                    able to show how, with the argument analyses in hand, a further drill down to
                    topic models at the sentence level of individual books could help identify
                    content that had not been originally selected. This investigation has also
                    provided insights into the nature, form and structure of arguments in historical
                    texts, and how these features can be difficult to neatly isolate and also be
                    variable, and require the human to <q>fit the pieces together</q>. This work
                    provides an important problematisation of the design space for future tool
                    development that should arguably focus, not on automatically extracting
                    arguments, but instead focus on how to better interrogate, manipulate and
                    understand them: a practice that has increasing importance and relevance within
                    and without the academy.</p>

                <p>Edmond notes that the digital tools currently available to humanists, focused as
                    they are on text, do not fully reflect the much broader information gathering
                    practices of humanists, which, in her phrase, remain <quote rend="inline"
                        >stubbornly multimodal</quote>
                    <ptr target="#edmond2018"/>. She argues that a certain kind of productive
                    distraction, following leads where they may, is essential to scholarly
                    creativity in the humanities. With respect to staying ensconced in the world of
                    (digitised) text we are guilty as charged, unfortunately unimodal. The digital
                    library is our easily-accessed tree, even if we would push digital humanist
                    towards higher-hanging fruit. But we would argue that the approach we have
                    outlined addresses some of the problems she outlines that arise from changes in
                    the way libraries are organised in this era of digitised texts and catalogues.
                    While we agree that <quote rend="inline">remote storage and electronic
                        catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity</quote> for reasons we
                    already mention, we believe we have outlined a digital research environment for
                    argument-based analysis in which serendipity arises. Following the traces
                    provided by topic models led to sampling a few books in more detail, and then to
                    the wasps, spiders, and amoebae that occupied the thoughts of comparative
                    psychologists a century ago: creatures that have all re-emerged in the 21st
                    century in discussions of non-human forms of cognition. The selections were
                    assisted but not forced, allowing the individual scholar to follow whatever
                    leads looked promising in light of whatever background information the scholar
                    has gleaned from other sources. Guided serendipity resulted, and thus the
                        <q>angry</q> wasp was found.</p>

                <p>The research reported in this article derives from a project that was funded by
                    the 2011 International Digging into Data Challenge. The project, entitled
                    “Digging by Debating: Linking Massive Data Sets to Specific Arguments”, was
                    co-funded in the UK by Jisc, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),
                    and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), and in the US by the
                    National Endowment for Humanities (NEH); the project title serves as the UK
                    grant ID and the NEH grant ID is HJ-50092-12. The authors would like to
                    acknowledge the work and intellectual contributions of the other co-PIs to this
                    project, the Digging by Debating team— Katy Börner, David Bourget, and Chris
                    Reed—and the various contributions of the staff and students who worked on the
                    project: John Lawrence, Robert Light, Simon McAlister, Jaimie Murdock, Jun
                    Otsuka, Robert Rose, and Doori Rose (listed alphabetically). David Bourget and
                    Colin Allen jointly developed the text-to-OVA+ argument mapping rubric with
                    feedback from Simon McAlister. We are particularly grateful to Simon for his
                    work on carrying out the argument mapping process itself. We are grateful, too,
                    for the comments by an anonymous referee, who encouraged us to think more
                    broadly about the political and ethical contexts of our work.</p>
