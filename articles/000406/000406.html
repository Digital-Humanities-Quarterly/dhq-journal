                  <p>The popularity of information visualization in academia and practice brings a
                     renewed emphasis on aesthetic values and visual applications to ensure its
                     appeal to a wider audience. This paper focuses on visualization aesthetics and
                     perception by making the case for using graphic design techniques and design
                     languages to understand and create more aesthetically pleasant and functionally
                     effective information design and visualization. It uses cross-disciplinary
                     reviews of background research to demonstrate the value of graphic design
                     principles and methods in the realm of visualization education. A user-centered
                     design framework and student projects are discussed by adapting graphic design
                     elements into the visualization process. It shows that the practice of
                     developing a visualization should be executed with an understanding of graphic
                     design basics in mind, and with a balanced consideration of tangible and
                     conditional design elements, as well as how these design elements fulfill the
                     purpose of the objective, context, content, audience, and the knowledge of the
                     design outcomes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Information Visualization is defined as a set of technologies that use visual
                     computing to amplify human cognition with abstract information. The purpose of
                     visualization is to communicate complex ideas with clarity, precision, and
                     efficiency to encourage objective analysis [<a class="ref" href="#card1999">Card et al. 1999</a>]. Early
                     research and applications of Information Visualization (infoVis) mostly
                     originated from computer science, cartography, and statistics; the teaching
                     focus was mainly for students fluent in computer systems and technology with the
                     goal of creating innovative visualization tools [<a class="ref" href="#bertin1983">Bertin 1983</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cleveland1993">Cleveland 1993</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#tufte1997">Tufte 1997</a>]. In recent years, many humanities scholars, artists,
                     designers, and news media outlets have exploited innovative visualization to
                     deliver data-oriented content. These efforts made visualization more accessible
                     to the public, and created more demand for information design and infoVis
                     classes from the education system. The popularity of infoVis also brings a
                     renewed emphasis on aesthetic values and visual applications to ensure its
                     appeal to a wider audience.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> In a recent collaborative class focusing on data visualization projects between
                     Computational Data Visualization students and Visual Communication Design
                     students of the Ohio State University, 36.7% of students ranked the quality of
                     communication between the two disciplines as less than or equal to 3 on a scale
                     of 1 to 5 (1 being “impossible” and 5 being “nice
                     and easy”) in a post-class survey. As expressed in student
                     comments, some reasons behind the communication gap come from different
                     problem-solving processes and the overall learning goals of each discipline.
                     Some are originated from the different perspective on visual literacy education.
                     However, there are strong connections between modern graphic design and
                     computational visualization in many aspects. The shared goal of visualization
                     and graphic design practices is the desire to pursue objectivity, rationality,
                     and clarity. Visualization as taught in science and engineering disciplines is
                     considered purely analytical and intellectual, but people’s response to visual
                     images are also visceral and emotional. Images made from data, as in
                     Computational Data Visualization courses, are no exception.

                     the collaboration process and make the connections among the various sub-fields
                     clear to students. Therefore, infoVis researchers and practitioners also need to
                     be educated about the impact of choices in design elements and styles – which
                     are usually taught in the field of art and design.

                     <em class="term">visual queries</em> as the acts of attention involved in visual
                     thinking, which are “driving eye movements and tuning our

                      [<a class="ref" href="#ware2008">Ware 2008</a>]. <em class="term">Visual encoding</em> is the mapping of information to visually
                     display elements [<a class="ref" href="#muzner2015">Muzner 2015</a>]. Skilled designers will visually
                     encode the data to support the visual queries, and different encoding strategies
                     will also alter the results of visual queries.

                     scientists and engineers are largely focused on solving functional requirements,
                     for example, how visual encoding technologies relate to multidimensional
                     databases or how they are applied to a particular programming language or
                     software <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bostock2002">#bostock2002</a></span>. But less attention has been paid to the
                     aesthetics or the visual appeals of the information being presented. In recent
                     years, there have been more efforts spent on visualization methods that are both
                     visually appealing as well as technically efficient. For example, popular

                     and the International Typographic Style (1950s), imply geometric layout, orderly
                     typography, effective use of white space, and simple color composition, foster
                     universal forms, and aim to objectify representations of cultural diversity by
                     making them appear economical and perceptually transparent [<a class="ref" href="#kostelnick2004">Kostelnick 2004</a>]. Edward Tufte, who is arguably the most
                     influential theoretician in information design and visualization, also stressed
                     the importance of “minimal and efficient” design [<a class="ref" href="#cairo2013">Cairo 2013</a>].
                     Tufte advocates the functionalism of information graphics: “Data graphics should draw the
                     viewer’s attention to the sense and substance of the data, not to
                     something else”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#tufte2004">Tufte 2004</a>, 91]. His notion of visual aesthetics rigidly follows minimalism and
                     anti-ornamentation for clear and elegant display. As the field of infoVis has
                     experienced a burst of popularity and growth to include various scientific and
                     computation-focused disciplines in recent years, graphic design’s involvement
                     must be reemphasized in regard to visualization content, perception, and
                     aesthetics.

                     functional design principles are compatible with the cognition-based approach of
                     visualization scientists. In scientific fields, infoVis is considered as
                     cognitive tools in problem solving, so the focus is on visual perception, visual
                     attention, and the pattern of information processing. Similarly, the
                     effectiveness and efficiency of content delivery was advocated by modern graphic
                     designers who championed functional and universal visual language. Graphic
                     design’s visual language can be layered onto the pattern of information
                     processing to ensure visual appeal through essential visual elements such as
                     form, layout, typography, and use of color.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Visualization researchers such as Bertin, Cleveland, Ware, and Munzner identified
                     visual parameters as the foundation to generate well-known visualization
                     techniques. Visual parameters refer to the set of visual options that are used
                     to construct design solutions that meet a specific product requirement. This
                     visual encoding process known by the visualization scientists has a deep
                     connection with the foundational design education across art and design schools
                     around the world. The visual principles and attributes that contribute to the
                     parameters are either aligned with or responding to the design ideologies rooted
                     in Gestalt psychology and the Bauhaus school. One of the Bauhaus masters Wassily
                     Kandinsky exploited the design curriculum of studying forms and understanding
                     colors using psychology and perception (Wassily Kandinsky - Wikipedia, 2018).

                     types. Then they encode data with marks and channels. Munzner defines graphical
                     elements as marks, and visual channels are ways to control marks’ appearances
                     [<a class="ref" href="#muzner2015">Muzner 2015</a>]. Design students’ education starts from learning
                     points, lines, planes, and composition tactics. In the book <cite class="title italic">Exploring the Elements of Design</cite>, the authors identified two groups
                     of design elements - tangible and conditional [<a class="ref" href="#evans2013">Evans et al. 2013</a>]s. The
                     tangible elements concern physical forms; and the conditional elements are the
                     ones only exist if the tangible element is established. Visual designers’ work
                     process pays more attention to achieving the best visual quality by actively
                     constructing different visual parameters [<a class="ref" href="#cross2007">Cross 2007</a>]. The
                     comparisons of visual parameters included in Visualization (science) and Graphic
                     Design (design) are shown in Table1. The overlapping elements demonstrate the
                     similarities of visual constructions from the two approaches.

                     functions and purposes between science and design. For example, the line mark in
                     science visualization is commonly seen as an element that can formulate
                     quantitative value through variation in size or position such as a bar chart or
                     line graph. But from the graphic design perspective, line is an element that can
                     be used to separate or divide information as well as to show connections and
                     links. It can indicate boundary or point out directions. Different styles of
                     lines also inherit various characteristics. Thin lines suggest delicacy and
                     convey a tranquil and elegant quality; and thick lines are often associated with
                     emphasis and strength (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). Gesture lines
                     may also be used to represent form and movement (<a href="#figure05">Figure
                        5</a>).

                     Therefore, infoVis designers should not only know the practical meanings of the
                     visual parameters defined in the science field, but also understand how the
                     language of visual design can improve the aesthetic and functional quality. The

                     understand design elements in the context of visualization. Modern design
                     strictly follows a user-centered approach [<a class="ref" href="#norman2002">Norman 2002</a>]. All
                     stages in the visualization process entail design thinking: the choice of data
                     set and attributes, as well as the visual encoding choice to support the visual
                     queries. How the contents are chosen, how the forms are constructed, how the
                     objective of the project is portrayed to the audiences through visual
                     representations, and how the messages can ultimately influence people’s
                     knowledge, attitudes, and behavior – the existence and choice of the design
                     elements always affect and are affected by these concerns. The connection
                     between these variables forms a dialogical approach that results in a framework
                     of the semantic components (right side) to be expressed through a particular set
                     of syntactic components (left side). Modifications of one side influence the
                     outcomes of the other. Different methods of organizing and expression can create
                     different perspectives and influence how the information is perceived. Each
                     individual component has its own purpose, yet they all rely on each other to
                     function as a unit.

                        darkness of a line) indicate different types of artists (a thin line
                        indicates an individual artist and a thick line indicates a group or a
                        band). Changing weights pushes the lines closer and further apart, they
                        create rhythms and dynamism in the composition. The lines and their
                        intervals also create the illusions of spatial depth that helps viewers have
                        a quick grasp of the gender distributions of Grammy winners through history.
                        The line element being considered from a graphic design perspective is able
                        to bring more meanings and visual dynamics to an otherwise unimaginative
                        regular timeline approach.

                        matter how abstract it appears, carries meanings. Even the three primary
                        geometric shapes — circle, square, and triangle — convey different messages
                        to the audiences. The roundness and the continuity of a circle translate
                        completion and harmony. The equal straight lines and perfect right angles
                        make a square seem stable and formal. The sharp angles and points in
                        triangle embody active and aggressive sensations. The choice of shape is
                        critical if it is to communicate the right message to the audience. <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a> shows a portion of a visual pain study

                        of shapes add more dimensions to the scale of pain measurement. The
                        connotation of symbols is also an attempt to establish better communication
                        with the patients.

                        well as reinforce the connection between groups of information. Charts and
                        diagrams in information design are often associated with color-coding.
                        Color-coding is the process of attaching a specific color to a category or
                        grouping of content to make it instantly recognizable. In the interactive
                        visualization project shown in <a href="#figure09">Figure 9</a>,
                        different color usage strategies are applied to two similar maps. The design
                        of choropleth maps is based on the scales of value (brightness and darkness
                        of a particular hue) change so that the audience can easily perceive the
                        pattern density. Hue contrast (blue, yellow, green) are then applied to the
                        second map in order to emphasize the comparisons of the three distinct
                        groups. Graphic designers often rely on color wheels to choose effective and
                        balanced color palette for a visual composition. The value contrast shown in
                        the first map is considered as monochromatic color relationships which
                        include variations of value in one single color. The color choice on the
                        second map shows analogous color relationships which include one color and
                        its neighboring colors on a color wheel (<a href="#figure10">Figure
                           10</a>). Both color combinations share a common blue hue and all are
                        closely related on a color wheel. This “designerly” way
                        of choosing color ensures varieties of colors to fulfil different purposes,
                        yet still represents a satisfying unity that is pleasing to the eye.

                        practiced in this exercise. In infoVis the essential typographic concerns
                        are legibility and readability. Legibility refers to perception. It is the
                        ability to clearly distinguish one letter from another within a font.
                        Readability refers to comprehension. It examines how lines and paragraphs of
                        text can be easily read. The spatial relationships between letters, words,
                        and interlines, the length of the text line, the x-height of a letter form
                        and the font style are all important to readability issues [<a class="ref" href="#kunz2002">Kunz 2002</a>]. The layers of information in the nutrition label
                        are established through different styles and weight of the type, and how
                        space is structured within or between the visual elements.

                        designers to make sure that different visual components within a design
                        composition are well connected and coherent. Originally developed in the
                        field of psychology, Gestalt Principles are a set of laws describing how
                        humans tend to see objects by grouping similar elements, recognizing
                        patterns and simplifying complex images. Some principles are directly
                        related to information organization, such as the law of proximity. It
                        indicates how elements that are close to each other are perceived to be
                        related when compared with elements that are separate from each other. It
                        allows designers to use whitespace, for example, to build perceived
                        relationships between different elements. The label exercise demands
                        students to divide the information into different parts, then practice the
                        Gestalt Principles, and use mainly conditional design elements (see <a href="#table01">Table 1</a>) to organize content and create
                        hierarchy based on the level of importance among the content.

                     design principles and techniques to ensure the aesthetic and communication
                     qualities of the visualization. The visual choices made through graphic design
                     methods are all through logical reasoning. This essay uses cross-disciplinary
                     reviews of background research to demonstrate the value of graphic design
                     principles and methods in the realm of visualization education, without which

                     those courses. It shows that the practice of developing a visualization should
                     be executed with an understanding of graphic design basics in mind, and with a
                     balanced consideration of tangible and conditional design elements, as well as
