                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Annotations are ubiquitous in research in the digital humanities and beyond
                     					and have been declared a “scholarly primitive” by Unsworth. By this, he
                     					refers to basic functions common to scholarly activity across disciplines,
                     					over time, and independent of theoretical orientation [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2000">Unsworth 2000</a>].
                     					Julia Nantke and Frederik Schlupkothen have set out to further deepen our
                     					understanding of annotation and foster interdisciplinary exchange on what
                     					annotation is and can be. To that end, they organized an interdisciplinary
                     					conference held at the University of Wuppertal, Germany, in February 2019.
                     					The conference was called <cite class="title italic">Annotations in Scholarly
                        						Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation,
                        						Systematization</cite> and its results were published in a volume by the
                     					same name [<a class="ref" href="#nantke2020">Nantke and Schlupkothen 2020</a>]. </div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The introduction to the volume by Nantke/Schlupkothen is in itself worth
                     					mentioning: to give a comprehensive overview of the 16 articles without
                     					reducing them to one aspect only, they provide several visualizations of
                     					the volume’s content using the articles’ keywords. A word cloud shows which
                     					keywords are the most popular, a similarity matrix displays which articles
                     					combine to thematic clusters and an edge bundling visualization gives easy
                     					access to information on which articles share which keywords. Especially,
                     					the latter unfolds its full usefulness only in the interactive version that
                     					can be found on the publisher’s website (De Gruyter): <a href="https://cloud.newsletter.degruyter.com/annotations/" onclick="window.open('https://cloud.newsletter.degruyter.com/annotations/'); return false" class="ref">https://cloud.newsletter.degruyter.com/annotations/</a>. This
                     					review, in contrast, must force the articles back into the linearity of the
                     					medium of text. The guiding principle of the following is to question both
                     					what the authors mean by the multifaceted term “annotation” and whether
                     					they approach it from a primarily theoretical or applied perspective. </div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">First, some articles focus on analysis of annotations that have already been
                     					done by someone else and are now the object of study. Freedman extends the
                     					understanding of annotations to footnotes in academic texts and traces that
                     					type of textual expression back to its origins in the 17th century. For
                     					Bamert, annotations are handwritten marginal notes in books for which he
                     					coins the term <em class="term">pen traces</em> (“Stiftspuren”). That term allows one to
                     					include non-verbal forms like underlinings and stresses the materiality of
                     					such annotations. Through the example of pen traces made by Thomas Mann
                     					found in books in his estate, Bamert shows that four types of knowledge
                     					need to be included in the analysis of such annotations. Most evident is
                     					the importance of knowledge of the text and the reader: readers might
                     					underline or comment on passages where they learn something from the text
                     					that they did not know before. However, the notes by Thomas Mann also
                     					document his critical stance towards the author of the text, who seems to
                     					willingly modify his interpretations to conform with National Socialist
                     					ideology. Therefore, Bamert argues, the knowledge of the author as well as
                     					of the historical context need to be involved in the interpretation of such
                     					annotations.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">While in these examples, the annotations analyzed have been done previous to
                     					the research, most articles in the volume deal with annotations that are
                     					produced at some point in the research process. One focus, as indicated in
                     					the title, is on annotations in the context of digital editions. In a
                     					digital edition, many different types of annotations can arise.
                     					Schlupkothen/Schmidt suggest a systematic distinction between commentaries
                     					(“Kommentare”) and explanatory notes (“Erläuterungen”), two terms that have
                     					often been used synonymously. While commentaries refer to the form of the
                     					text and editorial decisions related to it, explanatory notes offer
                     					additional information regarding the text’s content and thus ensure
                     					understandability. Fanta presents the edition of the estate of the author
                     					Robert Musil, which holds special challenges for the editors: the high
                     					number of documents are interrelated in many ways that echo Musil’s writing
                     					process. Such process is reflected in a high number of comments, revisions,
                     					and explicit references to other documents by the author himself, making it
                     					possible to trace how different preliminary works lead to later, more
                     					elaborate documents. Fanta shows how the edition attempts to capture all
                     					these relations in TEI/XML. Sciuto shares lessons learned from the digital
                     					edition of the work of the French philosopher d’Holbach. He discusses the
                     					problem of how to target different audiences with one edition and proposes
                     					a two-level annotation system for this purpose. Koolen/Boot approach the
                     					topic from a more technical and infrastructural angle: for many editions,
                     					it would be desirable to allow for annotation by third-party users on the
                     					edition’s website and, where useful, publish them for other users. They
                     					discuss difficulties that result from the HTML presentation of the edition
                     					and propose a solution based on semantic web technology.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Five further articles consider annotation in a different sense as the
                     					application of analytical categories to an object of study by researchers.
                     					Lang reports on the semi-automatic annotation of alchemical code names
                     					(“Decknamen”) with a thesaurus. Alchemical texts often refer to substances
                     					via their code names which are usually unfamiliar to modern readers and
                     					should therefore by accompanied by additional information. Lück aims at an
                     					analysis of philosophical texts with respect to the examples used and, as a
                     					first step, needs to identify examples in the texts. He exploits the fact
                     					that many examples are explicitly marked as such (with text strings like
                     						<em class="emph">e.g.</em> or<em class="emph"> for instance</em>)
                     					and uses these as a starting point for the heuristic identification of
                     					further candidates. The contribution by Reiter/Willand/Gius is about the
                     					annotation of narrative levels in literature. Noteworthy is that they
                     					approached this task by adapting the format of a Shared Task from
                     					computational linguistics and asked the research community to contribute
                     					annotation guidelines, test them empirically in a competitive setting, and
                     					engage in discussion about them. In a second part of the Shared Task, the
                     					aim is the development of a system for the automatic detection of narrative
                     					levels. The article by Drummond/Wildfeuer stands out by the fact that they
                     					tackle multimodal annotation. They investigate contemporary American TV
                     					series with respect to gender differences in representation of characters.
                     					Annotation categories capture aspects like camera perspective, sound
                     					design, how active the characters are and many more. Overall, female
                     					characters are displayed as in weaker positions.</div>
                  				
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Another group of articles focuses on annotation as a process and tools for
                     					its support. McCarty shares his thoughts on general note making in the
                     					research process and considers them a cognitive tool not only for writing
                     					down thoughts but for developing them in the first place. He stresses how
                     					the choice for a specific tool – be it digital or analogue – impacts our
                     					thinking and calls for a thorough study of annotation practices and their
                     					embedding in context prior to software development. Lange contributes
                     					empirical data on the annotation of research articles by scholars. To this
                     					end, he analyses public annotations by researchers in the online journal
                     					eLifeScience.com, which allows readers to annotate with the help of the
                     					Hypothes.is plug-in. In comparison to what we know about private note
                     					making, he finds that most annotations were clearly written (or rewritten)
                     					with publication in mind. Horstmann follows up on questions of tool
                     					development by presenting the annotation tool CATMA (Computer Assisted Text
                     					Markup and Analysis). CATMA supports close reading practices like
                     					highlighting and manual annotation as well as quantitative analysis of its
                     					annotations and automatic annotation of some phenomena. This way, Horstmann
                     					argues, the tool can contribute to building bridges between traditional
                     					literary scholars and digital humanists.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Finally, some articles primarily address theoretical aspects of annotation.
                     					Hinzmann revisits the concept of the hermeneutic circle. Despite the term’s
                     					popularity, it is not precisely defined and used for many different
                     					understandings of this concept. Hinzmann suggests a differentiation of
                     					several circular relationships that are involved in annotation and
                     					interpretation: 1) The interplay of part and whole of a text or corpus in
                     					the sense that interpretation of a part is influenced by knowledge of the
                     					whole and vice versa, 2) the interplay of individual annotation categories,
                     					the category system as a whole, and its theoretical foundation, 3) the
                     					interplay of the object’s historicity and systematic categories of modern
                     					research, and 4) the interplay of induction (bottom-up) and deduction
                     					(top-down) in research processes. That suggestion is to be welcomed and
                     					communication in and beyond the digital humanities could profit greatly
                     					from more explicitness as to which understanding of hermeneutic circle is
                     					being referred to. Franken/Koch/Zinsmeister look at the different functions
                     					that annotations can fulfill in a research process. To this end, they
                     					compare typical uses of annotations in computational linguistics and
                     					cultural anthropology. One major difference is that computational
                     					linguistics predominantly works with pre-defined category systems which are
                     					then applied to data while cultural anthropology follows methods of
                     					grounded theory and develops the annotation categories in the annotation
                     					process itself. Rehm offers various reflections on annotation from the
                     					perspective of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. Among
                     					others, he provides a list of “dimensions” by which annotations can be
                     					systematically described (e. g. research question, annotators, guidelines,
                     					complexity and evaluation).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Overall, the volume gives a very broad and inspiring insight into what can be
                     					considered annotation, what role in the research process annotation can
                     					play, and in what contexts and with which tools annotation as a practice
                     					takes place today. With regard to Unsworth’s [<a href="#unsworth2000">2000</a>] “scholarly primitive,”
                     					the multitude of phenomena and approaches sometimes makes it difficult to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">This formula provides a grid for a structured discussion of different types
                     					of annotations, depending on how the variables are filled. As for A, the
                     					role of the annotator is either fulfilled by the researcher (as in most
                     					papers in the volume) or by some other scholar or author that is the object
                     					of study (academic writers in Freedman, Thomas Mann in Bamert). Fanta
                     					combines both types as the edition involves annotations by Robert Musil,
                     					but also their representation in the edition. For automatic annotation, the
                     					computer can be considered another type of annotator, even though its
                     					application is, of course, driven by a researcher. For the type of
                     					information (B) encoded in annotations, possibilities are essentially
                     					unlimited and as free as research itself, as the volume impressively
                     					illustrates. Of course, some categories can be more easily mapped to an
                     					annotation scheme or are even standardized, while others are more difficult
                     					to pin down at text surface (see Franken/Koch/Zinsmeister). Note that while
                     					the text is the most common object of annotation (C) in the book and
                     					beyond, annotation can be applied to other research objects as well, like
                     					movies in Drummond/Wildfeuer. Also, the annotation of “text” holds its
                     					ambiguities, e.g. whether the text is considered in its materiality or not.
                     					The mode of annotation (D), in a technical sense, can be divided in
                     					analogue and digital approaches, the former constituting the vast majority
                     					for annotations created today (with the exception of personal note-taking,
                     					as in McCarty). A further differentiation can be made among the digital
                     					approaches by looking at annotation formats like XML (Fanta and others),
                     					HTML (Koolen/Boot) and TCF (Lück) and tools like CATMA (Horstmann) or ELAN
                     					(Drummond/Wildfeuer). Finally, annotations can be described by their
                     					purpose (E) which is also dependent on the addressee of the annotations.
                     					Purposes of annotations in the volume range from personal notes the author
                     					addresses to themself (Bamert, McCarty), analytical categories that are
                     					subsequently analyzed (Lang, Hinzmann, Reiter/Willand/Gius, and others),
                     					and annotations that are directed at a third-party reader like other
                     					researchers (Lange) or the reader of an edition (Schlupkothen/Schmidt,
                     					Sciuto). Some annotations are primarily addressed to the computer that maps
                     					the annotations to specific forms of visualization (typically) on the
                     					screen.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">In highly interdisciplinary contexts like the digital humanities,
                     					communication can be challenging. On an abstract level, we will oftentimes
                     					agree that we all “do annotation” and thus regard it a scholarly primitive.
                     					However, concrete practices differ substantially and what a computational
                     					linguist and a historian have in mind when they say “annotation” might have
                     					less in common than both of them expect. A description model like the
                     					simple formula proposed here enables systematic discussions about concepts
                     					of annotation. Grounded in a solid understanding of commonalities and
                     					differences, multiple approaches to annotation can benefit greatly from
                     					confrontation with each other. In this way, annotation as a shared practice
                     					can foster interdisciplinary exchange. The volume by Julia Nantke and
                     					Frederik Schlupkothen is an impressive example of how the focus on an
                     					abstract practice like annotation allows various research endeavors to find
                     					parallels in their work.</div>
