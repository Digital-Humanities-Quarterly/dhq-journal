				<p>Annotations are ubiquitous in research in the digital humanities and beyond
					and have been declared a <soCalled>scholarly primitive</soCalled> by Unsworth. By this, he
					refers to <quote rend="quotes">basic functions common to scholarly activity across disciplines,
					over time, and independent of theoretical orientation</quote> <ptr target="#unsworth2000"/>.
					Julia Nantke and Frederik Schlupkothen have set out to further deepen our
					understanding of annotation and foster interdisciplinary exchange on what
					annotation is and can be. To that end, they organized an interdisciplinary
					conference held at the University of Wuppertal, Germany, in February 2019.
					The conference was called <title rend="italic">Annotations in Scholarly
						Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation,
						Systematization</title> and its results were published in a volume by the
					same name <ptr target="#nantke2020"/>. </p>
				<p>The introduction to the volume by Nantke/Schlupkothen is in itself worth
					mentioning: to give a comprehensive overview of the 16 articles without
					reducing them to one aspect only, they provide several visualizations of
					the volume’s content using the articles’ keywords. A word cloud shows which
					keywords are the most popular, a similarity matrix displays which articles
					combine to thematic clusters and an edge bundling visualization gives easy
					access to information on which articles share which keywords. The latter unfolds its full usefulness only in the interactive version that
					can be found on the publisher’s website (De Gruyter): <ref
						target="https://cloud.newsletter.degruyter.com/annotations/"
						>https://cloud.newsletter.degruyter.com/annotations/</ref>. This
					review, in contrast, must force the articles back into the linearity of the
					medium of text. The guiding principle of the following is to question both
					what the authors mean by the multifaceted term <q>annotation</q> and whether
					they approach it from a primarily theoretical or applied perspective. </p>
				<p>First, some articles focus on analysis of annotations that have already been
					done by someone else and are now the object of study. Freedman extends the
					understanding of annotations to footnotes in academic texts and traces that
					type of textual expression back to its origins in the 17th century. For
					Bamert, annotations are handwritten marginal notes in books for which he
					coins the term <term>pen traces</term> (<q>Stiftspuren</q>). That term allows one to
					include non-verbal forms like underlinings and stresses the materiality of
					such annotations. Through the example of pen traces made by Thomas Mann
					found in books in his estate, Bamert shows that four types of knowledge
					need to be included in the analysis of such annotations. Most evident is
					the importance of knowledge of the text and the reader: readers might
					underline or comment on passages where they learn something from the text
					that they did not know before. However, the notes by Thomas Mann also
					document his critical stance towards the author of the text, who seems to
					willingly modify his interpretations to conform with National Socialist
					ideology. Therefore, Bamert argues, the knowledge of the author as well as
					of the historical context need to be involved in the interpretation of such
					annotations.</p>
				<p>While in these examples, the annotations analyzed have been done previous to
					the research, most articles in the volume deal with annotations that are
					produced at some point in the research process. One focus, as indicated in
					the title, is on annotations in the context of digital editions. In a
					digital edition, many different types of annotations can arise.
					Schlupkothen/Schmidt suggest a systematic distinction between commentaries
					(<q>Kommentare</q>) and explanatory notes (<q>Erläuterungen</q>), two terms that have
					often been used synonymously. While commentaries refer to the form of the
					text and editorial decisions related to it, explanatory notes offer
					additional information regarding the text’s content and thus ensure
					understandability. Fanta presents the edition of the estate of the author
					Robert Musil, which holds special challenges for the editors: the high
					number of documents are interrelated in many ways that echo Musil’s writing
					process. Such process is reflected in a high number of comments, revisions,
					and explicit references to other documents by the author himself, making it
					possible to trace how different preliminary works lead to later, more
					elaborate documents. Fanta shows how the edition attempts to capture all
					these relations in TEI/XML. Sciuto shares lessons learned from the digital
					edition of the work of the French philosopher d’Holbach. He discusses the
					problem of how to target different audiences with one edition and proposes
					a two-level annotation system for this purpose. Koolen/Boot approach the
					topic from a more technical and infrastructural angle: for many editions,
					it would be desirable to allow for annotation by third-party users on the
					edition’s website and, where useful, publish them for other users. They
					discuss difficulties that result from the HTML presentation of the edition
					and propose a solution based on semantic web technology.</p>
				<p>Five further articles consider annotation in a different sense as the
					application of analytical categories to an object of study by researchers.
					Lang reports on the semi-automatic annotation of alchemical code names
					(<q>Decknamen</q>) with a thesaurus. Alchemical texts often refer to substances
					via their code names which are usually unfamiliar to modern readers and
					should therefore by accompanied by additional information. Lück aims at an
					analysis of philosophical texts with respect to the examples used and, as a
					first step, needs to identify examples in the texts. He exploits the fact
					that many examples are explicitly marked as such (with text strings like
						<emph>e.g.</emph> or<emph> for instance</emph>)
					and uses these as a starting point for the heuristic identification of
					further candidates. The contribution by Reiter/Willand/Gius is about the
					annotation of narrative levels in literature. Noteworthy is that they
					approached this task by adapting the format of a Shared Task from
					computational linguistics and asked the research community to contribute
					annotation guidelines, test them empirically in a competitive setting, and
					engage in discussion about them. In a second part of the Shared Task, the
					aim is the development of a system for the automatic detection of narrative
					levels. The article by Drummond/Wildfeuer stands out by the fact that they
					tackle multimodal annotation. They investigate contemporary American TV
					series with respect to gender differences in representation of characters.
					Annotation categories capture aspects like camera perspective, sound
					design, how active the characters are and many more. Overall, female
					characters are displayed as in weaker positions.</p>
				<p>Another group of articles focuses on annotation as a process and tools for
					its support. McCarty shares his thoughts on general note making in the
					research process and considers them a cognitive tool not only for writing
					down thoughts but for developing them in the first place. He stresses how
					the choice for a specific tool – be it digital or analogue – impacts our
					thinking and calls for a thorough study of annotation practices and their
					embedding in context prior to software development. Lange contributes
					empirical data on the annotation of research articles by scholars. To this
					end, he analyses public annotations by researchers in the online journal
					eLifeScience.com, which allows readers to annotate with the help of the
					Hypothes.is plug-in. In comparison to what we know about private note
					making, he finds that most annotations were clearly written (or rewritten)
					with publication in mind. Horstmann follows up on questions of tool
					development by presenting the annotation tool CATMA (Computer Assisted Text
					Markup and Analysis). CATMA supports close reading practices like
					highlighting and manual annotation as well as quantitative analysis of its
					annotations and automatic annotation of some phenomena. This way, Horstmann
					argues, the tool can contribute to building bridges between traditional
					literary scholars and digital humanists.</p>
				<p>Finally, some articles primarily address theoretical aspects of annotation.
					Hinzmann revisits the concept of the hermeneutic circle. Despite the term’s
					popularity, it is not precisely defined and used for many different
					understandings of this concept. Hinzmann suggests a differentiation of
					several circular relationships that are involved in annotation and
					interpretation: 1) The interplay of part and whole of a text or corpus in
					the sense that interpretation of a part is influenced by knowledge of the
					whole and vice versa, 2) the interplay of individual annotation categories,
					the category system as a whole, and its theoretical foundation, 3) the
					interplay of the object’s historicity and systematic categories of modern
					research, and 4) the interplay of induction (bottom-up) and deduction
					(top-down) in research processes. That suggestion is to be welcomed and
					communication in and beyond the digital humanities could profit greatly
					from more explicitness as to which understanding of hermeneutic circle is
					being referred to. Franken/Koch/Zinsmeister look at the different functions
					that annotations can fulfill in a research process. To this end, they
					compare typical uses of annotations in computational linguistics and
					cultural anthropology. One major difference is that computational
					linguistics predominantly works with pre-defined category systems which are
					then applied to data while cultural anthropology follows methods of
					grounded theory and develops the annotation categories in the annotation
					process itself. Rehm offers various reflections on annotation from the
					perspective of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. Among
					others, he provides a list of <q>dimensions</q> by which annotations can be
					systematically described (e. g. research question, annotators, guidelines,
					complexity and evaluation).</p>
				<p>Overall, the volume gives a very broad and inspiring insight into what can be
					considered annotation, what role in the research process annotation can
					play, and in what contexts and with which tools annotation as a practice
					takes place today. With regard to Unsworth’s [<ref target="#unsworth2000">2000</ref>] <q>scholarly primitive,</q>
					the multitude of phenomena and approaches sometimes makes it difficult to
					see the primitive that they are all supposed to share.<note> The discussion
						about what scholarly primitives are is still in progress and the
						answer is highly dependent on the purpose of their compilation
						<ptr target="#palmer2009"/> <ptr target="#blanke2013"/>.</note> An
					abstraction of all understandings of annotation could result in a formula
					like: </p>
				<eg lang="nohighlight">
<hi rend="italic">A</hi><![CDATA[ adds information]]> <hi rend="italic">B</hi> <![CDATA[to object]]> <hi rend="italic">C</hi> <![CDATA[in mode]]> <hi rend="italic">D</hi> <![CDATA[with purpose]]> <hi rend="italic">E</hi>.
</eg>
				<p>This formula provides a grid for a structured discussion of different types
					of annotations, depending on how the variables are filled. As for A, the
					role of the annotator is either fulfilled by the researcher (as in most
					papers in the volume) or by some other scholar or author that is the object
					of study (academic writers in Freedman, Thomas Mann in Bamert). Fanta
					combines both types as the edition involves annotations by Robert Musil,
					but also their representation in the edition. For automatic annotation, the
					computer can be considered another type of annotator, even though its
					application is, of course, driven by a researcher. For the type of
					information (B) encoded in annotations, possibilities are essentially
					unlimited and as free as research itself, as the volume impressively
					illustrates. Of course, some categories can be more easily mapped to an
					annotation scheme or are even standardized, while others are more difficult
					to pin down at text surface (see Franken/Koch/Zinsmeister). Note that while
					the text is the most common object of annotation (C) in the book and
					beyond, annotation can be applied to other research objects as well, like
					movies in Drummond/Wildfeuer. Also, the annotation of <q>text</q> holds its
					ambiguities, e.g. whether the text is considered in its materiality or not.
					The mode of annotation (D), in a technical sense, can be divided in
					analogue and digital approaches, the former constituting the vast majority
					for annotations created today (with the exception of personal note-taking,
					as in McCarty). A further differentiation can be made among the digital
					approaches by looking at annotation formats like XML (Fanta and others),
					HTML (Koolen/Boot) and TCF (Lück) and tools like CATMA (Horstmann) or ELAN
					(Drummond/Wildfeuer). Finally, annotations can be described by their
					purpose (E) which is also dependent on the addressee of the annotations.
					Purposes of annotations in the volume range from personal notes the author
					addresses to themself (Bamert, McCarty), analytical categories that are
					subsequently analyzed (Lang, Hinzmann, Reiter/Willand/Gius, and others),
					and annotations that are directed at a third-party reader like other
					researchers (Lange) or the reader of an edition (Schlupkothen/Schmidt,
					Sciuto). Some annotations are primarily addressed to the computer that maps
					the annotations to specific forms of visualization (typically) on the
					screen.</p>
				<p>In highly interdisciplinary contexts like the digital humanities,
					communication can be challenging. On an abstract level, we will oftentimes
					agree that we all “do annotation” and thus regard it a scholarly primitive.
					However, concrete practices differ substantially and what a computational
					linguist and a historian have in mind when they say “annotation” might have
					less in common than both of them expect. A description model like the
					simple formula proposed here enables systematic discussions about concepts
					of annotation. Grounded in a solid understanding of commonalities and
					differences, multiple approaches to annotation can benefit greatly from
					confrontation with each other. In this way, annotation as a shared practice
					can foster interdisciplinary exchange. The volume by Julia Nantke and
					Frederik Schlupkothen is an impressive example of how the focus on an
					abstract practice like annotation allows various research endeavors to find
					parallels in their work.</p>
