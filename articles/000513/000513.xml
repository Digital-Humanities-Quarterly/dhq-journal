        <div><head>Introduction</head>
        <p>Gentrification is a sonic phenomenon. As cities across the globe reinvest
        in previously disenfranchised neighborhoods and invite middle-and upper-class
        residents to build communities in their own images, the sonic characters of
        these neighborhoods are shifting as well. Some neighborhoods become louder,
        newly formed nightlife hubs where incoming partygoers care little for
        residential sleep schedules. Others become quieter, as new residents enforce
        particular sonic expectations onto long-term residents. These shifts are, as
        sound is, enmeshed in complex histories of race, gender, class, sexuality,
        and ability, and documenting these sonic shifts has the potential to help us
        imagine and create more equitable soundscapes.</p>
        <p>In 2018, I was thinking through the possibilities of using the digital
        humanities to listen to gentrification in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington
        D.C. My analysis of the sonic dimensions of gentrification in D.C. is
        couched in histories of policing black sound, from the black codes of the
        19th century to the city's recent #DontMuteDC movement, which has
        fundamentally shifted the city's public conversation surrounding gentrification
        and black cultural displacement. The black codes, laws passed in the early
        19th century, dictated in cruel detail what was legal or illegal in
        the life of black people, both freed and enslaved. They included several laws
        about the legality of black gatherings, which had to be approved and supervised
        by white men of authority (largely police), and imposed limits on the number
        of people that could gather and at what times <ptr target="#snethen1848"/>.
        Over 100 years
        later, traces of the restrictive black codes are still present in D.C. and in
        cities across the country.</p>
        <p>In April of 2019, the #DontMuteDC Movement originated at one particular
        intersection in D.C., at the corner of 7th Street and Florida Avenue
        Northwest. 7th and Florida is home to "Central Communications,"
        a MetroPCS cell phone store whose owner, Donald Campbell, plays go-go music
        from large storefront speakers during business hours. Go-go music is D.C.'s
        local subgenre of funk, pioneered in the 1970s by bands such as Chuck Brown
        and the Soul Searchers, Trouble Funk, and The Young Senators. Characterized
        by energetic live performance, intense rhythmic grooves, and ample audience
        participation, go-go music has been the sound of working-class black D.C.
        for over 40 years. Go-go became the catalyst for the #dontmuteDC movement
        because of complaints leveled at the store by new residents who threatened
        to sue T-Mobile, MetroPCS's parent company, if the music was not turned off.
        Public outcry and swift organizing forced T-Mobile to allow the go-go music to
        continue, but the intersection remains the epicenter of conversations regarding
        gentrification and the silencing of black sonic life. Despite the positive
        outcome, this is what gentrification in Washington, D.C. sounds like: increased
        tensions surrounding the role of sound, music, and noise in "public" space.</p>
        <p>In this article, I demonstrate the potential of the computational methods
        to hear gentrification., using a combination of ethnography, passive acoustic
        recording, and computational sound analysis. My focus here is the intersection
        of 7th and Florida, which is located in the rapidly gentrifying Shaw
        neighborhood of Washington D.C.. This recording and subsequent computational
        analysis is a part of my larger project of exploring how black people hear
        gentrification in D.C., and contributes to the black digital humanities by
        thinking through how digital tools can transform how we hear black life.
        Furthermore, while the digital humanities have turned toward the sonic in
        recent years, there is still much to be done to embrace aurality in the field.
        The project invites us to listen closely to a changing neighborhood, and
        emphasizes sound as an essential mode of knowledge production, all the while
        arguing that a sonic rendering of gentrifying space through the digital has the
        potential to move us toward more equitable soundscapes.</p>
        <p>As I listen to 7th Street and Florida Avenue and the broader D.C.
        area, I hear continued attempts to silence of black music and sound through
        the threat of legal action, legislation, and the everyday criminalization of
        black people. In the same space, I also hear the flourishing of black sonic
        life in all its forms, from the quiet interior to raucous protest. In engaging
        sound in this way, we might imagine a soundscape in which any and all aural
        manifestations of blackness might be welcomed and not policed in the ways that
        they have been for centuries. Engaging with computational sonic methods leads
        us to a fuller understanding, articulation, and speculation of the auralities
        of black life, so that we might listen in and through and against gentrifying
        forces.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Digital Humanities and Black Sound</head>
        <p>Although the digital humanities consideration of sound has been behind that
        of other fields, there are a number of scholars and thinkers whose projects
        treat sound as data within the realm of DH. Most influential for this project
        has been those that engage black digital humanities discourses as well as those
        that engage in large sonic datasets from a computational perspective. This
        combination of perspectives is critical because of big data's potential to harm
        marginalized communities, particularly black people. At the forefront of these
        conversations is the 2019 volume <emph>Digital Sound Studies,</emph> published
        by Mary Caton Lingold, Darren Mueller, and Whitney Trettian. Acknowledging
        early on that Black Studies has been on the vanguard of sound studies since
        its inception, Lingold et al. set the tone for what a sonic digital humanities
        can be, considering a variety of projects from Jennifer Stoever's foundational
        blog "Sounding Out!" to Myron Beasley's attention to how Zora Neale Hurston's
        voice might remix the archive. The volume argues that "while digital media thus
        create a space of possibility for the study of sound, critical, interpretive
        labor fulfills this potential, not the technology itself," reinforcing
        the critical potential of sonic digital work when grounded in rigorous
        humanistic analysis. This reinforcement becomes ever more important as the
        #dontmuteDC movement forces the city and even the United States to have a stark
        conversation on the histories of policing black sound, and how technology might
        engage, unravel, and work against such legacies. Digital humanities and sound
        studies are sites in which to disrupt the violences of gentrification, and can
        do so through engaging with and against technological tools, from recording to
        machine learning.</p>
        <p>In addition to those within digital humanities, ethnomusicologists have
        also long been engaging sound and the digital. For example, Regina Bradley's
        "Outkasted Conversations" provides a digital space dedicated to the study and
        archiving of southern hip-hop scholarship, featuring interviews, essays, and
        syllabi all dedicated to the study of Atlanta's pioneering rap group Outkast.
        Additionally, Kyra Gaunt's scholarship on the exploitation of black girls
        on YouTube and other social media platforms is offering a deep dive into the
        sonorities of online racial and gendered oppressions. Gaunt's work, drawing
        on data from YouTube (and therefore Google) makes audible the harm enacted
        onto black girls and teenagers online, even as their content builds profits
        for other entities <ptr target="#gaunt2018"/>. These projects incorporate sound into broader
        datasets that also include text-based media, arguing for sound's presence as an
        integral part of multifaceted humanistic projects.</p>
        <p>Regarding the computational analysis of sound, Tanya Clement's work on
        machine learning and recorded sound collections has long been on the vanguard
        of sound work in the digital humanities. Her early use visualization tools
        such as ProseVis for the sonic analysis of Gertrude Stein's work has been
        key in developing questions of how to read sound and how to treat sound as
        data. Drawing on Johanna Drucker's "data as capta," Clement advocated early
        on for reading data visualization like musical scores, where the visualization
        itself is dependent on the observer rather than existing on its own
        <ptr target="#clement2013"/>. She also developed "High-Performance Sound Technologies for Access and
        Scholarship" (HiPSTAS), a program that leverages machine learning to generate
        metadata for large speech based aural datasets <ptr target="#clement2018"/>.</p>
        <p>Digital humanities practices in oral history have also been key to this
        genealogy. On the forefront of this work has been Doug Boyd and the Oral
        History in the Digital Age Project, where authors and contributors have
        advocated for pushing understandings of oral history practice into digital
        humanities conversations, from tools to capture histories to using recordings
        as data. Sharon Webb et al. have developed a minimal computing project to
        mine oral history recordings for important sonic information that is typically
        overlooked in favor of text only transcripts. Utilizing the soundscapes of
        the recording themselves has the potential to help researchers work through
        issues of gender, silence, emotion, and other factors that are lost within
        the production of the transcript <ptr target="#webb2017"/>. These projects that
        consider how engaging in the work of signal processing and managing a large
        sonic dataset move us toward a broader potential for archival recordings,
        particularly those based in speech.</p>
        <p>My intervention into this conversation in sonic digital humanities is
        to leave behind the text as an anchoring force, and to create work with
        large sonic datasets that respects the call and parameters of black digital
        humanities, described by Kim Gallon as "the intersection between Black studies
        and digital humanities, transforming the concept into corporeal reality
        while lending language to the work of the black digerati in and outside of
        the academy" <ptr target="#gallon2016"/>. Gallon forces us to ask the question
        of how the
        complete premise of the digital humanities changes for a group of people
        who are in many ways, historically and contemporarily, not considered human.
        Engaging with my own dataset, then, is always a question of amplifying black
        life. In the case of listening to gentrification in Washington, D.C., I have
        had to consider how both the creation and analysis of a large sonic dataset
        might engage the aural to disrupt visual narratives of gentrification, which
        emphasize dramatic change, displacement, and erasure <ptr target="#parham2007"/>.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Methodology</head>
        <p>I conducted the majority of the fieldwork for this project in Washington,
        D.C. between 2016 and 2018, employing three interwoven methodologies:
        interviews, participant observation, and passive acoustic recording. I
        engaged this combination of methodologies in order to arrive at a kind of
        "thick data" <ptr target="#wang2013"/>.
        Thick data combines Geertz's thick description
        with the big data that is often central to digital humanities conversations,
        aiming for a generative kind of movement between the macro and the micro,
        which was essential for this project. During fieldwork, I was interested
        in telling the stories of individuals, places, and songs through interviews
        and participant-observation, but also in listening to change over time and
        detecting broader patterns that only a vast number of soundscape recordings
        could provide. Approaching sound in "multiple registers" consistently allowed
        me to engage more meaningfully with the ethnographic and the computational
        aspects of the project.</p>
        <p>I conducted dozens of interviews with a wide range of conversation partners:
        musicians, local neighborhood officials, church members, business owners,
        and residents. These interviews were typically semi structured conversations,
        drawing on a mix of my own questions related to sonic impressions of the
        neighborhood as well as stories that people were willing to share. Gaining
        access to interviews was often an exercise of positioning myself in layers,
        typically beginning with my "official" classification as a PhD student or
        Smithsonian intern working on a project focused on neighborhood change.
        Language was important here, as "gentrification" carries different connotations
        than "neighborhood change" in local discourses. Neighborhood change is a less
        racially charged term than gentrification, with the former indicating that
        the neighborhood has undergone some development and the latter insinuating
        that the development can be blamed on a particular group of (white) people.
        At a neighborhood association meeting, I once described my project to a black
        resident of Maryland as being about "gentrification and sound," and he remarked
        that it was very interesting, "because of that word that you just used,"
        rather than repeating it himself. I moved between the two terms as the project
        unfolded, often times mirroring the vocabulary of my interlocuters.</p>
        <p>Two other layers of identification were key in gaining access to interviews:
        my blackness as well as my being from Prince George's County, Maryland, located
        directly east of the city. Because of the exploitative legacies of fields such
        as ethnomusicology, sociology, and anthropology, communities of color often
        exercise a legitimate skepticism with outside researchers, no matter their
        racial identity <ptr target="#mcdougal2014"/>.
        During phone calls to solicit interviews,
        I noticed that I was code switching more than usual, drawing out my D.C.
        accent in order to be heard and coded as a black woman from the area, working
        against the violent legacy of my discipline. In this way I was both insider
        and outsider for the duration of the project, at home in my proximity, racial
        identity, and family ties to the city yet distant in my academic training. Even
        as I did fieldwork in places very familiar to me, I was always an outsider just
        by virtue of doing the fieldwork <ptr target="#wong2008"/>.</p>
        <p>I articulate these layers in order to complicate the notion of "fieldwork
        at home," which has been inconsistently theorized in ethnomusicology and is
        so often conducted by people of color. As Mellonee Burnim has argued, shared
        racial or ethnic identity with a group of people does not automatically create
        a culture-bearer. Regarding her fieldwork on gospel music, she emphasizes that
        her racial identity is not the only reason why she was trusted in her various
        research sites, but also because she was a culture-bearer within the gospel
        music tradition, and was able to offer these churches her skills as a musician
        in return for conducting research <ptr target="#burnim1985"/>.
        My blackness, then, did not
        always endear people to me. Fieldwork for me was at home but-not-home, where
        I was often familiar with the people and places around me but had arrived
        with a new set of expectations and questions that required me to become an
        outsider.</p>
        <p>Participant observation for this project involved attending musical
        performances, neighborhood meetings, rallies, and protests. At these events, I
        was typically most interested in sound sources and tensions surrounding them.
        For example, at an Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) meeting one evening,
        half the attendees left the event halfway through because their hot-button
        agenda item had been completed. They then proceeded to be so loud in the
        hallway that one of the commissioners running the meeting had to step out to
        tell them to be quiet, reminding them that there were still more items on the
        agenda besides theirs. These tensions, stemming from who is able to be heard
        and whose sounds or voice are deemed important, were central for the project.
        Furthermore, many of my observations were digital rather than in person; I
        listened to online radio, watched Facebook and Twitter videos, and watched
        live streams of D.C. City Council Hearings. In this way, my ethnography was
        necessarily digital because many of the city's conversations on gentrification
        are happening online, both privately and publicly. As a result, I was thinking
        across multiple forms and formats of sound.</p>
        <p>Passive acoustic recording was the most unconventional method for the
        project, because it is most often used to listen to bioacoustic changes in
        environments coded as "natural," such as forests or underwater to listen to
        marine life. However, this method of long-term passive acoustic recording
        has been established as an effective way of detecting patterns and changes in
        a large number of soundscapes <ptr target="#pijanowski2011"/>. I was inspired by a
        colleague's work in the Ecuadorian cloud forest to transfer the methodology
        to the heart of Washington, D.C., applying a few modifications but utilizing
        the same recording equipment. For the duration of the project, I utilized two
        Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter SM4 recorders, described by the manufacturers as
        "a compact, weatherproof, dual-channel acoustic recorder capable of long-term
        acoustic monitoring of birds, frogs, insects, and aquatic life."
        <note>In my initial curiosity about the potential
        of these recorders for listening to gentrification, I called Wildlife
        Acoustics and asked a general question what the recorders would be able to
        hear. The man I spoke to then asked me what I was trying to hear, and my
        response of "gentrification" audibly threw him off. He did admit, though,
        that they can pick up "everything."</note> <ptr target="#wildlife"/>.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, this passive acoustic recording was carefully
        intertwined with ethnography, because I chose to install the recorders on two
        building rooftops in and around the intersection of 7th and Florida.
        Acoustically, rooftops offer the best vantage point for urban passive acoustic
        recording. In order to install the recorders, I first had to receive permission
        from the owners of those particular buildings (one a church and one a church
        office), both of whom agreed after an interview with me. This agreement also
        came with the promise of letting me inside and on the rooves once a month to
        download data and change the batteries for the recorders, which allowed me to
        get to know various office staffs and grounded this project in people, rather
        than soundscape data. The first rooftop was about five stories off the ground,
        and covered with solar panels. In March of 2018, I hung the first recorder,
        nestled in a wooden arm, off of the southwestern edge of the roof, so as to
        be directed towards the intersection of 7th street and Florida
        Avenue. I installed the second recorder in May over a third-floor balcony in
        the intersection. Both recorders captured one minute out of every five minutes
        all day, every day. That resulted in 288 recordings per day, per recorder.
        The final tally of over 100,000 recordings is nearly impossible to listen or
        analyze manually, and yet the possibilities for the dataset seem endless.</p>
        <p>While the go-go music at Central Communications is certainly the defining
        element of 7th and Florida, there are a number of other features
        that provide a rich space for a cultural soundscape study. Given its
        proximity to the Historically Black College/University Howard University, the
        intersection is heavily trafficked by students, residents, and people who work
        in the nearby Howard University Hospital. The northern half of the intersection
        is home to a florist, beauty supply store, restaurant, and church offices.
        At the southwest corner of the intersection is a CVS pharmacy owned by Howard
        University, complete with a small parking lot that is always at least half
        full of cars. In addition to these businesses, there are Metro Bus stops at the
        southwest and northeast corners of the intersection, where people constantly
        mill about and wait for the bus. In addition to foot traffic, 7th
        and Florida is one of the busiest intersections in the city for vehicular
        traffic, also ranked in the top 10 dangerous intersections for drivers between
        2015 and 2018 <ptr target="#smith2018"/>.
        Where Florida Avenue continues west directly to
        the U Street Corridor and into a busy nightlife district, 7th Street
        southbound leads to the Chinatown/Gallery-Place neighborhood, comparable to
        a smaller version of New York City's Times Square. The result is a bustling
        junction that is never silent, if only for the crosswalk signal that beeps 24
        hours a day.</p>
        <p>Engaging 100,000 raw .wav files required a healthy amount of data cleaning,
        an essential and time-consuming phase of every digital humanities project. Data
        cleaning is generally understood as the manipulation of a raw dataset (sound,
        text, images, etc.) into a more categorized, segmented, and manageable whole.
        When it comes to projects based in humanistic inquiry, though, data cleaning in
        and of itself is contested. The language of cleaning data implies that "things
        already have a rightful place, but they're not in it" <ptr target="#rawson2016"/>.
        The practice of putting data into categories is an imposition, and requires the
        questioning of the categories themselves. In my work, I treat listening as a
        speculative method, following Deborah Kapchan's call for scholars to "release
        our hold on intellective knowledge (with its drives to categorize, objectify,
        and subjugate)" <ptr target="#kapchan2017"/>. Similarly, I seek a mode of knowledge
        production through the aural that speculates without being ahistorical, and
        listens with the intent of amplification rather than categorization. This
        type of speculative engagement with sound led to a flexibility within both
        data cleaning and analysis, where I engaged in different levels of cleaning
        depending on the particular goal of the project in that moment. The disruption
        of visual narratives of gentrification, which emphasize displacement and
        measurable outcome, lies here in the slippage between the speculative and the
        categorizable. My intention in questioning the process of data cleaning is
        not to arrive at a perfect solution of how to categorize data, but instead to
        use both necessary processes of categorization and speculation to interrupt
        prevalent narratives of loss.</p>
        <p>Tanya Clement describes computational sound analysis as a question of
        compromises balanced amidst an exercise in imagination <ptr target="#clement2018"/>.
        Sound
        is ephemeral, difficult to track, and contains variants that text-based data
        does not. However, in order to engage in large scale analysis, some level of
        categorization is indeed required for a sonic data set. In the case of the data
        from the recorders, I went through a trial and error process in order to clean
        the data, beginning with Kaleidoscope, the software suite built by Wildlife
        Acoustics in order to visualize and classify the data from their Song Meter
        recorders. The software features a number of different functions, including a
        spectrogram to visualize data, a clustering mechanism to group like recordings,
        and a noise analysis tool. I began working with the data month by month, as
        my data was already organized in this schema because I ascended the rooftops
        monthly to download data and change the batteries on the recorders.</p>
        <p>In order to train the data set, I first ran a month's worth of data through
        Kaleidoscope's unsupervised classifier, which allows the algorithm to group
        the recordings into unnamed clusters based on similarities in frequency and
        timing. This classification is conducted through Fast Fourier Transform, an
        algorithm that decomposes complex frequencies. With these base classifiers
        in hand, I then went through manually and "tagged" clips within my own named
        clusters, which included the following: brakes, bus hiss, backup beeps, music,
        voices, and sirens. I developed this final set of categories through trial and
        error, and then went through to only tag the best examples of these sounds. I
        then re-ran the classifier with the same data to only include the clips that
        I tagged. This second .csv file then becomes the training set. Finally, I ran
        a new set of data under a supervised classification, using the second .csv
        file that I named as the training set. This then produces a results page that
        clusters the data based on my training set, and is fairly accurate within a set
        distribution.</p>
        <p>I trained the dataset at least three different times, working towards
        what I considered the best result for my research questions and within the
        ethical limitations I set for myself. One of the primary dilemmas during
        this process was the inclusion of voices as a tagged component. Surveillance
        is a fact of blackness, and keeping this in mind, this project has required
        careful consideration about the legacy of surveillance that weighs on black
        people across the diaspora <ptr target="#browne2015"/>.
        I was therefore determined to ignore
        potential identifiers in the data, and purposely "cleaned" in such a way that
        would obscure conversation rather than identify it. In fact, the only reason
        I classified voices at all was just to be able to train the classifier to be
        able to listen to go-go music, which contains a great deal of spoken vocals
        and rapping from lead talkers.<note>Lead talkers of go-go bands serve as
        bandleaders as well as the principle connection between band and audience. They
        talk to people in the front, give shout outs, call out neighborhoods, etc.</note>
        After solidifying the training set, I
        was then able to run all nine months of data from both recorders through
        Kaleidoscope. After further cleaning the final spreadsheet to only include the
        relevant information, I uploaded this spreadsheet into Sequel Pro, a database
        management application used for working with Structured Query Language (SQL)
        databases. Working with SQL and Indiana University's supercomputing support,
        I was then able to write queries for the larger dataset, getting back to those
        crucial questions about gentrification, race, and sound.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Analysis</head>
        <p>Drawing on this extended cleaning process as well as other methods of sonic
        representation, I offer a tripartite analysis of the soundscape data here,
        focused at different levels of scope to engage a variety of aural insights
        in a gentrifying intersection. I begin with close listenings, because even
        amid the possibilities of large scale machine learning, there is still room
        for and urgency within both traditional and computationally informed close
        listenings. By computationally informed close listening, I am referring to
        a kind of deep engagement with and interpretation of a sound source that
        stems from mediation types other than listening from a standard playback
        device. In this case, I facilitate close listenings via spectrograms, which
        are visual representations of sound that mark frequency and amplitude over
        an x axis of time. Utilizing the Google Chrome Music Lab's Spectrogram tool,
        I include here a short spectrogram film from the intersection, featuring the
        sounds from the intersection as well as my own annotations
        (<ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>).</p>
        <p>In this video, a spectrogram moves left to right in time, with sounds
        identified by color and 3-D intensification based on their frequency and
        loudness in relation to the sounds around them. In this short clip, I
        have annotated the sounds that are most recognizable in the intersection:
        go-go music, the hiss and beep of a Metro bus, and a siren. These sounds
        offer a striking visual representation of the collection of sounds in the
        intersection.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head>Go-Go Music</head>
          <media mimeType="video/mp4" url=""/>
        </figure>
        <p>In addition to clips such as these, I also engage in more traditional
        ethnographic descriptions drawn from my time as a participant-observer in the
        intersection. Take, for example, an ethnographic sketch of an August evening in
        2018:</p>
        <cit>
          <quote rend="block">As I sit down at the bus stop, a driver is honking intensely as they
        go through the intersection, practically laying on their horn. There is also
        a black woman's voice rapping N.E.R.D.'s "Lemon" from the speaker in front
        of Central Communications. A black man, who is actually in the intersection,
        is rapping along, but with different words. They're both rapping over a go-go
        pocket beat, and cars are driving by. A heavy engine idles at the intersection,
        then accelerates after the light turns green. As vehicles drive past, the
        pocket beat remains. In the distance, there is a siren blaring for a few
        moments, though it never passes directly through the intersection. The man
        in the intersection that was rapping along with the woman on the speaker has
        begun to rap on his own, because the speakers are currently on the breakdown,
        and there are no voices on the pocket now. He raps, "Lock It, Lock it in the
        Pocket," on repeat. His voice is momentarily drowned out by another heavy
        engine, but upon it leaving the intersection he seems to have moved on to
        rapping, "get money, get money." More engines, more brakes, more horns. The
        song changes, seemingly beginning a new set altogether. Now the song is a go-go
        cover of Frankie Beverly and Maze's "Before I Let Go." The man that was rapping
        is now saying "Hey baby, hey baby," but it's unclear who he's addressing.
        A metrobus stops, with its customary hiss-and-beep combination. A woman's
        disembodied voice comes from the bus, announcing that "the base fare is two
        dollars." She sounds like Siri. While trucks idle at the traffic light, the
        music is muffled.</quote>
        </cit>
        <p>This sketch is drawn from my time sitting one of the bus stops in the
        intersection, watching the passersby, and occasionally speaking with people.
        On this particular day, all of the people that lingered in the intersection,
        including myself, were black, and we existed as and within the boundaries of
        a porous space that people moved through to get to their next destination. For
        many of us, the intersection serves as a destination in and of itself, a place
        to come and exist outside in public space.</p>
        <p>How can the combination of a narrative close listening and a spectrogram
        film that approaches the granular help us to articulate the sonorities of
        gentrification? While many studies and narratives of gentrification emphasize
        displacement and loss, these sonic materials assert the enduring presence of
        black life in the intersection. I posit here that all of these sounds, from
        the bus stop to the siren to the go-go music, are "black sounds." The bus
        network is an important facet of black working life and labor in D.C., and
        sirens are closely connected to the same notions of policing and criminality
        that frame core conceptions of blackness
        <ptr target="#summers2019"/>. So
        as these neighborhoods become visually unrecognizable, their soundscapes
        remain discernable as a space in which black people exist. As gentrification
        threatens to erase all memory of a black D.C., the sonic footprint of a space
        on a granular level serves as an important timestamp and a refusal to be
        overlooked.</p>
        <p>These materials are an exercise in amalgamation, where all of the elements
        of the intersection are displayed and contemplated together. As I have
        conducted this analysis parallel to the rise of the #dontmuteDC movement, I
        understand this amalgamation to be a contribution to the amplification of black
        sonic life in that space. I argue that this close listening emphasizes the
        immersion of black sound in the intersection. The sounds are not neatly stacked
        or delineated individually but rather all incorporated together, as they are
        heard in the intersection. Spectrograms and ethnographic sketches support the
        assertions of the #dontmuteDC movement, namely that black music, in turn black
        people, are a foundational part of 7th and Florida, and cannot be
        silenced or removed because someone deems them too loud, too noisy, or too much
        of a nuisance.</p>
        <p>The final advantage to these close examinations of sound in the intersection
        lies in their combined elements. The spectrogram offers a visual narrative
        of sound that an ethnographic sketch alone cannot support in part because of
        the hierarchy of the senses which presumes visual evidence to be more true
        than sonic or narrative. And yet, the unreliability of my own narrative allows
        for the inclusion of more detailed information. For example, my description
        of the man's rapping is important here: his familiarity with the space and
        demonstration of go-go music's intertextuality is emblematic of the complex
        layers of sound in the intersection. But, I choose not to include the audio
        of that recording because it serves as a potential identifier, and my emphasis
        on black digital humanities does not allow me to intentionally surveil or put
        a black person in harm's way. These two modes of listening, then, together
        move us closer toward a sonic interpretation of gentrifying space and a more
        equitable soundscape the rejects the violence of surveillance as evidence.</p>
        <p>My next level of analysis zooms out to focus on particular days rather than
        minutes, represented by a 24 hour timeline built with Microsoft's Timeline
        Storyteller. Several days are important to the life of this intersection,
        from major holidays to the first day of each month, which is a popular day for
        many to go to Central Communications to pay their phone bills. Here I offer a
        24-hour look at July 4th, 2018, which features commentary about the
        various sounds heard on that day, from sirens to fireworks, which are common
        within the neighborhood as well as on the National Mall
        (See <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>).</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure02">
          <head>4th of July at Seventh and Florida</head>
          <media mimeType="video/mp4" url=""/>
        </figure>
        <p>In this timeline, hours of the day are represented by rectangular blocks
        that move clockwise beginning at 12 midnight. The beginning of the day, then,
        visually, is actually late in the night. These hour blocks are delineated in
        larger groups of three hours that mark time around a standard 24-hour day. In
        this representation, the only space continuously filled is that of the beeping
        crosswalk. While crosswalks are known to beep for accessibility purposes,
        this one in particular sounds throughout the day without prompting, inserting
        itself as the most consistent sound in the recording process. The consistent
        beeping of the intersection offers up a glimpse into a broader conversation
        about sound, gentrification, and accessibility, as the intersection serves a
        large population of disabled people. Go-go music, as per usual, begins at 10am
        when Central Communications opens, ending at 6pm which is earlier than its
        usual 8pm close but reasonable because of the holiday. Car horns are present
        throughout the day, as 7th and Florida is a busy vehicular and
        pedestrian intersection in the city. I offer "music" in the representation
        here distinct from "go-go music" and "club bass" to encompass the myriad of
        other types of musical expression that permeate the intersection, from people
        playing music on their phones as they pass through or the radio that spills
        out of cars that idle at red lights. For the remainder of the evening and into
        the night, sirens and fireworks crisscross each other in the timeline, giving
        the impression of a loud and busy night. Club bass is an interesting swatch
        in the timeline, present briefly in the late afternoon before asserting a more
        sustained presence from 12am-3am. Bass is more visible here than audible in
        actual recordings, because of the low frequencies spilling out of the club.
        Bass is felt, rather than heard, in most instances, and visual representation
        of such a consistent frequency is helpful here because many noise complaints
        (whether overtly racialized or not) begin and end with bass being too loud.</p>
        <p>I chose the 4th of July as a site for analysis because of the
        frictions between federal and local life in Washington, D.C. The 4th
        of July is perhaps the city's most popular holiday, where tourists flock in
        to visit national museums by day and enjoy fireworks by night. However, amid
        national festivities lie a city that is characterized by its lack of statehood,
        a drastic wealth gap, and a vibrant local cultural life. This timeline provides
        sonic entry into these tensions, noting how the neighborhood shifts because of
        the holiday, but also maintains its own character and traditions, in this case
        the go-go music at Central Communications.</p>
        <p>This circle timeline offers a grammar of audibility in the intersection
        through the unit of a day, a way of hearing the space that acknowledges
        patterns and routines but does not obscure or leave behind the sonic
        messiness of the day. Although gentrification is often considered primarily
        in longitudinal capacities, the unit of the everyday remains an incredibly
        useful metric of analysis. As de Certeau argued in "Walking in the City," the
        city is made by those that walk every day, made not from looking down from the
        empire state building and mapping the urban as city blocks, but instead in the
        compilation of those steps. There is a hubris in the longitudinal that I use
        the day to avoid and to disrupt. As Amira Baraka wrote about tradition, this is
        the changing same. Much of the gentrification story is not about what changes,
        but what stays the same. The crosswalk beeps, the music plays, the sirens
        wail.</p>
        <p>My final level of analysis, which is most dependent on that initial data
        cleaning process, scales back even further to think about gentrification across
        a series of months in the intersection. In this section, I consider data over
        the course of the months long period in which the recorders were installed.
        Gentrification is, on the surface, a problem of time. If I had wanted to hear
        gentrification over time in a purely longitudinal way, I would have needed
        to install the recorders in 2008 or 1998 instead of 2018. But this is a case,
        perhaps even a call, to lean in to the limitations of a dataset. What can nine
        months tell us about an intersection? What can this interval of time give us
        about a space? Does this period function only in anticipation of a longer,
        future dataset, or is there something to learn in listening to these months as
        incidents themselves?</p>
        <p>I draw on sirens here as an example, which operate as both icon and index
        of a broader urban imaginary <ptr target="#jones2017"/>.
        Sirens, depending on their source,
        can signal crime, emergencies, crises, danger, impending violence, even
        terror <ptr target="#stone2014"/>.
        Both interviews and informal conversations led me to
        understand sirens as a powerful indicator of a neighborhoods crime status, with
        some of my conversation partners sharing that they heard less sirens as the
        neighborhood around 7th and Florida gentrified. Furthermore, this
        decrease in sirens was often interpreted as a decrease in criminal activity.
        I was therefore interested in tracking the presence of sirens across time
        at 7th and Florida, and offer here a brief representation of that
        pursuit (See <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>).</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure03">
          <head>Siren Counts at Seventh and Florida</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>This simple line chart shows sirens from July to October of 2018,
        and displays the frequency of detected sirens every day.<note>Because the
        recorders only recorded one minute out of every five, it's important to note
        that this is not every siren.</note> A
        number of insights arise from the chart. The peaks and valleys here are often
        indicative of the number of people active in the space on any given day. For
        example, most peaks, where the recorder detected 20+ sirens, were on weekends,
        typically Fridays and Saturdays. Days with the least number of sirens often
        corresponded with difficult weather patterns, from heavy rain to thunderstorms.
        Looking across the longer four month period, from July to October, there is
        a noticeable decrease in sirens as the season turns from summer to fall. This
        decrease is consistent with two narratives of a gentrifying city: The first
        is that crime levels peak during summer months because summers are hot, in
        terms of both heat and criminal activity. The second narrative is that crime
        decreases over time in gentrifying neighborhoods, as the crime rate in D.C.
        has attested to. My intervention lies in the disruption of these narratives,
        however true they may be. Gentrification is not a linear, gradual process of
        displacement. Gentrification is a series of jagged interruptions, community
        meetings, demolitions, protests, contracts, construction projects, and
        violence.</p>
        <p>In carrying connotations of crime and loudness, sirens exist within a nexus
        of aural indicators of race, criminality, and urban life. Sirens are so closely
        molded to black urban life because they are indicative and representative of
        those forces that have deemed themselves in control of black life, particularly
        the police. The chart here details the pattern of sirens in the intersection,
        offering a visual experience of what it is to exist in a space in which
        blackness has been marked as existent and available. I read this pattern as
        a demonstration of the cycle of potential sonic traumas that come through
        the intersection every day, sometimes dozens of times a day: of policing,
        terror, emergency, and health crises. This chart disrupts a visual narrative of
        gentrification, in which neighborhoods become better and more beautiful looking
        because it repositions gentrification as a cyclical process of sonic violences,
        an ebb and flow of sirens.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>Taken together, these points of analysis start a conversation about how we
        might engage in computational analysis and data visualization to bear witness
        to the sonorities of black life, in both stifling and amplification. Bearing
        witness alone, however, is not enough. It is the role of the black digital
        humanist to develop, engage, and experiment with tools and methodologies that
        are in the service of black life. Here I have utilized spectrogram films to
        emphasize the ubiquity of black sound, considered how we might imagine the
        sonic life of a day in a particular gentrifying space, and used long-term
        analysis to consider gentrifying space as a series of potential sonic traumas.
        The intention of this work is to arrive at an aurality that disrupts and
        outright rejects the everyday violences imposed onto black people.</p>
        <p>This work has many applications and futures. In legislative arenas,
        lawmakers across the country decide acceptable decibel levels for city
        musicians and gatherings. Understanding the connections between sonic datasets
        and the racialization of sound could lead to more humanely written policies
        that do not foreground punitive measures for perceived sonic offenses. In
        addition to policy work, this work also calls for black DH to be recognized
        as a leader in the building of an anti-racist future. Following the lead of
        the Data for Back Lives Collective, I believe that research in big data should
        emphasize approaches to do no (additional) harm. Finally, this work needs to
        be of use for members of communities that are being silenced, be it through
        rigorous research that deconstructs the seemingly infallible connection
        between blackness, loudness, and criminality or through infrastructure and
        support for utilizing soundscape analysis to bolster the sonic health of a
        neighborhood.</p>
