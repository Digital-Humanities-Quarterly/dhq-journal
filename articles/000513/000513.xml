        <p>In this article, I outline a method of combining ethnography and computational soundscape
          analysis in order to listen to processes of gentrification in Washington, DC. I utilize
          Kaleidoscope Pro, a software suite built to visualize and cluster bioacoustic recordings
          (typically birds and bats) to cluster points of tension in the soundscape of Shaw, a
          rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in DC. Clustering and visualizing these sounds (which
          include car horns, sirens, public transportation, and music) makes audible the sonic
          markers of gentrification in Shaw. Furthermore, listening to gentrification is a call to
          engage with the sonic right to the city, histories of legislating sound, and sonorities of
          memory and nostalgia. This work contributes to the burgeoning black digital humanities
          canon by thinking through how computational methods can help us to hear black life.
          Although the digital humanities have turned to embrace the sonic in recent years, there is
          still much to be done in considering how to embrace the aural in DH work. This project
          invites us to listen closely to a changing neighborhood, and emphasizes sound as a valid
          mode of knowledge production, questioning how a sonic rendering of gentrifying space
          through the digital might move us toward more equitable soundscapes.</p>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>Gentrification is a sonic phenomenon. As cities across the globe reinvest in previously
          disenfranchised neighborhoods and invite middle-and upper-class residents to build
          communities in their own images, the sonic characters of these neighborhoods are shifting
          as well. Some neighborhoods become louder, newly formed nightlife hubs where incoming
          partygoers care little for residential sleep schedules. Others become quieter, as new
          residents enforce particular sonic expectations onto long-term residents. These shifts
          are, as sound is, enmeshed in complex histories of race, gender, class, sexuality, and
          ability, and documenting these sonic shifts has the potential to help us imagine and
          create more equitable soundscapes.</p>
        <p>In 2018, I was thinking through the possibilities of using the digital humanities to
          listen to gentrification in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington D.C. My analysis of the
          sonic dimensions of gentrification in D.C. is couched in histories of policing black
          sound, from the black codes of the 19th century to the city's recent #DontMuteDC movement,
          which has fundamentally shifted the city's public conversation surrounding gentrification
          and black cultural displacement. The black codes, laws passed in the early 19th century,
          dictated in cruel detail what was legal or illegal in the life of black people, both freed
          and enslaved. They included several laws about the legality of black gatherings, which had
          to be approved and supervised by white men of authority (largely police), and imposed
          limits on the number of people that could gather and at what times <ptr
            target="#snethen1848"/>. Over 100 years later, traces of the restrictive black codes are
          still present in D.C. and in cities across the country.</p>
        <p>In April of 2019, the #DontMuteDC Movement originated at one particular intersection in
          D.C., at the corner of 7th Street and Florida Avenue Northwest. 7th and Florida is home to
          "Central Communications," a MetroPCS cell phone store whose owner, Donald Campbell, plays
          go-go music from large storefront speakers during business hours. Go-go music is D.C.'s
          local subgenre of funk, pioneered in the 1970s by bands such as Chuck Brown and the Soul
          Searchers, Trouble Funk, and The Young Senators. Characterized by energetic live
          performance, intense rhythmic grooves, and ample audience participation, go-go music has
          been the sound of working-class black D.C. for over 40 years. Go-go became the catalyst
          for the #dontmuteDC movement because of complaints leveled at the store by new residents
          who threatened to sue T-Mobile, MetroPCS's parent company, if the music was not turned
          off. Public outcry and swift organizing forced T-Mobile to allow the go-go music to
          continue, but the intersection remains the epicenter of conversations regarding
          gentrification and the silencing of black sonic life. Despite the positive outcome, this
          is what gentrification in Washington, D.C. sounds like: increased tensions surrounding the
          role of sound, music, and noise in "public" space.</p>
        <p>In this article, I demonstrate the potential of the computational methods to hear
          gentrification., using a combination of ethnography, passive acoustic recording, and
          computational sound analysis. My focus here is the intersection of 7th and Florida, which
          is located in the rapidly gentrifying Shaw neighborhood of Washington D.C.. This recording
          and subsequent computational analysis is a part of my larger project of exploring how
          black people hear gentrification in D.C., and contributes to the black digital humanities
          by thinking through how digital tools can transform how we hear black life. Furthermore,
          while the digital humanities have turned toward the sonic in recent years, there is still
          much to be done to embrace aurality in the field. The project invites us to listen closely
          to a changing neighborhood, and emphasizes sound as an essential mode of knowledge
          production, all the while arguing that a sonic rendering of gentrifying space through the
          digital has the potential to move us toward more equitable soundscapes.</p>
        <p>As I listen to 7th Street and Florida Avenue and the broader D.C. area, I hear continued
          attempts to silence of black music and sound through the threat of legal action,
          legislation, and the everyday criminalization of black people. In the same space, I also
          hear the flourishing of black sonic life in all its forms, from the quiet interior to
          raucous protest. In engaging sound in this way, we might imagine a soundscape in which any
          and all aural manifestations of blackness might be welcomed and not policed in the ways
          that they have been for centuries. Engaging with computational sonic methods leads us to a
          fuller understanding, articulation, and speculation of the auralities of black life, so
          that we might listen in and through and against gentrifying forces.</p>

        <head>Digital Humanities and Black Sound</head>
        <p>Although the digital humanities consideration of sound has been behind that of other
          fields, there are a number of scholars and thinkers whose projects treat sound as data
          within the realm of DH. Most influential for this project has been those that engage black
          digital humanities discourses as well as those that engage in large sonic datasets from a
          computational perspective. This combination of perspectives is critical because of big
          data's potential to harm marginalized communities, particularly black people. At the
          forefront of these conversations is the 2019 volume <emph>Digital Sound Studies,</emph>
          published by Mary Caton Lingold, Darren Mueller, and Whitney Trettian. Acknowledging early
          on that Black Studies has been on the vanguard of sound studies since its inception,
          Lingold et al. set the tone for what a sonic digital humanities can be, considering a
          variety of projects from Jennifer Stoever's foundational blog "Sounding Out!" to Myron
          Beasley's attention to how Zora Neale Hurston's voice might remix the archive. The volume
          argues that "while digital media thus create a space of possibility for the study of
          sound, critical, interpretive labor fulfills this potential, not the technology itself,"
          reinforcing the critical potential of sonic digital work when grounded in rigorous
          humanistic analysis. This reinforcement becomes ever more important as the #dontmuteDC
          movement forces the city and even the United States to have a stark conversation on the
          histories of policing black sound, and how technology might engage, unravel, and work
          against such legacies. Digital humanities and sound studies are sites in which to disrupt
          the violences of gentrification, and can do so through engaging with and against
          technological tools, from recording to machine learning.</p>
        <p>In addition to those within digital humanities, ethnomusicologists have also long been
          engaging sound and the digital. For example, Regina Bradley's "Outkasted Conversations"
          provides a digital space dedicated to the study and archiving of southern hip-hop
          scholarship, featuring interviews, essays, and syllabi all dedicated to the study of
          Atlanta's pioneering rap group Outkast. Additionally, Kyra Gaunt's scholarship on the
          exploitation of black girls on YouTube and other social media platforms is offering a deep
          dive into the sonorities of online racial and gendered oppressions. Gaunt's work, drawing
          on data from YouTube (and therefore Google) makes audible the harm enacted onto black
          girls and teenagers online, even as their content builds profits for other entities <ptr
            target="#gaunt2018"/>. These projects incorporate sound into broader datasets that also
          include text-based media, arguing for sound's presence as an integral part of multifaceted
          humanistic projects.</p>
        <p>Regarding the computational analysis of sound, Tanya Clement's work on machine learning
          and recorded sound collections has long been on the vanguard of sound work in the digital
          humanities. Her early use visualization tools such as ProseVis for the sonic analysis of
          Gertrude Stein's work has been key in developing questions of how to read sound and how to
          treat sound as data. Drawing on Johanna Drucker's "data as capta," Clement advocated early
          on for reading data visualization like musical scores, where the visualization itself is
          dependent on the observer rather than existing on its own <ptr target="#clement2013"/>.
          She also developed "High-Performance Sound Technologies for Access and Scholarship"
          (HiPSTAS), a program that leverages machine learning to generate metadata for large speech
          based aural datasets <ptr target="#clement2018"/>.</p>
        <p>Digital humanities practices in oral history have also been key to this genealogy. On the
          forefront of this work has been Doug Boyd and the Oral History in the Digital Age Project,
          where authors and contributors have advocated for pushing understandings of oral history
          practice into digital humanities conversations, from tools to capture histories to using
          recordings as data. Sharon Webb et al. have developed a minimal computing project to mine
          oral history recordings for important sonic information that is typically overlooked in
          favor of text only transcripts. Utilizing the soundscapes of the recording themselves has
          the potential to help researchers work through issues of gender, silence, emotion, and
          other factors that are lost within the production of the transcript <ptr
            target="#webb2017"/>. These projects that consider how engaging in the work of signal
          processing and managing a large sonic dataset move us toward a broader potential for
          archival recordings, particularly those based in speech.</p>
        <p>My intervention into this conversation in sonic digital humanities is to leave behind the
          text as an anchoring force, and to create work with large sonic datasets that respects the
          call and parameters of black digital humanities, described by Kim Gallon as "the
          intersection between Black studies and digital humanities, transforming the concept into
          corporeal reality while lending language to the work of the black digerati in and outside
          of the academy" <ptr target="#gallon2016"/>. Gallon forces us to ask the question of how
          the complete premise of the digital humanities changes for a group of people who are in
          many ways, historically and contemporarily, not considered human. Engaging with my own
          dataset, then, is always a question of amplifying black life. In the case of listening to
          gentrification in Washington, D.C., I have had to consider how both the creation and
          analysis of a large sonic dataset might engage the aural to disrupt visual narratives of
          gentrification, which emphasize dramatic change, displacement, and erasure <ptr
            target="#parham2007"/>.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Methodology</head>
        <p>I conducted the majority of the fieldwork for this project in Washington, D.C. between
          2016 and 2018, employing three interwoven methodologies: interviews, participant
          observation, and passive acoustic recording. I engaged this combination of methodologies
          in order to arrive at a kind of "thick data" <ptr target="#wang2013"/>. Thick data
          combines Geertz's thick description with the big data that is often central to digital
          humanities conversations, aiming for a generative kind of movement between the macro and
          the micro, which was essential for this project. During fieldwork, I was interested in
          telling the stories of individuals, places, and songs through interviews and
          participant-observation, but also in listening to change over time and detecting broader
          patterns that only a vast number of soundscape recordings could provide. Approaching sound
          in "multiple registers" consistently allowed me to engage more meaningfully with the
          ethnographic and the computational aspects of the project.</p>
        <p>I conducted dozens of interviews with a wide range of conversation partners: musicians,
          local neighborhood officials, church members, business owners, and residents. These
          interviews were typically semi structured conversations, drawing on a mix of my own
          questions related to sonic impressions of the neighborhood as well as stories that people
          were willing to share. Gaining access to interviews was often an exercise of positioning
          myself in layers, typically beginning with my "official" classification as a PhD student
          or Smithsonian intern working on a project focused on neighborhood change. Language was
          important here, as "gentrification" carries different connotations than "neighborhood
          change" in local discourses. Neighborhood change is a less racially charged term than
          gentrification, with the former indicating that the neighborhood has undergone some
          development and the latter insinuating that the development can be blamed on a particular
          group of (white) people. At a neighborhood association meeting, I once described my
          project to a black resident of Maryland as being about "gentrification and sound," and he
          remarked that it was very interesting, "because of that word that you just used," rather
          than repeating it himself. I moved between the two terms as the project unfolded, often
          times mirroring the vocabulary of my interlocuters.</p>
        <p>Two other layers of identification were key in gaining access to interviews: my blackness
          as well as my being from Prince George's County, Maryland, located directly east of the
          city. Because of the exploitative legacies of fields such as ethnomusicology, sociology,
          and anthropology, communities of color often exercise a legitimate skepticism with outside
          researchers, no matter their racial identity <ptr target="#mcdougal2014"/>. During phone
          calls to solicit interviews, I noticed that I was code switching more than usual, drawing
          out my D.C. accent in order to be heard and coded as a black woman from the area, working
          against the violent legacy of my discipline. In this way I was both insider and outsider
          for the duration of the project, at home in my proximity, racial identity, and family ties
          to the city yet distant in my academic training. Even as I did fieldwork in places very
          familiar to me, I was always an outsider just by virtue of doing the fieldwork <ptr
            target="#wong2008"/>.</p>
        <p>I articulate these layers in order to complicate the notion of "fieldwork at home," which
          has been inconsistently theorized in ethnomusicology and is so often conducted by people
          of color. As Mellonee Burnim has argued, shared racial or ethnic identity with a group of
          people does not automatically create a culture-bearer. Regarding her fieldwork on gospel
          music, she emphasizes that her racial identity is not the only reason why she was trusted
          in her various research sites, but also because she was a culture-bearer within the gospel
          music tradition, and was able to offer these churches her skills as a musician in return
          for conducting research <ptr target="#burnim1985"/>. My blackness, then, did not always
          endear people to me. Fieldwork for me was at home but-not-home, where I was often familiar
          with the people and places around me but had arrived with a new set of expectations and
          questions that required me to become an outsider.</p>
        <p>Participant observation for this project involved attending musical performances,
          neighborhood meetings, rallies, and protests. At these events, I was typically most
          interested in sound sources and tensions surrounding them. For example, at an Advisory
          Neighborhood Commission (ANC) meeting one evening, half the attendees left the event
          halfway through because their hot-button agenda item had been completed. They then
          proceeded to be so loud in the hallway that one of the commissioners running the meeting
          had to step out to tell them to be quiet, reminding them that there were still more items
          on the agenda besides theirs. These tensions, stemming from who is able to be heard and
          whose sounds or voice are deemed important, were central for the project. Furthermore,
          many of my observations were digital rather than in person; I listened to online radio,
          watched Facebook and Twitter videos, and watched live streams of D.C. City Council
          Hearings. In this way, my ethnography was necessarily digital because many of the city's
          conversations on gentrification are happening online, both privately and publicly. As a
          result, I was thinking across multiple forms and formats of sound.</p>
        <p>Passive acoustic recording was the most unconventional method for the project, because it
          is most often used to listen to bioacoustic changes in environments coded as "natural,"
          such as forests or underwater to listen to marine life. However, this method of long-term
          passive acoustic recording has been established as an effective way of detecting patterns
          and changes in a large number of soundscapes <ptr target="#pijanowski2011"/>. I was
          inspired by a colleague's work in the Ecuadorian cloud forest to transfer the methodology
          to the heart of Washington, D.C., applying a few modifications but utilizing the same
          recording equipment. For the duration of the project, I utilized two Wildlife Acoustics
          Song Meter SM4 recorders, described by the manufacturers as "a compact, weatherproof,
          dual-channel acoustic recorder capable of long-term acoustic monitoring of birds, frogs,
          insects, and aquatic life." <note>In my initial curiosity about the potential of these
            recorders for listening to gentrification, I called Wildlife Acoustics and asked a
            general question what the recorders would be able to hear. The man I spoke to then asked
            me what I was trying to hear, and my response of "gentrification" audibly threw him off.
            He did admit, though, that they can pick up "everything."</note>
          <ptr target="#wildlife"/>.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, this passive acoustic recording was carefully intertwined with
          ethnography, because I chose to install the recorders on two building rooftops in and
          around the intersection of 7th and Florida. Acoustically, rooftops offer the best vantage
          point for urban passive acoustic recording. In order to install the recorders, I first had
          to receive permission from the owners of those particular buildings (one a church and one
          a church office), both of whom agreed after an interview with me. This agreement also came
          with the promise of letting me inside and on the rooves once a month to download data and
          change the batteries for the recorders, which allowed me to get to know various office
          staffs and grounded this project in people, rather than soundscape data. The first rooftop
          was about five stories off the ground, and covered with solar panels. In March of 2018, I
          hung the first recorder, nestled in a wooden arm, off of the southwestern edge of the
          roof, so as to be directed towards the intersection of 7th street and Florida Avenue. I
          installed the second recorder in May over a third-floor balcony in the intersection. Both
          recorders captured one minute out of every five minutes all day, every day. That
          resulted in 288 recordings per day, per recorder. The final tally of over 100,000
          recordings is nearly impossible to listen or analyze manually, and yet the possibilities
          for the dataset seem endless.</p>
        <p>While the go-go music at Central Communications is certainly the defining element of 7th
          and Florida, there are a number of other features that provide a rich space for a cultural
          soundscape study. Given its proximity to the Historically Black College/University Howard
          University, the intersection is heavily trafficked by students, residents, and people who
          work in the nearby Howard University Hospital. The northern half of the intersection is
          home to a florist, beauty supply store, restaurant, and church offices. At the southwest
          corner of the intersection is a CVS pharmacy owned by Howard University, complete with a
          small parking lot that is always at least half full of cars. In addition to these
          businesses, there are Metro Bus stops at the southwest and northeast corners of the
          intersection, where people constantly mill about and wait for the bus. In addition to foot
          traffic, 7th and Florida is one of the busiest intersections in the city for vehicular
          traffic, also ranked in the top 10 dangerous intersections for drivers between 2015 and
          2018 <ptr target="#smith2018"/>. Where Florida Avenue continues west directly to the U
          Street Corridor and into a busy nightlife district, 7th Street southbound leads to the
          Chinatown/Gallery-Place neighborhood, comparable to a smaller version of New York City's
          Times Square. The result is a bustling junction that is never silent, if only for the
          crosswalk signal that beeps 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>Engaging 100,000 raw .wav files required a healthy amount of data cleaning, an essential
          and time-consuming phase of every digital humanities project. Data cleaning is generally
          understood as the manipulation of a raw dataset (sound, text, images, etc.) into a more
          categorized, segmented, and manageable whole. When it comes to projects based in
          humanistic inquiry, though, data cleaning in and of itself is contested. The language of
          cleaning data implies that "things already have a rightful place, but they're not in it"
            <ptr target="#rawson2016"/>. The practice of putting data into categories is an
          imposition, and requires the questioning of the categories themselves. In my work, I treat
          listening as a speculative method, following Deborah Kapchan's call for scholars to
          "release our hold on intellective knowledge (with its drives to categorize, objectify, and
          subjugate)" <ptr target="#kapchan2017"/>. Similarly, I seek a mode of knowledge production
          through the aural that speculates without being ahistorical, and listens with the intent
          of amplification rather than categorization. This type of speculative engagement with
          sound led to a flexibility within both data cleaning and analysis, where I engaged in
          different levels of cleaning depending on the particular goal of the project in that
          moment. The disruption of visual narratives of gentrification, which emphasize
          displacement and measurable outcome, lies here in the slippage between the speculative and
          the categorizable. My intention in questioning the process of data cleaning is not to
          arrive at a perfect solution of how to categorize data, but instead to use both necessary
          processes of categorization and speculation to interrupt prevalent narratives of loss.</p>
        <p>Tanya Clement describes computational sound analysis as a question of compromises
          balanced amidst an exercise in imagination <ptr target="#clement2018"/>. Sound is
          ephemeral, difficult to track, and contains variants that text-based data does not.
          However, in order to engage in large scale analysis, some level of categorization is
          indeed required for a sonic data set. In the case of the data from the recorders, I went
          through a trial and error process in order to clean the data, beginning with Kaleidoscope,
          the software suite built by Wildlife Acoustics in order to visualize and classify the data
          from their Song Meter recorders. The software features a number of different functions,
          including a spectrogram to visualize data, a clustering mechanism to group like
          recordings, and a noise analysis tool. I began working with the data month by month, as my
          data was already organized in this schema because I ascended the rooftops monthly to
          download data and change the batteries on the recorders.</p>
        <p>In order to train the data set, I first ran a month's worth of data through
          Kaleidoscope's unsupervised classifier, which allows the algorithm to group the recordings
          into unnamed clusters based on similarities in frequency and timing. This classification
          is conducted through Fast Fourier Transform, an algorithm that decomposes complex
          frequencies. With these base classifiers in hand, I then went through manually and
          "tagged" clips within my own named clusters, which included the following: brakes, bus
          hiss, backup beeps, music, voices, and sirens. I developed this final set of categories
          through trial and error, and then went through to only tag the best examples of these
          sounds. I then re-ran the classifier with the same data to only include the clips that I
          tagged. This second .csv file then becomes the training set. Finally, I ran a new set of
          data under a supervised classification, using the second .csv file that I named as the
          training set. This then produces a results page that clusters the data based on my
          training set, and is fairly accurate within a set distribution.</p>
        <p>I trained the dataset at least three different times, working towards what I considered
          the best result for my research questions and within the ethical limitations I set for
          myself. One of the primary dilemmas during this process was the inclusion of voices as a
          tagged component. Surveillance is a fact of blackness, and keeping this in mind, this
          project has required careful consideration about the legacy of surveillance that weighs on
          black people across the diaspora <ptr target="#browne2015"/>. I was therefore determined
          to ignore potential identifiers in the data, and purposely "cleaned" in such a way that
          would obscure conversation rather than identify it. In fact, the only reason I classified
          voices at all was just to be able to train the classifier to be able to listen to go-go
          music, which contains a great deal of spoken vocals and rapping from lead
            talkers.<note>Lead talkers of go-go bands serve as bandleaders as well as the principle
            connection between band and audience. They talk to people in the front, give shout outs,
            call out neighborhoods, etc.</note> After solidifying the training set, I was then able
          to run all nine months of data from both recorders through Kaleidoscope. After further
          cleaning the final spreadsheet to only include the relevant information, I uploaded this
          spreadsheet into Sequel Pro, a database management application used for working with
          Structured Query Language (SQL) databases. Working with SQL and Indiana University's
          supercomputing support, I was then able to write queries for the larger dataset, getting
          back to those crucial questions about gentrification, race, and sound.</p>

        <head>Analysis</head>
        <p>Drawing on this extended cleaning process as well as other methods of sonic
          representation, I offer a tripartite analysis of the soundscape data here, focused at
          different levels of scope to engage a variety of aural insights in a gentrifying
          intersection. I begin with close listenings, because even amid the possibilities of large
          scale machine learning, there is still room for and urgency within both traditional and
          computationally informed close listenings. By computationally informed close listening, I
          am referring to a kind of deep engagement with and interpretation of a sound source that
          stems from mediation types other than listening from a standard playback device. In this
          case, I facilitate close listenings via spectrograms, which are visual representations of
          sound that mark frequency and amplitude over an x axis of time. Utilizing the Google
          Chrome Music Lab's Spectrogram tool, I include here a short spectrogram film from the
          intersection, featuring the sounds from the intersection as well as my own annotations
            (<ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>).</p>
        <p>In this video, a spectrogram moves left to right in time, with sounds identified by color
          and 3-D intensification based on their frequency and loudness in relation to the sounds
          around them. In this short clip, I have annotated the sounds that are most recognizable in
          the intersection: go-go music, the hiss and beep of a Metro bus, and a siren. These sounds
          offer a striking visual representation of the collection of sounds in the
          intersection.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">

          <media mimeType="video/mp4" url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/508242911"/>
        </figure>
        <p>In addition to clips such as these, I also engage in more traditional ethnographic
          descriptions drawn from my time as a participant-observer in the intersection. Take, for
          example, an ethnographic sketch of an August evening in 2018:</p>
        <cit>
          <quote rend="block">As I sit down at the bus stop, a driver is honking intensely as they
            go through the intersection, practically laying on their horn. There is also a black
            woman's voice rapping N.E.R.D.'s "Lemon" from the speaker in front of Central
            Communications. A black man, who is actually in the intersection, is rapping along, but
            with different words. They're both rapping over a go-go pocket beat, and cars are
            driving by. A heavy engine idles at the intersection, then accelerates after the light
            turns green. As vehicles drive past, the pocket beat remains. In the distance, there is
            a siren blaring for a few moments, though it never passes directly through the
            intersection. The man in the intersection that was rapping along with the woman on the
            speaker has begun to rap on his own, because the speakers are currently on the
            breakdown, and there are no voices on the pocket now. He raps, "Lock It, Lock it in the
            Pocket," on repeat. His voice is momentarily drowned out by another heavy engine, but
            upon it leaving the intersection he seems to have moved on to rapping, "get money, get
            money." More engines, more brakes, more horns. The song changes, seemingly beginning a
            new set altogether. Now the song is a go-go cover of Frankie Beverly and Maze's "Before
            I Let Go." The man that was rapping is now saying "Hey baby, hey baby," but it's unclear
            who he's addressing. A metrobus stops, with its customary hiss-and-beep combination. A
            woman's disembodied voice comes from the bus, announcing that "the base fare is two
            dollars." She sounds like Siri. While trucks idle at the traffic light, the music is
            muffled.</quote>
        </cit>
        <p>This sketch is drawn from my time sitting one of the bus stops in the intersection,
          watching the passersby, and occasionally speaking with people. On this particular day, all
          of the people that lingered in the intersection, including myself, were black, and we
          existed as and within the boundaries of a porous space that people moved through to get to
          their next destination. For many of us, the intersection serves as a destination in and of
          itself, a place to come and exist outside in public space.</p>
        <p>How can the combination of a narrative close listening and a spectrogram film that
          approaches the granular help us to articulate the sonorities of gentrification? While many
          studies and narratives of gentrification emphasize displacement and loss, these sonic
          materials assert the enduring presence of black life in the intersection. I posit here
          that all of these sounds, from the bus stop to the siren to the go-go music, are "black
          sounds." The bus network is an important facet of black working life and labor in D.C.,
          and sirens are closely connected to the same notions of policing and criminality that
          frame core conceptions of blackness <ptr target="#summers2019"/>. So as these
          neighborhoods become visually unrecognizable, their soundscapes remain discernable as a
          space in which black people exist. As gentrification threatens to erase all memory of a
          black D.C., the sonic footprint of a space on a granular level serves as an important
          timestamp and a refusal to be overlooked.</p>
        <p>These materials are an exercise in amalgamation, where all of the elements of the
          intersection are displayed and contemplated together. As I have conducted this analysis
          parallel to the rise of the #dontmuteDC movement, I understand this amalgamation to be a
          contribution to the amplification of black sonic life in that space. I argue that this
          close listening emphasizes the immersion of black sound in the intersection. The sounds
          are not neatly stacked or delineated individually but rather all incorporated together, as
          they are heard in the intersection. Spectrograms and ethnographic sketches support the
          assertions of the #dontmuteDC movement, namely that black music, in turn black people, are
          a foundational part of 7th and Florida, and cannot be silenced or removed because someone
          deems them too loud, too noisy, or too much of a nuisance.</p>
        <p>The final advantage to these close examinations of sound in the intersection lies in
          their combined elements. The spectrogram offers a visual narrative of sound that an
          ethnographic sketch alone cannot support in part because of the hierarchy of the senses
          which presumes visual evidence to be more true than sonic or narrative. And yet, the
          unreliability of my own narrative allows for the inclusion of more detailed information.
          For example, my description of the man's rapping is important here: his familiarity with
          the space and demonstration of go-go music's intertextuality is emblematic of the complex
          layers of sound in the intersection. But, I choose not to include the audio of that
          recording because it serves as a potential identifier, and my emphasis on black digital
          humanities does not allow me to intentionally surveil or put a black person in harm's way.
          These two modes of listening, then, together move us closer toward a sonic interpretation
          of gentrifying space and a more equitable soundscape the rejects the violence of
          surveillance as evidence.</p>
        <p>My next level of analysis zooms out to focus on particular days rather than minutes,
          represented by a 24 hour timeline built with Microsoft's Timeline Storyteller. Several
          days are important to the life of this intersection, from major holidays to the first day
          of each month, which is a popular day for many to go to Central Communications to pay
          their phone bills. Here I offer a 24-hour look at July 4th, 2018, which features
          commentary about the various sounds heard on that day, from sirens to fireworks, which are
          common within the neighborhood as well as on the National Mall (See <ref
            target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>).</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure02">
          <head>4th of July at Seventh and Florida</head>
          <media mimeType="video/mp4" url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/508243017"/>
        </figure>
        <p>In this timeline, hours of the day are represented by rectangular blocks that move
          clockwise beginning at 12 midnight. The beginning of the day, then, visually, is actually
          late in the night. These hour blocks are delineated in larger groups of three hours that
          mark time around a standard 24-hour day. In this representation, the only space
          continuously filled is that of the beeping crosswalk. While crosswalks are known to beep
          for accessibility purposes, this one in particular sounds throughout the day without
          prompting, inserting itself as the most consistent sound in the recording process. The
          consistent beeping of the intersection offers up a glimpse into a broader conversation
          about sound, gentrification, and accessibility, as the intersection serves a large
          population of disabled people. Go-go music, as per usual, begins at 10am when Central
          Communications opens, ending at 6pm which is earlier than its usual 8pm close but
          reasonable because of the holiday. Car horns are present throughout the day, as 7th and
          Florida is a busy vehicular and pedestrian intersection in the city. I offer "music" in
          the representation here distinct from "go-go music" and "club bass" to encompass the
          myriad of other types of musical expression that permeate the intersection, from people
          playing music on their phones as they pass through or the radio that spills out of cars
          that idle at red lights. For the remainder of the evening and into the night, sirens and
          fireworks crisscross each other in the timeline, giving the impression of a loud and busy
          night. Club bass is an interesting swatch in the timeline, present briefly in the late
          afternoon before asserting a more sustained presence from 12am-3am. Bass is more visible
          here than audible in actual recordings, because of the low frequencies spilling out of the
          club. Bass is felt, rather than heard, in most instances, and visual representation of
          such a consistent frequency is helpful here because many noise complaints (whether overtly
          racialized or not) begin and end with bass being too loud.</p>
        <p>I chose the 4th of July as a site for analysis because of the frictions between federal
          and local life in Washington, D.C. The 4th of July is perhaps the city's most popular
          holiday, where tourists flock in to visit national museums by day and enjoy fireworks by
          night. However, amid national festivities lie a city that is characterized by its lack of
          statehood, a drastic wealth gap, and a vibrant local cultural life. This timeline provides
          sonic entry into these tensions, noting how the neighborhood shifts because of the
          holiday, but also maintains its own character and traditions, in this case the go-go music
          at Central Communications.</p>
        <p>This circle timeline offers a grammar of audibility in the intersection through the unit
          of a day, a way of hearing the space that acknowledges patterns and routines but does not
          obscure or leave behind the sonic messiness of the day. Although gentrification is often
          considered primarily in longitudinal capacities, the unit of the everyday remains an
          incredibly useful metric of analysis. As de Certeau argued in "Walking in the City," the
          city is made by those that walk every day, made not from looking down from the empire
          state building and mapping the urban as city blocks, but instead in the compilation of
          those steps <ptr target="#certeau1984"/>. There is a hubris in the longitudinal that I use
          the day to avoid and to disrupt. As Amira Baraka wrote about tradition, this is the
          changing same <ptr target="#baraka1991"/>. Much of the gentrification story is not about
          what changes, but what stays the same. The crosswalk beeps, the music plays, the sirens
          wail.</p>
        <p>My final level of analysis, which is most dependent on that initial data cleaning
          process, scales back even further to think about gentrification across a series of months
          in the intersection. In this section, I consider data over the course of the months long
          period in which the recorders were installed. Gentrification is, on the surface, a problem
          of time. If I had wanted to hear gentrification over time in a purely longitudinal way, I
          would have needed to install the recorders in 2008 or 1998 instead of 2018. But this is a
          case, perhaps even a call, to lean in to the limitations of a dataset. What can nine
          months tell us about an intersection? What can this interval of time give us about a
          space? Does this period function only in anticipation of a longer, future dataset, or is
          there something to learn in listening to these months as incidents themselves?</p>
        <p>I draw on sirens here as an example, which operate as both icon and index of a broader
          urban imaginary <ptr target="#jones2017"/>. Sirens, depending on their source, can signal
          crime, emergencies, crises, danger, impending violence, even terror <ptr
            target="#stone2014"/>. Both interviews and informal conversations led me to understand
          sirens as a powerful indicator of a neighborhoods crime status, with some of my
          conversation partners sharing that they heard less sirens as the neighborhood around 7th
          and Florida gentrified. Furthermore, this decrease in sirens was often interpreted as a
          decrease in criminal activity. I was therefore interested in tracking the presence of
          sirens across time at 7th and Florida, and offer here a brief representation of that
          pursuit (See <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>).</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure03">
          <head>Siren Counts at Seventh and Florida</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>This simple line chart shows sirens from July to October of 2018, and displays the
          frequency of detected sirens every day.<note>Because the recorders only recorded one
            minute out of every five, it's important to note that this is not every siren.</note> A
          number of insights arise from the chart. The peaks and valleys here are often indicative
          of the number of people active in the space on any given day. For example, most peaks,
          where the recorder detected 20+ sirens, were on weekends, typically Fridays and Saturdays.
          Days with the least number of sirens often corresponded with difficult weather patterns,
          from heavy rain to thunderstorms. Looking across the longer four month period, from July
          to October, there is a noticeable decrease in sirens as the season turns from summer to
          fall. This decrease is consistent with two narratives of a gentrifying city: The first is
          that crime levels peak during summer months because summers are hot, in terms of both heat
          and criminal activity. The second narrative is that crime decreases over time in
          gentrifying neighborhoods, as the crime rate in D.C. has attested to. My intervention lies
          in the disruption of these narratives, however true they may be. Gentrification is not a
          linear, gradual process of displacement. Gentrification is a series of jagged
          interruptions, community meetings, demolitions, protests, contracts, construction
          projects, and violence.</p>
        <p>In carrying connotations of crime and loudness, sirens exist within a nexus of aural
          indicators of race, criminality, and urban life. Sirens are so closely molded to black
          urban life because they are indicative and representative of those forces that have deemed
          themselves in control of black life, particularly the police. The chart here details the
          pattern of sirens in the intersection, offering a visual experience of what it is to exist
          in a space in which blackness has been marked as existent and available. I read this
          pattern as a demonstration of the cycle of potential sonic traumas that come through the
          intersection every day, sometimes dozens of times a day: of policing, terror, emergency,
          and health crises. This chart disrupts a visual narrative of gentrification, in which
          neighborhoods become better and more beautiful looking because it repositions
          gentrification as a cyclical process of sonic violences, an ebb and flow of sirens.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>Taken together, these points of analysis start a conversation about how we might engage
          in computational analysis and data visualization to bear witness to the sonorities of
          black life, in both stifling and amplification. Bearing witness alone, however, is not
          enough. It is the role of the black digital humanist to develop, engage, and experiment
          with tools and methodologies that are in the service of black life. Here I have utilized
          spectrogram films to emphasize the ubiquity of black sound, considered how we might
          imagine the sonic life of a day in a particular gentrifying space, and used long-term
          analysis to consider gentrifying space as a series of potential sonic traumas. The
          intention of this work is to arrive at an aurality that disrupts and outright rejects the
          everyday violences imposed onto black people.</p>
        <p>This work has many applications and futures. In legislative arenas, lawmakers across the
          country decide acceptable decibel levels for city musicians and gatherings. Understanding
          the connections between sonic datasets and the racialization of sound could lead to more
          humanely written policies that do not foreground punitive measures for perceived sonic
          offenses. In addition to policy work, this work also calls for black DH to be recognized
          as a leader in the building of an anti-racist future. Following the lead of the Data for
          Back Lives Collective, I believe that research in big data should emphasize approaches to
          do no (additional) harm. Finally, this work needs to be of use for members of communities
          that are being silenced, be it through rigorous research that deconstructs the seemingly
          infallible connection between blackness, loudness, and criminality or through
          infrastructure and support for utilizing soundscape analysis to bolster the sonic health
          of a neighborhood.</p>
