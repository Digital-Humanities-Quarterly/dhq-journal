                  <p>In this article, I outline a method of combining ethnography and computational soundscape
                     analysis in order to listen to processes of gentrification in Washington, DC. I utilize
                     Kaleidoscope Pro, a software suite built to visualize and cluster bioacoustic recordings
                     (typically birds and bats) to cluster points of tension in the soundscape of Shaw,
                     a
                     rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in DC. Clustering and visualizing these sounds (which
                     include car horns, sirens, public transportation, and music) makes audible the sonic
                     markers of gentrification in Shaw. Furthermore, listening to gentrification is a call
                     to
                     engage with the sonic right to the city, histories of legislating sound, and sonorities
                     of
                     memory and nostalgia. This work contributes to the burgeoning black digital humanities
                     canon by thinking through how computational methods can help us to hear black life.
                     Although the digital humanities have turned to embrace the sonic in recent years,
                     there is
                     still much to be done in considering how to embrace the aural in DH work. This project
                     invites us to listen closely to a changing neighborhood, and emphasizes sound as a
                     valid
                     mode of knowledge production, questioning how a sonic rendering of gentrifying space
                     through the digital might move us toward more equitable soundscapes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Gentrification is a sonic phenomenon. As cities across the globe reinvest in previously
                     disenfranchised neighborhoods and invite middle-and upper-class residents to build
                     communities in their own images, the sonic characters of these neighborhoods are shifting
                     as well. Some neighborhoods become louder, newly formed nightlife hubs where incoming
                     partygoers care little for residential sleep schedules. Others become quieter, as
                     new
                     residents enforce particular sonic expectations onto long-term residents. These shifts
                     are, as sound is, enmeshed in complex histories of race, gender, class, sexuality,
                     and
                     ability, and documenting these sonic shifts has the potential to help us imagine and
                     create more equitable soundscapes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In 2018, I was thinking through the possibilities of using the digital humanities
                     to
                     listen to gentrification in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington D.C. My analysis of
                     the
                     sonic dimensions of gentrification in D.C. is couched in histories of policing black
                     sound, from the black codes of the 19th century to the city's recent #DontMuteDC movement,
                     which has fundamentally shifted the city's public conversation surrounding gentrification
                     and black cultural displacement. The black codes, laws passed in the early 19th century,
                     dictated in cruel detail what was legal or illegal in the life of black people, both
                     freed
                     and enslaved. They included several laws about the legality of black gatherings, which
                     had
                     to be approved and supervised by white men of authority (largely police), and imposed
                     limits on the number of people that could gather and at what times [<a class="ref" href="#snethen1848">Snethen 1848</a>]. Over 100 years later, traces of the restrictive black codes are
                     still present in D.C. and in cities across the country.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In April of 2019, the #DontMuteDC Movement originated at one particular intersection
                     in
                     D.C., at the corner of 7th Street and Florida Avenue Northwest. 7th and Florida is
                     home to
                     "Central Communications," a MetroPCS cell phone store whose owner, Donald Campbell,
                     plays
                     go-go music from large storefront speakers during business hours. Go-go music is D.C.'s
                     local subgenre of funk, pioneered in the 1970s by bands such as Chuck Brown and the
                     Soul
                     Searchers, Trouble Funk, and The Young Senators. Characterized by energetic live
                     performance, intense rhythmic grooves, and ample audience participation, go-go music
                     has
                     been the sound of working-class black D.C. for over 40 years. Go-go became the catalyst
                     for the #dontmuteDC movement because of complaints leveled at the store by new residents
                     who threatened to sue T-Mobile, MetroPCS's parent company, if the music was not turned
                     off. Public outcry and swift organizing forced T-Mobile to allow the go-go music to
                     continue, but the intersection remains the epicenter of conversations regarding
                     gentrification and the silencing of black sonic life. Despite the positive outcome,
                     this
                     is what gentrification in Washington, D.C. sounds like: increased tensions surrounding
                     the
                     role of sound, music, and noise in "public" space.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In this article, I demonstrate the potential of the computational methods to hear
                     gentrification., using a combination of ethnography, passive acoustic recording, and
                     computational sound analysis. My focus here is the intersection of 7th and Florida,
                     which
                     is located in the rapidly gentrifying Shaw neighborhood of Washington D.C.. This recording
                     and subsequent computational analysis is a part of my larger project of exploring
                     how
                     black people hear gentrification in D.C., and contributes to the black digital humanities
                     by thinking through how digital tools can transform how we hear black life. Furthermore,
                     while the digital humanities have turned toward the sonic in recent years, there is
                     still
                     much to be done to embrace aurality in the field. The project invites us to listen
                     closely
                     to a changing neighborhood, and emphasizes sound as an essential mode of knowledge
                     production, all the while arguing that a sonic rendering of gentrifying space through
                     the
                     digital has the potential to move us toward more equitable soundscapes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">As I listen to 7th Street and Florida Avenue and the broader D.C. area, I hear continued
                     attempts to silence of black music and sound through the threat of legal action,
                     legislation, and the everyday criminalization of black people. In the same space,
                     I also
                     hear the flourishing of black sonic life in all its forms, from the quiet interior
                     to
                     raucous protest. In engaging sound in this way, we might imagine a soundscape in which
                     any
                     and all aural manifestations of blackness might be welcomed and not policed in the
                     ways
                     that they have been for centuries. Engaging with computational sonic methods leads
                     us to a
                     fuller understanding, articulation, and speculation of the auralities of black life,
                     so
                     that we might listen in and through and against gentrifying forces.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Although the digital humanities consideration of sound has been behind that of other
                     fields, there are a number of scholars and thinkers whose projects treat sound as
                     data
                     within the realm of DH. Most influential for this project has been those that engage
                     black
                     digital humanities discourses as well as those that engage in large sonic datasets
                     from a
                     computational perspective. This combination of perspectives is critical because of
                     big
                     data's potential to harm marginalized communities, particularly black people. At the
                     forefront of these conversations is the 2019 volume <em class="emph">Digital Sound Studies,</em>
                     published by Mary Caton Lingold, Darren Mueller, and Whitney Trettian. Acknowledging
                     early
                     on that Black Studies has been on the vanguard of sound studies since its inception,
                     Lingold et al. set the tone for what a sonic digital humanities can be, considering
                     a
                     variety of projects from Jennifer Stoever's foundational blog "Sounding Out!" to Myron
                     Beasley's attention to how Zora Neale Hurston's voice might remix the archive. The
                     volume
                     argues that "while digital media thus create a space of possibility for the study
                     of
                     sound, critical, interpretive labor fulfills this potential, not the technology itself,"
                     reinforcing the critical potential of sonic digital work when grounded in rigorous
                     humanistic analysis. This reinforcement becomes ever more important as the #dontmuteDC
                     movement forces the city and even the United States to have a stark conversation on
                     the
                     histories of policing black sound, and how technology might engage, unravel, and work
                     against such legacies. Digital humanities and sound studies are sites in which to
                     disrupt
                     the violences of gentrification, and can do so through engaging with and against
                     technological tools, from recording to machine learning.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In addition to those within digital humanities, ethnomusicologists have also long
                     been
                     engaging sound and the digital. For example, Regina Bradley's "Outkasted Conversations"
                     provides a digital space dedicated to the study and archiving of southern hip-hop
                     scholarship, featuring interviews, essays, and syllabi all dedicated to the study
                     of
                     Atlanta's pioneering rap group Outkast. Additionally, Kyra Gaunt's scholarship on
                     the
                     exploitation of black girls on YouTube and other social media platforms is offering
                     a deep
                     dive into the sonorities of online racial and gendered oppressions. Gaunt's work,
                     drawing
                     on data from YouTube (and therefore Google) makes audible the harm enacted onto black
                     girls and teenagers online, even as their content builds profits for other entities
                     [<a class="ref" href="#gaunt2018">Gaunt 2018</a>]. These projects incorporate sound into broader datasets that also
                     include text-based media, arguing for sound's presence as an integral part of multifaceted
                     humanistic projects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Regarding the computational analysis of sound, Tanya Clement's work on machine learning
                     and recorded sound collections has long been on the vanguard of sound work in the
                     digital
                     humanities. Her early use visualization tools such as ProseVis for the sonic analysis
                     of
                     Gertrude Stein's work has been key in developing questions of how to read sound and
                     how to

                     early
                     on for reading data visualization like musical scores, where the visualization itself
                     is
                     dependent on the observer rather than existing on its own [<a class="ref" href="#clement2013">Clement 2013</a>].

                     On the

                     Project,
                     where authors and contributors have advocated for pushing understandings of oral history
                     practice into digital humanities conversations, from tools to capture histories to
                     using
                     recordings as data. Sharon Webb et al. have developed a minimal computing project
                     to mine
                     oral history recordings for important sonic information that is typically overlooked
                     in
                     favor of text only transcripts. Utilizing the soundscapes of the recording themselves
                     has
                     the potential to help researchers work through issues of gender, silence, emotion,
                     and
                     other factors that are lost within the production of the transcript [<a class="ref" href="#webb2017">Webb et al. 2017</a>]. These projects that consider how engaging in the work of signal
                     processing and managing a large sonic dataset move us toward a broader potential for

                     gentrification in Washington, D.C., I have had to consider how both the creation and

                     of

                     2016 and 2018, employing three interwoven methodologies: interviews, participant
                     observation, and passive acoustic recording. I engaged this combination of methodologies
                     in order to arrive at a kind of "thick data" [<a class="ref" href="#wang2013">Wang 2013</a>]. Thick data
                     combines Geertz's thick description with the big data that is often central to digital
                     humanities conversations, aiming for a generative kind of movement between the macro
                     and
                     the micro, which was essential for this project. During fieldwork, I was interested
                     in
                     telling the stories of individuals, places, and songs through interviews and
                     participant-observation, but also in listening to change over time and detecting broader
                     patterns that only a vast number of soundscape recordings could provide. Approaching
                     sound
                     in "multiple registers" consistently allowed me to engage more meaningfully with the
                     ethnographic and the computational aspects of the project.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">I conducted dozens of interviews with a wide range of conversation partners: musicians,
                     local neighborhood officials, church members, business owners, and residents. These
                     interviews were typically semi structured conversations, drawing on a mix of my own
                     questions related to sonic impressions of the neighborhood as well as stories that
                     people
                     were willing to share. Gaining access to interviews was often an exercise of positioning
                     myself in layers, typically beginning with my "official" classification as a PhD student
                     or Smithsonian intern working on a project focused on neighborhood change. Language
                     was
                     important here, as "gentrification" carries different connotations than "neighborhood
                     change" in local discourses. Neighborhood change is a less racially charged term than
                     gentrification, with the former indicating that the neighborhood has undergone some
                     development and the latter insinuating that the development can be blamed on a particular
                     group of (white) people. At a neighborhood association meeting, I once described my
                     project to a black resident of Maryland as being about "gentrification and sound,"
                     and he
                     remarked that it was very interesting, "because of that word that you just used,"
                     rather
                     than repeating it himself. I moved between the two terms as the project unfolded,
                     often
                     times mirroring the vocabulary of my interlocuters.

                     the
                     city. Because of the exploitative legacies of fields such as ethnomusicology, sociology,
                     and anthropology, communities of color often exercise a legitimate skepticism with
                     outside

                     drawing
                     out my D.C. accent in order to be heard and coded as a black woman from the area,
                     working
                     against the violent legacy of my discipline. In this way I was both insider and outsider

                     ties
                     to the city yet distant in my academic training. Even as I did fieldwork in places
                     very
                     familiar to me, I was always an outsider just by virtue of doing the fieldwork [<a class="ref" href="#wong2008">Wong 2008</a>].

                     of color. As Mellonee Burnim has argued, shared racial or ethnic identity with a group
                     of
                     people does not automatically create a culture-bearer. Regarding her fieldwork on

                     in her various research sites, but also because she was a culture-bearer within the
                     gospel
                     music tradition, and was able to offer these churches her skills as a musician in

                     with the people and places around me but had arrived with a new set of expectations
                     and

                     neighborhood meetings, rallies, and protests. At these events, I was typically most
                     interested in sound sources and tensions surrounding them. For example, at an Advisory
                     Neighborhood Commission (ANC) meeting one evening, half the attendees left the event
                     halfway through because their hot-button agenda item had been completed. They then
                     proceeded to be so loud in the hallway that one of the commissioners running the meeting
                     had to step out to tell them to be quiet, reminding them that there were still more
                     items
                     on the agenda besides theirs. These tensions, stemming from who is able to be heard
                     and
                     whose sounds or voice are deemed important, were central for the project. Furthermore,
                     many of my observations were digital rather than in person; I listened to online radio,
                     watched Facebook and Twitter videos, and watched live streams of D.C. City Council
                     Hearings. In this way, my ethnography was necessarily digital because many of the
                     city's
                     conversations on gentrification are happening online, both privately and publicly.
                     As a

                     such as forests or underwater to listen to marine life. However, this method of long-term
                     passive acoustic recording has been established as an effective way of detecting patterns

                     recording equipment. For the duration of the project, I utilized two Wildlife Acoustics
                     Song Meter SM4 recorders, described by the manufacturers as "a compact, weatherproof,

                     ethnography, because I chose to install the recorders on two building rooftops in
                     and
                     around the intersection of 7th and Florida. Acoustically, rooftops offer the best
                     vantage
                     point for urban passive acoustic recording. In order to install the recorders, I first
                     had
                     to receive permission from the owners of those particular buildings (one a church
                     and one
                     a church office), both of whom agreed after an interview with me. This agreement also
                     came
                     with the promise of letting me inside and on the rooves once a month to download data
                     and
                     change the batteries for the recorders, which allowed me to get to know various office
                     staffs and grounded this project in people, rather than soundscape data. The first
                     rooftop
                     was about five stories off the ground, and covered with solar panels. In March of
                     2018, I
                     hung the first recorder, nestled in a wooden arm, off of the southwestern edge of
                     the
                     roof, so as to be directed towards the intersection of 7th street and Florida Avenue.
                     I
                     installed the second recorder in May over a third-floor balcony in the intersection.
                     Both
                     recorders captured one minute out of every five minutes all day, every day. That
                     resulted in 288 recordings per day, per recorder. The final tally of over 100,000
                     recordings is nearly impossible to listen or analyze manually, and yet the possibilities
                     for the dataset seem endless.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Engaging 100,000 raw .wav files required a healthy amount of data cleaning, an essential
                     and time-consuming phase of every digital humanities project. Data cleaning is generally
                     understood as the manipulation of a raw dataset (sound, text, images, etc.) into a
                     more
                     categorized, segmented, and manageable whole. When it comes to projects based in
                     humanistic inquiry, though, data cleaning in and of itself is contested. The language
                     of
                     cleaning data implies that "things already have a rightful place, but they're not
                     in it"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rawson2016">Rawson and Muñoz 2016</a>]. The practice of putting data into categories is an
                     imposition, and requires the questioning of the categories themselves. In my work,
                     I treat
                     listening as a speculative method, following Deborah Kapchan's call for scholars to
                     "release our hold on intellective knowledge (with its drives to categorize, objectify,
                     and
                     subjugate)" [<a class="ref" href="#kapchan2017">Kapchan 2017</a>]. Similarly, I seek a mode of knowledge production
                     through the aural that speculates without being ahistorical, and listens with the
                     intent
                     of amplification rather than categorization. This type of speculative engagement with
                     sound led to a flexibility within both data cleaning and analysis, where I engaged
                     in
                     different levels of cleaning depending on the particular goal of the project in that
                     moment. The disruption of visual narratives of gentrification, which emphasize
                     displacement and measurable outcome, lies here in the slippage between the speculative
                     and
                     the categorizable. My intention in questioning the process of data cleaning is not
                     to
                     arrive at a perfect solution of how to categorize data, but instead to use both necessary
                     processes of categorization and speculation to interrupt prevalent narratives of loss.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Tanya Clement describes computational sound analysis as a question of compromises
                     balanced amidst an exercise in imagination [<a class="ref" href="#clement2018">Clement 2018</a>]. Sound is
                     ephemeral, difficult to track, and contains variants that text-based data does not.
                     However, in order to engage in large scale analysis, some level of categorization
                     is
                     indeed required for a sonic data set. In the case of the data from the recorders,
                     I went
                     through a trial and error process in order to clean the data, beginning with Kaleidoscope,
                     the software suite built by Wildlife Acoustics in order to visualize and classify
                     the data
                     from their Song Meter recorders. The software features a number of different functions,
                     including a spectrogram to visualize data, a clustering mechanism to group like
                     recordings, and a noise analysis tool. I began working with the data month by month,
                     as my
                     data was already organized in this schema because I ascended the rooftops monthly
                     to
                     download data and change the batteries on the recorders.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">In order to train the data set, I first ran a month's worth of data through
                     Kaleidoscope's unsupervised classifier, which allows the algorithm to group the recordings
                     into unnamed clusters based on similarities in frequency and timing. This classification
                     is conducted through Fast Fourier Transform, an algorithm that decomposes complex
                     frequencies. With these base classifiers in hand, I then went through manually and
                     "tagged" clips within my own named clusters, which included the following: brakes,
                     bus
                     hiss, backup beeps, music, voices, and sirens. I developed this final set of categories
                     through trial and error, and then went through to only tag the best examples of these
                     sounds. I then re-ran the classifier with the same data to only include the clips
                     that I
                     tagged. This second .csv file then becomes the training set. Finally, I ran a new
                     set of
                     data under a supervised classification, using the second .csv file that I named as
                     the
                     training set. This then produces a results page that clusters the data based on my
                     training set, and is fairly accurate within a set distribution.

                     the best result for my research questions and within the ethical limitations I set
                     for
                     myself. One of the primary dilemmas during this process was the inclusion of voices
                     as a
                     tagged component. Surveillance is a fact of blackness, and keeping this in mind, this
                     project has required careful consideration about the legacy of surveillance that weighs

                     black people across the diaspora [<a class="ref" href="#browne2015">Browne 2015</a>]. I was therefore determined
                     to ignore potential identifiers in the data, and purposely "cleaned" in such a way
                     that
                     would obscure conversation rather than identify it. In fact, the only reason I classified
                     voices at all was just to be able to train the classifier to be able to listen to
                     go-go
                     music, which contains a great deal of spoken vocals and rapping from lead
                     talkers.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e282">[2]</a> After solidifying the training set, I was then able
                     to run all nine months of data from both recorders through Kaleidoscope. After further
                     cleaning the final spreadsheet to only include the relevant information, I uploaded
                     this

                     Structured Query Language (SQL) databases. Working with SQL and Indiana University's
                     supercomputing support, I was then able to write queries for the larger dataset, getting
                     back to those crucial questions about gentrification, race, and sound.

                     different levels of scope to engage a variety of aural insights in a gentrifying
                     intersection. I begin with close listenings, because even amid the possibilities of
                     large
                     scale machine learning, there is still room for and urgency within both traditional
                     and
                     computationally informed close listenings. By computationally informed close listening,
                     I
                     am referring to a kind of deep engagement with and interpretation of a sound source
                     that
                     stems from mediation types other than listening from a standard playback device. In
                     this
                     case, I facilitate close listenings via spectrograms, which are visual representations
                     of
                     sound that mark frequency and amplitude over an x axis of time. Utilizing the Google
                     Chrome Music Lab's Spectrogram tool, I include here a short spectrogram film from
                     the
                     intersection, featuring the sounds from the intersection as well as my own annotations

                     in

                     <p class="ptext">
                        As I sit down at the bus stop, a driver is honking intensely as they
                        go through the intersection, practically laying on their horn. There is also a black
                        woman's voice rapping N.E.R.D.'s "Lemon" from the speaker in front of Central
                        Communications. A black man, who is actually in the intersection, is rapping along,
                        but
                        with different words. They're both rapping over a go-go pocket beat, and cars are
                        driving by. A heavy engine idles at the intersection, then accelerates after the light
                        turns green. As vehicles drive past, the pocket beat remains. In the distance, there
                        is
                        a siren blaring for a few moments, though it never passes directly through the
                        intersection. The man in the intersection that was rapping along with the woman on
                        the
                        speaker has begun to rap on his own, because the speakers are currently on the
                        breakdown, and there are no voices on the pocket now. He raps, "Lock It, Lock it in
                        the
                        Pocket," on repeat. His voice is momentarily drowned out by another heavy engine,
                        but
                        upon it leaving the intersection he seems to have moved on to rapping, "get money,
                        get
                        money." More engines, more brakes, more horns. The song changes, seemingly beginning
                        a
                        new set altogether. Now the song is a go-go cover of Frankie Beverly and Maze's "Before
                        I Let Go." The man that was rapping is now saying "Hey baby, hey baby," but it's unclear
                        who he's addressing. A metrobus stops, with its customary hiss-and-beep combination.
                        A
                        woman's disembodied voice comes from the bus, announcing that "the base fare is two
                        dollars." She sounds like Siri. While trucks idle at the traffic light, the music
                        is
                        muffled.

                     approaches the granular help us to articulate the sonorities of gentrification? While
                     many
                     studies and narratives of gentrification emphasize displacement and loss, these sonic
                     materials assert the enduring presence of black life in the intersection. I posit
                     here
                     that all of these sounds, from the bus stop to the siren to the go-go music, are "black
                     sounds." The bus network is an important facet of black working life and labor in
                     D.C.,
                     and sirens are closely connected to the same notions of policing and criminality that
                     frame core conceptions of blackness [<a class="ref" href="#summers2019">Summers 2019</a>]. So as these
                     neighborhoods become visually unrecognizable, their soundscapes remain discernable
                     as a
                     space in which black people exist. As gentrification threatens to erase all memory
                     of a
                     black D.C., the sonic footprint of a space on a granular level serves as an important
                     timestamp and a refusal to be overlooked.

                     be a

                     this

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">The final advantage to these close examinations of sound in the intersection lies
                     in
                     their combined elements. The spectrogram offers a visual narrative of sound that an
                     ethnographic sketch alone cannot support in part because of the hierarchy of the senses
                     which presumes visual evidence to be more true than sonic or narrative. And yet, the
                     unreliability of my own narrative allows for the inclusion of more detailed information.
                     For example, my description of the man's rapping is important here: his familiarity
                     with
                     the space and demonstration of go-go music's intertextuality is emblematic of the
                     complex
                     layers of sound in the intersection. But, I choose not to include the audio of that
                     recording because it serves as a potential identifier, and my emphasis on black digital
                     humanities does not allow me to intentionally surveil or put a black person in harm's
                     way.
                     These two modes of listening, then, together move us closer toward a sonic interpretation
                     of gentrifying space and a more equitable soundscape the rejects the violence of
                     surveillance as evidence.

                     day
                     of each month, which is a popular day for many to go to Central Communications to

                     their phone bills. Here I offer a 24-hour look at July 4th, 2018, which features
                     commentary about the various sounds heard on that day, from sirens to fireworks, which
                     are
                     common within the neighborhood as well as on the National Mall (See <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>).

                     clockwise beginning at 12 midnight. The beginning of the day, then, visually, is actually
                     late in the night. These hour blocks are delineated in larger groups of three hours
                     that
                     mark time around a standard 24-hour day. In this representation, the only space
                     continuously filled is that of the beeping crosswalk. While crosswalks are known to
                     beep
                     for accessibility purposes, this one in particular sounds throughout the day without
                     prompting, inserting itself as the most consistent sound in the recording process.
                     The
                     consistent beeping of the intersection offers up a glimpse into a broader conversation
                     about sound, gentrification, and accessibility, as the intersection serves a large
                     population of disabled people. Go-go music, as per usual, begins at 10am when Central
                     Communications opens, ending at 6pm which is earlier than its usual 8pm close but
                     reasonable because of the holiday. Car horns are present throughout the day, as 7th
                     and
                     Florida is a busy vehicular and pedestrian intersection in the city. I offer "music"
                     in
                     the representation here distinct from "go-go music" and "club bass" to encompass the
                     myriad of other types of musical expression that permeate the intersection, from people
                     playing music on their phones as they pass through or the radio that spills out of
                     cars
                     that idle at red lights. For the remainder of the evening and into the night, sirens
                     and
                     fireworks crisscross each other in the timeline, giving the impression of a loud and
                     busy
                     night. Club bass is an interesting swatch in the timeline, present briefly in the
                     late
                     afternoon before asserting a more sustained presence from 12am-3am. Bass is more visible
                     here than audible in actual recordings, because of the low frequencies spilling out
                     of the
                     club. Bass is felt, rather than heard, in most instances, and visual representation
                     of
                     such a consistent frequency is helpful here because many noise complaints (whether
                     overtly
                     racialized or not) begin and end with bass being too loud.

                     and local life in Washington, D.C. The 4th of July is perhaps the city's most popular
                     holiday, where tourists flock in to visit national museums by day and enjoy fireworks
                     by
                     night. However, amid national festivities lie a city that is characterized by its
                     lack of
                     statehood, a drastic wealth gap, and a vibrant local cultural life. This timeline
                     provides
                     sonic entry into these tensions, noting how the neighborhood shifts because of the
                     holiday, but also maintains its own character and traditions, in this case the go-go
                     music
                     at Central Communications.

                     unit
                     of a day, a way of hearing the space that acknowledges patterns and routines but does
                     not
                     obscure or leave behind the sonic messiness of the day. Although gentrification is
                     often
                     considered primarily in longitudinal capacities, the unit of the everyday remains
                     an
                     incredibly useful metric of analysis. As de Certeau argued in "Walking in the City,"
                     the
                     city is made by those that walk every day, made not from looking down from the empire
                     state building and mapping the urban as city blocks, but instead in the compilation
                     of
                     those steps. There is a hubris in the longitudinal that I use the day to avoid and
                     to
                     disrupt. As Amira Baraka wrote about tradition, this is the changing same. Much of
                     the
                     gentrification story is not about what changes, but what stays the same. The crosswalk
                     beeps, the music plays, the sirens wail.

                     process, scales back even further to think about gentrification across a series of
                     months
                     in the intersection. In this section, I consider data over the course of the months
                     long
                     period in which the recorders were installed. Gentrification is, on the surface, a
                     problem
                     of time. If I had wanted to hear gentrification over time in a purely longitudinal
                     way, I
                     would have needed to install the recorders in 2008 or 1998 instead of 2018. But this
                     is a
                     case, perhaps even a call, to lean in to the limitations of a dataset. What can nine
                     months tell us about an intersection? What can this interval of time give us about
                     a
                     space? Does this period function only in anticipation of a longer, future dataset,
                     or is
                     there something to learn in listening to these months as incidents themselves?

                     urban imaginary [<a class="ref" href="#jones2017">Jones 2017</a>]. Sirens, depending on their source, can signal
                     crime, emergencies, crises, danger, impending violence, even terror [<a class="ref" href="#stone2014">Stone 2014</a>]. Both interviews and informal conversations led me to understand
                     sirens as a powerful indicator of a neighborhoods crime status, with some of my
                     conversation partners sharing that they heard less sirens as the neighborhood around
                     7th
                     and Florida gentrified. Furthermore, this decrease in sirens was often interpreted
                     as a
                     decrease in criminal activity. I was therefore interested in tracking the presence
                     of
                     sirens across time at 7th and Florida, and offer here a brief representation of that

                     number of insights arise from the chart. The peaks and valleys here are often indicative
                     of the number of people active in the space on any given day. For example, most peaks,
                     where the recorder detected 20+ sirens, were on weekends, typically Fridays and Saturdays.
                     Days with the least number of sirens often corresponded with difficult weather patterns,
                     from heavy rain to thunderstorms. Looking across the longer four month period, from
                     July
                     to October, there is a noticeable decrease in sirens as the season turns from summer
                     to
                     fall. This decrease is consistent with two narratives of a gentrifying city: The first
                     is
                     that crime levels peak during summer months because summers are hot, in terms of both
                     heat
                     and criminal activity. The second narrative is that crime decreases over time in
                     gentrifying neighborhoods, as the crime rate in D.C. has attested to. My intervention
                     lies
                     in the disruption of these narratives, however true they may be. Gentrification is
                     not a
                     linear, gradual process of displacement. Gentrification is a series of jagged
                     interruptions, community meetings, demolitions, protests, contracts, construction
                     projects, and violence.

                     indicators of race, criminality, and urban life. Sirens are so closely molded to black
                     urban life because they are indicative and representative of those forces that have
                     deemed
                     themselves in control of black life, particularly the police. The chart here details
                     the
                     pattern of sirens in the intersection, offering a visual experience of what it is
                     to exist
                     in a space in which blackness has been marked as existent and available. I read this
                     pattern as a demonstration of the cycle of potential sonic traumas that come through
                     the
                     intersection every day, sometimes dozens of times a day: of policing, terror, emergency,
                     and health crises. This chart disrupts a visual narrative of gentrification, in which
                     neighborhoods become better and more beautiful looking because it repositions
                     gentrification as a cyclical process of sonic violences, an ebb and flow of sirens.

                     with tools and methodologies that are in the service of black life. Here I have utilized
                     spectrogram films to emphasize the ubiquity of black sound, considered how we might
                     imagine the sonic life of a day in a particular gentrifying space, and used long-term
                     analysis to consider gentrifying space as a series of potential sonic traumas. The
                     intention of this work is to arrive at an aurality that disrupts and outright rejects
                     the
                     everyday violences imposed onto black people.

                     the connections between sonic datasets and the racialization of sound could lead to
                     more
                     humanely written policies that do not foreground punitive measures for perceived sonic

                     recorders for listening to gentrification, I called Wildlife Acoustics and asked a
                     general question what the recorders would be able to hear. The man I spoke to then
                     asked
                     me what I was trying to hear, and my response of "gentrification" audibly threw him
                     off.
                     He did admit, though, that they can pick up "everything."</span></div>

                     connection between band and audience. They talk to people in the front, give shout

                     call out neighborhoods, etc.</span></div>
