            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration within digital humanities research requires brokering
               and boundary-crossing work. This article maps interdisciplinary exchanges between
               computer scientists, media scholars and information scientists to explicate how
               interdisciplinary brokering affects knowledge and tool production in the digital
               humanities. The analysis of qualitative data collected during a 17 month-long digital
               humanities research pilot - set to collaboratively test a digital Linked Open Data
               (LOD) search tool - provides insights into the exploratory search behaviour of a
               total of 122 (digital) humanities scholars, and how these insights informed brokering
               work within an interdisciplinary research team. The article argues that
               interdisciplinary collaboration first and foremost requires disciplinary recognition
               in order to succeed, and demonstrates how practical, empirical research insights - in
               this case about user research - mobilize interdisciplinary decision-making processes.
               Conclusions indicate in what ways computational tools and collaboration affect
               knowledge production, and suggest that understanding the stakes of digital humanities
               research with digital audio-visual sources requires an integrated perspective
               characterized by both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical,
               practical application. The article furthermore concludes that digital humanities
               brokering and boundary work should not only revolve around tool development, but also
               requires self-reflexivity in aligning epistemological chasms between disciplines by
               means of collaborative translation practices. </p>

            <p>Productive interdisciplinary collaboration is high on research agendas of funding
               organisations, especially those organisations looking to stimulate digital humanities
                  research<note> For examples of calls for and reports on interdisciplinary research

                  (last accessed 16-1-2022).</note>. Stimulating collaboration between computer
               scientists and humanities scholars could potentially lead to insights that are of
               interest to both disciplines; humanities-oriented reflections on big data analysis
               can help understandings of its cultural significance, whilst computational analyses
               of cultural data potentially enrich humanities research about large batches of
               cultural data. However, as this article shows, interdisciplinary collaboration is
               often messy and wrought with misunderstanding <ptr target="#vangorp2019"/>, and a great
               deal of time and effort is spent on trying to create a common agenda as researchers
               work to comply with goals that are of importance to their own disciplinary concerns.
               The central argument of this article is that successful interdisciplinary
               collaboration requires disciplinary recognition if it is to be a fruitful endeavour. </p>
            <p><q>Interdisciplinariness</q> does not warrant immediate celebration. It is important to
               acknowledge that doing interdisciplinary work requires translation work:
               specifically, an adaptation of research insights to make sense within another
               disciplinary perspective, in order to reach conclusions that prove productive to all
               researchers and disciplines involved. Overcoming epistemological differences between
               disciplines often makes conflict inevitable within interdisciplinary digital
               humanities projects <ptr target="#poole2018"/>. This is why interdisciplinary research
               should include self-reflexivity in the process of collaboration (see also <ptr target="#hagedoorn2018"/>) and thereby pay attention to the outcomes and also the <quote rend="inline">practice of
                  interdisciplinary collaboration</quote> <ptr target="#vangorp2019"/>.</p>
            <p>This article presents insights into such interdisciplinary digital humanities
               practices. It delves into a particular case of interdisciplinary translation work to
               explicate the particularities of what we refer to as interdisciplinary brokering
               work. The case centres on the collaboration practices of a team of computer
               scientists, information scientists and media scholars who, over the course of 17
               months, user tested and fine-tuned a digital tool as part of a digital humanities
               pilot study. Throughout this study, the tool became the basis for interdisciplinary
               knowledge exchange, much like a <q>boundary object</q> <ptr target="#star1989"/>.
               Furthermore, the team’s brokering and negotiation efforts about insights drawn from
               user testing illustrate that, while such insights are a product of interdisciplinary
               meaning-making, these insights are also more strongly guided by the project’s
               deliverable goals than by concerns about usability.</p>
            <p>The tool that became the team’s boundary object, is the Linked Open Data (LOD)
               exploratory search browser DIVE+<note> See  <ref
                     target="https://diveplus.frontwise.com/">https://diveplus.frontwise.com/</ref>.
                  DIVE+ is an exploratory, event-centric linked open data browser that connects
                  several digital cultural heritage collections <ptr target="#deboer2015"/> <ptr target="#deboer2017"/>. The
                  application seeks to support humanities scholars’ research by allowing
                  serendipitous exploration and visualization of historical narratives found in
                  cultural heritage collections.</note>, which is part of the CLARIAH Media Suite<note>
                  <ref target="https://mediasuite.clariah.nl">https://mediasuite.clariah.nl</ref>
                  </note> research environment <ptr target="#martinez2017"/>. DIVE+ is a digital cultural
               heritage browser which aims to support scholars during the first, exploratory, phase
               of their research by allowing them to create and save <q>search narratives</q> as
               sequences of search results, connected by scholars in a separate navigation and
               bookmarking pane in the search browser (see Figure 2). The CLARIAH Media Suite gives
               access to important Dutch national audiovisual archives and is part of the
               overarching CLARIAH infrastructure, which is the Dutch national counterpart to the
               international CLARIN and DARIAH research infrastructures. CLARIAH <quote rend="inline">develops,
               facilitates, and stimulates the use of Digital Humanities resources and
               infrastructures</quote> <ptr target="#clariah2022"/>, and offers tools and data for humanities and social
               sciences research. </p>
            <p>Insights into the team’s interdisciplinary collaboration practices are drawn from
               qualitative data that was collected during a 17 month-long digital humanities
               research pilot study (2017-2018) that investigated how effectively DIVE+ supported
               the digital research practices of humanities scholars. Throughout the research study
               the authors collected data about humanities scholars’ digital search practices by
               means of focus groups, search tasks and think-aloud protocols, surveys, and
               questionnaires of in total 122 participants. The authors then traced how these user
               insights shaped both the development of DIVE+ as well the interdisciplinarity
               collaboration within the research team.</p>
            <p>As the title of this article suggests, brokering plays a key role in grasping the
               interdisciplinary collaboration within this pilot. Brokering is not simply a metaphor
               for collaboration. Admittedly borrowed from Innovation Studies <ptr target="#hargadon1997"/>, brokering draws attention to how, in the contemporary marketplace of ideas,
               understanding the negotiation between parties or actors is key to explain why certain
               ideas are embraced or discarded. The concept also conjures up recent debates about
               how neoliberalism has permeated digital humanities research, and what universities’
               and funding agencies’ large-scale investment in the computational turn indicates
               about the role of cultural critique and hermeneutics within (digital) humanities
               research <ptr target="#allington2016"/> <ptr target="#liu2012"/> <ptr target="#nowviskie2016"/>. </p>
            <p>In this case, brokering takes the shape of a brokering community practice <ptr target="#wenger1998"/> <ptr target="#henry2012"/> in which collaborators <quote rend="inline">[negotiate] their own
               activities and identities, [while shaping] the relationships between their
               communities of practice</quote> <ptr target="#beddoes2011" loc="13"/>. The analysis of this practice focuses
               on how insights uncovered during the pilot – i.e. insights into how humanities
               scholars actually search in and explore digital archives while using DIVE+ – inform
               team collaborations and decision-making processes, both on the level of the tool
               (adjusting for instance its interface, and functionality to align with user needs)
               and on the level of interdisciplinary research collaboration (e.g., in working to
               create academic and a project-related research output). We relate this back to how
               brokering practices reflect who ‘wins’ within the marketplace of ideas by focusing on
               humanities scholars, who are deemed to have increasingly less agency in digital
               humanities due to their insistence on close reading, hermeneutic tradition, and
               interpretation <ptr target="#allington2016"/>. In our case, humanities
               scholars were involved as part of the interdisciplinary project team, and as the
               tool’s targeted user group.</p>
            <p>This article’s second goal is to connect our qualitative user studies’ insights to
               interdisciplinary concerns about how knowledge is explored, produced, and
               disseminated by means of computational tools and digital humanities research
               practices. This objective relates to prior studies about scholarly research processes
               and how these may <quote rend="inline">inform the development of research environments for digital
                  scholarship in the humanities</quote> <ptr target="#gradmann2015" loc="143"/> <ptr target="#bron2012"/>. It is
               particularly valuable to scholars working on the disciplinary boundary of computer
               science and the humanities, who grapple with issues of how to translate humanities’
               concepts and concerns into computational terms.</p>
            <p> In the next section (Section 2) we present the theoretical framework used to analyse
               the collected data. The methodological section (Section 3) shows how we related
               qualitative data collection and grounded theory to answer overarching questions about
               collaboration and brokering practices. Section 4 presents the analysis, with
               reflections about interdisciplinary brokering and translation work on two levels: (1)
               the project level, where team meetings and debates indicate the necessity of both
               theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical, practical application
               when doing digital humanities work and, (2) the tool level, and the role played by
               insights drawn from the pilot’s user studies in the team collaboration practices. We
               conclude in section 5 with a discussion of how our analysis at the user study level
               maps onto larger interdisciplinary concerns.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that while the user study provides qualitative insights into
               the exploratory search behaviour of 122 users, and that the documented research team
               collaboration was analysed in order to better understand how interdisciplinary
               research within the digital humanities works, this study does have clear limitations.
               We used a mixed-method approach to conduct our qualitative research. This choice was
               informed by both methodological and practical concerns: we wanted to triangulate
               insights, while simultaneously adapting our methods to specific research settings.
               This is why think-aloud protocols were supplemented with questionnaires, research
               diaries and focus group sessions. This mixed-method approach relied on the team’s
               collective expertise and as a result helped to translate project insights into new
               knowledge for dissemination within the different researchers’ respective fields of
               Computer Science, Media Studies and Information Science.</p>

               <head>2.1 Collaboration as brokering work</head>
               <p>Digital humanities research is characterised as interdisciplinary, and works at
                  the boundaries of what are considered computational sciences and the humanities.
                  More often than not, digital humanities are described in terms of how the
                  computational turn has taken effect in the humanities, thereby mirroring
                  all-encompassing processes of the datafication of modern society <ptr target="#schafer2017" loc="15"/>. In this article, we look at what this computational work means for
                  the boundaries between disciplines, in terms of interdisciplinary collaboration
                  practices. Collaboration between different disciplines and different skill-sets is
                  key in digital humanities projects <ptr target="#vangorp2019"/> <ptr target="#klein2015"/> <ptr target="#hayles2012"/> <ptr target="#masson2017"/>. With collaboration comes the need for translations of
                  concepts and methods. Furthermore, and especially within disciplines that focus on
                  negotiations between actors to delineate how technological artefacts are
                  developed, brokering work itself is recognized as a shaping actor <ptr target="#oldenziel2006"/>, even at the level of project management <ptr target="#tabak2017"/>
                  <ptr target="#gradmann2015"/>.</p>
               <p>Masson describes two trends in digital humanities research that relate to the core
                  objectives of this paper: (1) the critical engagement with digital tools and data,
                  and (2) the growing tendency to refer to digital humanities research as
                  transdisciplinary, drawing into focus the work of creating a <quote rend="inline">shared conceptual
                     framework</quote> <ptr target="#masson2017" loc="35"/> by collaborating disciplines. Transdisciplinarity contrasts
                  with interdisciplinary and multidisciplinarity in the sense that the former is
                  transformative, while interdisciplinarity is concerned with linking and
                  integrating, and multidisciplinarity juxtaposes disciplines <ptr target="#klein2010" loc="16"/>.
                  Transdisciplinary research may emerge from interdisciplinary collaboration, when
                  <quote rend="inline">fundamental epistemological shifts occur</quote> <ptr target="#austin2008" loc="557"/>.</p>
               <p>Our study engages with both of Masson’s digital humanities trends. The analysis
                  shows how, in our project, critical tool engagement informs the collaborative
                  brokering practice of an interdisciplinary research team. Tool user testing not
                  only informs tool development, but also fundamentally shapes the interdisciplinary
                  team’s negotiation practices, especially regarding what is deemed important or
                  within the scope of the research project for each involved researcher and
                  represented discipline. Ultimately, the analysis shows that while this project was
                  interdisciplinary, it never transcended disciplinary concerns to realize a shared
                  conceptual – transdisciplinary – space.</p>
               <p> The research project did, however, rely on a shared material space: DIVE+, the
                  tool that was further developed and tested within the project. Drawing into focus
                  the brokering practices on both the tool and project levels creates a conceptual
                  framework that is empirically, practically, observable; shared project objectives
                  lead to tests and alterations of, and reflections on DIVE+ as a boundary object
                  <ptr target="#star1989"/> or a <quote rend="inline">working artefact</quote> <ptr target="#suchman2002"/>).
                  Boundary objects are defined as objects <quote rend="inline">both adaptable to different viewpoints
                     and robust enough to maintain identity across them</quote> <ptr target="#star1989" loc="387"/>.</p>
               <p>We work in line with Rieder and Rohle’s (<ref target="#rieder2012">2012</ref>) argument that interdisciplinary
                  digital humanities research should <quote rend="inline">establish areas of collaboration between the
                  disciplines and to foster the development of practical solutions for interaction</quote>
                  <ptr target="#rieder2012" loc="80"/> at the level of methodology. We analyse documented team meetings, and
                  methodological and technological choices that flowed from these meetings as
                  brokering practices to better understand how such an area of collaboration was
                  formed in action. The team collectively documented meetings in a shared online
                  file as part of project management efforts. The content of this file underlines
                  that interdisciplinary collaboration requires a constant eagerness to engage in
                  brokering practices. </p>
               <p>Here, brokering work takes the shape of translation<note> In the sense that Callon
                     (<ref target="#callon1984">1984</ref>) discusses translation of interests, but stressing, in line with Star and
                     Griesemer (<ref target="#griesemer1989">1989</ref>), the work that goes into this translation. Latourian
                     translation refers to ‘mediation, of ‘interpretation’ of objectives, expressed
                     in the ‘languages’ of the different intermediaries engaged in a project/process
                     of 'innovation’ <ptr target="#buzelin2007" loc="48"/>.</note>; of finding words to express
                  concepts and translating these into a set of interface and data requirements.
                  Recognizing translations as negotiations between disciplinary perspectives, and
                  revisiting documentation of interactions between members of different disciplines
                  through the conceptual lens of brokering, enables us to trace the work that goes
                  into realizing interdisciplinary collaboration within digital humanities projects,
                  and the work that goes into fine-tuning a technological artefact. </p></div>

               <head>2.2 The boundary object DIVE+: Exploratory search and narrative creation</head>
               <p>Drawing out this brokering work shows how collaborators work across disciplines by
                  material engagement with the tool DIVE+ as a boundary object. DIVE+ is an open
                  linked exploratory search browser that facilitates the exploration of diverse
                  archival and museum collections, and allows researchers to investigate how
                  different media objects, events, people and concepts can be compared, connected,
                  and contextualized. Within Library and Information Sciences, the process of
                  information search and retrieval has been described as consisting of different
                  phases, including exploration. Kuhlthau proposes a six-stage model of information
                  searching, that relates search stages to phases of uncertainty, and observes that
                  <quote rend="inline">the model reveals a search process in which a person is seeking meaning in the
                     course of seeking information</quote> <ptr target="#kuhlthau2017" loc="2233"/>. Exploration is described as
                  the third stage, in which a searcher experiences a <q>dip</q> of confidence after
                  having selected a number of interesting sources. Exploration leads to feelings of
                  uncertainty, as a user encounters sources that do not <quote rend="inline">fit smoothly with
                     previously held constructs</quote> <ptr target="#kuhlthau2017"/>. Exploration and exploratory search are
                  investigatory activities triggered by a user’s need and willingness to learn and
                  develop new knowledge <ptr target="#marchionini2006"/> <ptr target="#mirizzi2010" loc="39"/>. White
                  and Roth furthermore emphasize that exploratory searchers <quote rend="inline">aim to solve complex
                  problems</quote> and that exploratory search itself is <quote rend="inline">open-ended, persistent, and
                  multi-faceted</quote> (<ref target="#white2009">2009</ref>). Exploratory search can therefore be regarded as an
                  iterative process, likened to solving puzzles <ptr target="#sauer2016"/> or playing
                  games <ptr target="#wilson2017"/>. </p>
               <p>In defining how to optimally support exploratory search, Marchionini (<ref target="#marchionini2006">2006</ref>)
                  describes a system much like DIVE+ that affords user exploration and visualization
                  of relationships between different entities and data facets (topic, time, space,
                  data format). DIVE+ aspires to create ‘search narratives’ by presenting for
                  instance events that are shared across linked data sets. However, as we will
                  discuss in the analysis section, the mismatch between the search narratives
                  afforded by DIVE+’s use of LOD and humanities scholars’ understanding of
                  ‘narrative’ demonstrates the precarity of transdisciplinary presumptions.</p></div>
            <div>
               <head>2.3 Exploration afforded by Linked Open Data</head>
               <p>Facilitating data exploration by means of linked open data (LOD) allows users to
                  discover connections across linked data sets <ptr target="#pattuelli2017"/>. Transposing
                  and matching vocabularies of different data collections grants insights into
                  individual collections as well as enable the definition of new research questions
                  about hitherto digitally unconnected materials. Of course, providing new ways to
                  explore these afforded connections relies on translations grounded in specific
                  assumptions. First, there is invisible but very real work done at the data level
                  to translate collections into LOD: adapting explorable entities to facilitate
                  connections across different collections. Second, the notion that LOD will allow
                  new discoveries, or the formulation of new research questions (prompted by
                  surprising visualised connections), is based on the conviction that patterns in
                  data lead to new knowledge <ptr target="#bod2013"/> and that knowledge is no longer
                  entity-centric, but rather, relationship-centric <ptr target="#voskarides2018"/><note>
                     Dimitrova et al.’s user study (<ref target="#dimitrova2013">2013</ref>) uses task-based experiments to understand
                     how linked semantic data supports exploratory search processes and concludes
                     that semantic data browsers support serendipitous learning in users, as
                     semantic links allow for the discovery of new facts by chance.</note>. </p>
               <p>Recent digital humanities research has also focused on discovery by means of
                  exploratory search. Jähnichen et al. (<ref target="#jahnichen2017">2017</ref>) focus on visual topic modelling of
                  large collections of historical digitised materials to enhance exploratory search
                  processes, while Muiser (<ref target="#muiser2017">2017</ref>) employed user-centred design case studies to
                  optimize exploration of digital cultural heritage collections. The possibilities
                  explicitly offered by LOD are furthermore documented by Lampert and Southwick
                  (<ref target="#lampert2013">2013</ref>) who argue that LOD will not only change search processes, but also shift
                  (librarian) skills and the conception of access to digital collections.</p>
               <p> This article presents the results of our user study focused on exploratory search
                  and LOD, while connecting user study insights to overarching observations made
                  about interdisciplinary collaboration in terms of brokering practices. We are not
                  only interested in how users can form new research questions and encounter
                  research ideas as they engage in exploratory search with LOD, but also draw
                  attention to a parallel between LOD and interdisciplinary collaboration. Exploring
                  LOD is similar to exploring interdisciplinary research possibilities; both happen
                  between what Klein refers to as the Boundary Object and the Interactional
                  Expertise Trading Zones, that include linguistic exchanges generating
                  <quote rend="inline">interlanguage and interactional expertise</quote> <ptr target="#klein2015" loc="140"/>. Mapping and
                  transposing vocabularies across digital heritage collections and making these
                  vocabularies explorable via the DIVE+ browser marks collaborations within both
                  zones at the same time. DIVE+ becomes a boundary object for these collections (at
                  the data level), while also performing the function of boundary object for the
                  collaborating disciplines. The zone of interactional expertise is engaged by
                  addressing user interactions with the browser. LOD allows new unforeseen
                  connections between entities and documents. Meanwhile, interdisciplinary
                  collaborations are expected to link and connect disciplinary ideas. On both
                  levels, there are of course also challenges and obstacles to the fruition of these
                  new connections. The present study details these to provide insights at both the
                  project and interdisciplinary level.</p>

               <head>3.1 Documenting collaboration</head>
               <p>Digital humanities research is often project-based <ptr target="#tabak2017"/>. Project
                  management therefore plays an important role, also when analysing how
                  collaboration is structured. The object of the research pilot was to investigate
                  how DIVE+ supports exploratory search practices of media researchers, especially
                  when these researchers investigate narrative creation about unexpected media
                  events, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks <ptr target="#hagedoorn2018"/>. User
                  insight would lead to recommendations to further fine-tune the browser. </p>
               <p>The project team, consisting of eight researchers from the fields of Computer
                  Science, Media Studies, and Information Science, met virtually on a bi-weekly
                  basis to discuss project deliverables, tool development, planned user studies, and
                  research insight dissemination efforts. Meetings lasted between 30 and 60 minutes,
                  and were documented in an online shared document. This shared document served as a
                  research diary, chronicling the research project’s issues, concerns, and
                  milestones in a bi-weekly rhythm. This document is analysed to discern recurring
                  themes, ideas, and joint research objectives in order to help understand how the
                  team gave meaning to DIVE+ as the project’s boundary object.</p></div>

               <head>3.2 User research: documenting user stories to understand exploratory search with
                  linked data</head>
               <p>Research diaries were also part of the mixed-methods approach used to undertake
                  user research. A total of 122 (digital) humanities scholars took part in these
                  studies, between May 2017 and January 2018. A number of methods were combined to
                  triangulate results; individually, users were given exploratory search tasks,
                  answered surveys and (post-task) questionnaires about their experiences. This was
                  combined with collaborative tasks, where small groups worked together to create
                  posters about their search experiences and their ideas about exploratory search.
                  User studies were conducted by means of interactive workshops hosted at different
                  universities to include the users’ actual work settings.</p>
               <p>The tasks were performed on personal laptops or university computers. During two
                  sessions, the tasks were accompanied by think-aloud protocols which were recorded
                  and subsequently transcribed. Search histories were saved and exported by the user
                  and users filled out a post task questionnaire. In other sessions, tasks were not
                  accompanied by a think-aloud protocol, but by a questionnaire. This was done to
                  not disturb other users in the room, as they were completing tasks in a single,
                  larger, space.</p>
               <p>The task assignment was followed by a focus group discussion. During the
                  discussion, users shared their experiences of searching with exploratory search
                  tools, including DIVE+. These sessions were concluded with a poster session. Users
                  worked together in small groups of 3-4 people to draw their research process and
                  trajectory. The main question they all worked with was: How would you visualize
                  your research journey, and what is the (ideal) role of exploratory search in this
                  process? During plenary sessions posters were discussed and research findings
                  displayed (Figure 1).</p>

            <p>The first part of the analysis focuses on the research team’s brokering and
               translation work and then thus turns to how this work was informed by user research
               insights. These insights formed part of the team’s shared goals, but also became the
               space in which different research interests and negotiations came to the fore.
               Lastly, the analysis draws on insights about the collaboration and user research to
               focus on the necessity of both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their
               empirical, practical application when doing digital humanities work. </p></div>

            <head>4.1 Collaboration affects knowledge production; interactional expertise, brokering
               and translation</head>
            <p>The interdisciplinary research team met virtually 27 times on a bi-weekly basis
               between March 2017 and July 2018. This team consisted of two computer scientists, one
               information scientist, and two media studies scholars. A data scientist and
               programmer joined the bi-weekly team meetings on a more ad-hoc basis. Team
               discussions focused on project goals: (1) how to execute user testing with the DIVE+
               browser in order to better understand how (digital) humanities scholars can use
               exploratory search tools as part of their research practices; (2) how to optimize the
               DIVE+ browser in terms of its user interface (UI) and its integration into the
               overarching CLARIAH Media Suite; and (3) tool and project dissemination efforts at
               conferences and in publications.</p>
            <p>Meeting minutes were shared within the team, and archived online. These minutes serve
               as an overview of the project, project management, and are an artefact onto itself. A
               grounded analysis of these minutes shows that discussions were for instance not
               primarily about DIVE+’s UI, but also focused on project management (to indicate, of
               the 239 coded lines, 50 were labelled ‘project management’, only superseded by 51
               times that the UI was topic of discussion). </p>
            <p>At a first glance, this interdisciplinary collaboration focused on discussing project
               timelines, deliverables and key milestones. Issues with DIVE+ functionality, testing
               and its integration into the Media Suite were also discussed at length. Following
               Klein, and Star and Griesemer, DIVE+ was the project’s boundary object and its
               trading zone of interaction from the outset. Discussions revolved around how to
               investigate the ways in which DIVE+ supports exploration, how to translate insights about use into browser and interface changes, and how to disseminate research insights
               more broadly (discussed 24 times during the 27 meetings).</p>
            <p> Klein discusses the <quote rend="inline">interactional expertise trading zone</quote> where <quote rend="inline">interdisciplinary
               work includes linguistic exchange that generates interlanguage and interactional
               expertise</quote> <ptr target="#klein2015" loc="140"/>. In the team meetings, this exchange centred around discussing
               the possibilities of LOD, and how users could be asked to reflect on the usefulness
               of LOD via the DIVE+ search browser. Specifically, what methods could be used to
               understand user engagement with DIVE+, and how users understand the tool and LOD? </p>
            <p>The team settled on a mixed-method approach that used exploratory search tasks and
               think-aloud protocols (used more commonly in human computer interaction studies), as
               well as research diaries and focus groups (that are employed more readily in
               qualitative social science and humanities research). The mixed-method approach relied
               on the team’s collective expertise. This is not trivial: specific experts are
               involved in the project because they are experts in specific user research
               methodologies, and are willing to contribute this expertise for the project’s
               collective benefit. Conversely, these methods were also chosen because these
               specifically helped the involved researchers translate project insights into new
               knowledge for dissemination within their respective fields.</p>
            <p>Translating the findings from the user studies into requirements for DIVE+
               necessitated another step in the collaboration process, in which interdisciplinary
               collaboration led to clashes in epistemological outlook and understanding. For
               example, the tensions over the meaning and use of the term ‘narrative’ between
               researchers based in the humanities and those in computational science exemplify the
               type of translation problems that can arise during interdisciplinary collaboration. </p>
            <p>Whereas the media studies researchers relied on thick descriptions of what
               ‘narrative’ means to the users in order to reflect on the role of narrativization in
               research practices, their user study work also needed to lead to user interface
               recommendations, as well as recommendations for the overarching Media Suite. In other
               words, user feedback and reflections had to be translated into material suggestions,
               as per the project’s objectives. A clear example of this are the team discussions
               about and the understanding of what ‘narrative’ means in the context of users’
               research practices within DIVE+, and what this difference in meaning-attribution means
               in terms of interface functionality and design. For instance, not all users that
               partook in the user studies were comfortable with the notion that they create
               narratives while doing research. As one (media) historian notes: <quote rend="inline">I believe that the
               narrative metaphor does not really apply to my research, because I do not produce
               sequential data, but rather a meta-structure, which cannot be told as a story</quote> (Respondent B-P17)
              . Yet for media researchers who are interested in audio-visual production
               processes, such as image researchers, creating narratives is part of their core
               research work. Narrative is thus a multi-interpretable container term that cannot
               easily be translated in a one-size fits all UI.</p>
            <p>On the level of the search browser, the developers of DIVE+ referred to generated
               exploration paths as ‘search narratives’, as these ‘retell’ the user’s search
               history. This, however, lead to user misunderstandings over how they can become
               storytellers without being able to annotate, add, or shuffle the search results
               within the exploration path. For the humanities researchers on the interdisciplinary
               team, ‘narrative’ was also closely connected to the desire to meaningfully edit or
               comment upon search results. The humanities scholars struggled to view
               ‘auto-generated narratives’ as research stories; without a way to add an
               interpretation to the narrative, the humanities users felt a lack of agency over the
               research narrative. </p>
            <p>To the involved information and computer scientists however, the concept of
               ‘narrative’ was irrevocably tied to a user’s search history. Ultimately, the research
               team’s media scholars suggested to change this notion of a ‘search narrative’ to a
               ‘search journey’, thereby preventing future misunderstandings between team members
               and between the team and the test users. The dispute over a term like ‘narrative’
               shows that developing a shared vocabulary means discussing disciplinary differences. </p>
            <p>A similar discussion emerged about the idea of how DIVE+ was to be an ‘event-centric’
               browser. Initially, the browser included the option to search for events. However, in
               large part because of the ambiguity of this concept (when is something an event?),
               this idea was eventually abandoned. Discussions over terms such as ‘narrative’ and
               ‘event’ were followed up with a collective re-interpreting or translating of the term
               from the point of view of the users, in order to make alterations to the search
               browser and UI that would reflect this user interpretation and to avoid what has been
               referred to as the <quote rend="inline">I-methodology</quote> <ptr target="#akrich1995"/>, where <quote rend="inline">designers consider
                  themselves as representative of the users</quote> <ptr target="#oudshoorn2004" loc="41"/>.</p>
            <p>This translation work is part of the brokering that the collaborating researchers
               engaged in. Beyond translation, brokering also means convincing the other team
               members of how users seemed to interpret their interactions with DIVE+ and with LOD.
               In this case, the discussions about the meaning of ‘narrative’ and ‘event’ that users
               attributed to these terms gained more agency in the brokering practice: the
               epistemological outlook and interpretations of the users involved in tool testing
               became key to material or technological changes in the browser. The data that was
               collected as part of the user studies becomes part of an interactional expertise
               trading zone; it is not only DIVE+ that connects the members of the research team as
               a boundary object, but also the data that is collected about DIVE+ and its use (and
               possible subsequent analysis of that data to publish about the project!) that gives
               the team discussions, and decisions, its momentum. This data is also part of the
               negotiation. In order to zoom in further on how this negotiation actually took shape,
               we now turn to a close analysis of how our collected user research data shaped the
               interdisciplinary collaborative work. </p></div>

               of interdisciplinary brokering </head>
            <p>Using DIVE+, users can explore relations between 1,231.688 entities from 4 digital or
               digitized heritage collections<note> The Tropenmuseum (a museum of world cultures),
                  Dutch newspaper archive Delpher, the Amsterdam Museum, and the Open Images
                  collection of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.</note> when they use
               DIVE+. Links between entities are visualized by showing a snapshot of the retrieved
               ‘media object’, descriptions of the media object, the people, locations, and concepts
               linked to that entity, and how these can be further explored. Users can collect data
               by adding an entity of interest to their ‘exploration path’, or by bookmarking the
               entity for further investigation. They can subsequently save, load and export their
               exploration paths into their overarching CLARIAH personal ‘workspace’ to be able to
               peruse these throughout their research process. </p>
            <p>Users saw benefits in using DIVE+ to explore collections, and recognized its
               potential to support the discovery of new research ideas and topics:
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block"><hi rend="italic">DIVE+’s way of linking information allows you to start with a wide
                  search term and then click through to other or related aspects of it. It enables
                  some free association, which can trigger research questions</hi></quote> (Respondent A-G2)</cit>
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block"><hi rend="italic">[It] makes source selection a bit more random, giving the
                  researcher a chance to find sources that other methods might not reveal</hi></quote> (Respondent X-P12)</cit> 
               
            </p>
            <p>The DIVE+ interface allows users to search for keywords, persons, and locations
               within 4 collections. Clicking on a search result provides a more detailed
               description of an entity, or, for example, allows the user to play the audio-visual
               file that contains the search query. This gives, as one user reports, searching with
               DIVE+, a sense of <quote rend="inline">just diving in without knowing what you will end up with</quote> (Respondent B-P12).
               The fact that connections between entities are made visible is one of the described
               strengths of the browser, as it <quote rend="inline">lets you see connections and thus shows you the
                  meaning of AV content</quote> (Respondent A-P18). </p>
            <p>Connections are deemed valuable when they can be contextualized; researchers see the
               tool as useful to gain a quick overview of how entities are related, and what kinds
               of materials are accessible and related to particular search queries. At the same
               time, they miss context to ground the material as <quote rend="inline">real connections still have to be
               made in an old and traditional way… in the mind of the researcher. (...) It is more
               about the metadata than about the actual content</quote> (Respondent B-P2). Users also indicate that
               while the browser could potentially spark new research questions, this is hampered by
               the lack of transparency about <emph>why</emph> certain entities are
               related: DIVE+’s UI does not inherently explicate the connections it draws across LOD
               entities for the user. This also relates to questions that arose in the focus group
               discussions after using DIVE+: how are entities labelled as events in the tool, what
               is an event? Based on the user feedback, the DIVE+UI was adapted to give users the
               possibility to contextualize data by sorting search results by collection. This
               affords users a clearer view of what they are exploring. </p>
            <p>The user-reported need to ground the data, whether within the context of collection,
               historical parameters, or a particular label (as a ‘concept’, for example), mirrors
               boyd and Crawford’s insights about Big Data analysis (<ref target="#crawford2013">2013</ref>). Without context, data
               loses its meaning: <quote rend="inline">The ability to represent relationships between people as a graph
                  does not mean that they convey equivalent information</quote> <ptr target="#boyd2012" loc="670"/>. </p>
            <p>The overall responses of the users indicate that DIVE+ could potentially support
               exploration, because it offers an alternative way to interact with different data
               collections. However, users also felt that the tool lacks direct research benefits
               because searching with DIVE+ is time consuming, has a steep learning curve, and its
               search functions are counter-intuitive. Users further questioned what kind of
               knowledge is afforded by linked data. We will expand on this last observation,
               because it directly mirrors our findings about brokering as translation and
               consensus-making within interdisciplinary work.</p>
            <p> One of the premises of DIVE+ is that, by offering exploration of entities across 4
               different collections, researchers may encounter materials in new ways, which will
               allow researchers to ask new questions. This idea was supported by user feedback, as
               exploratory search is deemed to <quote rend="inline">[allow] the adaptation of research questions in an
                  iterative fashion</quote> (Respondent A-P1). However, exploration is limited by the knowledge graph
               that these collections, together, create. In other words, search is limited by the
               ways in which entities have been made discoverable, and how these have been labelled
               (e.g., as persons). The micro-granularity of search that is afforded by linked data
               would seem to allow more fine-grained search results. Yet, for the users this meant
               that they became more sceptical of what they were finding. Who, after all, is doing
               the labelling? In other words, apart from voicing a need for (collection) context to
               be able to interpret what they were seeing, users were questioning the transparency
               of the search results, and who was defining terms and setting boundaries around these
               objects. Within DIVE+ and interdisciplinary research alike, the tensions manifested
               within the boundaries of the conversation as much as within its content.</p></div>

            <head>4.2.1 Negotiations: The role of visualization in narrative creation</head>
            <p>The visualized exploration path, or search narrative (Figure 2), was deemed helpful
               to keep track of what was found before and to trace how users came to certain
               materials. Users could see the potential usefulness of this feature, especially to
               revisit previously examined materials. </p>

               van het schip de ‘Prinses Beatrix’’ (construction of the ship ‘Princess Beatrix’)
               which is connected to the entity ‘Prinses Beatrix’ after whom the ship was named.

            </figure>
            
            <p>However, as stated previously, referring to the collected search history as a
               narrative seemed less intuitive to the users than referring to this feature as a
               search journey. The actual narrative, it was deemed, is related to the historical
               narrative that the user is trying to form about a set of events in the past. Yet,
               users saw possibilities to enhance the exploration path functionalities by
               incorporating the possibility to add annotations; adding notes about how the user
               sees connections between two suggested linked entities enables the researcher to feel
               that they are creating narratives. Key to this understanding of narrative creation is
               the sense that annotation gives the user the <quote rend="inline">powerful tool and an important strategy
               not only to tell events, but above all to interpret them and therefore to attribute
               meaning, relevance and to understand reality with more awareness and to transform it</quote> (Respondent E-P7)
               . Giving researchers the agency to annotate created exploration paths into
               narratives more readily integrates the tool into existing research processes. This
               could be useful as <quote rend="inline">during the process of collecting data, the narrative might
               change, for media researchers might find information that changes their research
               question and primary focus</quote> (Respondent E-P7).</p>
            <p> What the above observations indicate about how exploratory search offered by LOD
               affects knowledge production, is that knowledge production needs to be grounded in a
               clear context. The user studies show that (digital) humanities scholars greatly value
               visualizations of historical events in narratives, but still struggle with
               contextualizing the linked data presented in DIVE+. Adding user-generated annotations
               to the suggested connections between LOD entities will benefit their
               contextualization, as it would allow users to reflect on the entity, its source, and
               role within a possible research narrative. </p>
            <p>The user insights about the exploratory search afforded by DIVE+ and the visual
               representations of the search narrative or journey culminated in three tool
               recommendations that were devised by the authors, to allow for annotation of search
               results (to contextualize findings), to allow the export of search results so that a
               user can keep these as ‘notes’ during research, and to add a feature that allows
               users to shuffle search results in the search narrative. These features have been
               designed and implemented in the newest iteration of DIVE+; user research insights
               thus informed particular changes to the browser to ensure the tool aligns better with
               research and meaning-making practices of its foreseen users.</p>

            <head>5. Conclusion </head>
            <p>The objective of this article was to show how insights into the exploratory search
               behaviour of (digital) humanities scholars with the DIVE+ browser informed the
               brokering work of the interdisciplinary research team. The article also argues that
               successful interdisciplinary collaboration requires disciplinary recognition if it is
               to be considered a fruitful endeavour. The presented user study insights are a
               springboard for answers to related questions about knowledge production - and
               recognition - in the digital humanities. The insights help clarify how the research
               team project management efforts and collective user study analysis worked to
               negotiate meaning, methods and outcomes on both the level of the tools’ user
               interface and on the level of interdisciplinary collaboration. </p>
            <p>The user insights culminated in team discussions about how to further refine the
               concept of narrative in DIVE+. These discussions articulate the important role of
               critical interdisciplinary dialogue in digital humanities research throughout tool
               development and application. The recommendations primarily focused on refining DIVE+
               to give the user a better sense of data context, as well as suggestions to improve
               user interaction and experience with the tool’s exploration path (visualizing the
               search narrative, or, as the scholars agreed to term it, the search journey of the
               user). Figure 3 and 4 show what these incremental changes look like in the current
               version of the tool.</p>

            <p>While these alterations were the result of user recommendations, they also reflect
               the outcome of the research team’s brokering - negotiation and translation - work. </p>
            <p>On the level of the tool DIVE+, the user studies therefore show that (digital)
               humanities scholars greatly value visualizations of events in narratives, but
               struggle with contextualizing the linked data presented in DIVE+. Granting users more
               agency in the creation of narratives, by allowing them to annotate related entities
               in the interface’s exploration path, is expected to support this contextualization
               process. On the level of collaboration between disciplines, the case shows that
               interdisciplinarity necessitates the ability to work together in a transdisciplinary
               manner. This means that interdisciplinary collaboration requires the forming of a
               shared conceptual or even community practice in which brokering takes the shape of
               not only discussing and negotiating about project management and deliverables, but
               also requires an almost literal translation of epistemological considerations, in
               this case about the meaning of a term such as ‘narrative’ or ‘event’. </p>
            <p>Overall, this then demands that researchers act in a self-reflexive manner throughout
               collaborations: sharing explicit awareness of how their disciplinary background
               shapes methodological considerations, their understanding of what is considered to be
               knowledge, and how the practice of collaborating shifts or does not shift these
               understandings. Masson’s observation that transdisciplinary work demands a <quote rend="inline">shared
                  conceptual framework</quote> <ptr target="#masson2017" loc="35"/> seems fitting here, with the additional observation
               that creating this framework demands active and open ‘exploration’ within the
               interdisciplinary team. In the interactional expertise trading zone, researchers from
               different disciplines need to broker their views, methods, and terminology, to reach
               consensus and move forward. The interdisciplinary dialogue around the boundary object
               DIVE+ gave meaning to this collaboration; without continuous brokering work, this
               project would not have led to fruitful insights about the user interface of DIVE+,
               about users’ perceptions of meaning-creation that are afforded by linked data, or
               about the collaboration itself. </p>
            <p>Yet, solely focusing on DIVE+ as a boundary object overlooks the important role
               played by the process of developing interactional expertise, of engaging in boundary
               work required to realize project deliverables that include an optimized exploratory
               search browser as a boundary object. The object seems to, also in project
               deliverables, take on a larger role: the tool is at the centre of conference
               presentations and publications, whereas the joint discussions and the collaborative
               work in producing the object are seemingly left aside. Tool development and project
               deliverables trump reflections about process. Admittedly, this seems inherent to work
               on any kind of research project. This is also why we feel it is important to connect
               a focus on (technical) deliverables to how the interdisciplinary team executed their
               project. While this focus on deliverables and tool recommendation realization seems
               to align with earlier mentioned ideas about digital humanities as a ‘neoliberal
               field’ that is focused on computation and the development of tools for tools’ sake,
               the project also illustrates that interpretation and reflections on interpretation
               matter within projects such as these. In the end, <quote rend="inline">it’s not what the software does,
                  it’s what the user does</quote> <ptr target="#macleod2009"/>. Analysing the work that goes into boundary
               work provides an opportunity to pick apart the fabric of much-valued
               interdisciplinary collaboration, to help pinpoint how researchers from different
               disciplines can understand one another. </p>
            <p>We would like to conclude with the observation that there is an interesting parallel
               between the technological affordances of LOD and interdisciplinary digital humanities
               research. Clearly, semantics play a decisive role in both: linked data allows for
               semantic linking of entities, and transdisciplinary collaboration is about brokering
               and translating terms and meanings in such a manner that the entire group understands
               something in a similar way. Drawing out how this interdisciplinary brokering takes
               shape in practice requires working towards a sociology of digital humanities; mapping
               interdisciplinary exchanges in practice. This, in turn, will also bolster an
               understanding of how semantic connections and linked data can further enrich
               knowledge creation and collaboration. </p>
