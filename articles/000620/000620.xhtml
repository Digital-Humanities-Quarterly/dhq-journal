                  <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration within digital humanities research requires brokering
                     and boundary-crossing work. This article maps interdisciplinary exchanges between
                     computer scientists, media scholars and information scientists to explicate how
                     interdisciplinary brokering affects knowledge and tool production in the digital
                     humanities. The analysis of qualitative data collected during a 17 month-long digital
                     humanities research pilot - set to collaboratively test a digital Linked Open Data
                     (LOD) search tool - provides insights into the exploratory search behaviour of a
                     total of 122 (digital) humanities scholars, and how these insights informed brokering
                     work within an interdisciplinary research team. The article argues that
                     interdisciplinary collaboration first and foremost requires disciplinary recognition
                     in order to succeed, and demonstrates how practical, empirical research insights -
                     in
                     this case about user research - mobilize interdisciplinary decision-making processes.
                     Conclusions indicate in what ways computational tools and collaboration affect
                     knowledge production, and suggest that understanding the stakes of digital humanities
                     research with digital audio-visual sources requires an integrated perspective
                     characterized by both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical,
                     practical application. The article furthermore concludes that digital humanities
                     brokering and boundary work should not only revolve around tool development, but also
                     requires self-reflexivity in aligning epistemological chasms between disciplines by
                     means of collaborative translation practices. </p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Productive interdisciplinary collaboration is high on research agendas of funding
                     organisations, especially those organisations looking to stimulate digital humanities
                     research<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e240">[1]</a>. Stimulating collaboration between computer
                     scientists and humanities scholars could potentially lead to insights that are of
                     interest to both disciplines; humanities-oriented reflections on big data analysis
                     can help understandings of its cultural significance, whilst computational analyses
                     of cultural data potentially enrich humanities research about large batches of
                     cultural data. However, as this article shows, interdisciplinary collaboration is
                     often messy and wrought with misunderstanding [<a class="ref" href="#vangorp2019">Van Gorp and Bron 2019</a>], and a great
                     deal of time and effort is spent on trying to create a common agenda as researchers
                     work to comply with goals that are of importance to their own disciplinary concerns.
                     The central argument of this article is that successful interdisciplinary
                     collaboration requires disciplinary recognition if it is to be a fruitful endeavour.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">“Interdisciplinariness” does not warrant immediate celebration. It is important to
                     acknowledge that doing interdisciplinary work requires translation work:
                     specifically, an adaptation of research insights to make sense within another
                     disciplinary perspective, in order to reach conclusions that prove productive to all
                     researchers and disciplines involved. Overcoming epistemological differences between
                     disciplines often makes conflict inevitable within interdisciplinary digital
                     humanities projects [<a class="ref" href="#poole2018">Poole and Garwood 2018</a>]. This is why interdisciplinary research
                     should include self-reflexivity in the process of collaboration (see also [<a class="ref" href="#hagedoorn2018">Hagedoorn and Sauer 2018</a>]) and thereby pay attention to the outcomes and also the “practice of
                     interdisciplinary collaboration” [<a class="ref" href="#vangorp2019">Van Gorp and Bron 2019</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">This article presents insights into such interdisciplinary digital humanities
                     practices. It delves into a particular case of interdisciplinary translation work
                     to
                     explicate the particularities of what we refer to as interdisciplinary brokering
                     work. The case centres on the collaboration practices of a team of computer
                     scientists, information scientists and media scholars who, over the course of 17
                     months, user tested and fine-tuned a digital tool as part of a digital humanities
                     pilot study. Throughout this study, the tool became the basis for interdisciplinary
                     knowledge exchange, much like a “boundary object” [<a class="ref" href="#star1989">Star and Griesemer 1989</a>].
                     Furthermore, the team’s brokering and negotiation efforts about insights drawn from
                     user testing illustrate that, while such insights are a product of interdisciplinary
                     meaning-making, these insights are also more strongly guided by the project’s
                     deliverable goals than by concerns about usability.</div>

                     exploratory search browser DIVE+<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e280">[2]</a>, which is part of the CLARIAH Media Suite<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e290">[3]</a> research environment [<a class="ref" href="#martinez2017">Martínez et al. 2017</a>]. DIVE+ is a digital cultural
                     heritage browser which aims to support scholars during the first, exploratory, phase
                     of their research by allowing them to create and save “search narratives” as
                     sequences of search results, connected by scholars in a separate navigation and
                     bookmarking pane in the search browser (see Figure 2). The CLARIAH Media Suite gives
                     access to important Dutch national audiovisual archives and is part of the
                     overarching CLARIAH infrastructure, which is the Dutch national counterpart to the
                     international CLARIN and DARIAH research infrastructures. CLARIAH “develops,

                     qualitative data that was collected during a 17 month-long digital humanities
                     research pilot study (2017-2018) that investigated how effectively DIVE+ supported
                     the digital research practices of humanities scholars. Throughout the research study
                     the authors collected data about humanities scholars’ digital search practices by
                     means of focus groups, search tasks and think-aloud protocols, surveys, and
                     questionnaires of in total 122 participants. The authors then traced how these user
                     insights shaped both the development of DIVE+ as well the interdisciplinarity
                     collaboration within the research team.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">As the title of this article suggests, brokering plays a key role in grasping the
                     interdisciplinary collaboration within this pilot. Brokering is not simply a metaphor
                     for collaboration. Admittedly borrowed from Innovation Studies [<a class="ref" href="#hargadon1997">Hargadon and Sutton 1997</a>], brokering draws attention to how, in the contemporary marketplace of ideas,
                     understanding the negotiation between parties or actors is key to explain why certain
                     ideas are embraced or discarded. The concept also conjures up recent debates about
                     how neoliberalism has permeated digital humanities research, and what universities’
                     and funding agencies’ large-scale investment in the computational turn indicates
                     about the role of cultural critique and hermeneutics within (digital) humanities
                     research [<a class="ref" href="#allington2016">Allington et al. 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2016">Nowviskie and McGann 2016</a>]. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In this case, brokering takes the shape of a brokering community practice [<a class="ref" href="#wenger1998">Wenger 1998</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#henry2012">Henry and Mackenzie 2012</a>] in which collaborators “[negotiate] their own
                     activities and identities, [while shaping] the relationships between their
                     communities of practice” [<a class="ref" href="#beddoes2011">Beddoes 2011</a>, 13]. The analysis of this practice focuses
                     on how insights uncovered during the pilot – i.e. insights into how humanities
                     scholars actually search in and explore digital archives while using DIVE+ – inform
                     team collaborations and decision-making processes, both on the level of the tool
                     (adjusting for instance its interface, and functionality to align with user needs)
                     and on the level of interdisciplinary research collaboration (e.g., in working to
                     create academic and a project-related research output). We relate this back to how
                     brokering practices reflect who ‘wins’ within the marketplace of ideas by focusing
                     on
                     humanities scholars, who are deemed to have increasingly less agency in digital
                     humanities due to their insistence on close reading, hermeneutic tradition, and
                     interpretation [<a class="ref" href="#allington2016">Allington et al. 2016</a>]. In our case, humanities
                     scholars were involved as part of the interdisciplinary project team, and as the
                     tool’s targeted user group.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">This article’s second goal is to connect our qualitative user studies’ insights to
                     interdisciplinary concerns about how knowledge is explored, produced, and
                     disseminated by means of computational tools and digital humanities research
                     practices. This objective relates to prior studies about scholarly research processes
                     and how these may “inform the development of research environments for digital
                     scholarship in the humanities” [<a class="ref" href="#gradmann2015">Gradmann et al. 2015</a>, 143] [<a class="ref" href="#bron2012">Bron et al. 2012</a>]. It is
                     particularly valuable to scholars working on the disciplinary boundary of computer
                     science and the humanities, who grapple with issues of how to translate humanities’
                     concepts and concerns into computational terms.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"> In the next section (Section 2) we present the theoretical framework used to analyse
                     the collected data. The methodological section (Section 3) shows how we related
                     qualitative data collection and grounded theory to answer overarching questions about
                     collaboration and brokering practices. Section 4 presents the analysis, with
                     reflections about interdisciplinary brokering and translation work on two levels:
                     (1)
                     the project level, where team meetings and debates indicate the necessity of both
                     theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical, practical application
                     when doing digital humanities work and, (2) the tool level, and the role played by
                     insights drawn from the pilot’s user studies in the team collaboration practices.
                     We
                     conclude in section 5 with a discussion of how our analysis at the user study level
                     maps onto larger interdisciplinary concerns.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">It is important to note that while the user study provides qualitative insights into
                     the exploratory search behaviour of 122 users, and that the documented research team
                     collaboration was analysed in order to better understand how interdisciplinary
                     research within the digital humanities works, this study does have clear limitations.
                     We used a mixed-method approach to conduct our qualitative research. This choice was
                     informed by both methodological and practical concerns: we wanted to triangulate
                     insights, while simultaneously adapting our methods to specific research settings.
                     This is why think-aloud protocols were supplemented with questionnaires, research
                     diaries and focus group sessions. This mixed-method approach relied on the team’s
                     collective expertise and as a result helped to translate project insights into new

                        More often than not, digital humanities are described in terms of how the
                        computational turn has taken effect in the humanities, thereby mirroring
                        all-encompassing processes of the datafication of modern society [<a class="ref" href="#schafer2017">Schäfer and Van Es 2017</a>, 15]. In this article, we look at what this computational work means for
                        the boundaries between disciplines, in terms of interdisciplinary collaboration
                        practices. Collaboration between different disciplines and different skill-sets is
                        key in digital humanities projects [<a class="ref" href="#vangorp2019">Van Gorp and Bron 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#klein2015">Klein 2015</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#masson2017">Masson 2017</a>]. With collaboration comes the need for translations of
                        concepts and methods. Furthermore, and especially within disciplines that focus on
                        negotiations between actors to delineate how technological artefacts are
                        developed, brokering work itself is recognized as a shaping actor [<a class="ref" href="#oldenziel2006">Oldenziel et al. 2006</a>], even at the level of project management [<a class="ref" href="#tabak2017">Tabak 2017</a>]

                     <div class="ptext" id="p12">Masson describes two trends in digital humanities research that relate to the core
                        objectives of this paper: (1) the critical engagement with digital tools and data,
                        and (2) the growing tendency to refer to digital humanities research as
                        transdisciplinary, drawing into focus the work of creating a “shared conceptual
                        framework” [<a class="ref" href="#masson2017">Masson 2017</a>, 35] by collaborating disciplines. Transdisciplinarity contrasts
                        with interdisciplinary and multidisciplinarity in the sense that the former is
                        transformative, while interdisciplinarity is concerned with linking and
                        integrating, and multidisciplinarity juxtaposes disciplines [<a class="ref" href="#klein2010">Klein 2010</a>, 16].
                        Transdisciplinary research may emerge from interdisciplinary collaboration, when
                        “fundamental epistemological shifts occur” [<a class="ref" href="#austin2008">Austin et al. 2008</a>, 557].</div>

                        shows how, in our project, critical tool engagement informs the collaborative
                        brokering practice of an interdisciplinary research team. Tool user testing not
                        only informs tool development, but also fundamentally shapes the interdisciplinary
                        team’s negotiation practices, especially regarding what is deemed important or
                        within the scope of the research project for each involved researcher and
                        represented discipline. Ultimately, the analysis shows that while this project was
                        interdisciplinary, it never transcended disciplinary concerns to realize a shared
                        conceptual – transdisciplinary – space.</div>

                        Boundary objects are defined as objects “both adaptable to different viewpoints

                        file as part of project management efforts. The content of this file underlines
                        that interdisciplinary collaboration requires a constant eagerness to engage in

                        material engagement with the tool DIVE+ as a boundary object. DIVE+ is an open
                        linked exploratory search browser that facilitates the exploration of diverse
                        archival and museum collections, and allows researchers to investigate how
                        different media objects, events, people and concepts can be compared, connected,
                        and contextualized. Within Library and Information Sciences, the process of
                        information search and retrieval has been described as consisting of different
                        phases, including exploration. Kuhlthau proposes a six-stage model of information
                        searching, that relates search stages to phases of uncertainty, and observes that
                        “the model reveals a search process in which a person is seeking meaning in the
                        course of seeking information” [<a class="ref" href="#kuhlthau2017">Kuhlthau 2017</a>, 2233]. Exploration is described as
                        the third stage, in which a searcher experiences a “dip” of confidence after
                        having selected a number of interesting sources. Exploration leads to feelings of
                        uncertainty, as a user encounters sources that do not “fit smoothly with
                        previously held constructs” [<a class="ref" href="#kuhlthau2017">Kuhlthau 2017</a>]. Exploration and exploratory search are
                        investigatory activities triggered by a user’s need and willingness to learn and
                        develop new knowledge [<a class="ref" href="#marchionini2006">Marchionini 2006</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#mirizzi2010">Mirizzi et al. 2010</a>, 39]. White
                        and Roth furthermore emphasize that exploratory searchers “aim to solve complex
                        problems” and that exploratory search itself is “open-ended, persistent, and
                        multi-faceted” (<a href="#white2009">2009</a>). Exploratory search can therefore be regarded as an
                        iterative process, likened to solving puzzles [<a class="ref" href="#sauer2016">Sauer and De Rijke 2016</a>] or playing

                        surprising visualised connections), is based on the conviction that patterns in

                        only interested in how users can form new research questions and encounter
                        research ideas as they engage in exploratory search with LOD, but also draw
                        attention to a parallel between LOD and interdisciplinary collaboration. Exploring
                        LOD is similar to exploring interdisciplinary research possibilities; both happen

                        zones at the same time. DIVE+ becomes a boundary object for these collections (at
                        the data level), while also performing the function of boundary object for the
                        collaborating disciplines. The zone of interactional expertise is engaged by
                        addressing user interactions with the browser. LOD allows new unforeseen

                        triangulate results; individually, users were given exploratory search tasks,
                        answered surveys and (post-task) questionnaires about their experiences. This was
                        combined with collaborative tasks, where small groups worked together to create
                        posters about their search experiences and their ideas about exploratory search.
                        User studies were conducted by means of interactive workshops hosted at different
                        universities to include the users’ actual work settings.</div>

                        and users filled out a post task questionnaire. In other sessions, tasks were not
                        accompanied by a think-aloud protocol, but by a questionnaire. This was done to
                        not disturb other users in the room, as they were completing tasks in a single,

                        worked together in small groups of 3-4 people to draw their research process and
                        trajectory. The main question they all worked with was: How would you visualize
                        your research journey, and what is the (ideal) role of exploratory search in this
                        process? During plenary sessions posters were discussed and research findings

                     Klein, and Star and Griesemer, DIVE+ was the project’s boundary object and its
                     trading zone of interaction from the outset. Discussions revolved around how to
                     investigate the ways in which DIVE+ supports exploration, how to translate insights
                     about use into browser and interface changes, and how to disseminate research insights

                     expertise” [<a class="ref" href="#klein2015">Klein 2015</a>, 140]. In the team meetings, this exchange centred around discussing
                     the possibilities of LOD, and how users could be asked to reflect on the usefulness
                     of LOD via the DIVE+ search browser. Specifically, what methods could be used to
                     understand user engagement with DIVE+, and how users understand the tool and LOD?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">The team settled on a mixed-method approach that used exploratory search tasks and
                     think-aloud protocols (used more commonly in human computer interaction studies),
                     as
                     well as research diaries and focus groups (that are employed more readily in
                     qualitative social science and humanities research). The mixed-method approach relied
                     on the team’s collective expertise. This is not trivial: specific experts are
                     involved in the project because they are experts in specific user research
                     methodologies, and are willing to contribute this expertise for the project’s
                     collective benefit. Conversely, these methods were also chosen because these
                     specifically helped the involved researchers translate project insights into new
                     knowledge for dissemination within their respective fields.</div>

                     necessitated another step in the collaboration process, in which interdisciplinary
                     collaboration led to clashes in epistemological outlook and understanding. For
                     example, the tensions over the meaning and use of the term ‘narrative’ between
                     researchers based in the humanities and those in computational science exemplify the
                     type of translation problems that can arise during interdisciplinary collaboration.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Whereas the media studies researchers relied on thick descriptions of what
                     ‘narrative’ means to the users in order to reflect on the role of narrativization
                     in
                     research practices, their user study work also needed to lead to user interface
                     recommendations, as well as recommendations for the overarching Media Suite. In other
                     words, user feedback and reflections had to be translated into material suggestions,
                     as per the project’s objectives. A clear example of this are the team discussions
                     about and the understanding of what ‘narrative’ means in the context of users’
                     research practices within DIVE+, and what this difference in meaning-attribution means
                     in terms of interface functionality and design. For instance, not all users that
                     partook in the user studies were comfortable with the notion that they create
                     narratives while doing research. As one (media) historian notes: “I believe that the
                     narrative metaphor does not really apply to my research, because I do not produce
                     sequential data, but rather a meta-structure, which cannot be told as a story” (Respondent B-P17)
                     . Yet for media researchers who are interested in audio-visual production
                     processes, such as image researchers, creating narratives is part of their core
                     research work. Narrative is thus a multi-interpretable container term that cannot
                     easily be translated in a one-size fits all UI.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">On the level of the search browser, the developers of DIVE+ referred to generated
                     exploration paths as ‘search narratives’, as these ‘retell’ the user’s search
                     history. This, however, lead to user misunderstandings over how they can become
                     storytellers without being able to annotate, add, or shuffle the search results
                     within the exploration path. For the humanities researchers on the interdisciplinary
                     team, ‘narrative’ was also closely connected to the desire to meaningfully edit or
                     comment upon search results. The humanities scholars struggled to view
                     ‘auto-generated narratives’ as research stories; without a way to add an
                     interpretation to the narrative, the humanities users felt a lack of agency over the
                     research narrative. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">To the involved information and computer scientists however, the concept of
                     ‘narrative’ was irrevocably tied to a user’s search history. Ultimately, the research
                     team’s media scholars suggested to change this notion of a ‘search narrative’ to a
                     ‘search journey’, thereby preventing future misunderstandings between team members
                     and between the team and the test users. The dispute over a term like ‘narrative’
                     shows that developing a shared vocabulary means discussing disciplinary differences.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">A similar discussion emerged about the idea of how DIVE+ was to be an ‘event-centric’
                     browser. Initially, the browser included the option to search for events. However,
                     in
                     large part because of the ambiguity of this concept (when is something an event?),
                     this idea was eventually abandoned. Discussions over terms such as ‘narrative’ and
                     ‘event’ were followed up with a collective re-interpreting or translating of the term
                     from the point of view of the users, in order to make alterations to the search
                     browser and UI that would reflect this user interpretation and to avoid what has been
                     referred to as the “I-methodology” [<a class="ref" href="#akrich1995">Akrich 1995</a>], where “designers consider
                     themselves as representative of the users” [<a class="ref" href="#oudshoorn2004">Oudshoorn et al. 2004</a>, 41].</div>

                     engaged in. Beyond translation, brokering also means convincing the other team
                     members of how users seemed to interpret their interactions with DIVE+ and with LOD.
                     In this case, the discussions about the meaning of ‘narrative’ and ‘event’ that users
                     attributed to these terms gained more agency in the brokering practice: the
                     epistemological outlook and interpretations of the users involved in tool testing
                     became key to material or technological changes in the browser. The data that was
                     collected as part of the user studies becomes part of an interactional expertise
                     trading zone; it is not only DIVE+ that connects the members of the research team
                     as
                     a boundary object, but also the data that is collected about DIVE+ and its use (and
                     possible subsequent analysis of that data to publish about the project!) that gives
                     the team discussions, and decisions, its momentum. This data is also part of the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">The DIVE+ interface allows users to search for keywords, persons, and locations
                     within 4 collections. Clicking on a search result provides a more detailed
                     description of an entity, or, for example, allows the user to play the audio-visual
                     file that contains the search query. This gives, as one user reports, searching with
                     DIVE+, a sense of “just diving in without knowing what you will end up with” (Respondent B-P12).
                     The fact that connections between entities are made visible is one of the described
                     strengths of the browser, as it “lets you see connections and thus shows you the
                     meaning of AV content” (Respondent A-P18). </div>

                     tool as useful to gain a quick overview of how entities are related, and what kinds
                     of materials are accessible and related to particular search queries. At the same
                     time, they miss context to ground the material as “real connections still have to be
                     made in an old and traditional way… in the mind of the researcher. (...) It is more
                     about the metadata than about the actual content” (Respondent B-P2). Users also indicate that
                     while the browser could potentially spark new research questions, this is hampered
                     by
                     the lack of transparency about <em class="emph">why</em> certain entities are
                     related: DIVE+’s UI does not inherently explicate the connections it draws across
                     LOD
                     entities for the user. This also relates to questions that arose in the focus group
                     discussions after using DIVE+: how are entities labelled as events in the tool, what
                     is an event? Based on the user feedback, the DIVE+UI was adapted to give users the
                     possibility to contextualize data by sorting search results by collection. This
                     affords users a clearer view of what they are exploring. </div>

                     exploration, because it offers an alternative way to interact with different data
                     collections. However, users also felt that the tool lacks direct research benefits
                     because searching with DIVE+ is time consuming, has a steep learning curve, and its
                     search functions are counter-intuitive. Users further questioned what kind of
                     knowledge is afforded by linked data. We will expand on this last observation,
                     because it directly mirrors our findings about brokering as translation and
                     consensus-making within interdisciplinary work.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45"> One of the premises of DIVE+ is that, by offering exploration of entities across
                     4
                     different collections, researchers may encounter materials in new ways, which will
                     allow researchers to ask new questions. This idea was supported by user feedback,
                     as
                     exploratory search is deemed to “[allow] the adaptation of research questions in an
                     iterative fashion” (Respondent A-P1). However, exploration is limited by the knowledge graph
                     that these collections, together, create. In other words, search is limited by the
                     ways in which entities have been made discoverable, and how these have been labelled
                     (e.g., as persons). The micro-granularity of search that is afforded by linked data
                     would seem to allow more fine-grained search results. Yet, for the users this meant
                     that they became more sceptical of what they were finding. Who, after all, is doing
                     the labelling? In other words, apart from voicing a need for (collection) context
                     to
                     be able to interpret what they were seeing, users were questioning the transparency
                     of the search results, and who was defining terms and setting boundaries around these
                     objects. Within DIVE+ and interdisciplinary research alike, the tensions manifested
                     within the boundaries of the conversation as much as within its content.</div>

                     narrative seemed less intuitive to the users than referring to this feature as a
                     search journey. The actual narrative, it was deemed, is related to the historical
                     narrative that the user is trying to form about a set of events in the past. Yet,
                     users saw possibilities to enhance the exploration path functionalities by
                     incorporating the possibility to add annotations; adding notes about how the user
                     sees connections between two suggested linked entities enables the researcher to feel
                     that they are creating narratives. Key to this understanding of narrative creation
                     is
                     the sense that annotation gives the user the “powerful tool and an important strategy
                     not only to tell events, but above all to interpret them and therefore to attribute
                     meaning, relevance and to understand reality with more awareness and to transform
                     it” (Respondent E-P7)
                     . Giving researchers the agency to annotate created exploration paths into
                     narratives more readily integrates the tool into existing research processes. This
                     could be useful as “during the process of collecting data, the narrative might
                     change, for media researchers might find information that changes their research
                     question and primary focus” (Respondent E-P7).</div>

                     a
                     clear context. The user studies show that (digital) humanities scholars greatly value
                     visualizations of historical events in narratives, but still struggle with
                     contextualizing the linked data presented in DIVE+. Adding user-generated annotations
                     to the suggested connections between LOD entities will benefit their
                     contextualization, as it would allow users to reflect on the entity, its source, and

                     humanities scholars greatly value visualizations of events in narratives, but
                     struggle with contextualizing the linked data presented in DIVE+. Granting users more
                     agency in the creation of narratives, by allowing them to annotate related entities
                     in the interface’s exploration path, is expected to support this contextualization
                     process. On the level of collaboration between disciplines, the case shows that
                     interdisciplinarity necessitates the ability to work together in a transdisciplinary
                     manner. This means that interdisciplinary collaboration requires the forming of a
                     shared conceptual or even community practice in which brokering takes the shape of
                     not only discussing and negotiating about project management and deliverables, but
                     also requires an almost literal translation of epistemological considerations, in
                     this case about the meaning of a term such as ‘narrative’ or ‘event’. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">Overall, this then demands that researchers act in a self-reflexive manner throughout
                     collaborations: sharing explicit awareness of how their disciplinary background
                     shapes methodological considerations, their understanding of what is considered to
                     be
                     knowledge, and how the practice of collaborating shifts or does not shift these
                     understandings. Masson’s observation that transdisciplinary work demands a “shared
                     conceptual framework” [<a class="ref" href="#masson2017">Masson 2017</a>, 35] seems fitting here, with the additional observation
                     that creating this framework demands active and open ‘exploration’ within the
                     interdisciplinary team. In the interactional expertise trading zone, researchers from
                     different disciplines need to broker their views, methods, and terminology, to reach
                     consensus and move forward. The interdisciplinary dialogue around the boundary object
                     DIVE+ gave meaning to this collaboration; without continuous brokering work, this
                     project would not have led to fruitful insights about the user interface of DIVE+,
                     about users’ perceptions of meaning-creation that are afforded by linked data, or
                     about the collaboration itself. </div>

                     played by the process of developing interactional expertise, of engaging in boundary
                     work required to realize project deliverables that include an optimized exploratory
                     search browser as a boundary object. The object seems to, also in project
                     deliverables, take on a larger role: the tool is at the centre of conference
                     presentations and publications, whereas the joint discussions and the collaborative
                     work in producing the object are seemingly left aside. Tool development and project
                     deliverables trump reflections about process. Admittedly, this seems inherent to work
                     on any kind of research project. This is also why we feel it is important to connect
                     a focus on (technical) deliverables to how the interdisciplinary team executed their
                     project. While this focus on deliverables and tool recommendation realization seems
                     to align with earlier mentioned ideas about digital humanities as a ‘neoliberal
                     field’ that is focused on computation and the development of tools for tools’ sake,
                     the project also illustrates that interpretation and reflections on interpretation
                     matter within projects such as these. In the end, “it’s not what the software does,
                     it’s what the user does” [<a class="ref" href="#macleod2009">MacLeod 2009</a>]. Analysing the work that goes into boundary
                     work provides an opportunity to pick apart the fabric of much-valued
                     interdisciplinary collaboration, to help pinpoint how researchers from different
                     disciplines can understand one another. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p56">We would like to conclude with the observation that there is an interesting parallel
                     between the technological affordances of LOD and interdisciplinary digital humanities
                     research. Clearly, semantics play a decisive role in both: linked data allows for
                     semantic linking of entities, and transdisciplinary collaboration is about brokering
                     and translating terms and meanings in such a manner that the entire group understands
                     something in a similar way. Drawing out how this interdisciplinary brokering takes
                     shape in practice requires working towards a sociology of digital humanities; mapping
                     interdisciplinary exchanges in practice. This, in turn, will also bolster an
                     understanding of how semantic connections and linked data can further enrich
                     knowledge creation and collaboration. </div>
