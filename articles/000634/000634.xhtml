                  <p>As algorithmic models increasingly assist, judge, and manage human life, a growing
                     amount of scrutiny, criticism, and backlash has ensued, calling into question the
                     violence of such powerful applications and demanding a renewed focus on bias, ethics,
                     and governance. At the same time elite academic institutions and massive tech firms
                     have been adaptively adept at the capture and depoliticizing of its critics <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#whittaker2021">#whittaker2021</a></span>. Calls for a fundamental reckoning with the logics and
                     violences of computation have been largely disciplined into niche new industries of
                     expertise which Phan, Goldenfein, Mann, and Kuch refer to as “economies of
                     virtue.” In response, this essay explores Black Computational Thought as a
                     critical intervention into the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought mapped onto
                     and
                     subtending contemporary computational logics. By placing computation within such
                     genealogical bounds, we are free to ask the question, what other proximal places
                     might we look to to recover computational practices that challenge colonial logics
                     of
                     coercion? What other genres lay in wait? Black Computational Thought holds open these
                     proximal possibilities and directs our attention to the quotidian, social, opaque,
                     woven, and fugitive practices of computation born from Black diasporic movement. </p>

                     Smith. Following the rise of Ronald Reagan and his ascendence to the presidency in
                     1980 this poem is one of escape, incommensurability, and refusal in the face of an
                     authoritarian shift, reductive politics, and the normalization of precarity. In
                     short, this is a poem of survival beyond the regulating edges of possibility. The

                     newly liberated ﬁnancial markets that mark the Reagan administration and a stark
                     shift towards neoliberal economic policy in the U.S. This rise corresponds to an
                     increase in supply chain logistics, managerial monitoring, just in time production,
                     deindustrialization, the contraction of public benefits, shifts in surplus state
                     capacity, the financialization of the market, and builds the architecture for a
                     global marketplace later inscribed through Free Trade Agreements [<a class="ref" href="#gilmore2007">Gilmore 2007</a>]

                     into a wobbly pyramid, the labeling of the price, the line break before “Each,”
                     are intentional moves that draw our attention to what Murphy would call the
                     economization of life. By this she means, “a historically speciﬁc
                     regime of valuation hinged to the macrological ﬁgure of national ‘economy.’
                     It names the practices that differentially value and govern life in terms of their
                     ability to foster the macroeconomy of the nation-state, such as life’s ability to
                     contribute to the gross domestic product (GDP ) of the nation. It is distinct from
                     commodifying life or biocapital, or from the broader history of using
                     quantiﬁcation to monetize practices”

                     ability to contribute to larger consolidated national and international markets.
                     Additionally, she is pointing to the transposition of this valuation into a larger
                     logic underpinned by quantiﬁcation, aggregation, scale, calculability, and
                     monetization. Central to the functioning of this shift is an imposition of
                     separability<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e347">[1]</a> and the reification of the individual. The pomegranates are
                     not sold in pairs or by the bunch but each. Each pomegranate is assigned an exact
                     value as an individual. Returning to Jordan, she describes this transposition as
                     natural order being restored”. As the poem continues, Jordan describes vividly the
                     violences and repercussions of this restoration. </div>

                     climate crisis, mass global displacement, a rapidly growing global pandemic, and
                     intensified state sanctioned and extra legal racial violence centered in xenophobia,
                     anti-blackness, and cis-hetero patriarchy. While the edges<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e402">[2]</a> of this violence continues to
                     expand — encircling those previously thought safe, hunkered behind thin walls of
                     whiteness, denial, or entitlement, the scale of this precarity seems to be matched
                     only by the consolidation of land, computing power, and capital. These hubristic
                     endeavors seek to remap our social, educational, occupational, commercial, and sex

                     critical aim at the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought as it maps onto and
                     subtends contemporary computational logics. Black Computational Thought denaturalizes
                     these residues and situates them as spatial temporal onto-epistemologies<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e540">[12]</a>
                     that are highly narrow and specific, rather than universal, axiomatic, or natural.
                     Instead these residues are entangled with and are the basis for past and continued

                     totalizing violence of enclosing land and labor. By placing computation within such
                     genealogical bounds, we are free to ask the question, what other proximal places

                     of computation born from Black diasporic movement. Blackness here is always in an
                     appositional love affair with queerness, transness, and feminist orientations of the
                     world that fight the simplicity of calculated separability, and instead contend with
                     their relationship to difference, kin, collectivity, risk, non-normativity,

                     Jordan speaks of a coming together that is raucous, messy, whirling, spilling, and
                     free. Coming together is an effusive act. It is a particular voluptuous
                     disintegration. It is the pomegranate sucked by tongue and lips. This stands in sharp
                     contrast with the wobbly, precariously stacked pyramid described in the opening.

                     to
                     a cacophonous spilling overflow. Coming together is an act of both encounter and

                     Essays on Radical Black Feminism, Marquis Bey describes this coming together as
                     “ the critical intimacy we share with one another when we come
                     together to pull things apart”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bey2019">Bey 2019</a>]. Bey describes this mode of being as fugitive. In this
                     section I will engage Bey’s thoughts on Blackness, gender, and fugitivity as critical
                     practices for enacting Jordan’s call to come together. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13"> For Bey, fugitivity is primarily a praxis that makes real other ways of living
                     together in the world. On this they state, “ It is not
                     necessarily a model or template; it is, in fact, deﬁant of these. It is a ﬂash, a
                     glimmer, a ﬂicker that forces us to see and do differently. It engenders our doing
                     something, not our being something; it engenders our moving with others on unruly
                     grounds”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bey2019">Bey 2019</a>]. This is a crucial passage for thinking about the intimacy
                     of relations that fugitivity can offer beyond the individual as the standard unit
                     of
                     measure. To engage in the necessary work of undoing together, means to live in the
                     postures and folds of the fugitive as a perpetual state of becoming otherwise through
                     actions taken together. Blackness holds that there is no reconciliation to be found
                     in the individual Subject, that it cannot be taken for granted as the site of
                     liberty. Blackness rememberers the original sin from which liberty was born, and
                     frees us from unquestioningly returning to it. It then follows that Blackness exposes
                     the limits at the end of justice, calls into question attempts at inclusion,
                     dismantles the center from which the invitation of inclusion<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e595">[16]</a> is sent, and cracks the logics of categorical
                     purity that even whiteness fails to uphold. Or as Bey would say, “'Blackness' names, gives discursive ﬂesh to, a critical existence, a disobedient
                     world-working, an irruption upon the norm that crisisizes the scene so we can
                     reimagine the terms and meanings of the world in which we live”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bey2019">Bey 2019</a>, 29]. It Is important to stress that Blackness in this
                     conception is born from the racial but doesn’t reside there. Blackness is a critical
                     mode of being that struggles through the violences of modernity to foster other ways
                     of being because it must. Fugitivity as the repertoire of Blackness reminds us of
                     the
                     price of admission, the cost of subjection. Blackness is carefully attuned to the
                     residual, the left over, the over ﬂow that spills, through, and beyond subjective
                     categorization and ﬁxed normality. It collects this excess in overlooked corners
                     ﬁnding togetherness in the undoing, spreading into aberrant intimacies of how to be
                     together in the vulnerability of non subjects. Blackness, as a way of being in
                     relation, is in fact a natural disorder of voluptuous disintegration.</div>

                     its fugitive resistance to hegemonic subject formations. This resistance to
                     categorization extends to interrupt the projected stability of such attendant
                     formations such as gender and sexuality. Race, gender, and sexuality are not mere
                     categories additively summed, but are also relational practices that yield different
                     social and political formulations. This is important as it contrasts sharply with
                     mechanistic understandings of being by which identity is merely a summation of

                     race, gender, and sexuality as immanent processes, not destinations. For Bey this
                     kind of fugitive relationship to gender opens the space for a particular kind of self
                     determination. While self determination has held a long track record within Black
                     political movement building and radical thought, Bey works to remove it from its more
                     militant nationalistic trappings and instead positions it as a commitment to each
                     others’ processes of becoming. On this Bey writes,</div>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                     <p class="ptext">

                        presuming nothing, letting them show us as much or as little of themselves as they
                        wish. This is how we form a different world worth living within: the radicality of
                        all this movement work we’re doing rests in the ability to be fractured and
                        critiqued by the forgotten, to give oneself, radically open, to the unknownness of
                        the other, and to accept as a gift the various iterations of “Y’all need to get

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">This understanding of self determination that Bey offers cannot be held individually
                     but is always a practice of relating to others while moving through unknown currents.
                     Gender here is not something that can be presupposed or preﬁgured. This also begins
                     to open the space for engaging gender as a non-proprietary relationship. Bey draws
                     a
                     relationship between one’s ability to determine their own gender and the openness
                     of
                     receiving that determination by another. This reﬂects some of Bey’s earlier points
                     about the intimacy that fugitivity offers in coming undone together. In this fugitive
                     space the assumption to know someone based on their temporal presentation is
                     undermined. Such a practice of intimacy begins with compassion and humility to ask,
                     return, and re-return. This leaves space for the ﬂuidity of gender while not eliding
                     the ability to ﬁnd temporary homes in its folds. Coming undone is not a permanent
                     place of residence. This is crucial as it doesn’t disavow the material ways in which
                     we move through the world and the imposition of gender. Rather, at its best this
                     fugitive gesture allows for a reﬂection of the power relations by which subject
                     formations occur. This posture recognizes the power in normative gender formation
                     as
                     a particular performance and asks where power might be built elsewhere.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">Thinking fugitivity in this way sets it apart from the enclosure of method,
                     technique, or model and instead bears a strong resemblance to Diana Taylor’s work
                     on
                     repertoire. Rather than a static archive, repertoire “ enacts
                     embodied memory: performances, gestures, orality, movement, dance, singing — in
                     short, all those acts usually thought of as ephemeral, nonreproducible
                     knowledge”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#taylor2007">Taylor 2007</a>, 20]. She goes on to state, “The
                     repertoire requires presence: people participate in the production and
                     reproduction of knowledge by ‘being there,’ being a part of the transmission.
                     As opposed to the supposedly stable objects in the archive, the actions that are
                     the repertoire do not remain the same. The repertoire both keeps and transforms
                     choreographies of meaning”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">This focus on fugitivity as repertoire, as embodied knowledge, as gesture, and
                     movement extends Bey’s fugivitity from being a critical response to subjection and
                     raises questions about the ways in which such a radical undoing can also be a
                     practice of information sharing and knowledge production. The repertoire requires
                     presence as its mode of transmission. Through the presence of participants coming
                     together again and again, knowledge is produced and reproduced. It is held in the
                     fleshy extensions of those that share space on unruly grounds. In this context the
                     transmission of information is not separate from the material embodiment of those
                     involved. In fact it is dependent on material bodies in relation. The data is encoded
                     and transmitted through acts taken together. It remains local.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e645">[17]</a> As a mode of information sharing
                     and knowledge production the fugitive repertoire is encased in shared cultural
                     practices made available through the intimacy of coming together. It is not
                     interoperable or modular. Instead it requires something of you. To partake in the
                     knowledge you must learn the choreography, the gestures, the furtive movements. The
                     repertoire makes explicit endured agreements of trust, building practices of
                     interdependence in order to share risk together<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e656">[18]</a>. Both Bey and
                     Taylor stress the importance of presence and “being there” as vital components of
                     engaging in unstable practices together. There is a productive redundancy here. The
                     vectors that Bey and Taylor describe are circular<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e664">[19]</a>. They thrive on their
                     ability to repeat and return — recursive, not linear. Such acts require endurance,
                     an
                     endurance capacious enough to meet uncertainty, an endurance that supports proximity
                     without fixing boundaries. This makes self determination an act of coming together
                     again and again to be undone while holding the intimacy of how we can be together
                     in
                     motion. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">My engagements with fugitivity are an attempt to struggle with what it means to live
                     in the theory of fugitivity. Rather than just theorizing on what it can promise, I
                     am
                     interested in how we can begin to recognize a fugitive praxis. In doing so I turn
                     to
                     Tina Campt’s seminal text, Listening to Images. Rather than speaking to fugitivity
                     as
                     a constant exhaustive physical act of movement and escape, Campt is interested in
                     the
                     quiet and quotidian. Campt works from this position toward a theory of fugitivity
                     and
                     situated understanding of the politics of refusal. Writing on this Campt states,
                     “the quotidian must be understood as a practice rather than an
                     act/ion. It is a practice honed by the dispossessed in the struggle to create
                     possibility within the constraints of everyday life. For blacks in diaspora, both
                     quiet and the quotidian are mobilized as everyday practices of refusal”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#campt2017">Campt 2017</a>, 4]. Here Campt is quite clear that fugitivity cannot
                     only be used as metaphor or merely an act of escape but is held in the ongoing
                     practices of the dispossessed to survive in a world that isn’t ﬁt for their survival.
                     These practices are found in sites of everyday life. This in part returns fugitivity
                     to the body without entombing it, it is where ﬂight meets the ground, without
                     landing, it is in the sweat that permeates pores, the exhaustion as breath leaves
                     the
                     lungs, the smell of fresh soil during midnight maurades. It is a fugitivity that is
                     situated rather than ﬂattened, and made to spread so thinly that it is all
                     encompassing and ambiguous.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Keeping with this focus on the mundane, Campt works through identiﬁcation photography
                     as her primary material to think with. She theorizes these photographs has having
                     a
                     sonic quality that operates at a haptic level, only understood through feeling.
                     Borrowing from Georges Perec, she refers to these photographs as “infra-ordinary, — everyday practices we don’t always notice and whose seeming
                     insigniﬁcance requires excessive attention”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#campt2017">Campt 2017</a>, 8]. These infra-ordinary practices and objects are
                     moments of refusal that are essential for the possibilities of Black futurity. These
                     practices themselves, as fugitive refusal, should not be understood simply as
                     rebelliousness or revolt, but are born from an insistence to strive for futurity,
                     to
                     matter, to survive. Here is where the stakes and promise of fugitivity come into full
                     view. When put in relationship to futurity, the fugitive cannot remain a romanticized
                     ﬁgure freed from attachments, in constant pursuit of an ultimate unmediated freedom.
                     Rather, the fugitive is one who contends deeply with the daily violences of life to
                     be able to have a future beyond them. </div>

                     to break open the disciplining logics of rationality and separability. Fugitivity
                     at
                     its best is a repertoire that requires interdependence for care and regular
                     maintenance. I am invested in practices of computation that emphasize such
                     interdependencies while moving through the processes of sharing, storing, and making
                     meaning together. Here, the social and the technical are explicitly intertwined
                     rather than ignored or mechanistically separated. In what follows I hope to show how
                     fugitivity opens computation to being a practice in the making, co-constituted
                     through social repertoires and formations. It is not universal or standard but
                     operates through specific genres. I believe it is within such genres that we might
                     find social processes that make the space to return again and again while immersed

                     Computational Thought. I frame this discussion through David Golumbia’s
                     computationalism. In his text, The Cultural Logic of Computation, Golumbia makes a
                     distinction between computers and computationalism. For him computationalism is
                     “is the view that not just human minds are computers but that
                     mind itself must be a computer — that our notion of intellect is, at bottom,
                     identical with abstract computation, and that in discovering the principles of
                     algorithmic computation via the Turing Machine human beings have, in fact,
                     discovered the essence not just of human thought in practice but all thought in
                     principle”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#golumbia2009">Golumbia 2009</a>, 7]. Golumbia expands upon this term “as a commitment to the view that a great deal, perhaps all, of human
                     and social experience can be explained via computational processes”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#golumbia2009">Golumbia 2009</a>, 8]. Over the course of his text Golumbia tries to
                     show the ways that the digital computer inherits much of its logic from a
                     Post-Enlightenment high rationality. By engaging the work of Decartes, Hobbes, Kant,
                     and Liebnitz, Golumbia positions this rationality; “computationalism entails not merely rationalism per se, but a particular species
                     of rationalism with clear conceptual and historical weight, which we nevertheless
                     seem all too ready to forget”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#golumbia2009">Golumbia 2009</a>, 190]. The basis of Golumbia’s critique lies at the
                     episteme from which computational logics emerge solidified in formal reason and
                     syntax.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e720">[20]</a> Golumbia is attempting to show the ways that
                     computationalism understands cognition itself as an inherent computing process, and
                     by extension, all matters of phenomena in the world can be understood as a function
                     of computation. This eerily mirrors the Screen New Deal future that Klein details,
                     by
                     which the economization of life is aggregated, totalized, tracked, mined, and
                     brokered. This world is imagined as an ordered whole made of distinct intrinsically
                     different pieces that can only be understood through their secondary effects of
                     measure<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e722">[21]</a>. This is the
                     world that the economization of life emerges from and continues to validate. It is
                     the world of big data, Amazon Web Services, financialized global economies,
                     calculated abandonment, and Eric Schmidt. In this imagination of the world the
                     Subject is the only self determining thing gifted with cognition and capable of
                     measuring the rest of the world through modalities of difference and claims of
                     universality. In short the Subject is granted interiority. Golumbia reminds us that
                     this interiority is thought to operate upon the same mechanistic principles as a
                     computing device, taking in cold empiric data and making assessments and measures
                     through cognition. In fact this model often passes for objectivity and is upheld as
                     an ethical principle within much of computer science. It is a principle based on
                     separability, distance, and asociality. Accordingly to Golumbia “Interiority qua universal subjectivity emerges from numerical rationality applied
                     as an understanding of human subjectivity, and not vice versa. This is not to
                     reject the idea of subjectivity outside of rationalist modernity: it is rather to
                     suggest that the particular and elaborated form of interiority we associate with
                     present-day modernity underwrites an unexpected and radical mechanism”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#golumbia2009">Golumbia 2009</a>, 10]. This radical mechanism and its assumed
                     neutral evaluation sits at the center of much of modern representation and
                     performances of objectivity ethics. Bringing these insights from Golumbia into
                     conversation with Denise Ferreira da Silva, this “universal” ethic falls away is
                     in fact embodied within white European signification. da Silva argues that, “in both cases, cultural difference sustains a moral discourse, which
                     rests on the principle of separability. This principle considers the social as a
                     whole constituted of formally separate parts. Each of these parts constitutes a
                     social form, as well as geographically-historically separate units, and, as such,
                     stands differentially before the ethical notion of humanity, which is identified
                     with the particularities of white European collectives”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Through the principle of separability which da Silva grounds in Kantian reason, the
                     different pieces which are imagined as components of an ordered world are
                     incommensurable with each other. Their relationship is one of unbridgeable difference
                     and distance. The mechanism that Golumbia describes sits at the center of this
                     ordered world and is inscribed in the moral project of the human, written as white,
                     European, and male. Therefore the others of Europe can only be measured by their
                     difference to white European humanity and are therefore subjected to partial
                     protections through rights and partial violence. This undergirds one of da Silva’s
                     primary questions, “How the racial combines with other social

                     crisis?”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dasilva2007">Da Silva 2007</a>, xxx]. This also helps us begin to understand one of
                     my own questions which opens this article, Why does anti-blackness seem to
                     perpetually overdetermine and saturate the operating system regardless of who is
                     programming it? Because of the ways in which the Subject is written simultaneously
                     into white European embodiment as well as computationalist rationality, it will
                     continue to carry anti-blackness in its bowels even in the face of the most strident
                     claims of universality and objectivity. For this reason Black Computational Thought
                     allows for speculation beyond the Subject as mechanism, computing as
                     computationalism, and separability as ethics. To ground some of this
                     speculation<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e751">[22]</a> I work through a reading
                     of the Freedom Quilts as Black Computational Thought in practice. Though containing
                     many formal computational aspects<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e769">[23]</a>, this reading of the Freedom
                     Quilts is centered in computation as it works with Blackness to unsettle
                     computationalism, objectivity, separability, and the Subject. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">One of the primary tactics that informs the design and function of the Freedom Quilts
                     is the use of everyday objects to circulate information within traditional African
                     societies. Speaking on the power of everyday objects Tobin and Dobard state, “Communicating secrets using ordinary objects is very much a part of
                     African culture, in which familiarity provides the perfect cover. Messages can be
                     skillfully passed on through objects that are seen so often they become invisible.
                     These objects are creative expressions of African artisans and give tangible form
                     to the cultural and religious ideas of their kingdoms”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#tobin2000">Tobin and Dobard 2000</a>, 39]. Tobin and Dobard document this practice through
                     the role of the griot as the guardian of culture and societal history. Based in oral
                     traditions, the role of the griot was to remember and share ancestral lineage,
                     customs, beliefs, histories, and legends from generation to generation. The griots
                     “learned and taught via an oral tradition, based on memory,
                     aided by the use of specially designed mnemonic devices. Encoded staffs, stools,
                     memory boards, sculpture, and textiles chronicled the history of a people. But
                     only the griots and the diviners were able to read them”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#tobin2000">Tobin and Dobard 2000</a>, 40]. This practice is one that continued into the new
                     world as enslaved Africans held onto their cultural memories and combined them with
                     others stolen from their lands to create new creolized semiotic systems that crafted
                     convert ways for enslaved peoples to communication with each other, circulate
                     knowledge, and build wholly different cultural systems within the diaspora. These
                     creolized symbols were the basis for a visual language that gave new identities to
                     those for whom culture had been stripped as they were subjugated into objects. Here
                     the materiality and cultural legacies meet in the interface of the quilts themselves.
                     Repertoire becomes the means through which knowledge is archived and materialized
                     within cultural objects. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">The quilt code which Tobin and Dobard uncover, includes ten primary patterns and a
                     number of secondary patterns. Each pattern had two meanings, both to signal to those
                     enslaved to prepare to escape and to give clues to indicate safe directions on the
                     journey. Following these instructions enslaved people would know when to gather the
                     tools they would need for the coming journey, the time to escape from the plantation,
                     ways to navigate hundreds of miles to Cleveland (as a prominent location for
                     continued travel to free destinations in the North), places to find fresh clothes
                     and
                     shelter, and practices for recognizing other confidants. This mnemonic device was
                     used in addition to sampler quilts which held all ten primary patterns in sequence
                     to
                     aid in recognition while on the run. After leaving the plantation enslaved people
                     would encounter quilts bearing single patterns left in public to air. These quilts
                     became the constitutive matter that held together disparate subterranean connections.
                     Because the circulation of information traveled widely and lacked centralization,
                     the
                     mnemonic devices used and patterns themselves changed often to insulate from outside
                     parties learning and understanding the quilt code. For such a complex system to work
                     it required a tremendous amount of labor, maintenance, and shared risk. This means
                     that aside from the use of everyday objects, the making of shared diaspora cultures
                     through the combining and mixing of cultural artifacts gave rise to fugitive
                     formations themselves, in Bey’s sense of the word. </div>

                     interiority) that sees and measures the exterior world as a series of different
                     bodies upon which forces are acting. Instead the Freedom Quilts become a site in
                     which Blackness is being written through the creolization of symbols, meanings,
                     context, and codes that literally calculate pathways to fugitive escape and flight
                     from the plantation. Programmability, in this context, complicates the temporality
                     of
                     code as executable function, as cause and effect. The Freedom Quilts generate a type
                     of code that doesn’t execute automatically but makes the act of interpretation
                     explicit. While encountering quilts left in public fugitives would discern the code
                     and simultaneously have to read it in context, within the geography of placement.
                     In
                     this instance the executability of code is halted as a declarative axiomatic language
                     imagined within syntax. Code is not an absolute instruction but is read in addition
                     to landscape. Differing from the programming of second-order cybernetics, the
                     landscape is not reintegrated into code, making it workable. Instead the limit of
                     computation is held by the materiality of space, it is not transcended. Black people
                     on the run would read the code with the landscape and continue on their journey.
                     Computation in this instance does not need to be a totalizing logic that engulfs
                     everything but lives alongside bodies in motion, in relation to geography, reading

                     capture, from various geographic, historical, and cultural sites, are not fixed in
                     their ultimate difference upon which the only mediation is found through measurement.
                     Perhaps even more importantly the transparent center from which they are measured
                     is
                     not grounded in white European standards. Instead, Black people exchange and
                     reconstitute their own situated knowledges into new systems of information and
                     communication. This is difference without separability.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e830">[27]</a> This then opens computation to
                     practices of endured proximity. By this I mean that the measurability of difference
                     cannot be displaced and remade as intrinsic separation. That as we measure and
                     collect data about the external world, we cannot continue to think of ourselves as
                     transparent or incommensurable in our relationship to what is being indexed. Instead
                     we must contend with our relationship to the index. Black Computational Thought
                     grounds computational ethics in this practice of contention. It refuses imaginations
                     of the world by which calculable measurement is the only relationship between things
                     and pushes us to meaningfully engage difference as a relationship that we are
                     entangled within. Only by doing this will contemporary flights of liberation be
                     imaginable. In this formation, endured proximity supplants objectivity and
                     separability as the moral ground upon which to stand when working on data ethics,
                     bias, or algorithmic violence. Black Computational Thought attempts to open the space
                     for othered social formations that work in excess of measurable, separable
                     difference, and towards staying with the difficult work of proximity, trust,

                     Quilting bees became important gatherings where enslaved people “were able to compile facts regarding geography, landmarks, places to avoid,
                     obscure trails, mileage, and the locations of safe places where food and rest were

                     an individual, to go his/her own way, and yet to do so in concert with the

                     recovery of the fact that Black people have done some shit with numbers. It is an
                     epistemic confrontation with the logics of computation situated elsewhere and
                     challenges the very nature of what we consider computation to be and to have been.
                     It
                     is an argument for forms of computing embedded in technologies of living,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e903">[28]</a> connected to care work, to fullness,
                     to difference, and to shared practices of risky meaning making. Returning to Campt,
                     this is not a matter of hope, but is one of tense. She describes this tense as,
                     “humble, and strategic, subtle and discriminating. It is
                     devious and exacting. It’s not always loud and demanding. It is frequently quiet
                     and opportunistic, dogged and disruptive”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#campt2017">Campt 2017</a>, 17]. In thinking about futurity as tense Campt offers
                     what she calls, Black feminist futurity. Elaborating on this term she writes, “It strives for the tense of possibility that grammarians refer to as
                     the future real conditional or that which will have had to happen. The grammar of
                     black feminist futurity is a performance of a future that hasn’t yet happened but
                     must….It is the power to imagine beyond current fact and to envision that which is
                     not, but must be. It’s a politics of preﬁguration that involves living the future
                     now — as imperative rather than subjunctive — as a striving for the future you
                     want to see, right now, in the present”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#campt2017">Campt 2017</a>, 17]. In her understanding of futurity there are no
                     guarantees, there is no safety in eventuality, there is nothing promised to us. In
                     the face of this, Black feminist futurity is one that must be made. It is an
                     understanding of the future real conditional, of that which would have had to have
                     happened for us to exist in the future. In this sense futurity is present work upheld
                     by the daily practices of refusal. This makes clear the stakes of fugitive
                     computational practice and the work of Black Computational Thought. It is not a site
                     of salvation or assimilation but instead does the deep work of radical Black
                     feminism, “grappling with precarity, while maintaining an active
                     commitment to the everyday labor of creating an alternative future”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#campt2017">Campt 2017</a>, 16]. I believe this is the call that closes June
                     Jordan’s epic poem, written almost 37 years prior to Campt’s text, towards a natural
                     disorder. My engagements with fugitive computation are indebted to understanding this
                     natural disorder, this turn to ensuring a future through fugitive acts taken now.

                     mobilizes it from Kant. In “On Difference Without
                     Separability” da Silva identifies separability as a key element of
                     Kantian thought that still influences contemporary political and ethical projects.
                     Separability is the idea that “all that can be known about the things of the
                     world is gathered through formal constructs such as time, space, quantity,
                     quality, relation, and modality”

                     justification for variously hierarchical structures which rationalize some people
                     as human and deserving of ethical consideration and others as less than human and

                     Aimee Cesaire’s call for a new science of the word. Wynter argues that humans are
                     hybridly evolved as both bios and mythoi, meaning that our brains have evolved in
                     a way by which language and the semiotics we use to describe ourselves carry
                     meaning into scientific empiricism. Science then is never separate from the
                     social, cultural, and political context articulated through language. For this
                     reason Wynter describes humans as existing in different genres given the symbolic
                     and cultural context of language. This challenges universal rationality. I aim to
                     similarly challenge the universal assumptions that computation denotes, instead

                     spoken about risk multiple times. My interest in shared risk taking is to make
                     clear alternate ways to respond to the violent utility that predictive analytics
                     authorize. As prediction seeks to identify and control risk preemptively, it
                     simultaneously reifies the Subject as a self determining being in conflict with
                     exteriority. Violence becomes naturalized and justified as a requirement for
                     maintaining the interiority of the Subject. This same logic undergirds predictive
                     analytics and risk assessment models justifying violence as a way to meet
                     perceived risk, read as non-white, poor, ungovernable, and irrational. In the book
                     Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During This Crisis (And the Next) Dean Spade
                     writes, “Mutual aid can also generate boldness and a
                     willingness to defy illegitimate authority. Taking risks with a group for a

                     the foundation upon which computer scientists began to remake the mind as a
                     computer. Syntax in this context acts as a formal logic system built on protocol
                     and hierarchy. </span></div>

                     Silva’s article “On Different Without Separability.” In
                     it she marks a shift in 17th century continental philosophy which focused on the
                     “secondary (efficient) causes” of motion. This focus on efficient causes
                     reduced the complexity of being into observable differences made certain through
                     measurement. This certainty made a mechanistic world view possible by which
                     difference is irreducible and creates the contours by which our ethical
                     considerations for each other are limited and macerated. </span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e751"><span class="noteRef lang en">[22]  Here it is important to address the scrutiny and criticism
                     following Tobin and Dobard’s text <cite class="title italic">Hidden in Plain View: A
                        Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad</cite>. Since its
                     publication it has been the primary reference detailing the use of the Freedom
                     Quilts. It has also been a text engulfed in controversy. Much of this controversy
                     comes from quilt historians such as Barbara Brackman who point to various gaps in
                     the historic documentation to confirm Tobin and Dobard’s account. Brackman’s
                     argument tends to highlight the dearth of corroborating oral history accounts of
                     the quilts and discrepancies about the popular use and re-use of certain quilting
                     patterns such as The Log Cabin. Rather than prove the use of the quilts in either
                     Tobin and Dobard or Brackman’s accounts I find promise in Saidiya Hartman’s work
                     struggling with the archive as both an index of violence and an incomplete
                     accounting. In “Venus in Two Acts” Hartman offers a
                     method of critical fabulation to operate beyond the empiric authority of the
                     archive and its inability to render the lives of the enslaved beyond objects. On
                     this she writes, “I have attempted to jeopardize the status of
                     the event, to displace the received or authorized account, and to imagine what
                     might have happened or might have been said or might have been done. By
                     throwing into crisis “what happened when” and by exploiting the ‘transparency
                     of sources as fictions of history,’ I wanted to make visible the
                     production of disposable lives (in the Atlantic slave trade and, as well, in
                     the discipline of history), to describe ‘the resistance of the object,’ if
                     only by first imagining it, and to listen for the mutters and oaths and cries
                     of the commodity”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hartman2008">Hartman 2008</a>]. It is in this manner that I am attempting to
                     approach my work with the Freedom Quilts. While the exact mechanics of the use of
                     the quilts is in contention, the practices of enslaved people to engage in
                     exercises of trust building and information sharing along the plantation grapevine
                     cannot be ignored. Neither can the means of plotting and calculating paths of
                     escape from the plantation. I am actively choosing to engage these narratives in
                     ways that ascribe fugitive agency to Black people even without
                     properly proving the mechanics of their actions. </span></div>

                     looking at how lenticular logics structure racial representations and
                     epistemologies through UNIX protocols. In “U.S. Operating
                     Systems at Mid-Century: The Intertwining of Race and UNIX” McPherson
                     draws parallels between changing racial and political discourses and emerging
                     digital computing practices in the 1960s. Her argument focuses in part on the rule
                     of modularity as a particular principle within UNIX. She writes that this rule of
                     modularity was adopted by a nascent neoliberal state and used to discipline and
                     quell radical calls for liberation. On this she writes, “I am

                     the 1960s powerfully responds-across many registers-to the struggles for racial
                     justice and democracy that so categorized the U.S. at the time. Many of these
                     shifts were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
                     racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive

                     take up da Silva’s call to rethink the social beyond the separability proffered by
                     Kant and made certain through Cartesian logics. Rather than think the social
                     through Newtonian particle physics she pushes us to consider the strange effects
                     of quantum mechanics primarily nonlocality. Nonlocality refers to the phenomenon
                     by which the measurable properties of one particle instantaneously provide the
                     measurable properties of another particle regardless of the distance between the
                     two. Rather than understood as being separate individual entities they are
                     entangled together through a shared relationship. da Silva closes her essay
                     writing, “When nonlocality guides our imaging of the universe,
                     difference is not a manifestation of an unresolvable estrangement, but the
