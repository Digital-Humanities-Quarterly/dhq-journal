                  <p> Romi Ron Morrison is an interdisciplinary artist and researcher. Their work
                     investigates the spatial boundaries of race, ethics, and social infrastructure

                     their installations center Black diasporic technologies that challenge the
                     demands of an increasingly quantified world — reducing land into property, people
                     into digits, and knowledge into data. They are currently an Annenberg PhD

            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>As algorithmic models increasingly assist, judge, and manage human life, a growing
               amount of scrutiny, criticism, and backlash has ensued, calling into question the
               violence of such powerful applications and demanding a renewed focus on bias, ethics,
               and governance. At the same time elite academic institutions and massive tech firms
               have been adaptively adept at the capture and depoliticizing of its critics [Whittaker 2021]<!--<ptr
                  target="#whittaker2021"/>-->. Calls for a fundamental reckoning with the logics and
               violences of computation have been largely disciplined into niche new industries of
               expertise which Phan, Goldenfein, Mann, and Kuch refer to as <q>economies of
                  virtue.</q> In response, this essay explores Black Computational Thought as a
               critical intervention into the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought mapped onto and
               subtending contemporary computational logics. By placing computation within such
               genealogical bounds, we are free to ask the question, what other proximal places
               might we look to to recover computational practices that challenge colonial logics of
               coercion? What other genres lay in wait? Black Computational Thought holds open these
               proximal possibilities and directs our attention to the quotidian, social, opaque,
               woven, and fugitive practices of computation born from Black diasporic movement. </p>

            <head>Pomegranates…89 cents each</head>

            <p>These are the words that close June Jordan’s poignant poem, <title rend="quotes">From
                  Sea to Shining Sea</title>, published in 1983 in the the now seminal <title
                  rend="italic">Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology</title> edited by Barbara
               Smith. Following the rise of Ronald Reagan and his ascendence to the presidency in
               1980 this poem is one of escape, incommensurability, and refusal in the face of an
               authoritarian shift, reductive politics, and the normalization of precarity. In
               short, this is a poem of survival beyond the regulating edges of possibility. The
               poem opens with a scene of economization and the regulation of everyday life.</p>


            <quote rend="block">
               <p>Natural order is being restored. </p>

            <p>In this scene Jordan describes the quotidian spread of economic dispossession through
               newly liberated ﬁnancial markets that mark the Reagan administration and a stark
               shift towards neoliberal economic policy in the U.S. This rise corresponds to an
               increase in supply chain logistics, managerial monitoring, just in time production,
               deindustrialization, the contraction of public benefits, shifts in surplus state
               capacity, the financialization of the market, and builds the architecture for a
               global marketplace later inscribed through Free Trade Agreements <ptr
                  target="#gilmore2007"/>
               <ptr target="#harvey2007"/>
               <ptr target="#cowen2014"/>
               <ptr target="#delara2018"/>. This attention to the exact number of pomegranates piled
               into a wobbly pyramid, the labeling of the price, the line break before <q>Each,</q>
               are intentional moves that draw our attention to what Murphy would call the
               economization of life. By this she means, <quote rend="inline">a historically speciﬁc
                  regime of valuation hinged to the macrological ﬁgure of national <q>economy.</q>
                  It names the practices that differentially value and govern life in terms of their
                  ability to foster the macroeconomy of the nation-state, such as life’s ability to
                  contribute to the gross domestic product (GDP ) of the nation. It is distinct from
                  commodifying life or biocapital, or from the broader history of using
                  quantiﬁcation to monetize practices</quote>
               <ptr target="#murphy2017"/>.</p>
            <p>In this passage Murphy is speaking to the ways in which life becomes valued by its
               ability to contribute to larger consolidated national and international markets.
               Additionally, she is pointing to the transposition of this valuation into a larger
               logic underpinned by quantiﬁcation, aggregation, scale, calculability, and
               monetization. Central to the functioning of this shift is an imposition of
                  separability<note> I evoke this term in the ways that Denise Ferreira da Silva
                  mobilizes it from Kant. In <title rend="quotes">On Difference Without
                     Separability</title> da Silva identifies separability as a key element of
                  Kantian thought that still influences contemporary political and ethical projects.
                  Separability is the idea that <q>all that can be known about the things of the
                     world is gathered through formal constructs such as time, space, quantity,
                     quality, relation, and modality</q>
                  <ptr target="#dasilva2016"/>. These formal characteristics become the
                  justification for variously hierarchical structures which rationalize some people
                  as human and deserving of ethical consideration and others as less than human and
                  undeserving. </note> and the reification of the individual. The pomegranates are
               not sold in pairs or by the bunch but each. Each pomegranate is assigned an exact
               value as an individual. Returning to Jordan, she describes this transposition as
               natural order being restored”. As the poem continues, Jordan describes vividly the
               violences and repercussions of this restoration. </p>

               to show both the pervasiveness of who is affected as well as the sectarian divisions
               that rose in response. Jordan speaks to this tension in a 1981 interview with Adriane
               M. Livingston, Peter Merchant, and Mary Elsie Robertson stating: </p>
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block">I really think that I know that Americans now are simply
                  overwhelmed; like what is happening, what can we do. Everybody's tendency is
                  understandably to try to take care of yourself; cover your back, make sure you
                  have a house, a door for the key. I say that as understandable as that is, it
                  seems to me that we cannot afford to divorce ourselves from what is happening in
                  South Africa, for example, or for that matter, what is happening in West Germany,
                  or Poland any more than the Reagan administration divides these issues. I think
                  that the Reagan Administration and people in that; they see everything in global
                  terms. From Brooklyn to Angola is not a big jump for them at all. I think that
                  unless we, the people, begin to think in the same way, to make these connections,
                  really on a visceral level, I feel for the survival of the species</quote>

            <p>Jordan’s words resound today as an echo. At the time of this writing, we are
               currently entangled in cascading scenes of stark economic inequality, increasing
               climate crisis, mass global displacement, a rapidly growing global pandemic, and
               intensified state sanctioned and extra legal racial violence centered in xenophobia,
               anti-blackness, and cis-hetero patriarchy. While the edges<note> In the preface to
                  Tiffany Lethabo King’s <title rend="italic">The Black Shoals: Offshore Formations
                     of Black and Native Studies</title> she describes the violences of genocide and
                  slavery as edgeless. The violence moves as one. Because none of us are truly safe,
                  it requires shared ceremonies to combat. </note> of this violence continues to
               expand — encircling those previously thought safe, hunkered behind thin walls of
               whiteness, denial, or entitlement, the scale of this precarity seems to be matched
               only by the consolidation of land, computing power, and capital. These hubristic
               endeavors seek to remap our social, educational, occupational, commercial, and sex
               lives. Such enhanced on-demand services are built upon massive computational
               infrastructures. Referring to this dramatic enclosure of vital aspects of our lives
               as the Screen New Deal, Naomi Klein describes the potential looming future. </p>

               Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Mariame Makaba, Joy James, Incite! Women of Color Against
               Violence, and Angela Davis amongst many many more, known and unknown, abolition has
               announced itself again within the popular imagination. Abolition is not simply
               decarceration, but the undoing of punishment and violence as responses to organized
                  abandonment<note> This term comes from Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s work in <title

                     Globalizing California</title>. Gilmore uses it to describe the various ways in
                  which capital becomes reorganized in response to surplus crises leading to state
                  neglect and justifying cuts in state spending for social benefit</note> within our
               society. Abolition then moves beyond just the removal (not mere defunding) of police
               and prisons and opens a capacious landscape of ways to live and be in relationships
               with each other that treat life as precious. Referring to radical abolition Gilmore
               states: </p>
            <quote rend="block">The abolition I speak of has roots in all radical movements for

               what we don't know how to explain yet) - the abolition I speak of somehow, perhaps
               magically, resists division from class struggle and also refuses all the other kinds
               of power difference combinations that when fatally coupled, spark new drives for
               abolition. Abolition is a totality and it is ontological. It is the context and

               not struggle's form. To have form, we have to organize.<ptr target="#gilmore2007"

            <p>This essay takes up this call. It wrestles with our present moment, by which the old
               world is dying. This paper takes seriously the call that June Jordan makes and the
               emergence of a fugitive politics of refusal, so that the new world can be born.<note>
                  Gramsci refers to this transitional moment as an interregnum, the liminal space

               life as calculable units rendered as GDP, as productivity, as debt, within an ordered
               whole of insurmountably different pieces. The other begins with refusal of the
               present order of things. It embarks upon various inventions of flight finding the
               suturing ties that subtend “the beauty of black ordinary, the beauty that resides in
               and animates the determination to live free, the beauty that propels the experiments
               in living otherwise” (Hartman 46). </p>
            <p>Possible but not eventual, the present offers a moment of clarity. It is the time to

            <p>What follows are the beginning sketches towards what I am calling Black Computational

                  modernity, or the future</quote>
               <ptr target="#johnson2017" loc="1"/>. In doing so Black Computational Thought takes
               critical aim at the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought as it maps onto and
               subtends contemporary computational logics. Black Computational Thought denaturalizes
               these residues and situates them as spatial temporal onto-epistemologies<note> Here I
                  am referencing Denise Ferreira da Silva’s work in <title rend="italic">Toward a
                     Global Idea of Race</title>. In this text she deploys this term to indicate the
                  mutual constitution of specific subjects and knowledge about said subjects through
                  a shared dependence on ontology and epistemology within modern thought. </note>
               that are highly narrow and specific, rather than universal, axiomatic, or natural.
               Instead these residues are entangled with and are the basis for past and continued
               acts of subjection<note> By invoking subjection I am taking up Saidiya Hartman’s
                  explorations in <title rend="italic">Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and
                     Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America</title>. Hartman argues that the
                  violences of slavery are not merely found in the designation of the enslaved as
                  objects but also in the circumscribed forms of humanity imposed on the enslaved.
                  In doing so she details the <quote rend="inline">the forms of violence and
                     domination enabled by the recognition of humanity, licensed by the invocation
                     of rights, and justified on the grounds of liberty and freedom</quote>
                  <ptr target="#hartman1997"/>. </note>, expropriation, extraction, and the
               totalizing violence of enclosing land and labor. By placing computation within such
               genealogical bounds, we are free to ask the question, what other proximal places
               might we look to to recover computational practices that challenge colonial logics of
               coercion? What other genres<note> I use the term genre in reference to Sylvia
                  Wynter’s work on the sociogenic principle as well as the ways that she takes up
                  Aimee Cesaire’s call for a new science of the word. Wynter argues that humans are
                  hybridly evolved as both bios and mythoi, meaning that our brains have evolved in
                  a way by which language and the semiotics we use to describe ourselves carry
                  meaning into scientific empiricism. Science then is never separate from the
                  social, cultural, and political context articulated through language. For this
                  reason Wynter describes humans as existing in different genres given the symbolic
                  and cultural context of language. This challenges universal rationality. I aim to
                  similarly challenge the universal assumptions that computation denotes, instead
                  situating computing practices within specific social, cultural, and political
                  contexts. For further reference see Wynter’s work in <title rend="quotes"

               lay in wait? Black Computational Thought holds open these proximal possibilities and
               directs our attention to the quotidian, social, opaque, woven, and fugitive practices
               of computation born from Black diasporic movement. Blackness here is always in an
               appositional love affair with queerness, transness, and feminist orientations of the
               world that fight the simplicity of calculated separability, and instead contend with
               their relationship to difference, kin, collectivity, risk, non-normativity,
               non-linearity, ambiguity, and trust. </p>
            <p>I will work primarily from two points of departure. The first engages the scholarship
               of Black feminist + trans studies scholars as they speak through grammars of
               fugitivity into othered ways of being and sharing knowledge that disrupt the
               coherence of the enlightened Subject as individuated, rational, and self determining.
               I then extend these thoughts through a reading of the Freedom Quilts, a clandestine
               system of mapping escape routes for enslaved Black people, as a vital form of
               computation that forces us to rethink what computing can be when freed from its
               dependence on colonial pursuits of managing bodies, spaces, and resources.</p></div>

               Jordan leaves her readers with a deceptively simple request — to come together.
               Jordan speaks of a coming together that is raucous, messy, whirling, spilling, and
               free. Coming together is an effusive act. It is a particular voluptuous
               disintegration. It is the pomegranate sucked by tongue and lips. This stands in sharp
               contrast with the wobbly, precariously stacked pyramid described in the opening.
               Pomegranates 89 cents each. The stark individualized metrics of value are succumb to
               a cacophonous spilling overflow. Coming together is an act of both encounter and
               attrition, finding each other to shed our individualized selves<note> Bataille in his
                  text Erotism: Death and Sensuality describes this process as a central desire
                  within modernity. He calls this continuity. </note>. In Them Goon Rules: Fugitive
               Essays on Radical Black Feminism, Marquis Bey describes this coming together as
                  <title rend="quotes"> the critical intimacy we share with one another when we come
                  together to pull things apart</title>
               <ptr target="#bey2019"/>. Bey describes this mode of being as fugitive. In this
               section I will engage Bey’s thoughts on Blackness, gender, and fugitivity as critical
               practices for enacting Jordan’s call to come together. </p>
            <p> For Bey, fugitivity is primarily a praxis that makes real other ways of living
               together in the world. On this they state, <quote rend="inline"> It is not
                  necessarily a model or template; it is, in fact, deﬁant of these. It is a ﬂash, a
                  glimmer, a ﬂicker that forces us to see and do differently. It engenders our doing
                  something, not our being something; it engenders our moving with others on unruly
                  grounds</quote>
               <ptr target="#bey2019"/>. This is a crucial passage for thinking about the intimacy
               of relations that fugitivity can offer beyond the individual as the standard unit of
               measure. To engage in the necessary work of undoing together, means to live in the
               postures and folds of the fugitive as a perpetual state of becoming otherwise through
               actions taken together. Blackness holds that there is no reconciliation to be found
               in the individual Subject, that it cannot be taken for granted as the site of
               liberty. Blackness rememberers the original sin from which liberty was born, and
               frees us from unquestioningly returning to it. It then follows that Blackness exposes
               the limits at the end of justice, calls into question attempts at inclusion,
               dismantles the center from which the invitation of inclusion<note> Here I am
                  cautioning against calls for inclusion that fail to address the inherent violences
                  of liberal humanism. In doing so I take heed from Denise Ferreira da Silva’s
                  arguments against the sociohistorical logic of exclusion in Towards a Global Idea
                  of Race. In doing so she argues that, “we fail to understand how the racial
                  governs the contemporary global configuration because the leading account of
                  racial subjection — the sociohistorical logic of exclusion — (re)produces the
                  powers of the subject by rewriting racial difference as a signifier of cultural
                  difference” (da Silva xxiv). </note> is sent, and cracks the logics of categorical
               purity that even whiteness fails to uphold. Or as Bey would say, <quote rend="inline"
                  >'Blackness' names, gives discursive ﬂesh to, a critical existence, a disobedient
                  world-working, an irruption upon the norm that crisisizes the scene so we can
                  reimagine the terms and meanings of the world in which we live</quote>
               <ptr target="#bey2019" loc="29"/>. It Is important to stress that Blackness in this
               conception is born from the racial but doesn’t reside there. Blackness is a critical
               mode of being that struggles through the violences of modernity to foster other ways
               of being because it must. Fugitivity as the repertoire of Blackness reminds us of the
               price of admission, the cost of subjection. Blackness is carefully attuned to the
               residual, the left over, the over ﬂow that spills, through, and beyond subjective
               categorization and ﬁxed normality. It collects this excess in overlooked corners
               ﬁnding togetherness in the undoing, spreading into aberrant intimacies of how to be
               together in the vulnerability of non subjects. Blackness, as a way of being in
               relation, is in fact a natural disorder of voluptuous disintegration.</p>
            <p>Many scholars across Black studies, trans studies, queer studies, and Black feminism

               <ptr target="#cohen1997"/>

               <ptr target="#weheliye2014"/>
               <ptr target="#snorton2017"/> have emphasized the inherent queerness of Blackness and
               its fugitive resistance to hegemonic subject formations. This resistance to
               categorization extends to interrupt the projected stability of such attendant
               formations such as gender and sexuality. Race, gender, and sexuality are not mere
               categories additively summed, but are also relational practices that yield different
               social and political formulations. This is important as it contrasts sharply with
               mechanistic understandings of being by which identity is merely a summation of
               discrete inputs. Instead the scholars above emphasize the mutual constitution of
               race, gender, and sexuality as immanent processes, not destinations. For Bey this
               kind of fugitive relationship to gender opens the space for a particular kind of self
               determination. While self determination has held a long track record within Black
               political movement building and radical thought, Bey works to remove it from its more
               militant nationalistic trappings and instead positions it as a commitment to each
               others’ processes of becoming. On this Bey writes,</p>
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block">it is a demand placed on us all to ensure that self-determinative
                  spirit for others as well, to come at them with an utter, terrifying openness,
                  presuming nothing, letting them show us as much or as little of themselves as they
                  wish. This is how we form a different world worth living within: the radicality of
                  all this movement work we’re doing rests in the ability to be fractured and
                  critiqued by the forgotten, to give oneself, radically open, to the unknownness of
                  the other, and to accept as a gift the various iterations of “Y’all need to get

            <p>This understanding of self determination that Bey offers cannot be held individually
               but is always a practice of relating to others while moving through unknown currents.
               Gender here is not something that can be presupposed or preﬁgured. This also begins
               to open the space for engaging gender as a non-proprietary relationship. Bey draws a
               relationship between one’s ability to determine their own gender and the openness of
               receiving that determination by another. This reﬂects some of Bey’s earlier points
               about the intimacy that fugitivity offers in coming undone together. In this fugitive
               space the assumption to know someone based on their temporal presentation is
               undermined. Such a practice of intimacy begins with compassion and humility to ask,
               return, and re-return. This leaves space for the ﬂuidity of gender while not eliding
               the ability to ﬁnd temporary homes in its folds. Coming undone is not a permanent
               place of residence. This is crucial as it doesn’t disavow the material ways in which
               we move through the world and the imposition of gender. Rather, at its best this
               fugitive gesture allows for a reﬂection of the power relations by which subject
               formations occur. This posture recognizes the power in normative gender formation as
               a particular performance and asks where power might be built elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Thinking fugitivity in this way sets it apart from the enclosure of method,
               technique, or model and instead bears a strong resemblance to Diana Taylor’s work on
               repertoire. Rather than a static archive, repertoire <quote rend="inline"> enacts
                  embodied memory: performances, gestures, orality, movement, dance, singing — in
                  short, all those acts usually thought of as ephemeral, nonreproducible
                  knowledge</quote>
               <ptr target="#taylor2007" loc="20"/>. She goes on to state, <title rend="quotes">The
                  repertoire requires presence: people participate in the production and
                  reproduction of knowledge by <q>being there,</q> being a part of the transmission.
                  As opposed to the supposedly stable objects in the archive, the actions that are
                  the repertoire do not remain the same. The repertoire both keeps and transforms

            <p>This focus on fugitivity as repertoire, as embodied knowledge, as gesture, and
               movement extends Bey’s fugivitity from being a critical response to subjection and
               raises questions about the ways in which such a radical undoing can also be a
               practice of information sharing and knowledge production. The repertoire requires
               presence as its mode of transmission. Through the presence of participants coming
               together again and again, knowledge is produced and reproduced. It is held in the
               fleshy extensions of those that share space on unruly grounds. In this context the
               transmission of information is not separate from the material embodiment of those
               involved. In fact it is dependent on material bodies in relation. The data is encoded
               and transmitted through acts taken together. It remains local.<note> In <title
                     rend="italic">All Data Are Local: Thinking Critically in a Data-Driven
                     Society</title> Yanni Loukissas focuses on locality as a vital consideration
                  for working with data that pushes back against the universalism often assumed by
                  the dataset. By focusing on data settings instead of the data set Loukissas
                  invites us <quote rend="inline">to look at the local conditions of data can be a

               and knowledge production the fugitive repertoire is encased in shared cultural
               practices made available through the intimacy of coming together. It is not
               interoperable or modular. Instead it requires something of you. To partake in the
               knowledge you must learn the choreography, the gestures, the furtive movements. The
               repertoire makes explicit endured agreements of trust, building practices of
               interdependence in order to share risk together<note> Throughout this article I have
                  spoken about risk multiple times. My interest in shared risk taking is to make
                  clear alternate ways to respond to the violent utility that predictive analytics
                  authorize. As prediction seeks to identify and control risk preemptively, it
                  simultaneously reifies the Subject as a self determining being in conflict with
                  exteriority. Violence becomes naturalized and justified as a requirement for
                  maintaining the interiority of the Subject. This same logic undergirds predictive
                  analytics and risk assessment models justifying violence as a way to meet
                  perceived risk, read as non-white, poor, ungovernable, and irrational. In the book
                  Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During This Crisis (And the Next) Dean Spade
                  writes, <quote rend="inline">Mutual aid can also generate boldness and a
                     willingness to defy illegitimate authority. Taking risks with a group for a
                     shared purpose can be a reparative experience when we have been trained to
                     follow rules</quote>
                  <ptr target="#spade2020" loc="20"/>. This manner of taking shared risk together as
                  a response to uncertainty allows us to begin to orient to each other and shed the
                  violent utility that protection requires as an individual. </note>. Both Bey and
               Taylor stress the importance of presence and “being there” as vital components of
               engaging in unstable practices together. There is a productive redundancy here. The
               vectors that Bey and Taylor describe are circular<note> Glissant calls this circular
                  nomadism, <quote rend="inline">each time a portion of the territory is exhausted,
                     the group moves around. Its function is to ensure the survival of the group by
                     means of this circularity</quote>
                  <ptr target="#glissant2010"/>. Glissant understands this kind of nomadism as a
                  response to uprooting (crisis) which can <quote rend="inline">work toward
                     identity, and exile can be seen as beneficial, when these are experienced as a
                     search for the Other (through circular nomadism) rather than as an expansion of
                     territory (an arrowlike nomadism)</quote>
                  <ptr target="#glissant2010"/>. This is a response to crisis that engages in
                  different constructions of identity through diaspora.</note>. They thrive on their
               ability to repeat and return — recursive, not linear. Such acts require endurance, an
               endurance capacious enough to meet uncertainty, an endurance that supports proximity
               without fixing boundaries. This makes self determination an act of coming together
               again and again to be undone while holding the intimacy of how we can be together in
               motion. </p>
            <p>My engagements with fugitivity are an attempt to struggle with what it means to live
               in the theory of fugitivity. Rather than just theorizing on what it can promise, I am
               interested in how we can begin to recognize a fugitive praxis. In doing so I turn to
               Tina Campt’s seminal text, Listening to Images. Rather than speaking to fugitivity as
               a constant exhaustive physical act of movement and escape, Campt is interested in the
               quiet and quotidian. Campt works from this position toward a theory of fugitivity and
               situated understanding of the politics of refusal. Writing on this Campt states,
                  <quote rend="inline">the quotidian must be understood as a practice rather than an
                  act/ion. It is a practice honed by the dispossessed in the struggle to create
                  possibility within the constraints of everyday life. For blacks in diaspora, both
                  quiet and the quotidian are mobilized as everyday practices of refusal</quote>
               <ptr target="#campt2017" loc="4"/>. Here Campt is quite clear that fugitivity cannot
               only be used as metaphor or merely an act of escape but is held in the ongoing
               practices of the dispossessed to survive in a world that isn’t ﬁt for their survival.
               These practices are found in sites of everyday life. This in part returns fugitivity
               to the body without entombing it, it is where ﬂight meets the ground, without
               landing, it is in the sweat that permeates pores, the exhaustion as breath leaves the
               lungs, the smell of fresh soil during midnight maurades. It is a fugitivity that is
               situated rather than ﬂattened, and made to spread so thinly that it is all
               encompassing and ambiguous.</p>
            <p>Keeping with this focus on the mundane, Campt works through identiﬁcation photography
               as her primary material to think with. She theorizes these photographs has having a
               sonic quality that operates at a haptic level, only understood through feeling.
               Borrowing from Georges Perec, she refers to these photographs as <quote rend="inline"
                  >infra-ordinary, — everyday practices we don’t always notice and whose seeming
                  insigniﬁcance requires excessive attention</quote>
               <ptr target="#campt2017" loc="8"/>. These infra-ordinary practices and objects are
               moments of refusal that are essential for the possibilities of Black futurity. These
               practices themselves, as fugitive refusal, should not be understood simply as
               rebelliousness or revolt, but are born from an insistence to strive for futurity, to
               matter, to survive. Here is where the stakes and promise of fugitivity come into full
               view. When put in relationship to futurity, the fugitive cannot remain a romanticized
               ﬁgure freed from attachments, in constant pursuit of an ultimate unmediated freedom.
               Rather, the fugitive is one who contends deeply with the daily violences of life to
               be able to have a future beyond them. </p>
            <p>Despite its complications, or perhaps because of them, fugitive praxes are important
               to break open the disciplining logics of rationality and separability. Fugitivity at
               its best is a repertoire that requires interdependence for care and regular
               maintenance. I am invested in practices of computation that emphasize such
               interdependencies while moving through the processes of sharing, storing, and making
               meaning together. Here, the social and the technical are explicitly intertwined
               rather than ignored or mechanistically separated. In what follows I hope to show how
               fugitivity opens computation to being a practice in the making, co-constituted
               through social repertoires and formations. It is not universal or standard but
               operates through specific genres. I believe it is within such genres that we might
               find social processes that make the space to return again and again while immersed in
               the practices of sharing information and risk together. </p>

            <head>Black Computational Thought as Endured Proximity</head>
            <p>In this final section I will bring forth Bey’s subject come undone, Taylor’s
               repertoire, and Campt’s infra-ordinary to bear as I locate them within the Freedom
               Quilts as a future leaning computational past and a living body within Black
               Computational Thought. I frame this discussion through David Golumbia’s
               computationalism. In his text, The Cultural Logic of Computation, Golumbia makes a
               distinction between computers and computationalism. For him computationalism is
                  <quote rend="inline">is the view that not just human minds are computers but that
                  mind itself must be a computer — that our notion of intellect is, at bottom,
                  identical with abstract computation, and that in discovering the principles of
                  algorithmic computation via the Turing Machine human beings have, in fact,
                  discovered the essence not just of human thought in practice but all thought in
                  principle</quote>
               <ptr target="#golumbia2009" loc="7"/>. Golumbia expands upon this term <quote
                  rend="inline">as a commitment to the view that a great deal, perhaps all, of human
                  and social experience can be explained via computational processes</quote>
               <ptr target="#golumbia2009" loc="8"/>. Over the course of his text Golumbia tries to
               show the ways that the digital computer inherits much of its logic from a
               Post-Enlightenment high rationality. By engaging the work of Decartes, Hobbes, Kant,
               and Liebnitz, Golumbia positions this rationality; <quote rend="inline"
                  >computationalism entails not merely rationalism per se, but a particular species
                  of rationalism with clear conceptual and historical weight, which we nevertheless
                  seem all too ready to forget</quote>
               <ptr target="#golumbia2009" loc="190"/>. The basis of Golumbia’s critique lies at the
               episteme from which computational logics emerge solidified in formal reason and
                  syntax.<note> Syntax becomes a crucial component for computationalism in
                  Golumbia’s argument. Columbia argues that in order for computationalism to make
                  equivalences between cognition and computation, producing language needed to be
                  described in computational terms. Golumbia details the ways in which Noam
                  Chompsky’s innovations into linguistics with a particular focus on syntax became
                  the foundation upon which computer scientists began to remake the mind as a
                  computer. Syntax in this context acts as a formal logic system built on protocol
                  and hierarchy. </note> Golumbia is attempting to show the ways that
               computationalism understands cognition itself as an inherent computing process, and
               by extension, all matters of phenomena in the world can be understood as a function
               of computation. This eerily mirrors the Screen New Deal future that Klein details, by
               which the economization of life is aggregated, totalized, tracked, mined, and
               brokered. This world is imagined as an ordered whole made of distinct intrinsically
               different pieces that can only be understood through their secondary effects of
                  measure<note> By secondary effects of measure I am referring to Denise Ferreira da
                  Silva’s article <title rend="quotes">On Different Without Separability.</title> In
                  it she marks a shift in 17th century continental philosophy which focused on the
                     <q>secondary (efficient) causes</q> of motion. This focus on efficient causes
                  reduced the complexity of being into observable differences made certain through
                  measurement. This certainty made a mechanistic world view possible by which
                  difference is irreducible and creates the contours by which our ethical
                  considerations for each other are limited and macerated. </note>. This is the
               world that the economization of life emerges from and continues to validate. It is
               the world of big data, Amazon Web Services, financialized global economies,
               calculated abandonment, and Eric Schmidt. In this imagination of the world the
               Subject is the only self determining thing gifted with cognition and capable of
               measuring the rest of the world through modalities of difference and claims of
               universality. In short the Subject is granted interiority. Golumbia reminds us that
               this interiority is thought to operate upon the same mechanistic principles as a
               computing device, taking in cold empiric data and making assessments and measures
               through cognition. In fact this model often passes for objectivity and is upheld as
               an ethical principle within much of computer science. It is a principle based on
               separability, distance, and asociality. Accordingly to Golumbia <quote rend="inline"
                  >Interiority qua universal subjectivity emerges from numerical rationality applied
                  as an understanding of human subjectivity, and not vice versa. This is not to
                  reject the idea of subjectivity outside of rationalist modernity: it is rather to
                  suggest that the particular and elaborated form of interiority we associate with
                  present-day modernity underwrites an unexpected and radical mechanism</quote>
               <ptr target="#golumbia2009" loc="10"/>. This radical mechanism and its assumed
               neutral evaluation sits at the center of much of modern representation and
               performances of objectivity ethics. Bringing these insights from Golumbia into
               conversation with Denise Ferreira da Silva, this <q>universal</q> ethic falls away is
               in fact embodied within white European signification. da Silva argues that, <quote
                  rend="inline">in both cases, cultural difference sustains a moral discourse, which
                  rests on the principle of separability. This principle considers the social as a
                  whole constituted of formally separate parts. Each of these parts constitutes a
                  social form, as well as geographically-historically separate units, and, as such,
                  stands differentially before the ethical notion of humanity, which is identified
                  with the particularities of white European collectives</quote>
               <ptr target="#dasilva2007" loc="63"/>. </p>
            <p>Through the principle of separability which da Silva grounds in Kantian reason, the
               different pieces which are imagined as components of an ordered world are
               incommensurable with each other. Their relationship is one of unbridgeable difference
               and distance. The mechanism that Golumbia describes sits at the center of this
               ordered world and is inscribed in the moral project of the human, written as white,
               European, and male. Therefore the others of Europe can only be measured by their
               difference to white European humanity and are therefore subjected to partial
               protections through rights and partial violence. This undergirds one of da Silva’s
               primary questions, <quote rend="inline">How the racial combines with other social
                  categories (gender, class, sexuality, culture, etc.) to produce modern subjects
                  who can be excluded from (juridical) universality without unleashing an ethical
                  crisis?</quote>
               <ptr target="#dasilva2007" loc="xxx"/>. This also helps us begin to understand one of
               my own questions which opens this article, Why does anti-blackness seem to
               perpetually overdetermine and saturate the operating system regardless of who is
               programming it? Because of the ways in which the Subject is written simultaneously
               into white European embodiment as well as computationalist rationality, it will
               continue to carry anti-blackness in its bowels even in the face of the most strident
               claims of universality and objectivity. For this reason Black Computational Thought
               allows for speculation beyond the Subject as mechanism, computing as
               computationalism, and separability as ethics. To ground some of this
                  speculation<note> Here it is important to address the scrutiny and criticism
                  following Tobin and Dobard’s text <title rend="italic">Hidden in Plain View: A
                     Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad</title>. Since its
                  publication it has been the primary reference detailing the use of the Freedom
                  Quilts. It has also been a text engulfed in controversy. Much of this controversy
                  comes from quilt historians such as Barbara Brackman who point to various gaps in
                  the historic documentation to confirm Tobin and Dobard’s account. Brackman’s
                  argument tends to highlight the dearth of corroborating oral history accounts of
                  the quilts and discrepancies about the popular use and re-use of certain quilting
                  patterns such as The Log Cabin. Rather than prove the use of the quilts in either
                  Tobin and Dobard or Brackman’s accounts I find promise in Saidiya Hartman’s work
                  struggling with the archive as both an index of violence and an incomplete
                  accounting. In <title rend="quotes">Venus in Two Acts</title> Hartman offers a
                  method of critical fabulation to operate beyond the empiric authority of the
                  archive and its inability to render the lives of the enslaved beyond objects. On

                  exercises of trust building and information sharing along the plantation grapevine

                  in which various cultural pattern making practices across the continent retain
                  cultural and formal mathematical functions. </note>, this reading of the Freedom
               Quilts is centered in computation as it works with Blackness to unsettle
               computationalism, objectivity, separability, and the Subject. </p>
            <p>One of the primary tactics that informs the design and function of the Freedom Quilts
               is the use of everyday objects to circulate information within traditional African
               societies. Speaking on the power of everyday objects Tobin and Dobard state, <quote
                  rend="inline">Communicating secrets using ordinary objects is very much a part of
                  African culture, in which familiarity provides the perfect cover. Messages can be
                  skillfully passed on through objects that are seen so often they become invisible.
                  These objects are creative expressions of African artisans and give tangible form
                  to the cultural and religious ideas of their kingdoms</quote>
               <ptr target="#tobin2000" loc="39"/>. Tobin and Dobard document this practice through
               the role of the griot as the guardian of culture and societal history. Based in oral
               traditions, the role of the griot was to remember and share ancestral lineage,
               customs, beliefs, histories, and legends from generation to generation. The griots
                  <quote rend="inline">learned and taught via an oral tradition, based on memory,
                  aided by the use of specially designed mnemonic devices. Encoded staffs, stools,
                  memory boards, sculpture, and textiles chronicled the history of a people. But
                  only the griots and the diviners were able to read them</quote>
               <ptr target="#tobin2000" loc="40"/>. This practice is one that continued into the new
               world as enslaved Africans held onto their cultural memories and combined them with
               others stolen from their lands to create new creolized semiotic systems that crafted
               convert ways for enslaved peoples to communication with each other, circulate
               knowledge, and build wholly different cultural systems within the diaspora. These
               creolized symbols were the basis for a visual language that gave new identities to
               those for whom culture had been stripped as they were subjugated into objects. Here
               the materiality and cultural legacies meet in the interface of the quilts themselves.
               Repertoire becomes the means through which knowledge is archived and materialized
               within cultural objects. </p>
            <p>The quilt code which Tobin and Dobard uncover, includes ten primary patterns and a
               number of secondary patterns. Each pattern had two meanings, both to signal to those
               enslaved to prepare to escape and to give clues to indicate safe directions on the
               journey. Following these instructions enslaved people would know when to gather the
               tools they would need for the coming journey, the time to escape from the plantation,
               ways to navigate hundreds of miles to Cleveland (as a prominent location for
               continued travel to free destinations in the North), places to find fresh clothes and
               shelter, and practices for recognizing other confidants. This mnemonic device was
               used in addition to sampler quilts which held all ten primary patterns in sequence to
               aid in recognition while on the run. After leaving the plantation enslaved people
               would encounter quilts bearing single patterns left in public to air. These quilts
               became the constitutive matter that held together disparate subterranean connections.
               Because the circulation of information traveled widely and lacked centralization, the
               mnemonic devices used and patterns themselves changed often to insulate from outside
               parties learning and understanding the quilt code. For such a complex system to work
               it required a tremendous amount of labor, maintenance, and shared risk. This means
               that aside from the use of everyday objects, the making of shared diaspora cultures
               through the combining and mixing of cultural artifacts gave rise to fugitive
               formations themselves, in Bey’s sense of the word. </p>
            <p>Here, computation is not an internal process housed in the Subject (in a vacuum of
               interiority) that sees and measures the exterior world as a series of different
               bodies upon which forces are acting. Instead the Freedom Quilts become a site in
               which Blackness is being written through the creolization of symbols, meanings,
               context, and codes that literally calculate pathways to fugitive escape and flight
               from the plantation. Programmability, in this context, complicates the temporality of
               code as executable function, as cause and effect. The Freedom Quilts generate a type
               of code that doesn’t execute automatically but makes the act of interpretation
               explicit. While encountering quilts left in public fugitives would discern the code
               and simultaneously have to read it in context, within the geography of placement. In
               this instance the executability of code is halted as a declarative axiomatic language
               imagined within syntax. Code is not an absolute instruction but is read in addition
               to landscape. Differing from the programming of second-order cybernetics, the
               landscape is not reintegrated into code, making it workable. Instead the limit of
               computation is held by the materiality of space, it is not transcended. Black people
               on the run would read the code with the landscape and continue on their journey.
               Computation in this instance does not need to be a totalizing logic that engulfs
               everything but lives alongside bodies in motion, in relation to geography, reading
               both simultaneously. </p>
            <p>This relation between Black sojourners, geography, and the quilt code also extends to
               ancestral calculations.<note> Here I am specifically thinking with Alexis Pauline
                  Gumbs and Julia Roxanne Wallace in their piece, <title rend="quotes">Black

                  writing, <quote rend="inline">We are the future predicted by the careful

               the patterns encoded with meaning and stitched into the quilts are reflections of
               knowledges and sense-making done by ancestors prior. The quilt code carries these
               knowledges into present function. In Campt’s formulation<note> By Campt’s formulation
                  I mean her assertion that Black feminist futurity is a matter of tense. In

                  she describes Black Feminist Futurity as the future real conditional or that which
                  will have had to happen. </note> certain ancestral calculations were what had to
               have been for the future-present to be lived now through fugitive acts of flight. The
               quilt code makes this connection clear, as these creolized semiotics were essential
               for cultural encryption and the protection of the code.</p>
            <p>Computation here engages difference outside of separability.<note> Here I want to
                  point to parallels between my use of separability and Tara McPherson’s work
                  looking at how lenticular logics structure racial representations and
                  epistemologies through UNIX protocols. In <title rend="quotes">U.S. Operating
                     Systems at Mid-Century: The Intertwining of Race and UNIX</title> McPherson
                  draws parallels between changing racial and political discourses and emerging
                  digital computing practices in the 1960s. Her argument focuses in part on the rule
                  of modularity as a particular principle within UNIX. She writes that this rule of
                  modularity was adopted by a nascent neoliberal state and used to discipline and
                  quell radical calls for liberation. On this she writes, <quote rend="inline">I am
                     highlighting the ways in which the organization of information and capital in
                     the 1960s powerfully responds-across many registers-to the struggles for racial
                     justice and democracy that so categorized the U.S. at the time. Many of these
                     shifts were enacted in the name of liberalism, aimed at distancing the overt
                     racism of the past even as they contained and cordoned off progressive
                     radicalism.</quote><ptr target="#mcpherson2013"/></note> Black peoples before
               capture, from various geographic, historical, and cultural sites, are not fixed in
               their ultimate difference upon which the only mediation is found through measurement.
               Perhaps even more importantly the transparent center from which they are measured is
               not grounded in white European standards. Instead, Black people exchange and
               reconstitute their own situated knowledges into new systems of information and
               communication. This is difference without separability.<note> Here I am attempting to
                  take up da Silva’s call to rethink the social beyond the separability proffered by
                  Kant and made certain through Cartesian logics. Rather than think the social
                  through Newtonian particle physics she pushes us to consider the strange effects
                  of quantum mechanics primarily nonlocality. Nonlocality refers to the phenomenon
                  by which the measurable properties of one particle instantaneously provide the
                  measurable properties of another particle regardless of the distance between the
                  two. Rather than understood as being separate individual entities they are
                  entangled together through a shared relationship. da Silva closes her essay
                  writing, <quote rend="inline">When nonlocality guides our imaging of the universe,
                     difference is not a manifestation of an unresolvable estrangement, but the
                     expression of an elementary entanglement</quote>
                  <ptr target="#dasilva2014" loc="65"/>. </note> This then opens computation to
               practices of endured proximity. By this I mean that the measurability of difference
               cannot be displaced and remade as intrinsic separation. That as we measure and
               collect data about the external world, we cannot continue to think of ourselves as
               transparent or incommensurable in our relationship to what is being indexed. Instead
               we must contend with our relationship to the index. Black Computational Thought
               grounds computational ethics in this practice of contention. It refuses imaginations
               of the world by which calculable measurement is the only relationship between things
               and pushes us to meaningfully engage difference as a relationship that we are
               entangled within. Only by doing this will contemporary flights of liberation be
               imaginable. In this formation, endured proximity supplants objectivity and
               separability as the moral ground upon which to stand when working on data ethics,
               bias, or algorithmic violence. Black Computational Thought attempts to open the space
               for othered social formations that work in excess of measurable, separable
               difference, and towards staying with the difficult work of proximity, trust,
               sociality, and risk. </p>
            <p>One such formation resides in the quilting bees on plantations. Quilting bees were
               collective circles of primarily women that sat together and constructed quilts in
               collaboration. Because these quilts were often sourced from various spare pieces of
               fabric they were piecemealed and required numerous people to collect and plan each
               quilt. Quilting bees were sites that were both social and operated as convergences
               for vital stops along the plantation grapevine. Referencing James Oliver Horton’s
               work in <title rend="italic">Free People of Color: Inside the African American
                  Community</title>, Tobin and Dobard describe the plantation grapevine as: </p>
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block">interregional communication system existing between free blacks
                  of the Northeast, the Midwest, and the South and enslaved Southern blacks. Horton
                  chronicles how enslaved blacks and free blacks were able to meet at inns
                  frequented by traveling plantation owners who were accompanied by black slaves
                  acting as drivers and servants. He discusses how black sailors were able to
                  exchange information with enslaved blacks at port cities; how slaves who were
                  hired out to shops were able to gather information; how the black churches, even
                  under the scrutiny of whites, acted as <q>post offices</q> for messages containing
                  escape routes and instructions for escape and survival; and how plantation slaves
                  hired out to work in a neighboring town served as dispatchers of these
                  messages</quote>
               <ptr target="#tobin2000"/>
            </cit>
            <p>As Tobin and Dobard document, sites such as quilting bees became gathering spaces
               through which communication between free Black people in the north, white
               abolitionists, and the enslaved took place across numerous plantations and regions
               were able to send messages and communicate. Again, because agency was assumed only
               within the Subject figured as white, propertied, and male, enslaved Black people that
               accompanied their masters were able to play covert roles as dispatchers of secret
               messages. Likewise, quilting bees were seen as docile innocuous gatherings associated
               with craft and feminized labor. Yet, it is exactly this infra-ordinary quality of
               Black quilt making and its capacity for agency that allows for resistance to take
               place in the open.  </p>
            <p>Looking at quilting bees in this way also allows us to build on Tiffany Lethabo
               King’s understanding of fungibility, as it relates to computation. <title
                  rend="italic">In The Black Shoals: Offshore Formations of Black and Native
                  Studies</title>, King states: </p>

               <quote rend="block">As a Black fleshy analytic, I argue, Black fungibility can denote
                  and connote pure flux, process, and potential. To be rendered Black and fungible

                  a space and state at-the-edge and outside of normative configurations of sex,
                  gender, sexuality, space, and time to stabilize and fix the human category. Black
                  fungibility is an expression of the gratuitous violence of conquest and slavery
                  whose repertoire has no limits or bounds. It operates both materially on the body
                  and produces Blackness (as idea and symbol) as a discursive space of open

               <ptr target="#moten2018" loc="1"/> Because chattel slavery remakes the category of
               Blackness in the New World, formerly African peoples in part lost their connection to
               specific regional and tribal languages, customs, practices, and histories. This
               illustrates how various African people affected by chattel slavery became organized
               through various forms to mount resistance. Yet, the highly adapted systems of
               communication, cultural creolization, and trust that gave rise to the Freedom Quilts
               involved consistent forms of sociality and fungibility such as the quilting bees by
               which the piecemeal formation of the quilts as a vital interface parallels the
               makings of Blackness to form different possibilities on the edge of subjection.
               Quilting bees became important gatherings where enslaved people <quote rend="inline"
                  >were able to compile facts regarding geography, landmarks, places to avoid,

                  runaways shared their own tactics and routes of escape. Most early escape attempts
                  were individual efforts by slaves, not part of any organized cooperative ventures
                  headed by Northern abolitionists.</quote><ptr target="#tobin2000" loc="74"/> In
               this way, Blackness became a constituting position through which computing systems
               were produced and are entangled with the materials, people, cultures, and places that
               enacted them.</p>
            <p>Elsa Barkley Brown speaks brilliantly about the ways that material cultures carry
               alternate understandings for socially, economically, and politically ordering the
               world. Speaking specifically about Black women’s quilting practices she writes,
                  <quote rend="inline">African-American quilters prefer the sporadic use of the same
                  material in several squares when this material could have been used uniformly
                  because they prefer variation to regularity…In other words, the symmetry in
                  African-American quilts does not come from uniformity as it does in Euro-American
                  quilts; rather, the symmetry comes through the diversity</quote>
               <ptr target="#brown1989" loc="923"/>. Brown connects the errant quilting practices of
               Black women to other Black cultural forms such as jazz improvisation and polyrhythmic
               drumming. Both united through a considered practice of making structure through
               contrast and difference, Brown articulates theses forms as expressions of true
               democracy, <quote rend="inline">…for each person is allowed, in fact required, to be
                  an individual, to go his/her own way, and yet to do so in concert with the

            <p>Here the digital is returned to the digit, to the hand, to haptics, textures, and
               textiles, to the process of making through material and proximal relations to each
               other, to making through endured engagements with difference. Brown’s reflections on
               Black women’s quilting practices carry aspects of Bey’s self-determinism as a
               repertoire for ways to share information and knowledge with each other through
               endured practices of risk taking. </p>
            <p>In closing, I want to be clear: Black Computational Thought is not just a historic
               recovery of the fact that Black people have done some shit with numbers. It is an
               epistemic confrontation with the logics of computation situated elsewhere and
               challenges the very nature of what we consider computation to be and to have been. It
               is an argument for forms of computing embedded in technologies of living,<note> I was
                  introduced to this term through Tamura A. Lomax’s work, <title rend="quotes"
                     >Technology of Living</title> published in <title rend="italic">The Black
                     Scholar</title>. In this article Lomax invokes technology of the living from
                  Toni Cade Bambara’s seminal work <title rend="italic">The Salt Eaters</title>. In
                  it Bambara describes technology of the living as a spiritual practice of study.
                  Lomax builds on this definition to include <quote rend="inline">it is a force
                     where the political and logical encounter the spiritual being, where activists
                     and spiritualists come together to make sense of black life and journey toward
                     black wellness</quote>
                  <ptr target="#lomax2016" loc="22"/>, </note> connected to care work, to fullness,
               to difference, and to shared practices of risky meaning making. Returning to Campt,
               this is not a matter of hope, but is one of tense. She describes this tense as,
                  <quote rend="inline">humble, and strategic, subtle and discriminating. It is
                  devious and exacting. It’s not always loud and demanding. It is frequently quiet
                  and opportunistic, dogged and disruptive</quote>
               <ptr target="#campt2017" loc="17"/>. In thinking about futurity as tense Campt offers
               what she calls, Black feminist futurity. Elaborating on this term she writes, <quote
                  rend="inline">It strives for the tense of possibility that grammarians refer to as
                  the future real conditional or that which will have had to happen. The grammar of
                  black feminist futurity is a performance of a future that hasn’t yet happened but
                  must….It is the power to imagine beyond current fact and to envision that which is
                  not, but must be. It’s a politics of preﬁguration that involves living the future
                  now — as imperative rather than subjunctive — as a striving for the future you
                  want to see, right now, in the present</quote>
               <ptr target="#campt2017" loc="17"/>. In her understanding of futurity there are no
               guarantees, there is no safety in eventuality, there is nothing promised to us. In
               the face of this, Black feminist futurity is one that must be made. It is an
               understanding of the future real conditional, of that which would have had to have
               happened for us to exist in the future. In this sense futurity is present work upheld
               by the daily practices of refusal. This makes clear the stakes of fugitive
               computational practice and the work of Black Computational Thought. It is not a site
               of salvation or assimilation but instead does the deep work of radical Black
               feminism, <quote rend="inline">grappling with precarity, while maintaining an active
                  commitment to the everyday labor of creating an alternative future</quote>
               <ptr target="#campt2017" loc="16"/>. I believe this is the call that closes June
               Jordan’s epic poem, written almost 37 years prior to Campt’s text, towards a natural
               disorder. My engagements with fugitive computation are indebted to understanding this
               natural disorder, this turn to ensuring a future through fugitive acts taken now. To
               move beyond the paralysis of precarity, preparing a new world in the face of
               extinction. </p>
