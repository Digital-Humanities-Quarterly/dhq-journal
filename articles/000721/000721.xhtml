                  <p>Digital Humanities pedagogy seminars (DHPSs) are a common occurrence on small liberal
                     arts campuses that are seen as acts of 
                     service within the logic of the Teaching-Research-Service model of tenure and promotion
                     in the U.S. academy. Yet, the goal of 
                     these events is to teach faculty colleagues DH methods, inflected by DH pedagogy values,
                     which they can then use in their 
                     undergraduate courses. As tenured and tenure-track DH specialists at small liberal
                     arts colleges, we argue that a DHPS is 
                     pedagogical labor and should be evaluated as teaching in order to enact values-based
                     DH more broadly. The paper provides 
                     qualitative data based on experiences at our institutions as well as quantitative
                     data about 226 DHPSs offered in North 
                     America from July 2015 to July 2019. We focus on the impact of DHPS duration and the
                     home institutions and roles of instructors 
                     on collaboration, experimentation, and intersectional feminism as practiced in the
                     field.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Digital Humanities pedagogy seminars (DHPSs) are a common occurrence on liberal arts
                     campuses in the United States.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e231">[1]</a> Their aim 
                     is to introduce DH methods for integration into the curriculum. The seminar may be
                     one day, 
                     several days, or spread out over a semester or academic year. Yet, when it comes to
                     
                     institutional assessment of faculty members, DHPSs are often overlooked as sites of
                     
                     teaching, and seen instead as only acts of service within the logic of the 
                     Teaching-Research-Service model of credit and promotion in the U.S. academy. In a
                     field 
                     already marked by precarity and temporariness, the DHPS aims for longevity of the
                     field, 
                     but is made vulnerable by evaluative practices such as these [<a class="ref" href="#boyles2018">Boyles et al. 2018</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bonds2017">Bonds and Gil 2017</a>]. Moreover, the data that we report here provide a scale for 
                     what many DH practitioners experience in isolation: the burden of growing and sustaining
                     the
                     field falls to colleagues who are not on the tenure track. Senior colleagues in the
                     field, those with administrative roles, and DH scholars conducting evaluations for
                     promotion have opportunities to shape staffing and the interpretation of this labor
                     while DHPS instructors must be mindful about how they execute and communicate the
                     work of the DHPS in this environment.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">We recognize our positionality at affluent, small liberal arts institutions may make
                     our call seem like an issue unique to a privileged class of institutions. At the
                     same time, the labor practices of elite institutions ripple through higher
                     education. How well-resourced institutions hire, classify labor, and determine
                     compensation often sets a standard, giving arguments for or against certain
                     institutional behaviors. At a time when many arguments start with, “Well, [insert
                     peer and aspirant institution] is doing [insert behavior], therefore we should”,
                     institutions with power in higher education have even more of a responsibility to
                     think carefully about the local as well as national effects of how they approach
                     labor. Given that two co-authors on this paper are now-tenured faculty members, we
                     will focus our analysis on ways in which re-alignments of the DHPS for faculty
                     evaluation could be advantageous for the field at large, with the additional goal
                     of
                     using our privileged status to describe interventions that may also benefit
                     colleagues in non-tenure line or precarious positions in DH.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">To that end, we argue that DHPSs are pedagogical labor and should be evaluated as
                     teaching for faculty who need it to count as such. This ideological reframing can
                     have positive consequences for teachers of DHPSs. One outcome is that such a shift
                     facilitates the practice of a values-based digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#spiro2012">Spiro 2012</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mccarthy2016">McCarthy and Witmer 2016</a>]. Building from Lisa Spiro's argument to ground DH in values, this
                     article identifies three DH values — collaboration, experimentation, and
                     intersectional feminism — that are difficult to enact given the institutional labor
                     categorization of the DHPS as service. We ground these arguments in qualitative data
                     from our respective institutions and quantitative data gathered about DHPSs in the
                     United States. A second outcome is the identification of actionable interventions
                     in
                     this system that will make visible, if not formal, the teaching of faculty and staff
                     in ways that mitigate some of the challenges faced by the profession.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Although such arguments could engage with sociological theories of labor and
                     institutional power, given our specializations as humanists we employ historical
                     methods, including feminist data creation [<a class="ref" href="#klein2020">Klein and D'Ignazio 2020</a>]. Data creation
                     around the instantiations of the DHPS brought to light the dimensions of the
                     phenomenon and a broader view of the multiple threads in the field of DH that are
                     currently at odds: how DHPSs are evaluated, where they are taught, and the values
                     that we as a field promote for our pedagogy. The pedagogical theories of the field
                     are difficult to enact under the institutional circumstances provided for those who
                     do this important work for DH. In traditional humanistic fashion this article
                     contextualizes the problem with the small liberal arts college (SLAC) environment,
                     
                     uncovers inconsistencies in policies and priorities, and documents a portion of that
                     labor.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The article has two sections that juxtapose the institutional logics of higher
                     education in the United States and those of values-based DH. We begin the first
                     section with an overview of the triad of Teaching-Research-Service that defines
                     promotion and tenure guidelines followed by a definition of DHPS based on how it was
                     enacted in the 5-year period represented by our data, 2015-2019. After addressing
                     the institutional condition that all forms of labor that “count” must be assigned to
                     a part of the triad, we argue for considering DHPSs as teaching. We then turn in
                     the second section to how DHPSs struggle to enact DH values as long as they are
                     limited to the categorization of Service. Along the way we identify and
                     re-categorize DHPS labor with attention to the priorities of other labor in higher
                     education. Importantly, the challenges we identify are at odds with other values of
                     the field related to inclusion, credit, and the decentering of power structures.
                     They also reinforce faculty-staff divides and contribute to the invisibility of the
                     labor of care work and nurturing that often occurs outside the tenure stream. We
                     will address this from the point of view of what counts as knowledge in these
                     settings, but recognize that the conversation could and should expand to other
                     theoretical perspectives.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The DHPS is not a panacea to the myriad challenges facing higher education, but it
                     can be a site of flexibility, creativity, and alterity. Even seemingly minor
                     adjustments in how we organize, categorize, and credit labor have the potential to
                     change affective and material conditions on the ground. This is particularly the
                     case for those of us who labor in the hundreds of institutions of higher education
                     where teaching is the most valued aspect of our work as faculty. While much has been
                     written about what should count as research in DH, there is a noticeable gap in work
                     about what counts as teaching. Attention to debates over how we define, credit, and
                     acknowledge teaching is an important avenue for the field for making visible this
                     care work that is so often left uncounted. As one peer reviewer added to our
                     argument, doctoral institutions have the resources to compensate for the risks taken
                     to model these best practices. 
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In particular, we focus on the implication of DHPSs as service in the context of the
                     SLAC in the United States. There are two reasons for the focus. First, we are engaged
                     in 
                     DH at SLACs and therefore are best positioned to discuss DHPSs in this context. Second,
                     the 
                     primary focus of scholarship on DH pedagogy is situated in research-intensive universities.
                     
                     Yet, tens of thousands of people labor in the academy at institutions where teaching
                     is the 
                     priority or on par with research [<a class="ref" href="#casselman2016">Casselman 2016</a>]. Throughout the United 
                     States, there are almost 250 institutions of higher education that are classified
                     as 
                     “Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts &amp; Sciences Focus” by the 
                     Carnegie Classification system. Our argument therefore is shaped by and aimed at scholars
                     
                     laboring in this setting, which is often overlooked by the field. Given our roles
                     as 
                     tenure-stream faculty, we build our argument around those roles, and suggest implications
                     for 
                     colleagues in other kinds of positions and for the field at large. 
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">While we hope this article will have broad appeal, a primary audience is
                     tenure-stream and tenured faculty who have control over processes such as annual
                     reviews, mid-course reviews, tenure and promotion, and who sit on school and
                     university committees and may be rising in their administration. There is often a
                     false-binary discussion about higher education between the faculty/staff and “the
                     administration”. Yet, “the administration” is composed of colleagues who have risen
                     through the ranks of the faculty and staff. At small liberal arts colleges and many
                     institutions across the U.S., it is these very same faculty who become “the
                     administration”. Therefore, we see shifting the discourse for how we frame our labor
                     as a part of a longer shift in ideologies that we hope will lead to material
                     changes, within departments, units, and hopefully at the very top, even if it takes
                     time. We have more influence than is often a part of our national conversation.
                     Let’s take part of the power back.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The prevailing model for assessment of faculty is the tripartite of research,
                     teaching, and service. To receive tenure and promotions, faculty must
                     demonstrate their abilities in these three areas. The categories reflect the
                     scope of work expected from each faculty member, which includes engaging in the
                     creation of knowledge, enabling learning, and participating in supporting and
                     building the institution. While they seem capacious, research and teaching are
                     actually narrowly defined and beholden to priorities established during
                     administrative shifts at land-grant institutions in the early-twentieth century
                     and refined as the student population shifted after WWII [<a class="ref" href="#shuster2008">Shuster and Finkelstein 2008</a>]. 
                     Research is meant to contribute knowledge to a particular scholarly community where
                     
                     the work can be assessed for its “novelty” and “rigor” in the forms that 
                     garner the most credit, i.e., “products” such as articles, books, and patents. 
                     Teaching is aimed at students who are enrolled by the faculty member's employer and
                     
                     includes course instruction alongside advising and mentorship. For example, Bowdoin
                     
                     College's and the University of Richmond's guidelines for teaching define teaching
                     as 
                     student instruction in the classroom, consultation outside of the classroom (i.e.,
                     
                     office hours), and student advising. As a result, leading a DHPS at one's own or another
                     
                     institution does not count as teaching. Rather, a DHPS is considered service, which
                     has 
                     become a catch all for labor that falls outside research and teaching. Even though
                     service often
                     includes intellectual labor that results in the transfer or creation of
                     knowledge, it is frequently treated as lesser or second-tier work in
                     institutional evaluation, compounding the vulnerability of DH practitioners not
                     in permanent or tenure-track positions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">This is particularly fraught when the knowledge is centered on technology, often
                     seen as a research tool rather than a research subject and a key way of knowing.
                     A values-based DHPS is thus challenging to categorize, particularly when
                     collaborative experimentation driven by intersectional-feminist priorities leads
                     to new knowledge about an instructor's or participant's primary materials during
                     a workshop. The instructor and participants with DH backgrounds could be
                     learning more about the collaborative, experimental, and intersectional feminist
                     affordances of the method and their related tools (per best practices in DH),
                     while a non-DH participant will (hopefully) leave with at least a deeper
                     understanding of the texts, images, or other data being used in the DHPS. The DH
                     pedagogy components of the DHPS might remain invisible to these participants in
                     spite of their necessary presence for achieving the outcomes related to those
                     primary materials.

                     higher education landscape in the United States. Different kinds of institutions
                     emphasize particular parts, which (ideally) is explicitly addressed in tenure
                     and promotion guidelines. Small liberal arts colleges like ours, for example,
                     often discuss this triad as teaching, research, and service in order to
                     communicate the order of importance. The University of Richmond explicitly
                     states that “teaching is the most important area of faculty 
                     performance” [<a class="ref" href="#universityofrichmond2018">University of Richmond 2018</a>]. Bowdoin College 
                     declares that “a high standard of teaching... is essential” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bowdoincollege2019">Bowdoin College 2019</a>]. What one will almost never find is a guideline that 
                     begins with service in university documents or in colloquial usage, placing the DHPS
                     in 
                     a vulnerable category of institutional labor. As scholarship in higher education has
                     shown, 
                     service is the least valued component of the triad and almost never a reason one is
                     denied 
                     tenure or promotion. In fact, departments actively try to shield early career faculty
                     from
                     service, emphasizing that attention should be focused on research and teaching.
                     Given how little service “counts”, it is no wonder that faculty often focus
                     their attention elsewhere.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e315">[2]</a> Reconfiguring how we count different parts of academic labor 
                     becomes a necessity for recognizing the multiple sites in which DH pedagogy is practiced
                     and 
                     for enabling a values-based DH profession.

                     vetting and evaluation by a professional authority, and credentialing) include
                     elements that are at odds with the collaborative, feminist, intersectional
                     approach that many DH practitioners embody and share. The DHPS must almost
                     always be customized at least to the institution, if not to the participants,
                     and to the particular area(s) of DH in which the instructor has expertise,
                     decentralizing the curriculum. Moreover, the ethos of collaborative resource
                     sharing and the rate of change of technologies to support this work create a
                     dynamic menu of activities, methods, and agendas for the locally instantiated
                     DHPS. Suggesting that the DHPS could or should conform to one ideal that can be
                     judged for common content or skill-based outcomes would curtail the agility of
                     the field and its practitioners. This resistance to the markers of formal
                     instruction risks relegating the DHPS to the status of informal learning (another
                     devalued category in higher education), as though it were not led by a teacher,
                     based on a shared set of values and practices, or reliant on lesson plans and
                     pedagogical theory.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e320">[3]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Thus, DHPSs are often categorized as service because they are seen as professional
                     development for attendees. The current institutional logic is as follows. While
                     a researcher develops and shares scholarship, the person who leads a DHPS is
                     leading professional development and therefore engaged in service. The person
                     attending, on the other hand, can categorize the products of their time and
                     labor as teaching. As a result, a DHPS is not a form of knowledge transfer that
                     is recognized by institutional definitions as research, because it is not a
                     finished product in the form of a publication or creative work, or teaching,
                     because the attendees are not the institution's definition of a student. Yet,
                     such logic is problematic.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">A comparison to other fields highlights the incongruities. When an aspiring
                     Italian literary scholar wants to learn how to incorporate cinematic critique
                     into their practice, they take a graduate course from a specialist. When an
                     American studies scholar wants to include a contemporary ecological analysis of
                     a site in a seminar, they invite a colleague to guest lecture and teach the
                     class. That is, when we step outside our field or even subfield as pedagogues,
                     there are formal and informal ways to include specialist methods and tools in
                     our courses. These ways of expanding disciplinary coverage are recognized as
                     pedagogical for the specialist who is bringing that information to the scholar's
                     training or the colleague's class. If cinematic critique were treated as only
                     showing a movie, or if environmental studies were introduced as only reporting
                     test results, then the epistemologies, priorities, and ethics of those
                     disciplines would be reduced to a tool or output. Since they are not, the
                     specialists' roles as teachers are recognized. However, when it comes to
                     computational and digital methods, the same process of sharing analytical
                     methods through tools is often not seen as intellectual expertise that takes a
                     knowledgeable pedagogue.

                     tripartite faculty evaluation. DH faculty regularly teach seminars across the
                     curriculum from first year seminars to writing seminars to senior capstone
                     seminars. Faculty introduce new concepts and experiment with new ideas. They may
                     be centered on a particular topic and/or method. Tilton's “Introduction to
                     Digital Humanities” course is a case in point. As a seminar, the class meets each
                     week so that participants may develop their methodological toolkit. At Bowdoin,
                     DH faculty frequently consult, via weekly meetings, with students conducting
                     independent studies or Honors projects in another department. Those students
                     become conduits for DH methods and mindsets into the practices of colleagues in
                     those fields. How is this so different from a DHPS?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">We turn to another set of examples from the digital humanities community to
                     further our argument that DHPSs should also be considered teaching. DH institutes
                     are a popular form of knowledge creation and sharing, i.e., teaching, in the
                     field. Examples include the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at the
                     University of Victoria, Humanities Intensive Learning and Technology (HILT) in
                     the United States, the European Summer Institute in Digital Humanities at the
                     University of Leipzig, and the Winter Institute in Digital Humanities at New
                     York University, Abu Dhabi. Along with learning new methodologies for research,
                     courses also focus on DH pedagogy and praxis. DHSI courses at the University of
                     Victoria have counted toward institutional credit, which indicates their value
                     as teaching [<a class="ref" href="#proposal2014">Proposal 2014</a>]. While most do not carry academic credit, 
                     and we are not arguing that they necessarily should, the point is that the knowledge
                     sharing that occurred was seen as commensurate with what is called teaching in
                     the triad.

                     colleges. If the emphasis is on teaching, then becoming an excellent teacher who
                     is using appropriate and up-to-date scholarship and pedagogies, as is articulated
                     in 
                     many guidelines, requires learning.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e342">[4]</a> Rather 
                     than structurally disincentivizing a set of experts from teaching those would-be learners,
                     
                     we argue that we need to rethink how we categorize the labor that makes DHPSs possible.
                     
                     In other words, it is necessary to expand our definitions of who is teaching and learning
                     and
                     therefore how we define teaching in the promotion triad of the U.S. academy. This
                     issue is more acute given that institutional assessment structures require that
                     all labor be assigned to one part of the triad, otherwise that labor does not
                     count. The aim is not only to make sure that this labor counts but also be
                     recognized as important. While it may be tempting to dismiss this issue as an
                     elite problem, there are also implications for the larger DH community to which
                     we now turn. In the section that follows, we dive deeper into what we can learn
                     from data about DHPSs.

                     work, we used the process of data creation as an epistemological method and
                     created a data set in July 2019. As theorized by Klein and D'Ignazio, we
                     approached data collection as a potential means of action against power
                     imbalances, to better analyze the systems that maintain it, and to
                     potentially shift our own framework of understanding [<a class="ref" href="#klein2020">Klein and D'Ignazio 2020</a>]. 
                     This process drew our attention to the scope of the phenomenon of the DHPS, 
                     the institutional categories that sustain it, the embedded hierarchies in its 
                     presentation, and the range of definitions that can exist for this work. We thus 
                     employ a broad definition for DHPS, understanding that the integration of pedagogical
                     training alongside DH methods could occur with different proportions and
                     intentions. This means that DHPS, as it is self-identified, encompasses
                     presentations on teaching with DH, workshops on how to incorporate a DH
                     method or tool into a course, and sessions dedicated specifically to DH
                     pedagogy. We acknowledge that institutional capacities and interests impact
                     the duration and frequency of DHPS offerings. In light of the labor concerns
                     highlighted in this paper, opportunities for multiple-day, intensive
                     workshops often require resources that are simply unavailable. Thus, a DHPS
                     could be as short as a 20-minute presentation, a one-hour working lunch with
                     collaborators, or several consecutive meetings of a cohort. Our definition
                     embraces the largest tent for DH, relying on presenters and organizers to
                     label their pedagogical interventions as part of the field.

                     such as 
                     an online calendar, disciplinary communities such as the DH Slack, and public-facing
                     social 
                     media such as Twitter. The result was 226 events at 76 institutions. These do not
                     include national 
                     or regional conference presentations, nor do these events include instructional workshops
                     for common 
                     DH tools, unless they were advertised with a teaching or pedagogical component. We
                     documented the 
                     title of the event, a link to our source, information about instructor fields and
                     titles, 
                     institutional characteristics, and any moments in which we were estimating the length
                     of the DHPS.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">Given the institutional priorities surrounding these events, the amount of funding
                     for DH in general, 
                     and our labor constraints, we anticipate that the 226 events in our final data set
                     are a fraction 
                     of the DHPS that have occurred since 2015 in North America. Aside from established
                     summer
                     institutes like DHSI, the DHPS is an intensely local event, meaning that documentation
                     and visibility 
                     of this labor exists at an institutional level, often unseen by the profession at
                     large. The challenge 
                     of identifying and aggregating data about DHPSs is itself an indicator of the limited
                     outside
                     visibility of what we do, which exacerbates the problematic understanding of how to
                     categorize that 
                     work according to the logic of institutions of higher education in the United States.

                     our attention to

                     that follow. 
                     When we discuss the challenges that the structure of the DHPS creates for instilling
                     a values-based DH more 
                     broadly (in the second section of the article), we will discuss the relationship between
                     the instructor and 
                     the institution that hosts the DHPS, trends in duration of DHPSs, and the titles and
                     status of DHPS instructors. 
                     Here, for accountability purposes for institutional logic of evaluation, we focus

                     of the DHPS in the

                     academy that exacerbate 
                     professional risk. Experimentation can beget failure that is deemed unproductive in
                     a publish-or-perish 
                     research context; collaboration encounters the hurdle of devaluation in promotion
                     and hiring; and intersectional, 
                     feminist practices face institutionalized obstacles to adoption. In addition, because
                     service is often the 
                     least valued component of the model, DH pedagogy at the institutional level then becomes
                     marginalized labor 
                     even while it is essential to the program building that would offer less precarity
                     for DH practitioners on 
                     campus. There are then even greater stakes for DH specialists who are not on the tenure
                     track. As
                     long as the academy views this kind of labor as service, in spite of the pedagogical
                     expertise it requires, 
                     those instructors risk further marginalization. As a result, it is even more important
                     to recognize DHPSs as
                     teaching in the Teaching-Research-Service model of university labor.

                     trying to define

                     the standard format 
                     of DHPSs: the workshop structure and the institutional location of the instructors.
                     Miriam Posner 
                     is forthright about the challenges presented by these workshops: unscripted work is
                     messy and
                     hard, the timing of the workshop often doesn't align with the need for a new tool,
                     and it is hard to feel 
                     connected to a community of users in such a small window of time [<a class="ref" href="#posner2016">Posner 2016</a>]. Indeed, 
                     for the workshops we studied at liberal arts colleges and Masters universities, 80%
                     lasted 90 minutes or
                     less. By comparison, 95% of DHPSs at doctoral institutions were 90 minutes or shorter.
                     Often, panels are 
                     broken into 15-20 minute segments for multiple presenters. Moreover, being given an
                     opportunity to 
                     report on pedagogical interventions is markedly different from teaching a class of
                     adult learners
                     how to blend the priorities and tools of DH with their current practice. We also acknowledge
                     that 
                     collaboration is often fraught with the labor tensions that cross the faculty-staff
                     divide on many campuses 
                     and that different collaborators may not share common goals [<a class="ref" href="#wagner2019">Wagner2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#graban2019">Graban et al. 2019</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">We agree with Posner in her advocacy for bootcamps, longer training schedules, and
                     immersive 
                     experiences that enact as well as educate for collaboration [<a class="ref" href="#posner2016">Posner 2016</a>]. The implication 
                     of this finding is that the DHPS instructor typically has the length of a single class
                     period (or less)
                     to report or instruct methodology as well as to model the ethos of digital humanities
                     pedagogy, if not call 
                     attention directly to the values embraced therein. While the space for explicit engagement
                     with teaching is
                     constrained, the environment of such DHPSs nonetheless requires the successful instructor
                     to deploy 
                     aspects of DH pedagogy to instruct colleagues. Collaboration is thus difficult to
                     model, let alone teach, in
                     the time allotted for DHPSs, when it is seen as service rather than teaching. Short
                     periodization does not 
                     allow for reflection or critique on the use of the tool, thus overemphasizing quick,
                     transferable skill 
                     building with the goal of a product, rather than engaging in a process of interrogation.
                     Where collaboration 
                     might be a stated value, institutional structures privilege an outcome that is antithetical
                     to much of the 
                     current conversation on DH values.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">The second challenge facing collaboration is the institutional location of the instructors
                     and their 
                     relationship to attendees. As a corollary to the challenges of timing identified above,
                     one the basic 
                     rules that Posner identifies is “nobody comes to workshops” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#posner2016">Posner 2016</a>]. This is compounded by the number of invited instructors and the precarity 
                     of instructors' roles at their home institution. For DHPSs hosted at liberal arts
                     colleges in our
                     data, we observed that 45% of instructors were invited to campus, meaning that their
                     motivation to form 
                     partnerships or ability to maintain collaborations were limited. (This is comparable
                     to the 40% of invited 
                     DHPS instructors at doctoral institutions.) For context, Wagner's 2019 study on DH
                     research reported that 
                     66% of partnerships involved collaborators at the same institution. At the University
                     of Richmond, we 
                     intentionally blended this in order to model cross-institutional collaboration as
                     well as to build
                     in sustainability. At Bowdoin, we have primarily focused on workshops with local instructors,
                     allowing us 
                     to offer several iterations over time and build a cohort of colleagues who are developing
                     DH pedagogy 
                     skills in text analysis specifically. Admittedly, we have benefitted from an institutional
                     commitment to growing DH organically at the college.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">That commitment is important to note, because the greatest challenge to sustained
                     collaboration 
                     remains the precarity of many of the instructors and specialists in the field. As
                     Christina Boyles, 
                     Anne Cong-Huyen, Carrie Johnston, Jim McGrath, and Amanda Phillips poignantly document,
                     DH
                     colleagues who could be potential collaborators are frequently providing support without
                     the resources 
                     of a dedicated center, trying to balance complex research needs with administrative
                     burdens of educating and
                     persuading a C-suite to maintain funding for DH initiatives, and doing so under the
                     professional burdens 
                     of temporary positions [<a class="ref" href="#boyles2018">Boyles et al. 2018</a>]. Even at institutions with a higher level of commitment 
                     to DH such as Bowdoin, this was Crystal's experience, starting as a postdoctoral fellow
                     with the 
                     expectation of building an undergraduate program, transitioning to a visiting assistant
                     professorship 
                     while generating institutional buy-in, and then undergoing promotion and tenure review
                     in DH based on 
                     teaching and scholarship in the field (in that order of priority). When funding ends
                     for initiatives, or 
                     when a person moves into a new, and hopefully less precarious, position, collaborations
                     are difficult to 
                     maintain, presuming that local interested colleagues took the risk of starting such
                     projects under 
                     circumstances of precarity. This status of DH practitioners is evident in the data
                     about workshop instructors, 
                     40% of whom were in non-tenure stream positions for liberal arts college workshops
                     (compared with 60% at
                     doctoral institutions). Building sustainable, long term DH pedagogy collaborations
                     becomes nearly impossible 
                     when the labor necessary for DHPSs is devalued.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Reconsidering DHPSs as teaching also enables experimentation. In his oft-cited blog
                     post, Tom Scheinfeldt 
                     questioned the refrain, “Where's the beef?” Those posing the question argued 
                     that DH lacked arguments, which remains a popular debate from scholars, particularly
                     in digital history. 
                     While others have engaged in debates over the merit of the claim that DH does not
                     make arguments, Scheinfeldt 
                     questioned what was so wrong with experimenting as scholarly knowledge. “We need time 
                     to experiment”, he argued [<a class="ref" href="#scheinfeldt2012">Scheinfeldt 2012</a>]. Experimentation, he argued, has long 
                     been recognized as a way of knowing. Just ask a scientist, hacker, tinkerer, or maker.
                     He's not alone.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">The idea of experimentation is so pervasive in DH, Lisa Spiro notes, that she offers
                     it as one of the 
                     six values that she suggests for the field. “As in the sciences, digital humanities 
                     projects often use data, tools, and methods to examine particular questions”, she writes, adding 
                     that “the work supports interpretation and exploration” [<a class="ref" href="#spiro2012">Spiro 2012</a>]. 
                     The same holds true for teaching and pedagogy. Experimenting with which DH methods
                     to teach or utilize in a 
                     course necessitates a space where one can learn these methods, hence the emergence
                     of the DHPS.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">Yet, the ability to experiment in a DHPS is compromised when this teaching practice
                     is framed as service. 
                     Service is most often about sharing responsibility for maintenance and development
                     of institutional structures
                     and to perform administrative tasks within a defined timeline for completed components.
                     Experimentation on the 
                     other hand is as much about process as result. DHPSs therefore risk being assessed
                     alongside maintaining a
                     department and successfully carrying out administrative tasks. The assessment model
                     of the institution can 
                     then foreclose experimentation because service is measured by effectiveness and productivity.
                     As a result,
                     teaching a series of tools that one can numerically count as evidence of knowledge
                     transfer, for example, 
                     becomes appealing.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">Productive failure, therefore, is rarely an option. In a neoliberal effort to transfer
                     as much knowledge 
                     as “efficiently” as possible, the short duration and schedule of DHPSs create expectations for immediate
                     
                     and quick results. This disincentivizes experimenting with a new method and its related
                     tools. The stakes are 
                     even higher for contingent and precarious colleagues. This is a particularly acute
                     issue because the 
                     instructors of on-campus DHPSs are frequently early career scholars, untenured, or
                     term positions, according to
                     our data. The person's position can preclude productive experimentation and failure,
                     which is a continual part 
                     of teacher development and central to DH.

                     such as race and

                     power structures 
                     that produce gendered inequalities. The DHPS represents the very moment of training

                     As Elizabeth Losh 
                     and Jacqueline Weirnemont point out in the introduction to their exciting volume on
                     feminist DH, 
                     “trivialization of feminist methodologies continues within the field” and they 
                     call for coalition building and communal care to resist the structural misogyny that
                     marginalizes certain 
                     aspects of the field. One area where structural misogyny permeates DH is the topic
                     of DH pedagogy. At the 
                     annual DH conferences 2105-2019, of the 400+ workshops, long papers, short papers,
                     and posters each year, 
                     contributions on pedagogy range from a minimum of 3 papers (2015) to a maximum of
                     11 (2016, 2018). Pedagogy 
                     finds a marginalized home in the research space of the field. Examples abound including
                     the programming of 
                     the international DH conference, citation practices, and the language of “hard”, scientific research 
                     versus “soft”, pedagogical work [<a class="ref" href="#losh2018">Losh and Wernimont 2018</a>]. Therefore, it is difficult to make compelling
                     arguments to institutions to value DH pedagogical labor when hyper-visible and vocal
                     aspects of DH marginalize 
                     this labor.

                     pedagogies in DH and in 
                     our institutions through DHPSs [<a class="ref" href="#park1996">Park 1996</a>]. One way is to focus on process and not product, 
                     which brings us back to centering collaboration and experimentation. The three values
                     are interconnected and 
                     mutually reinforcing. The combination moves the student-colleague, through DH pedagogy,
                     into a space of 
                     reflection on method and priorities in their field as well as ours. One way we model
                     and convey these as DH 
                     values is through the DHPS. For example, when we lead a DHPS, we don't identify a
                     list of tools, but rather 
                     discuss how we will be engaging in a set of methods in order to evaluate tools, process
                     and outcomes.
                     Experimentation and play become critical.

                     This necessitates 
                     conversations about power structures in archives, histories and cultural contexts
                     of tool development, and 
                     responsible data creation. This work takes time, which is why we resist the call for
                     a quick, one-time DHPS. 
                     Quick, efficient, digestible knowledge transfer is capitalist and gendered logic that

                     Rather, creating more stable, long term models for DHPSs that center intersectional
                     feminist values through 
                     collaboration and experimentation is one way that DHPSs can avoid replicating problematic
                     power dynamics that 
                     are at odds with values of the field. A more sustained model also gives us more space

                     By juxtaposing the values of the field against the form that our practice takes when

                     Graban et al. also highlight care within collaboration, adding the principles of identifying

                     of recognition, making labor visible through documentation, “acknowledging a spectrum”

                     making these ideological changes through a shift in our DH practices and discourses,
                     we can be a part of

                     Rather, the call to consider DHPSs as yeaching means continuing to work within the
                     current institutional 
                     stratification of labor. Since the current system for faculty evaluation requires
                     assigning all labor to 
                     one of these three categories, another challenge arises. It is difficult to argue
                     for “counting” a type of
                     labor as more than one part. Therefore, a DHPS in most settings will count as either
                     teaching or service, much 
                     like all other forms of labor.

                     some of the structural

                     the work of groups such as
                     Humane Metrics Initiative (HuMetricsHSS) is helping us rethink how we define and assess
                     labor across the 
                     humanities and social sciences.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e850">[6]</a> Models such as the one proposed by HuMetrics and Lisa Spiro offer
                     the possibility to tear down the Teaching-Research-Service tripartite that has been
                     in place over the past 
                     several decades. Our call to reassess how we categorize DHPSs is a step in the direction,
                     we hope, of a more 
                     radical and, dare we say, “productive” future for DH and higher education.
