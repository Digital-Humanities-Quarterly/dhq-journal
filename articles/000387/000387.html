                  <p>Rather than seeing hypertext as offering only distracted reading, this paper
                     argues that annotation software provides students with the opportunity to
                     perform recursive reading: a process that facilitates knowledge transfer and
                     encourages intersectional critical approaches to texts. As hypertext editions
                     and online reading communities have proliferated, scholars have theorized that
                     these layered, interactive modes of reading produce distracted readings of
                     texts, especially in pedagogical contexts. With annotation software, however,
                     researchers and students have the opportunity not just to consume these
                     distracted readings, but to produce them. Within the classroom, annotation
                     software assignments require a deeper psychological investment from students
                     than simply consuming a hypertext edition. By choosing how and where to annotate
                     a particular text, students’ distributed modes of attention are re-focused on
                     the text itself, pulling disparate threads of thought together.

                     death of intellectual thought. One need not look far in popular media to find
                     the myriad thinkpieces suggesting that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/20/internet-altering-your-mind" onclick="window.open('https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/20/internet-altering-your-mind'); return false" class="ref">distractibility of youth is at an all-time high</a>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-has-become-the-external-hard-drive-for-our-memories/" onclick="window.open('https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-has-become-the-external-hard-drive-for-our-memories/'); return false" class="ref">that Google has replaced the need for memory</a>, and that media

                        clickbait</a> rather than “real news.” These
                     (ironically) online arguments are supported by illustratively titled volumes
                     about the evils of online reading, such as Nicholas Carr’s <cite class="title italic">The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains</cite> and Mark
                     Bauerlein’s <cite class="title italic">The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age
                        Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes the Future</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#carr2010">Carr 2010</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bauerlein2008">Bauerlein 2008</a>]. According to these authors, readers who consume
                     text exclusively or mainly online have lost the ability to concentrate on a
                     single text from beginning to end: or in other words, they are no longer linear
                     readers, dedicating their time and energy to the words on the page in the order
                     they appear. Instead, these readers are hopelessly distracted by the online
                     reading experience, as ads, embedded links, and mouse-over hovertext pull their
                     attention several directions at once, ensuring that nothing of substance enters
                     long-term memory. In this view, supported by educational studies that
                     demonstrate that reading online encourages selective consumption and lesser
                     recall [<a class="ref" href="#liu2005">Liu 2005</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#carr2010">Carr 2010</a>], the Internet’s incredible potential for information
                     sharing and computing power is too easily overshadowed by the possibly more
                     numerous possibilities for distraction and procrastination.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">On the other hand, defenses of reading and intellectual thought in today’s
                     hyper-connected world have become nearly as common as their critiques. In
                     particular, Jerome McGann argued early on that reading online, especially text
                     enhanced with hypertext, enables radial reading rather than (or in addition to)
                     linear reading, which “involves decoding one or more of
                     the contexts that interpenetrate the scripted and physical text”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 119]. The embedded links that direct readers to images, sources, and
                     supplemental information, the online dictionaries that define words as they are
                     read, and the sheer potential for directed individual research all add up to a
                     deeper and broader reading of a text, rather than a shallower one. According to
                     McGann, moreover, hypertext only makes manifest the fact that all texts, to
                     greater and lesser extents, “function in a radial field”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 126]. Books have never existed in a vacuum, and to some extent the linear
                     reader who starts at the beginning of a text and reads through to the end is
                     largely a fiction: a “linear” reader may stop to consult with
                     a dictionary or historical source, flip to the endnotes or critical works in an
                     edited edition, or mentally or physically compare the work at hand with any
                     number of other related texts. In other words, linear reading is interrupted by
                     radial thinking. A well-designed online text, by embedding all of these
                     possibilities in a single web page, might paradoxically allow for a more
                     continuous reading experience than a physical book that would need to be put
                     down to acquire the same information. To a medievalist, hypertext can also
                     function as a modernization of a long-standing practice: consider a
                     heavily-glossed medieval Bible, in which scribes used the margins of the page to
                     both reproduce and contribute to interpretations of the text such that on some
                     pages the distinction between Biblical text and commentary is nearly erased. It
                     is difficult to argue that such commentary, while undeniably distracting, is
                     either shallow or anti-intellectual. Nor does online reading disallow or destroy
                     more traditional linear reading practices: David Dowling describes the
                     phenomenon of online reading groups communally reading <cite class="title italic">Moby
                        Dick</cite>, for example, and points to the revival of longform news
                     articles that are no longer limited in length by the physical standards of the
                     printed page [<a class="ref" href="#dowling2010">Dowling 2010</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dowling2014">Dowling 2014</a>]. Recent studies in education also suggest that the
                     reading comprehension gap between print and screen is closing [<a class="ref" href="#cull2011">Cull 2011</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#eden2013">Eden and Eshet-Alkalai 2013</a>]. According to this perspective, the Internet age
                     offers new horizons of insight, knowledge, and shared intellectual work.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">These defenses complicate the too-attractive binary that longform linear reading
                     is “good,” under attack, and must be recovered in online
                     communities, while hypertext-enabled radial reading is “bad,”
                     distracted, and deliberately erodes traditional thought. Yet in the classroom,
                     we often reproduce such assumptions unthinkingly, assigning traditional reading
                     and writing assignments that can clash poorly with a student who is
                     accomplishing these tasks on a phone or tablet. There is also little doubt that
                     a student occupied with Facebook both contributes and learns less than one not
                     so distracted. The hyperbolic clash between naysayers predicting the end of
                     human civilization and enthusiasts pointing to a blessed new dawn faces a far
                     more prosaic reality in the classroom: that the Internet age presents neither
                     our salvation nor our damnation, but instead a set of tools. Hypertext and other
                     aspects of online text can undoubtedly enhance our students’ understanding by
                     encouraging radial reading. They can also present considerable distractions, as
                     anyone who has gone on a late-night Wikipedia binge can relate. In the
                     classroom, then, our task is to harness the potential of hypertext without
                     falling prey to the unproductive kind of distraction.

                     to consume texts online in deliberate, scholarly ways. Many studies have already
                     indicated that online hypertext annotations can combat the tendency towards
                     shallow digital reading that [<a class="ref" href="#carr2010">Carr 2010</a>] notes in <cite class="title italic">The Shallows</cite>. [<a class="ref" href="#porter-odonell2004">Porter-O’Donnell 2004</a>]
                     demonstrates that annotated content promotes greater reading comprehension in
                     digital contexts than the same content without such annotations. [<a class="ref" href="#chen2014">Chen and Chen 2014</a>] likewise report statistically significant improvements
                     in elementary-age students’ reading abilities with the use of a collaborative
                     annotation system. The majority of these studies, however, focus on reading
                     comprehension as the primary goal, which in the college English classroom is
                     only the necessary first step in teaching students how to critically engage with
                     a text. Our goal is not to have students simply understand the content of a
                     text, but instead to teach them to see the multivalent, polyphonic possibilities
                     in every text. We hypothesized that we could harness the same deeper reading
                     encouraged by online annotation in order to produce what we call recursive
                     reading: a process that goes beyond simple comprehension in order to facilitate
                     knowledge transfer and encourage a layered and intersectional critical approach
                     to texts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">In pursuit of that aim, we considered how we accomplished one of the most basic
                     goals of English literature classes: teaching students to read critically. In
                     our methods class at our small liberal arts college, we teach our students
                     methodologies and theories for approaching literature — such as formalism, new
                     historicism, psychoanalytic criticism, queer theory, etc. — and we do this
                     either overtly by calling attention to the names and histories of these
                     practices, or implicitly through our own emphasis on certain approaches with
                     certain texts. For instance, if we are teaching Charles Dickens’ <cite class="title italic">Oliver Twist</cite>, we might choose to engage new
                     historicist methods by exploring the historical implications of
                     industrialization, including background on the Poor Laws, mortality rates, and
                     the general squalor of nineteenth-century London. Alternately, if we teach
                     Chaucer’s <cite class="title italic">Wife of Bath’s Tale</cite>, we might approach

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Immediately problematic, however, is that while we might spend a great deal of
                     time teaching a methodological or theoretical approach in conjunction with one

                     Students siloed their knowledge of a particular methodological approach, such
                     that they could apply new historicism only as it pertained to Dickens or gender
                     studies as it applied to Chaucer. What we as instructors saw as lenses a
                     critical reader might use to interrogate <em class="emph">any</em> text became fixed to a
                     single text, or at best a time period. The difficulty of knowledge transfer
                     became clear: students resisted seeing these concepts as dynamic, intersecting,
                     and malleable, instead fusing particular theories with individual texts or time
                     periods. There was no transfer across texts, no return to prior knowledge to
                     integrate it as we moved forward on our syllabi.

                     <blockquote>

                           Most research has found […] that (a) transfer occurs
                           neither often nor automatically, and (b) the more dissimilar the
                           learning and transfer contexts, the less likely successful transfer will
                           occur. In other words, much as we would like them to, students often do
                           not successfully apply relevant skills or knowledge in novel
                           contexts.

                     </blockquote> Therefore, our students’ inability to read across theoretical and
                     methodological approaches did not originate from laziness or lack of engagement,
                     but from the need for this skill to be explicitly taught rather than assumed. In
                     their germinal work on knowledge transfer, David Perkins and Gavriel Salomon
                     posit that there are a range of types of transfer. One kind of transfer “involves the spontaneous, automatic
                     transfer of highly practiced skills, with little need for reflective
                     thinking,” while the other kind of transfer requires “the explicit conscious
                     formulation of abstraction in one situation that allows making a
                     connection to another”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#salomon1989">Salomon and Perkins 1989</a>, 118]. Often referred to as low-road vs. high-road transfer, what distinguishes
                     the two is the need for “mindful abstraction” or
                     “deliberate, usually metacognitively guided and
                     effortful, decontextualization of a principle.” Emphasizing the need
                     for teaching these skills, Perkins and Salomon insist that the best environment
                     for transfer is one in which “skills of mindful attention to and management of one’s
                     own processes were taught along with the strategies themselves”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Turning to the role of writing in supporting knowledge transfer, in <cite class="title italic">Writing Across Contexts</cite>, Kathleen Yancey, et. al. ask: “how we can help students develop
                     writing knowledge and practices that they can draw upon, use, and
                     repurpose for new writing tasks in new settings”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#yancey2014">Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak 2014</a>, 2]. Thinking about transfer in the writing context, Yancey et. al. suggest
                     sequential writing assignments which emphasize return and revision in the
                     writing process as a way of encouraging transfer. As <cite class="title italic">Writing Across Contexts</cite> indicates, most work about knowledge
                     transfer has considered it in the context of writing, and as a problem that can
                     be solved with writing solutions, such as assigning drafts and multiple rounds
                     of peer and instructor feedback. Yet as we continued to encounter difficulties
                     with knowledge transfer while teaching literary theory, it seemed to us that the
                     problem preexisted the writing aspect of our courses. We have all experienced
                     the student who, when faced with commentary that requires a full revision,
                     chooses to interpret that feedback in the least revelatory manner possible,
                     making few to none of the necessary changes. While for some students this
                     behavior can be linked to lack of time or interest, others with the same issue
                     lacked neither motivation nor time. What we came to discover was that for many
                     of these students, the problem lay not in their skills in writing, but to those
                     in reading. These students, once they had committed their ideas to paper, ceased
                     to regard their rough draft as <em class="emph">writing</em> – that is, in the full
                     present progressive sense, an idea still in progress – and instead began to see
                     it as <em class="emph">reading</em>. No longer was it a fluid form easily changed, but
                     instead a fixed point, more akin to one of their primary texts than their own
                     handiwork. This mindset made it almost impossible to engage in the kind of
                     revision that recursive writing requires.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e380">[2]</a> Moreover, this mindset makes it incredibly
                     difficult to learn multiple modes of theory. If, to our students, reading is a
                     fixed point, then by reading critical race theory alongside <cite class="title italic">Othello</cite>, it becomes impossible for students to then transfer it to
                     <cite class="title italic">The Tempest</cite>. In order to help solve the problem
                     of knowledge transfer, then, we needed to think more not just about writing, but
                     about how students read and interface with the texts we assign them.

                           of language. One of the most important steps, however, is to connect the

                           attach facts, ideas, concepts or perspectives to that known

                     </blockquote> Bean, along with Roberts and Roberts, agrees that for students to read
                     well and read deeply, they must engage and form associations with the text.
                     Elsewhere, scholars make the overt connection between recursive processes in the
                     writing practice and strong reading skills. The much-used anthology <cite class="title italic">Ways of Reading</cite> suggests, “strong readers, we’ve said,
                     remake what they have read to serve their own ends, putting things
                     together, figuring out how ideas and examples relate, explaining as best
                     they can material that is difficult or problematic…At these moments, it
                     is hard to distinguish the act of reading from the act of
                     writing”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#bartholomae1993">Bartholomae and Petrosky 1993</a>, 13]. For Bartholomae and Petrosky, interacting with the text fuses the
                     process of reading and writing together. The recurring idea that reading and
                     writing should together emphasize a process of return and connection-making
                     suggested a method that could help us to surpass our students’ particular
                     cognitive difficulties. Furthermore, the idea of getting students to form “visual images” to represent
                     content, as proposed by Roberts and Roberts, immediately called to mind digital
                     tools. Echoing McGann’s discussions of “radial reading” that replaces linear reading, Rosenwasser and
                     Stephen, in <cite class="title italic">Writing Analytically,</cite> articulate what
                     they call recursive thinking: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           Thinking is not simply linear
                           and progressive, moving from point A to point B to point C like stops on
                           a train. Careful thinkers are always retracing their steps, questioning
                           their first – and second — impressions, assuming that they have missed
                           something. All good thinking is <em class="emph">recursive</em> — that is,
                           repeatedly going over the same ground, rethinking connections.
                            [<a class="ref" href="#rosenwasser2015">Rosenwasser and Stephen 2015</a>, 60]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> The recursivity scholars like Yancey saw as so crucial to writing, and
                     Rosenwasser and Stephen to thinking, we realized was equally crucial in reading.
                     We needed to teach our students to view reading not as a one-and-done singular
                     act, but instead as a process of returning and rethinking. More than simply
                     reading a text multiple times, we needed to teach them to be recursive readers,
                     continually returning to the text (whether their own or someone else’s) with new
                     information and encountering it afresh, integrating their new knowledge with the
                     old. If we could encourage visualization via digital tools that spurred our
                     students to be recursive readers, we might begin to dismantle our particular
                     problem of siloed knowledge and encourage students to transfer knowledge across
                     contexts within our classrooms.

                     Annotation assignments seemed the obvious choice, but annotation, or text
                     markup, is not limited to digital tools, as our epigraph suggests. Interacting
                     with the text is a long-standing, analog literary practice, but one that we
                     wanted to revisit for a particular set of pedagogical outcomes. We needed to use
                     a tool that would encourage a textual interaction that was both fluid and visual
                     and that allowed students to return to the same text again and again in order to
                     emphasize rereading. We also wanted our students' work to be available to the
                     class as a whole.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e458">[3]</a> These goals together suggested
                     that a digital annotation tool was the solution to our pedagogical problem.

                     providing the same functionality has since been created by Sai Grandhi, a
                     Computer Science student at Dickinson College, for projects running the latest

Our argument for
                     using a locally hosted Drupal site over other, hosted annotation projects was
                     long-term reliability and the advantages to having a custom-built site for our
                     needs. Using a Drupal site meant that we could have our texts organized and in a
                     single location as opposed to having students share multiple Google or Office
                     365 documents. Over time, classes at Dickinson are able to add to the site as
                     well as utilize the work of previous students as examples of quality annotations
                     if desired. We also maintain the ability to make sections or even individual
                     pages of the site publicly available or private.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e475">[4]</a> Bryant also pointed
                     out, by hosting the site and the database ourselves, we would retain complete
                     access to the data created by professors and students for future digital
                     humanities projects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e478">[5]</a> In the end, a custom-built tool provided us with maximum flexibility
                     when thinking about the future use of text annotation. While we crafted a
                     highly-focused annotation project for our classrooms, the tool’s uses could
                     extend far beyond what we lay out in this essay. Additionally, by developing in
                     open source, the tools demonstrated can be utilized by others and modified to
                     fit new kinds of annotation projects.

                     tools” that allow users to “engage and reflect more critically upon texts instead of passively reading
                     them.” Bryant’s module works similarly to Annotation Studio in that
                     both sites are using the same tool (which is available here, <a href="http://annotatorjs.org/showcase.html" onclick="window.open('http://annotatorjs.org/showcase.html'); return false" class="ref">http://annotatorjs.org/showcase.html</a>) to highlight text and send the

                     and add annotations with comments or further questions. The practical uses of
                     annotation assignments, then, are not restricted to those with the capability to

                           Marxist theory, new historicism, formalism, gender theory, postcolonial
                           theory, ecocriticism, etc.). This course helps students frame interpretive

                     and “critical practice” over the duration of the major, <cite class="title italic">Introduction to Literary Studies</cite> implicitly demands
                     students learn how to utilize the knowledge of critical theories and
                     methodologies as they apply to a variety of literary objects. This means that
                     students will need to be able to transfer knowledge of theories and methods to
                     new texts within our <cite class="title italic">Introduction to Literary

                     foundational work of the class. Using the annotation tool developed in
                     consultation with Bryant, we created an assignment where each student chose a
                     poem and annotated it throughout the term. The catch was that each student
                     returned to the <em class="emph">same</em> poem again and again through the class,
                     annotating it each time with at least two new annotations utilizing the
                     methodology or theory we were currently studying.

                     theories and methodologies interacted, how their own highlighting and
                     annotations overlapped and intersected, and how repeatedly annotating the poem
                     allowed them to discover something new with each reading. This ability to return
                     to a particular reading and visually change and augment it was a moment of
                     reading deeply. Students read and re-read a text from many angles, viewing it
                     through a variety of different methodological or theoretical lenses. The
                     annotation module facilitated a digital space for students to be attentive to
                     the language of their poem through a recursive reading process.

                     dovetailed with our methods of writing as well. As in most classes emphasizing
                     writing, the course requires students to return to and revise drafts of papers
                     as they move through the class. Emphasizing reading as a process much like
                     writing made both writing and reading recursive, and it encouraged students to
                     approach their own drafts with the same renewed flexibility as they approached
                     their chosen poem. Finally, part of what worked particularly well here was that
                     each student chose a <em class="emph">different</em> poem. With a variety of poems, it
                     meant that each student became an expert on the chosen poem.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e584">[8]</a> At the end of a semester,
                     students were left with a visual, layered, hypertext record of their process
                     (and progress) in critical thinking, resulting in more nuanced integration of
                     critical methods in their essays and in-class work.

                     annotation module, we saw student improvement across three distinct course
                     assignments: knowledge transfer across annotations, analytical thinking in
                     essays, and awareness of knowledge gained in reflection essays. In the exhibits
                     that follow, we present examples of this student success. First, the annotations
                     themselves demonstrate examples of recursive reading and knowledge transfer
                     across theories and methodologies. Second, we offer an example from a student
                     essay that shows how the annotations encouraged students to see and see again,
                     prompting internal feedback that led to deeper analytical thinking in their
                     writing. Third, a final self-reflection essay assignment demonstrates evidence
                     of knowledge transfer not just within our classes, but potentially to future
                     classrooms and projects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">In Skalak’s class, after a four-week grounding in the literary theory of
                     formalism, students encountered a new, more conceptual lens: structuralism.
                     Scores on the weekly assignment plummeted, from an average of 8.3/10 to 5.5/10.
                     This drop was not unexpected: most students have encountered formalist
                     approaches in high school, but it is the rare secondary education that includes
                     readings on structuralism. Their initial attempts have been overwritten through
                     the semester-long revision process, but the feedback on one student’s attempt is
                     indicative of the whole. In the comment accompanying the student's numerical
                     score, Skalak writes: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>You have pointed to a
                           binary here in this line, but pointing out a binary does not make a
                           structuralist reading. The rest of your annotation is instead formalist,
                           focused on the tone and rhythm of the line. To think about this poem as a
                           structuralist might, consider the following questions: does the poem
                           construct itself around the binary opposition you notice here, or depend
                           upon the opposition being absolute and completely opposed? Why is it
                           significant to oppose these two? How does it affect our understanding of the
                           poem to see these as opposites?
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> From Skalak’s feedback, it is
                     apparent that this student had seized upon a key vocabulary term — binary
                     oppositions — and assumed that this sufficed to produce a structuralist reading,
                     suggesting an insufficient understanding of how to apply the theoretical
                     readings we had discussed in class. Unfortunately, the student misunderstood how
                     binaries might function within a structuralist reading. In the following week,
                     however, the class moved on to deconstruction, and once again the students faced
                     a new theoretical lens through which to view their chosen poem. Skalak
                     explicitly reminded the students that they could revisit previous sections of
                     the poem, taking a look at the same lines under a different lens. Nearly half
                     the class chose to layer their deconstruction reading directly over their
                     structuralist reading of the previous week, with auspicious results. The student
                     referenced above submitted these two responses:

                     </div> The same student who had struggled with her first structuralist
                     reading had now completely replaced her old annotation with two others: one
                     structuralist, and one that directly deconstructed that first reading. Here, the
                     student’s knowledge of formalism allowed her to see the poem’s connection
                     between inanimate goods and the sensuality of female bodies, which fueled her
                     structuralist observation that the poem creates four different categories for
                     these goods/bodies, like the “four corners” of the globe. Her
                     immediate re-reading of this section to reject such an easy categorization of
                     the world demonstrates her newfound understanding of deconstruction and
                     structuralism both. While not a perfect example of either theory, these attempts
                     demonstrated marked improvement. Rather than leave her lackluster attempt at
                     structuralism behind as only last week’s mistake, this recursive approach to
                     reading encouraged new, integrated learning: by reading the poem a second time,
                     this time through the lens of deconstruction, the student also came to better
                     understand the structuralism to which it responded. Even better, she
                     demonstrated successful knowledge transfer within the course as the lessons of
                     the previous week carried over into the next, building on and augmenting one
                     another. These annotations also pointed forward to our later studies of feminism
                     and critical race theory, and she returned to this section with great excitement
                     in class discussion to add further nuance to her initial readings.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20"> While Kersh’s class covered a slightly different range of critical theory,
                     evidence of transfer surfaced in annotations where students began to point out
                     readings that were catalyzed by overlapping or intersecting methodologies. For
                     example, one student began her reading of Alice Dunbar-Nelson’s “Sonnet” by carefully trying to parse the poem’s
                     approach to love in the beginning lines, “I had not thought of violets late,/ The wild, shy
                     kind that spring beneath your feet/ In wistful April days, when lovers mate/
                     And wander through the fields in raptures sweet.” What started as a
                     straight close reading of the symbolism of “violets” within the sonnet
                     became much more nuanced as the student reader began to theorize the metaphor of
                     violets as it related to the gender of the poet, to the time period in which it
                     was written, and then finally to race. In the annotation assignment prompt,
                     students were directed to label their annotations with parenthetical or
                     bracketed notations that identify the methodology or theory they engage (see
                     figures above). In the “Sonnet” annotations, the
                     student begins simply with notations such as “formalism” or “new
                     historicism” and as the weeks progress the notations begin to reflect the
                     intersections she has found labeling one “post-colonialism and cultural
                     materialism” then, more comically, “cultural materialism + a bit of
                     feminism.” While the student’s comfort with the assignment increased
                     alongside her willingness to push the boundaries of the prompt’s requirements,
                     what became increasingly clear was how in her own reading she found the poem
                     impossible to interpret using a single lens. Similar to Skalak’s student
                     analyzing “Ithaka,” the student working on
                     Dunbar-Nelson’s <cite class="title">Sonnet</cite> improved her own reading with each new
                     annotation. Each new interaction with the poem produced not just a
                     reconceptualization of the text, but articulated an intersection of theoretical
                     lenses. (See <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>)

                     analytical essays. After several weeks of annotation practice, our classes
                     required students to write a formalist essay on their chosen poem. Many chose to
                     return to subjects they had first noted in their annotations. Returning to their
                     annotations with fresh eyes, this time aimed at producing a paper-length
                     analysis, encouraged students to expand and improve upon their initial ideas. As

                        <p>Through a series of startling and unexpected
                           metaphors, John Donne makes the unusual assertion that love is, essentially,
                           nothing but deleterious. Donne employs the use of, primarily, metaphors, to
                           fully convey the destructive nature of love as a battle. These metaphors,
                           paired with the overarching theme of warfare, and finally, the conceit of
                           his heart being broken glass, effectively convey the idea that love is not
                           what most people perceive it be; it is a damaging and harmful conflict in
                           which no man can escape victorious. Just as war is a mentally and
                           emotionally scarring experience, so is love.

                     to present nothing especially exciting: after all, writers on the subject of
                     pedagogy have known for years that revising old ideas leads to better writing
                     outcomes. This is why we have all signed on to the doctrine of first drafts,
                     second drafts, and multiple sources of targeted feedback. What makes this
                     example worthy of note, however, is that it resulted not from peer or instructor
                     feedback, or from a revision of a draft, but from a student
                     re-<em class="emph">reading</em> the source text and independently revising his
                     thinking. He moves from a simple observation of recurring war images to a thesis
                     which takes into account the nuances of the poem’s metaphors.

                     the writing process, we also want students to see their own shortcomings and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">At the end of any class, we typically have two questions: first, did the students
                     learn the class objectives? Second, can they articulate what they have learned,
                     so as to better prepare them to transfer that knowledge forward to future
                     classes and future assignments? Our first two sets of examples address this
                     first concern, demonstrating how recursive reading fostered engagement with
                     critical theory and analytical writing. There we see how students rereading and
                     reworking a single text from a variety of lenses produced better, richer
                     engagement with both the lens and the primary text. One way to gauge the success
                     of this second question is to ask the students to reflect on the annotation
                     process. In a final assignment, Kersh’s students wrote a reflection paper about
                     the semester-long annotation assignment addressing two key components. First,
                     they were to outline their process for annotating their chosen poem and what
                     they learned from each annotation. Second, they were asked, “what did
                     annotating the poem, and then writing this paper, teach you? In other words,
                     what are you taking away from this digital poetry project after the
                     semester?” In the first two reflections, students articulate how their
                     process of reading changed during class, showing their own ability to engage in
                     metacognition, or thinking about how they think: 
                     <div class="example">

                            of it every time. I also learned not to get frustrated when I don’t
                            understand something right away, or I don’t see a clear understanding

                     three times” is essential to the process of reading well. Also
                     fascinating is the way she imagines her own bodily responses as she thinks about
                     and works through the poem. Her claim that “I would teach myself to breathe and come back to the poem with
                     a fresh start” resonates with John Bean’s imperative that students
                     devote “energy to the tasks” of
                     reading [<a class="ref" href="#bean2011">Bean 2011</a>, 162]. Moreover, she is teaching and
                     learning from herself; developing a critical awareness of her own process.

                            context. This is why we use so many different theories and
                            methodologies; to piece together the puzzle of the literature, to bring
                            together every background and contextual piece of evidence we can gather

                            yet above all, its contextual background was the thing that allowed me
                            to make these observations and view the piece through multiple lenses

                     is necessary. One reading or one theoretical approach “does not exist in solitude” and instead he implies
                     his own hard work “tied” the

                     articulate knowledge transfer. Indeed, most of our students began to see the
                     connections across theories and methodologies as we progressed through the
                     class, learning to apply and understand them in new contexts. In these final two
                     examples, however, recursive reading not only opened up moments of transfer in
                     class, but also allowed them to apply recursivity outside the classroom. The
                     following example is written by a senior science major. This course was her
                     first literature class in college and she reflects: 
                     <div class="example">

                            view of a single piece. As previously mentioned, the process of writing
                            the annotations encouraged me to fully grasp and realize what each
                            methodology meant, instead of learning them superficially for our exam.

                     understanding of Keats’ famous poem grew exponentially over the course, but she
                     also recognized the applications of lenses and perspectives outside in areas
                     outside the classroom. Echoed in another reflection piece, this newly-declared

                     return to the text in a new way. Students moved freely from one critical method

                     or mentally narrating their own lives. Their responses over the course of the
                     semester suggest that by using annotation to encourage recursive reading, our
                     classes might be offering theoretical lenses to think about these other texts

                           possibility we have the opportunity to labor for freedom, to demand of
                           ourselves and our comrades, an openness of mind and heart that allows us
                           to face reality even as we collectively imagine ways to move beyond
                           boundaries, to transgress. This is education as the practice of
                           freedom.

                     </blockquote> Encouraging transfer, we think, encourages movement with “an openness of mind.” We are deeply
                     committed to the model of liberal arts education that works hard to encourage
                     critical thinking in all situations, in all the various texts that circulate in
                     our world. Teaching students the skill of recursive reading using digital tools
                     may be a small step, but it is one more along the road to move “beyond boundaries.”

                     annotation software, but puts it to a different kind of use insofar as it
                     allows for students to encounter a volume of poetry annotated with hypertext
                     background, images, and citations. The module’s flexibility lies
                     particularly in its ability to be utilized in multiple ways: for instance,
                     as a process-oriented and ongoing project (this essay), or a footnote-style
                     augmentation of a text (<cite class="title italic">Sight and Song</cite>).

                     from that body of literature in that we are less interested in the social
                     aspect of annotation. While filled with the potential to allow students to
                     teach other students, we turned our attention to fostering critical thinking
                     on an individual level. Students in our classes could see other annotations,
                     but they were only responsible for their own poem. Secondly, our focus was
                     less on reading comprehension, though we see the foundational necessity for
                     their skill, and instead on higher-order metacognitive skills that allowed
                     students to see dissonance and multivalency in a single text.</span></div>
