            <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
            <p>The contemporary digital media ecology is one of convergence and hybridity. As
               virtual and technical interfaces intersect in increasingly complex formulations, the
               ability to identify organic vs. technical forms has become problematic. Virtual
               environments predominate within <q>everyday</q> cultural practice arguably limiting
                  <q>real</q> or unmediated human experience. The advent of social media artifacts
               and networks in particular — those that create fusions of personal experience and
               communal activity and that support and broadcast user-generated content as a
               foundation for media productions of real-life — have made organic bodies and personal
               experience difficult to discern. </p>
            <p>Extending Mark B.N. Hansen’s model for identifying embodied experience within
               contemporary <soCalled>mixed reality</soCalled> culture, I argue
               that embodied expression is more, not less, present in the contemporary media age.
               Organic expressions, those that emanate from primal, tactile, and motile forces and
               that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at the core of many social media
               artifacts circulated within the networks of contemporary culture and operating
               outside the aesthetics of traditional semiotic representation. Recovering the organic
               body and foregrounding its presence in such media asserts the functional
               non-aesthetic principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in those
               dependant on documenting the minutiae of real-life under-represented in mainstream
               and traditional media. As personal and public spaces collide, situating the <q>me</q>
               or the embodied subject within production is problematic. I identify such embodiment
               within contemporary social media, particularly on YouTube, to illustrate that the
               human body does not operate from a position of <q>erasure</q> within social media
               networks and artifacts, and its expressive value is therefore central in much current
               user-generated me-dia. </p>

         <p>In this age of heightened media and genre convergence, the depths and surfaces for
            considering the relationship between virtual and physical forms of embodiment require a
            nuanced perspective. The shift in media production and broadcast practices from
            predominantly mainstream outlets with mass audiences who consume
            professionally-developed content sourced from specialized technicians and technical
            apparatus has been radically altered. The introduction of Web 2.0 principles and
            practices and the development of social media networks in the late 1990s and early 21st
            century marked a definitive shift in the elemental foundations of digital media culture.
            User-generated content now circulates via internet technologies in dynamic
            micro-networks of equivocal exchange, bypassing industrial media methods and outlets for
            production, distribution, and exchange, while fusing producer and consumer into what
            Axel Bruns terms hybrid <term>produsers</term>
            <ptr target="#bruns2008" loc="2"/>. As the product and the producer converge, the
            (in)ability to clearly discern one from the other has extended theoretical
            considerations about real and virtual designations within internet-based technological
            and media innovations. In the decade before, in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s,
            web-based media, along with digital art and hypermedia forms and applications, underwent
            fast-paced revision and innovative reconstruction. The methods of inscription and the
            expressive and creative capabilities for computer-mediated production reconfigured not
            only the technologies, but the complex cultural networks that supported them. As
            distribution practices enabled rhizomatic content structures (and infrastructures) and
            as convergent media forms proliferated, the bodies (text-bodies, author/user-bodies,
            machine-bodies, for example) engaged by these innovative transformations became
            increasingly complex. </p>
         <p>Currently, digital media <term>remix</term> culture is one where <soCalled>real
               life</soCalled> (RL) and <soCalled>virtual life</soCalled> (VL) structures have
            migrated more fully from the desktop to otherly-mediated life worlds, and they occupy
            all states in-between. The space one occupies, for example, in the
               <term>twitterverse</term>, the term in common usage to describe the network engaged
            by the micro-blogging application Twitter, exemplifies such ambiguity and malleability.
            The term twitter<emph>verse</emph> itself underscores the conceptual pseudo-spatial
            dimensions it occupies. It evokes the materiality of planetary outer-<emph>space</emph>,
            as well as the universal expansiveness of the celestial bodies that orbit within the
            social media networks they engage, in infinite and intricate patterns, only partially
            discernible to the theoretician’s naked eye. One’s own <term>tweets</term> (messages)
            are able to migrate from hand-held to desktop displays, confusing or eliding the site of
            real vs. virtual production. I can tweet my location, thereby affirming <emph>my</emph>
            presence in both real and virtual spaces, but also as part of a collective: <q>I (/We) am (/are) (t)here.</q> Twitter
            content too is labile and may comprise numerous forms, modes of inscription, and states
            of being. The twitter user serves multiple functions, as: diarist; locative
            documentarian; disseminator of others’ content (via re-tweets); photographer or
            videographer; corporate mouthpiece, or pawn, circulating or advertising other media; or
            merely as a gateway or conduit to other equally distributed networks — to Facebook,
            YouTube, Flickr. Self-fashioning in social media is as fluid as the networks through
            which data circulates, and the possibilities for dis-<emph>playing</emph> one’s self,
            for performing one’s experiences, move far beyond the virtual identity crises and
            cyber-theatrics once reflected in the work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda Laurel and others to
            account for life on the screen-stage enabled by computer media. For Lawrence Lessig, the
               <quote rend="inline" source="#lessig2004">hybrid economies</quote> supported by the
            new social media networks are driven by their association with a slippery dialectic
            structure and ever-shifting oscillation between personal and private spaces, grassroots
            and corporate interests, and global vs. local community interests <ptr
               target="#lessig2004"/>. Experiences are circulated through a variety of alternate,
            other, and liminal states of in-between-ness, and shifting allegiance. Uncovering the
            embodied source(s) of such highly convergent mediations and experiences necessitates new
            theoretical perspectives to account for organic vs. technical structures and for RL vs.
            VL constructions in an age where social networking practices intersect with personal
            expressiveness.</p>
         <p>To enable creative and critical expression and critique, and to address the texts and
            bodies supported by current emergent digital media forms, I propose the human body and
            its relation to technical mediation is a core site for investigation. An understanding
            of the human body, both as a stimulant for expressing organic forms of agency and
            production as well as a primal site from which to establish the dynamic dimensions of
            new technical interfaces, particularly the complex ones supported within socially
            networked media, is critical for future digital media studies. Embodiment as a state of
            organic (non-technical) and sensory being-ness — one that foregrounds its physicality
            and its tactility and serves as a necessary force for technical rendering, or
            representative mediation — cannot exist as a discursive abstract in contemporary media
            theory. Its conceptual position as a referent within representation (within traditional
            discourse), and therefore outside of the expressive, anti-aesthetic (social-)media
            politics informing emergent contemporary media forms, is not adequate to account for the
            primacy of the physical body. This organic reference point situates and contextualizes
            much of social media and its networks of exchange. Embodied expression, that is, organic
            communication that originates prior to pure external mediation, particularly prior to
            mediation through visual means, offers a provocative site from which to investigate the
            networks of social media. However, recognizing the embodied or internal experiences of
            social media is particularly challenging. Most social media and networks, on the
            surface, seem hyper-invested in creating overt visual displays or public performances,
            mediatized externalization as a means of communicating private, personal experience. One
            may consider, for example, the overt/covert use of visuality and internalization on
            YouTube. This online user-generated video platform supports predominantly visual media
            as a cover for circulating private experience. All manner of personal expression is
            rendered into video clip micro-documentaries and shared with a community of users, who
            may further circulate, comment, and edit it. Its communicative media power lies in the
            connective tissue built in the personal network of exchange that stem from
               <term>produsing</term> private internal expression, not in the externalized
            aesthetics of the videos (which are often low budget and low quality). In other such
            social networks (Facebook, Daily Booth), personal and public spaces converge, rendering
            the <q>me,</q> or the embodied (interiorized, organic)
            subject within media production, subverted. In this analysis, I track a historical
            context for considering the relationship between organic bodies and digital intervention
            and illustrate ways in which the human body currently operates as an expressive referent
            within social media networks. Drawing particularly on examples from YouTube, a social
            media network overtly dependant on visual content, I demonstrate that internal
            expression and pre-subject, pre-aesthetic organic value, is central in much current
            user-generated <hi rend="underlined">me</hi>-dia. The pre-aesthetic impulse is one that
            I identify as a primal desire towards creative production and display. Deeply connected
            to one’s sense of embodied being-ness and need to express, it is, nevertheless, outside
            a model of aesthetic production bound to traditional representative models for artistic
            creation — to photography, painting, cinema, theatre, and literature, for example.
            Social <hi rend="underlined">me</hi>-dia, I argue, operate and circulate with a deep
            connectedness to experience-production. That is after all its trademark, a proliferation
            of personal artifacts, radically increasing with each new iterative media type, or
            spontaneous desire to self-promote or to share. And yet its connection to the subject
            and site of production, the <q>me,</q> is one which
            depends on a configuration of the material body where organic (vs. technical) material
            is a primary element of creation. The body of social <hi rend="underlined">me</hi>-dia,
            as such, is not overwritten by the technical apparatus that seemingly mediates it. Mark
            B.N. Hansen, particularly in his work <title rend="italic">Bodies in Code: Interfaces
               with Digital Media</title>, offers the most radical, yet direct course to discover
            (recover) organic bodies and to resist such external and technically dominant models.
            Furthermore, he offers an intriguing perspective from which to explore the inherent
            organicism in contemporary social media practice and forms, particularly those that
            appear overtly ocularcentric, or visually-dependent and which are tied to aesthetic
            expression. </p>
         <p>As we move into the embodied spaces of social media, where the call to <q>Broadcast Yourself</q> is fully embraced by
            a next wave of user-generating content-subjects, one may ask, what is the content of
            such subjects, and how do they <emph>matter</emph> in the new media ecologies that
            spa(w)n them? New hybrid virtual and physical inscription spaces, social media spaces, I
            argue, have become more than surfaces for writing reality and are now complex mediated
            life worlds where inscription is no longer a metaphoric practice but an act of
            (pre-)self/real-world environmental coupling, inadequate to be viewed from the
            perspective of discursive representation. Hansen’s models for recognizing the
            relationships between real and virtual bodies and worlds, and for revealing the
            underlying tactile and motile forces that resist abstract formulation, offer a
            provocative in-road to these new hybrid <emph>spaces</emph> of production. Furthermore,
            Hansen’s insistence on promoting the primacy of the body as an agent in technical
            ordering, on revealing <quote rend="inline" source="#hansen2006">the constitutive or
               ontological role of the body in giving birth to the world</quote> enables a critical
            perspective that foregrounds the functionalist perspective of much social media <ptr
               target="#hansen2006" loc="5"/>. As forms of functional documentation, as opposed to
            representational media practice, many social media artifacts resist the drives of
            traditional media that operate with clear aesthetic goals and values and with a
            conscious intent to produce formal and professional media objects.</p>
         <p>As contemporary texts and representational contexts have become increasingly complex,
            semiotic surfaces and the inscription spaces which <q>contain</q> them have challenged theorists and media practitioners to identify,
            access, and engage the full spectrum of material surfaces which proliferate.
            Historically, embodiment and the varied forms of its discontents have been a profound
            focal point for critical reflection within digital media studies. This is particularly
            true within the late 1980’s to mid 1990’s wave of hypertext and then cyberstudies
            theorists. Arguably it is, in fact, <emph>the</emph> center-point for such critique.
            Responding to the <q>new</q> paradigms afforded by technology-assisted writing practices
            — Storyspace texts and environments, for example, followed closely by the creation of
            Internet-based cyberspace production — the webbed and malleable properties of hypertext,
            intrigued and stimulated a rich and fundamental first-wave of material-based critical
            reflection exploring new frontiers. Shelley Jackson’s <title rend="italic">Patchwork
               Girl</title> (1995), a re-telling of Mary Shelley’s <title rend="italic"
               >Frankenstein</title> through the foregrounding of the female monster and her
            monstrous body, is an early and overt example of how the metaphorical material of text
            and body may be interlinked through digital media. The creative potential of fragmented
            text-bodies and the ironic potentialities of the stitched-together body-text (the
            hyperlinked text) revealed the power of the scar, the space between body parts, to
            express deeply embodied creativity through otherness and other voices. And yet this
            embodiment was driven by a politics of difference, or deformation from the norm to probe
            and critique normative value. Liberation was attained through an acceptance of self as
            other, organicism as abject power, text as broken (until re-worked).</p>
         <p>The shift from page to screen within digital media has been well-documented: Bolter,
            Lanham and Landow, for example, explored in depth the liberating and fluid properties of
            hyper-linked electronic texts, defined by the immaterial semantics and semiotics of
            digital inscription texts and technology. Shifts in authorial agency, the material
            reconstruction of reading-practice, and the revolutionary ideological identity
            reconstructions, unrestricted by organic genealogy-parables and enabled by the new
            digital and cyberspaces were and are foundational critical perspectives for considering
            (dis)embodiment. In <title rend="italic">Writing Space: The Computer, Hypertext, and the

            field for electronic writing in relation to the increasing influence of the Internet. He

            </cit>. For Bolter debates about the unity (or not) of the Cartesian ego in the digital
            age and continuing reflections on mind-body paradigms struggle to situate media
            production. The impulse to explore singular vs. multiple authorship signals a revolution
            in material culture imagined through the communal matrix of network culture. Bolter
            acknowledges an irony in the claim that digitally produced texts inspire theorists to
            associate virtual production with materiality: <cit>

         <p>Critical challenges to the innovative claims that rhizomes, lexia, and looping
            structures formed the definitive (im)material of new media were inevitable, and
            counter-debates quickly developed. Espen Aarseth’s ergodic taxonomies, outlined in
            detail within <title rend="italic">Cybertext</title>, for example, argue for historical
            links to digital innovation — to the codex model, for example — that defy
            multi-directional paths as unique to digital models. As multimodal texts progressed in
            their material innovation through the end of the millennium, they moved beyond linking
            functions to more complex formal constructions and network structures; they comprised
            recombinatory database structures working in tandem with hypertexts, for example, and
            the ability to identify <emph>organic agency</emph> from, or within, <emph>technical
               functioning</emph> was further challenged. The process of reading itself as a
            critical practice, disrupted and revealed by digital interventions, became central to
            the rhetorics of a developing new media <q>poetics,</q> and in works such as Brian Kim Stefans’ <title rend="quotes">the

               >Vniverse</title> (2002), Ana Maria Uribe’s <title rend="italic">Anipoems</title>
            (2003), language, its transformation in the reading-mind, and the spaces occupied by the
            digital reader-writer are all explored. Audio, image, text, and video components
            converged to form richly material surfaces and genre conventions also merged: cinematic
            models for Quicktime movies embedded on web pages and graphic design principles utilized
            within literary and linguistic conventions freely comingled, and such miscegenation
            proffered hybrid artifacts. Media production via futurist mutant manifesto reigned.
            Ludology gamed the narrative system, and stories became playable, programmable, and
            code-worthy; users and interactors <emph>participated</emph> in media, and reading
            became an applied critical practice, an integrated part of discursive representation.
            Jim Andrews in his poem-game <title rend="italic">Arteroids 2.5</title> (2003) deftly
            mixes metaphors, genres, and media as well as visual, kinetic, and audio signifiers to
            display language as a representational system to be played, and to be played with. Some
            theorists, like Janet Murray in <title rend="italic">Hamlet on the Holodeck</title>
            (1997), find a comfortable allegiance between tradition and invention, between stories
            and games, and unite them with new genre titles, with <term>cyberdrama</term>, for
            example. Others, like Nick Montfort in <title rend="italic">Twisty Little Passages: An
               Approach to Interactive Fiction</title>, suggest a more complex basis for identifying
            creative co-mingling and its offspring. For Montfort, the core components of developing
            hybrid genres unite simulated <term>world models</term> that are run through a
            computerized <term>parser</term> to create interactive fictions <ptr
               target="#montfort2005" loc="viii"/>. Riddles are the base form for interaction in the
            new genre, and they lead players into a plenitude of puzzling metaphor, simulation, and
            abstraction. The riddle leads one away from internal bodily experience and into new
            digital thought-experiments, mind-games ruled by <quote rend="inline"

               target="#montfort2005" loc="60"/>. Computer code and its relationship to language,
            machine language and human discourse hybrids also came under scrutiny and were seen as
            crucial to understanding digital aesthetics and signification as linked to programming.
            John Cayley, digital poet and theorist, recognizes digital textuality as based on a
            procedural <quote rend="inline" source="#cayley2006">phenomenology of

            <ptr target="#cayley2006" loc="309"/>. In the early 21st century, theoretical
            reflections on experimental creole languages, code-talk, unnaturally shifted the figure
            and ground elements of behind-the-scenes programming and on-the-screen texts. For Rita
            Raley, this meant that programming operations lead away from organic self-realization
            toward an ontology of the technical device: <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#raley2002">Broadly, codework, makes exterior the

               <ptr target="#raley2002"/>
            </cit>. The notion of embodiment was complicated in the extra-inscribed surfaces and the
            resulting over-supplementary semiotic code-talk. The <emph>container</emph> challenged
            the <emph>contained</emph>, and an epic battle of anti-binary misproportions ensued,
            erasing organics in favor of discursive abstraction.</p>
         <p>Currently digital media has fully traveled beyond the computer screen, encroaching into
            physical spaces, and corporeal liminality continues to instantiate new rules:
            text-bodies, user-bodies, architectural-bodies, avatar-bodies, reading-bodies, and
            writing-bodies overlap, recombine, devolve, and bewilder. Clearly the media ecology of
            the digital domain has become a fertile breeding ground for new life-forms, and
            developing a measuring stick for pure organicism vs. embodied representation is an overt
            critical challenge. As such, it is embraced by an increasingly interdisciplinary set of
            theorists who approach embodiment from a wide array of perspectives. Eugene Thacker in
               <title rend="italic">Biomedia</title> is representative of a movement to recapture
            organic bodies through a theoretical melding of molecular biology’s <soCalled>wet lab</soCalled> techniques and those of computational
            bioinformatics, or <soCalled>dry lab</soCalled>
            considerations <ptr target="#thacker2004" loc="2"/>. Thacker presents a context for
            recognizing a deeply intertwined duality of virtual and physical bodies: <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#thacker2004">The biological and the digital domains are
                  no longer rendered ontologically distinct, but instead are said to inhere in each
                  other; the biological <soCalled>informs</soCalled> the digital, just as the
                  digital <soCalled>corporealizes</soCalled> the biological</quote>
               <ptr target="#thacker2004" loc="7"/>
            </cit>. Thus, although Thacker seemingly moves toward a more scientific method to
            situate <emph>real</emph> bodies, outside the aesthetics of pure representation and
            towards more scientific renderings, his approach is ultimately discursive. Biomedia
            bodies are not machine/human hybrids, or transcendental markers of erasure, and their
            mixed ontology (biological and digital) means the singular body is not expressed in the
            genetic/computer code hybrid. One does not ask, then, what a body is, but rather <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#thacker2004">what a body can do?</quote>
               <ptr target="#thacker2004" loc="6"/>
            </cit>. That is, one asks what a body becomes when viewed through its discursively
            rendered behaviors, a step removed from its essential nature.</p>
         <p>Since Hayles first identified the struggle to recover the Cartesian body lost to
               <soCalled>information</soCalled> in <title rend="italic">How We Became
               Posthuman</title>, she has also remained in an iterative critical loop focused on
            material embodiment in digital contexts. In texts such as <title rend="italic">Writing
               Machines</title>, she enacts the recursive impulse to reassert material metaphors as
            the basis for human-machine signifying practice. For Hayles, the material metaphor is
            the eternally changing red-yellow-green signal regulating the semiotic flow between
            signifiers and texts, the <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2002">traffic between
               words and physical artifacts,</quote> a <term>technotext</term> control-measure for

            its machinery — a distinctly un-organic enterprise <ptr target="#hayles2002" loc="22"/>.
            For Hayles, the <term>writing machines</term> she imagines, and the (machine-like)
            materiality they foreground as essential components of their inscription practices,
            embody meaning primarily at a level of discursive signification, or at <cit>

            </cit>. The organic body, per se, is only revealed as a component <emph>within</emph>
            systems of representation; it is <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2002">an emergent
               property</quote> and one that arrives as a result of interactions <quote
               rend="inline" source="#hayles2002">between physical properties and a work’s
               artistic strategies</quote>
            <ptr target="#hayles2002" loc="33"/>. Materiality <emph>is</emph> mobilized, and it
            clearly mediates: it literally exists in a middle ground between the world of things and
            the world of ideas, <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2002">in between the richness of a physically
                  robust world and human intelligence as it crafts this physicality to create

               <ptr target="#hayles2002" loc="33"/>
            </cit>. Materiality is, thus, coextensive with meaning, with signification, or
            representation. Abstraction, as such, is not fully evident, and liminal bodies, sites of
            ambiguous non-identification, resolve into consciously registered aesthetic
            production-machines. The machine-body of the text encodes meanings and is itself encoded
            in a semiotic assembly-line where physicality is represented through a body’s strategic
            artistic properties. However, this material formulation does not account for media
            production outside of aesthetic valuation. The <soCalled>metaphor</soCalled> itself
            implies resolution, equivalency, x = y. But what of the work-production that engages
            bodies, mobilizes expressions, exudes tactility, and yet resists the politics of pure
            aesthetic production? The metaphors at the heart of Hayles’ material reflections allow
            little room for slippage in terms of intentionality for finding physicality or pure
            organic expression within production. As the physical properties of a work, the embodied
            content and the container, can only be seen within iterative discourse loops, the
            irresolute excesses remain unaccounted for, as materiality always becomes
               <soCalled>representable</soCalled> when connected to technical mediation.</p>
         <p>Mark B. N. Hansen offers an alternate theoretical perspective from which such organic
            excesses — those excesses outside of exterior mediation practices, outside of semiotic
            visualization exercises — may be examined. His work also provides a basis for
            considering the embodied aesthetics at work within social media artifacts that do not
            always seem motivated to produce meaning, or substantive matter even, within the
            generative politics of discourse and artistic semiotics. When one considers, for
            example, what Patricia Lange calls the <quote rend="inline" source="#lange2009"
               >personal ephemera</quote> or the minutiae and small-life moments evident in many
            YouTube videos, one can recognize that traditional cinema art-house aesthetics do not
            apply <ptr target="#lange2009" loc="74"/>. Popular YouTube subjects range from the more
            familiar video-fare recognizable in home-movies and videos: birthday parties, family
            holiday gatherings, and graduation events; to a whole range of more unfamiliar
            documentations now publicly circulated: belly-fat jiggling, Lego-building, baby
            lemon-sucking, and bedroom web-cam dancing. Hansen’s reflections on embodiment within
            contemporary media forms are at an extreme end of the organic vs. technical interface
            spectrum and may allow then a method to account for these equally radical
               <emph>ephemeral</emph> media-modes that have emerged on sites such as YouTube.</p>
         <p>Hansen argues in <title rend="italic">Bodies in Code: Interfaces with Digital

            of bodies only within discourse <ptr target="#hansen2006" loc="5"/>. Mixed realities
            assert physicality and bodily motility, emphasizing not only what a body can do, but how
            it operates in physical motion, rather than in mental abstraction. (One may consider
            then those belly fat jiggle and Lego construction ephemera videos in this context, for
            example.) This model moves away, then, from a critical perspective dependant on
            deforming, disrupting, or foregrounding representative discourse by reasserting
               <emph>new</emph> digitized versions with which one may interact (as with works like
            Strickland’s <title rend="italic">Vniverse</title>, Andrews’ <title rend="italic"

            Although earlier digital works such as these consider the body as an integral mediator,
            they also ultimately mix realities only in the realm of the mind (or the intellectual
            sphere) and on the screen, and are highly dependent on knowledge of previous aesthetic
            and creative systems, of sonnet forms, novels, or games. For Hansen, <quote
               rend="inline" source="#hansen2006">embodied human agency</quote> is a perspective
            for <quote rend="inline" source="#hansen2006">perceptuomotor activity,</quote> a site
            of heightened perceptive and physicalized action, where tactility and biological
            functioning are not merely referenced within iterative discursive leaps, or mediated
            with an end-goal of intellectual understanding <ptr target="#hansen2006" loc="3"/>.
            Instead the biological body, the organic body, overshadows and overpowers critical
            attempts to place it inside signification and make it a mere surface for representation.
            As a force of tactile activity, the body shapes experience to conform to its organizing
            schema and offers phenomenological evidence that it is a <cit>

            </cit>. Specifically, it resists representative models, including creative and aesthetic
            ones, that refine meaning only in discursive models, those that come <emph>after</emph>
            the body has been <emph>overcome</emph> by the mind, or ones materializing after the
            visual sense has emerged secondarily from the body sense. (Lacanian philosophy, for
            example, depends on the primacy of the mirror stage, when the subject sees herself in
            reflection, as a key movement into language, into culture.) However, alternately one may
            view contemporary media from the site of the organic body, as a <emph>body in
               code</emph>, a neither purely informational body, nor a disembodied reflection of <cit>

            perspective on the <term>originary technicity of the human</term>
            <ptr target="#hansen2006" loc="20"/>. For Hansen, technicity — the body’s relation to
            exteriority, to something outside of itself, and its mediation of that awareness — is
            key to understanding the significance of embodiment to aesthetic production. His
            reflections on the phenomenal body (not surprisingly extended from the work of
            Merleau-Ponty) allow a critical perspective where the operational mechanisms of the body
            (vs. the representational ones) seem suited to the varied practices and emerging forms
            evident in social media arenas. The phenomenal body is connected to the body schema
            (body map) as opposed to the body image (a specular construct), and it is an active
            agent filled with sensory data and not overly dependent on organized intellectual data
            or visual cues (Hansen 2006, 38–43). I assert that such bodily and tactile motility,
            recognized as agents of embodied production, offer critical models to account for the
            deep organism-environment coupling (for Hansen, the technical mediation of the
               <term>body schema</term>) one finds in the active embodied productions of social
            media where personal-public displays of <emph>affect</emph>ion dominate. <term>The body
               of affect</term>, a state of <quote rend="inline" source="#hansen2006">one’s
               incongruity with oneself</quote> where fixed identity is overcome through singular
               <quote rend="inline" source="#hansen2006">excess</quote> serves as a rich model to
            consider the fluid networked me/not me in social <hi rend="underlined">me</hi>-dia <ptr
               target="#hansen2006" loc="168"/>. Affect, characterized by emotional and sensory
            connections felt in the body and expressed through it, with it, is a defining feature of
            social media’s mode of anti-intellectual, experience-based production.</p>
         <p>One may again consider, in this context, Twitter as an illustration of a mixed reality
            and social media <term>space</term>: This finger-tip driven micro-blogging network realm
            is a site where the humble text message, once firmly connected to cell phone technology,
            has been hyper-remediated, redistributed, and repurposed into an array of technical
            devices and forms. It operates on computers or handheld devices (the technical device is
            irrelevant), and it generates a pseudo-locative life-narrative and experiential trail of
            communiqués that comprise many functions. It is innately personal <hi rend="underlined"
               >and</hi> communal and inexorably combinatory and flexible in terms of its content,
            operating in ambiguous and otherly code-talk, in tweets, anti-discursive
               <emph>bird</emph>-sounds, for example: <q>(@ishmaelvr please don't encourage him. RT
               @limabean: @indistinky and when will the #PPOP unrated version be coming out?</q> At
            its core, Twitter is a platform for documenting and mediating one’s own interests and
            experience, as well as a site to disseminate the experiences and interests of others.
            Tweets de-personalize <emph>my body</emph>, even while announcing <emph>my
               presence</emph>, and operate via co-evolution with <emph>my followers</emph>; they
            are driven forward through recursive re-tweeting and often operate via discursive
            generalization, via <soCalled>trending topics,</soCalled> where the # sign, ironically,
            erases singular reflection and joins <emph>me</emph> to <emph>you</emph>, in an
            anti-personal account of personal and collaborative experiential location, no matter how
            trivial: <q>I am at the grocery store buying milk (and you are with me via my
               twitter-feed.)</q> Twitter’s dependence on the circulation of <emph>affect</emph>,
            rather than the production or mediation of aesthetic meaning, is in fact central to its
            operation, although it may also be a container for more direct information: to advertise
            goods and services and to announce events. As a platform for circulation, rather than a
            pure medium, it can sustain multiple operations and serve a variety of purposes, as the
            conveyor of personal information or as an advertising forum. It operates similarly to
            what Pelle Snickars and Patrick Vonderau have identified as the ambiguous power and
            economic flexibility of the YouTube platform; <cit><quote rend="inline"
               source="#snickarsandvonderau2009">The peculiarity of YouTube, then, lies in the way

            <ptr target="#snickarsandvonderau2009" loc="11"/></cit>. It is a (re)mix of realities with no
            allegiance to fixed purposing or singular identity.</p>
         <p>For Hansen’s purposes in <title rend="italic">Bodies in Code</title>, second-generation
            virtual reality artifacts, that is, mixed reality artifacts, best exemplify the ways in
            which the body is articulated. This is similar to the applications of Jay D. Bolter and
            Diane Gromala in <title rend="italic">Windows and Mirrors: Interaction Design, Digital
               Art, and the Myth of Transparency</title>. In this text, Bolter and Gromala use
            digital art within the SIGGRAPH 2000 exhibition to exemplify radical new interfaces that
            engage the user in their production practice. Hansen too finds rich source material in
            digital art and practice. Like Bolter and Gromala, he dedicates much of his theoretical
            examples to exploring the operative interfaces of digital art, but ultimately moves into
            other virtual domains (architectural space, wearable space, narrative literary space,
            and Internet cyberspace, stopping short of social media). However Hansen’s conclusions
            differ significantly from Bolter and Gromala’s. They argue that digital artifacts
            oscillate between <term>transparency</term> and <term>opacity</term> in their interface
            constructions. Digital artifacts naturalize representations and reflect and foreground
            mediated, yet personal and embodied, experiences for those who encounter them. The
            interfaces they foreground depend on deeply integrated relationships with the
            viewer-users who <emph>participate</emph> in their creative production <ptr
               target="#bolter2003" loc="3–4"/>. Like Hayles’ middle approach, embodiment is
            iterative. However, Hansen’s critical departure resists any kind of mutually dependent
            or recursive configuration and warrants further exploration and application as to the
            primacy of embodiment in social media.</p>
         <p>To facilitate a discussion of the viability of Hansen’s position in regards to social
            media practice, I provide a summary of the four primary elements which Hansen outlines
            to illustrate the function of digital technologies and <quote rend="inline"
               source="#hansen2006">the sensory commons,</quote> the <term>me/not me</term> space,
            they afford in contemporary media culture <ptr target="#hansen2006" loc="20"/>.
            According to Hansen, digital technologies: 1) expand the scope of bodily (motor)
            activity; 2) broaden the domain of the <term>prepersonal</term>; 3) create an anonymous
            medium for co-belonging (a <emph>being-with</emph>-ness); 4) transform collective
            existence from self-enclosed cognitive functioning to open forms of communal
            motor-driven, motile participation to assert the <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#hansen2006">ongoing technogenesis of the human</quote>
               <ptr target="#hansen2006" loc="20–21"/>
            </cit>. Such a state of technogenesis (of continual creation, of beginning again) is
            characterized by a body’s relation to exteriority, to that outside of or in excess to,
            its core sense of embodied being. This state of other-awareness is not dependant on
            visual recognition or overt cognitive functions to produce. Therefore artistic
            production, as such, may be recognized as an embodied impulse within which to express
            one’s own state of being-ness and to connect to the exterior world, indicating a
            relationship to communal relations, but separated from representative politics and
            objective consciousness. (<q>I do not need <emph>you</emph> to <hi rend="underlined"
                  >see</hi>
               <emph>me</emph> produce an artifact outside of <emph>my</emph> self.</q>) One may,
            then, express aesthetics, without fully extending an awareness of otherness as something
            outside one’s own primal experience. Extending these elements within social media offers
            a dynamics of expressive embodiment illustrating the ways that the body itself operates
            as a core agent of production and as a formal organizing aesthetic within the social
            medias and practices that dominate contemporary culture. Users of Facebook, for example,
            are not unfamiliar with the status update from the <soCalled>friend</soCalled> who
            overshares, or who offers <soCalled>too-much-information,</soCalled> seemingly unaware
            of the public forum on which she or he posts, or who indulges in hyper-trivial, mundane,
            or too-personal updates uncharacteristic of public declaration: <q>I bought toilet paper
               today.</q> One may also consider YouTube as an exemplary model for many other social
            media. Driven as it is by user-generated production means, it invites user-producers to
            participate in artifact making based on personal experience, but for the purpose of
            forming a collective network. The state of co-belonging supersedes individuation, as
            evidenced by tagging, commenting, reply, and rating functions, for example. Motile
            tactility is referenced in the hyperconscious referencing of self-mediation in the
               <term>prepersonal</term> domain, where pure subject-object difference is viewed under
            erasure and the <term>power of imaging</term> via technical means is a form of internal
            surveillance and an enactment of primal technics. The talking-head vlog post, now iconic
            in structure with its web-cam framing and domestic setting reference point, is a
            straw-man set-up for <emph>my</emph> experience, a generic device posing as subjective
            function. One can consider, for example, the definitive features of the well-known
            lonelygirl15 vlog posts. This series of posts made in 2006, although eventually (and
            ironically) exposed as a hoax and part of a professional film-making experiment,
            epitomize the private and confessional aesthetics of typical vloggers. Set in a bedroom,
            and focused on the emotional and impassioned outpourings of a teenage girl at war with
            her parents, they strive to defy the slick aesthetics of professional video-making
            techniques and operate at the level of hyper-privacy and social mediation. Even though
            falsely contrived, they circulated and affirmed a model for YouTube vlogging and
            pre-aesthetic rendering. They were straight-to-camera, from-my-bedroom, spontaneous
            diary-like musings, combined with a presumed social connection to an ideal someone (in
            this case to fake-vlogger Daniel, playing the love interest role). This ideal audience
            is always imagined to be somewhere out there, listening to or for <emph>me</emph>.</p>
         <p>Lonelygirl15, with the head-shot framing and the personal confessions within private
            locations, epitomizes what Lange calls <term>videos of affinity</term>. These videos
            foreground the creation of sensory impressions and spontaneous creativity using private
            and intimate communication techniques (like eating on camera) and moving, adjusting, or
            shaking the camera (to evade transparent media representation). They don’t operate
            merely to showcase the vlogger, but to bring her into contact with <cit>
               <quote rend="inline" source="#lange2009">potential others who identify and
                  interpellate themselves as intended viewers of the video</quote>
               <ptr target="#lange2009" loc="71"/>
            </cit>. This was clear in the construction of lonelygirl15, for example, with the
            inclusion of Daniel. The producers recognized that the power of lonelygirl15’s vlog
            posts were not in a representation of the vlogger alone, but in her eventual
            communication with another via the internal <soCalled>monologue</soCalled> she used to
            surveille and promote her private state of being. In this sense, <hi rend="underlined"
               >lonely</hi>girl15 was merely a front for an idealized aesthetics of affinity
            embraced by most vloggers, and she was never really lonely, as long as she was engaged
            by the social media network. The presumed interaction of vlogging is inevitable and
            displays of <emph>affect</emph> in social media networks eventually lead to bodies of
               <emph>affection</emph>. For Lange, affinity videos on YouTube operate as a form of
               <quote rend="inline" source="#lange2009">habeas corpus,</quote> bringing the body
            firmly into view to forge intimate connections with others <ptr target="#lange2009"
               loc="78"/>. This body of affinity, like Hansen’s body-in-code, shapes the experiences
            it relays and deepens the mediations between pre-subject and presumed other, without
            exteriorizing production at a pure site of representation. Disconnected from aesthetic
            function, it serves as a marker of network affiliation and organic functioning within a
            reenactment of primordial technicity: this body performs an awareness of otherness,
            without separating it from the deeply personal felt within.</p>
         <p>Offering a perspective to view organic and technical operations, many YouTube posts
            couple the pre-subject with digital technologies to display a primary or primal state of
            the body-in-code. In <title rend="italic">YouTube: Online Video and Participatory
               Culture</title>, Jean Burgess and Joshua Green reflect on the complicated structure
            of YouTube itself as an identifiable media form. They recognize the inability to reduce
            theoretical considerations of YouTube to a singular phenomenon. It currently operates
            both as a mainstream media outlet and as critique and counter-cultural model subverting
            those political and aesthetic models. Burgess and Green acknowledge it as a business,
            but also as a form of what David Weinberger has termed a <soCalled>meta-business,</soCalled> one that serves as a
            distribution platform to enhance the value of content developed elsewhere and draw
            attention to it <ptr target="#burgessandgreen2009" loc="4"/>. In this sense, it does not
            assume the pure aesthetics and production qualities of other mainstream media that
            clearly foreground their own creations, rendering them artistic for (and before) public
            consumption. Similar to the claim Lange makes that homemade, anti-aesthetic ephemera
            dominate YouTube media content, Burgess and Green suggest that <quote rend="inline"
               source="#burgessandgreen2009">vernacular creativity,</quote> that is, a wide range
            of creative practices, from scrapbooking to informal story-telling in conversational
            chat, is at work in many YouTube expressions. Amateur content-makers according to this
            model are more inclined to personal expressions <quote rend="inline"
               source="#burgessandgreen2009">outside the cultural value systems of either high
               culture or commercial creative practice</quote> and as a method to enforce social
            networking. Operating, as a body-in-code, they express an affiliation with technics,
            with a primal desire to express a relationship to exteriority and to specular rendering,
            without erasing a form of primordial tactility inherent to pure embodied and private
            states-of-being. In this site of co-belonging, one desires to be <emph>felt</emph> (that
            is, as opposed to being <emph>seen</emph>) in order to instantiate a form of communal
            ontology and sharing, one that is organic, and one that is both mine and yours. Burgess
            and Green support this position when they claim that when considering YouTube <quote
               rend="inline" source="#burgessandgreen2009">it is important not to fall into the
               trap of simply assuming that vernacular video is organized primarily around a desire
               to broadcast the self</quote>; instead it operates to promote <quote rend="inline"
               source="#burgessandgreen2009">social networking</quote> over modes of traditional
            cultural production <ptr target="#burgessandgreen2009" loc="25–26"/>.</p>
         <p>Another popular YouTube genre is that of the homemade dance remix video. In fact, such
            videos characterize some of the earliest YouTube successes, marked by the number of hits
            (views by others) and by their circulation to achieve viral status via the social
            network. Unlike the movie theater or Broadway stage, there is no one space to find these
            expressions; you can come to them, or they may find you — via email inbox, twitter feed,
            or Facebook post. Burgess and Green cite the video dance version of the Pixies song
               <title rend="italic">Hey</title> (identified as the <title rend="italic">Hey
               Clip</title> on YouTube) as one of the most popular YouTube videos to date with more
            than 21 million views as of March 2008 <ptr target="#burgessandgreen2009" loc="26"/>.
            Dance videos like the <title rend="italic">Hey Clip</title> are generally edited remakes
            of mainstream music, usually in a domestic setting, like a bedroom or living room. They
            illustrate the strong drive to foreground embodied experience and transmit communication
            codes outside of traditional signifying systems, and most often outside a professional
            aesthetics. The amateur nature of the videos, which often appear spontaneous and
            unrehearsed, or rehearsed to a degree, but never to expert level, is a key component of
            this genre. In the dance remixes, the dancing subjects seem to be enacting a private
            (and somewhat universal) experience of embodied musical pleasure and fantasy
            reenactment: <q>I want to express how the music makes me feel and materializes in my
               body-moves</q>
            <emph>and</emph>
            <q>I want to learn to dance like Shakira and embody her presence in me.</q> Although
            prior to social media outlets, these dances may have happened in private, now they
            operate at another level of private and conjoined expression. Peters and Seier in <title
               rend="quotes">Home Dance: Mediacy and Aesthetics of the Self on YouTube</title>
            acknowledge the mixed messages of YouTube dance videos that proffer a <quote

               and forgetting, discipline and pleasure.</quote> Here the bedroom mirror is replaced

            </cit>. This site, like the mixed reality sensory commons that envelops Hansen’s

            remixed thousands of times on YouTube and performed by everyone from babies to
            grandfathers, dancing with wild abandon and with varying degrees of allegiance to the
            actual choreography. The original video, with its minimal sets, engaging choreographed
            moves, and impossible to forget tune, was itself seemingly created with an eye toward
            reproduction. It was made to be remade, and it represents a shift in production politics
            where the ambivalence of ownership gives way to a performance of functional expression.
            Watch me (or <q>Feel</q> me), watch (<q>feel</q>) my body watching (<q>feeling</q>)
            Beyoncé’s body, and I will watch (<q>feel</q>) you, etc….</p>
         <p>One may recognize how all of these examples defy generic identity politics and operate
            at a revolutionary level to recover organic presence from transcendental cyberculture.
            Like the homey bedroom <emph>sets</emph> glimpsed behind the webcam-framed vlogger,
            bodies slyly materialize both as the backdrop for creative and critical mediated
            self-expression and as dynamic pre-personal text-subjects asserting a pre-aesthetic
            drive to mediate outside traditional spaces of representation. These contemporary forms
            resist the disembodied abstraction promised by early-generation cyber-theorists and
            traditional poststructuralist perspectives. They assert a primordial drive to overcome
            ocularcentric dynamics, that threaten to subvert the phenomenal body to the visually
            constructed one. They clearly put expressive bodies before external signification and
            challenge new <hi rend="underlined">me</hi>-dia politics grounded in the production
            aesthetics of tactile motility and <emph>amateur</emph> organics.</p>
