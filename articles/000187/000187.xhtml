                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  <p>While research coordinator at the Burney Centre at McGill University in Montreal,
                    I pioneered new digital paleographical methods to support the editorial work on
                    Frances Burney and Samuel Richardson undertaken there. Prior to my
                    interventions, the primary method for reading faint, obscured, and obliterated
                    manuscript texts had been multi-spectral imaging, which is prohibitively
                    expensive, limiting its utility as a general research tool, although it is still
                    sometimes in use. There have not been many alternative digital paleographical
                    methodologies. The potential of image manipulation software, such as Adobe
                    Photoshop, has been noted by a few scholars, but not explored. Working in Adobe
                    Photoshop, I have developed a method of deciphering heavily deleted or
                    obliterated text through the use of layering techniques, altered color levels,
                    and the employment of certain kinds of filters. The method is more advanced than
                    simple image enlargement techniques used by most researchers. Importantly
                    though, it remains far less expensive than multi-spectral imaging. The technique
                    contributed to the recovery of nearly all of the obliterated text in the first
                    two volumes of <cite class="title italic">The Court Journals and Letters of Frances
                        Burney</cite>, which were published by Oxford University Press in 2011, and
                    it was also used within in-progress volumes from <cite class="title italic">The
                        Cambridge Edition of the Works of Samuel Richardson</cite>. This article
                    discusses the methodology and some of its key results from eighteenth-century
                    manuscripts.</p>

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Up to this point, the primary method for reading faint, obscured, and obliterated
                manuscript texts has been multi-spectral imaging, first described in A. H. Smith’s
                    "The Photography of Manuscripts" (1938). For the past
                75 years, multi-spectral imaging has served as the predominant methodology for
                deciphering hard-to-read manuscripts; its continuing usefulness as a paleographical
                tool has been the subject of recent studies [<a class="ref" href="#chabries2003">Chabries, Booras, and Bearman 2003</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#goltz2007">Goltz et al. 2007</a>]. The Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science at the
                Rochester Institute of Technology contains a division devoted to cultural artifact
                and document imaging; their projects have required multi-spectral technology to
                recover material from the Archimedes Palimpsest and other historical texts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e179">[1]</a>
                Yet the instruments required for multi-spectral imaging – multi-spectral cameras,
                color filters, and digital storage for super high-resolution images – are
                prohibitively expensive,<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e185">[2]</a> which limit its utility as a general research
                tool. There have not been many alternative digital paleographical methodologies.
                Carl W. Griffin’s survey of the field, "Digital Imaging: Looking
                    Toward the Future of Manuscript Research" (2006), gestures towards the
                usefulness of image manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop, but does not
                describe any particular methods.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e194">[3]</a> There are a few current projects, predominantly in the field of
                medieval research, that have yielded results. Cultural Heritage Imaging (CHI), a
                nonprofit corporation, has developed and distributed digital imaging and
                preservation solutions, most of which relate to its innovative computational
                photographic method called "Reflectance Transformation
                    Imaging." This method captures the shape and color of a subject, allowing
                the user to adjust lighting directionality to reveal surface information. Through
                this technique, CHI has successfully recovered previously unreadable sections of
                illuminated manuscripts by adjusting levels and using multiple images to piece
                together partial or damaged material with a program called GIMP (GNU Image
                Manipulation Program).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e202">[4]</a> Peter Ainsworth and
                Michael Meredith have also developed an electronic tool called "Virtual Vellum" that enables users to view, transcribe, and manipulate
                electronic versions of manuscripts [<a class="ref" href="#ainsworth2009">Ainsworth and Meredith 2009</a>]. Beyond its
                pedagogical and expository applications, the aim of "Virtual
                    Vellum" is to grant open access to these manuscripts to researchers who
                would not otherwise be able to view them. The digital methodologies I have developed
                serve similar functions to CHI’s "Reflectance Transformation
                    Imaging" and "Virtual Vellum," though mine
                have particular applications for the recovery of deleted and hard-to-read text.</div>

               </div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Ultraviolet lighting is also a viable and cost-effective option for recovering
                deleted text. New 35mm cameras cost at least $150, while UV camera filters can be
                found for around $10. This is comparable in cost to Adobe Photoshop: an educational
                subscription to Adobe’s Creative Cloud (which contains Photoshop) will run slightly
                less than $200. However, many universities offer the software for free on
                specialized library computers, and users can attain most of the functionality of
                Photoshop through the open-source GNU Image Manipulation Program. There are a couple
                of drawbacks to ultraviolet lighting: 1) Some archive-rich libraries, such as the
                New York Public Library and the British Library, neither allow users to take
                pictures with their own cameras (and a UV filter) nor are willing to supply these
                services themselves (though ordinary scanned images are available). 2) Ultraviolet
                light is not always the better solution. The following picture sequence (Figures
                1-3) compares the results of ultraviolet light with my methodologies. <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a> displays the original obliterated image, which
                is a passage from Frances Burney’s French journal held at the McGill University Rare

                  </div> My current research methodologies and approaches stem from my five years
                serving as a research assistant and later as the research coordinator of the Burney
                Centre at McGill University in Montreal. The Burney Centre contains the world’s
                largest holdings of material relating to the family of the major eighteenth-century
                novelist and diarist Frances Burney, which unites microfilm, photocopies, and
                scans of the major Burney collections at the Berg Collection in the New York Public
                Library, the British Library in London, and the Beinecke Library at Yale University,
                as well as important smaller and private holdings. The main goal of the Burney
                Centre is to prepare modern, complete, and unabridged scholarly editions of the
                journals and letters of Frances Burney and her father Charles Burney, author of the
                first history of music. More recently, the Centre has expanded its focus beyond the
                Burney family to include editions of other major eighteenth-century novelists. The
                Centre is a key site for the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Samuel Richardson
                project, with twenty-five projected volumes. Editions of Jane Austen’s juvenilia and
                manuscript writings with Cambridge University Press and Broadview Press (Canada)
                have also recently appeared through the Centre.</div>
               <div class="counter">
                  <a href="#p3">3</a>
               </div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">While at the Burney Centre, I developed a method that combines layering techniques,
                color levels, and filters and has proved highly effective for my research work on
                    <cite class="title italic">The Court Journals and Letters of Frances Burney</cite>
                (Oxford University Press), <cite class="title italic">The Additional Journals and Letters
                    of Frances Burney</cite> (Oxford University Press), and the Cambridge Edition
                of the Works of Samuel Richardson. The method is more advanced than simple image
                enlargement techniques used by most researchers. Importantly though, it remains far
                less expensive than multi-spectral imaging. First, it requires changing the color
                levels of a high-resolution photograph or scan in order to emphasize the contrast
                between obliteration marks and original text. The next steps involve adding new
                layers and carefully removing obliteration marks until the original text becomes
                visible by using a paint brush tool that is set to the background color. This method
                can also be used in conjunction with various filters that may sharpen or clarify
                some aspects of the image. I’ve illustrated the method in a corresponding series of
                images [<a href="#figure04">Figures 4-16</a>], which demonstrate the
                step-by-step process of recovering a word. Not all of the steps are obligatory, but
                the results are often improved after adjusting the Brightness/Contrast or Levels in
                the image [<a href="#figure05">Figures 5-6</a>] and using and often
                customizing the Sharpen filter [<a href="#figure07">Figures 7-9]</a>. Next, it
                is important to add a layer [<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>] to separate
                the researcher’s work from the original image, which allows for easy recovery of the
                original if a mistake is made during the process. The following steps are largely
                iterative, which involve using the paint tool to remove obliteration marks that are
                not definitively part of the original text [<a href="#figure11">Figures
                    11-15</a>]. Finally, the Brightness/Contrast or Levels can be adjusted once
                again [<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>] to make the recovery work blend into
                the original background.</div>

                    <cite class="title italic">The Court Journals and Letters of Frances Burney</cite>
                (2011). This volume, which spans July-December 1786, depicts the beginning of
                Frances Burney’s tenure as Keeper of the Robes at the court of Queen Charlotte.
                Burney frequently crossed out passages in her journals, especially those that she
                later deemed were too private for potential public consumption. The top image in
                    <a href="#figure17">Figure 17</a> is a typical obliterated passage from
                Burney’s court years; the bottom image contains the same passage, but it has been
                modified using my digital paleography methodologies. In the altered image, we can
                detect the opening words "The mourning." The next word "will" is more
                difficult, though the two l’s at the end make it possible to read. "3 weeks" is
                clear as is "I believe." The beginning of the second line is the most obscured:
                I determined that the first mark was a false start and read this as "we were."
                "already at Kew" is fairly legible, and so is the final part, "before the
                    Princess Amelia died," except perhaps for the last letters of "before,"
                though these can be safely guessed. When put together, the text reads, "The
                    mourning will be but 3 weeks, I believe. We were already at Kew before the
                    Princess Amelia died." It is a significant passage, which reveals Burney’s
                response to the death of Princess Amelia, the second daughter of George II, on 31
                October 1786 [<a class="ref" href="#sabor2011">Sabor 2011</a>, 250]. <div id="figure17" class="figure">

                  </div>This is only one of several important recovered passages from Burney’s
                court journals. Some of the deleted material recovered using this technique
                confirmed Burney’s long-lasting depression from fall 1786, a medical condition
                suspected by her biographers, but never before confirmed in her correspondence.</div>

               </div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">This methodology has also been useful when applied to Burney’s novel manuscripts.
                There are surviving early manuscript drafts and later versions, including a proof
                copy, an interleaved copy, and some significant post-publication revisions, for her
                four novels, <cite class="title italic">Evelina</cite> (1778), <cite class="title italic">Cecilia</cite> (1782), <cite class="title italic">Camilla</cite> (1796), and <cite class="title italic">The Wanderer</cite> (1814). Eighteenth-century scholars have
                rarely been able to analyze fictional manuscripts because few novel manuscripts from
                the eighteenth-century survive as Burney’s do: it was common practice for printing
                houses to divide and destroy manuscripts during the publishing process. Extant
                manuscripts sometimes contain important authorial or editorial additions, pasted or
                sewn onto manuscript pages. This methodology can contribute to our understanding of
                Burney’s creative process of composition. In the early draft fragments that survive
                from her third novel <cite class="title italic">Camilla</cite>, Burney changes the names
                of some of the characters. Burney’s most fascinating alteration can be seen in <a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>, where "Mr. Solmes" is discovered to be
                a gender-bending replacement for "Mrs. Arlbery."
                "Mr. Solmes" is undoubtedly a reference to the eponymous heroine’s distasteful
                and unyielding suitor in Samuel Richardson’s <cite class="title italic">Clarissa</cite>
                (1747-8). Initially, this name change seems like a bizarre selection for the "Mrs.
                    Arlbery" figure, who is playful, sarcastic, and largely good intentioned. Yet
                the early version of Mrs. Arlbery tries to force Camilla into a mercenary marriage
                to a nobleman so that she can pay off her debts. She even tries to prevent Camilla
                from seeing her father in the last minutes before the marriage is solemnized. The
                name change to "Mr. Solmes," then, is an apt choice for an advocate of a
                pressured, mercenary marriage. It reveals the significance of <cite class="title italic">Clarissa</cite> as an intertext for <cite class="title italic">Camilla</cite>, even
                though the storyline that contained Camilla’s failed aristocratic marriage was
                ultimately deleted from the novel. We can also see that Burney’s name and gender
                change of Mrs. Arlbery was half-hearted at best, since all of the pronouns linked to
                her character in the draft were left feminine.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p8">These digital methodologies, however, are not always successful. The primary limiting
                factors are 1) poor image quality and 2) extremely heavy deletions and manuscript
                deterioration. Unfortunately, researchers can rarely control either of these
                factors. It is usually impossible to reconstruct text where there are holes, gaps,
                and tears in the manuscript. Extremely heavy obliterations – where it is even
                difficult to determine the existence of letters with ascenders ("b,"
                "d,"
                "h,"
                "k,"
                "l," and "t"), descenders ("g,"
                "j,"
                "p,"
                "q," and "y"), or both ascenders and descenders ("f" and long
                    "s") – can only be deciphered with the help of multi-spectral imaging or
                invasive chemical processes. Image quality can also be prohibitively low; few
                librarians allow image reproduction in excess of 300 dpi [<a class="ref" href="#ainsworth2009">Ainsworth and Meredith 2009</a>, 12]. It is also nearly impossible to retrieve
                high resolution and color scans from most microfilm versions, which are often used
                in lieu of the original manuscripts [<a class="ref" href="#brown2012">Brown et al. 2012</a>]. <a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a>, which is taken from the correspondence
                between the eighteenth-century author Samuel Richardson and his admirer and friend
                Lady Dorothy Bradshaigh, illustrates the difficulties that arise with low image
                resolution and heavy deletions. The Richardson-Bradshaigh correspondence, which
                began with the latter’s anonymous homage to the former’s writings, is in general
                riddled with obliteration marks because their correspondence, which lasted from 1748
                until Richardson’s death in 1761, was prepared for public consumption, initially
                within Anna Laetitia Barbauld’s <cite class="title italic">The Correspondence of Samuel
                    Richardson</cite> (1804).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e545">[6]</a> Places and names, such Lady Bradshaigh’s identity and the
                    "low" origins of her husband’s wealth (cannel coal pits at
                their estate in Haigh, Lancashire), are constantly obscured, but these can almost
                always be safely guessed. There are other extended deletions in the text, and
                because of the thick and heavy nature of the obliteration marks, many of these
                cannot be fully or even mostly deciphered, such as the example given in <a href="#figure19">Figure 19.</a>

                  </div> Certain phrases like "generally speaking," which is located on line
                two of the obliteration, can be recovered with some careful work. Most of the
                passage, however, is undecipherable, which is also due to poor image quality. Even
                though <a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a> has a resolution of 350 dpi, the
                dimensions for each .pdf file from the Richardson correspondence, which contains two
                sheets, is 8.263 inches by 11.694 inches (33.9 MB). This is in marked contrast to
                some of the other files, such as <a href="#figure04">Figures 4-16</a>, which
                originated as .tiff files with a resolution of 300 dpi and dimensions of 18.28
                inches by 21.313 inches (100.3 MB). The Burney sheets are nearly six times larger
                than the Richardson ones – 33.9 MB for two sheets of the Richardson vs. 100.3 MB for
                one sheet of the Burney – which accounts for the large discrepancy in image quality,
                and hence decipherability, between the two.</div>

                Wortley Montagu illustrate that this project could be of great interest to
                eighteenth-century manuscript and textual scholars, as it uses digital methodologies
                to elucidate manuscripts for editing projects, thus making such projects more
                accessible than ever before. Moreover, these techniques need not be limited to
                eighteenth-century manuscripts: as long as the images are presented in
                high-resolution and as long as the obliterations are neither too thick nor too
                heavy, the techniques have potentially wide applications. They provide, above all, a
                means of interacting with manuscripts through methodologies that, instead of
                opposing, incorporate the rise of digital texts and technologies.</div>
