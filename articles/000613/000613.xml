            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>In late 11th century, a reform carried out by Wang Anshi (1021–1086) brought about
               controversies and initiated a series of political struggles between factionalized
               reformers and anti-reformers. The origin and nature of these factionalized struggles
               have been discussed for a long time among scholars. In this paper, we discuss the
               issue based on the literary and political relationships among people in the era of
               the reform. First, two matrices are respectively constructed of the literary and
               political relations among these people based on the data collected from CBDB (China
               Biographical Database). Then a Poission-Gamma factorization model is adopted to
               obtain the key factors of the matrices, and the Louvain Modularity algorithm is used
               for community detection. The results show that people engaging in similar literary
               pursuits were more likely to share political interests and people belonging to the
               same literary groups were more likely to join in the same political groups,
               suggesting. Ensuing discussions illustrate that people’s differing academic views indeed
               played a shaping role in the formation and exacerbation of factionalized struggle,
               for which the mechanism unfolded herein of “literati politics” was highly
               responsible.</p>

         <head>1 Introduction</head>
         <p>The political struggle among factions in the light of the reform in late 11th century
            China is considered as a decisive period in the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127).
            Beginning in 1069, Wang Anshi carried out the <title rend="italic">Wang Anshi bianfa
            </title>[Reform of Wang Anshi] under the support of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1067–1085), aiming
            at changing the <q><emph>jipinjiruo</emph></q> [unceasingly impoverished and
            weakened] situation of the state. The <emph>xinfa</emph> [new policies]
            initiated in the reform include a group of financial, social, and military policies that
            enormously changed the state’s political mechanism, thus resulting in severe resistance
            from the conservative officials and a long-lasting political dispute. In 1085, when
            Emperor Shenzong died, the Empress Dowager Gao (1032–1093) came into power. During her
            reign, all reform policies were abolished and most pro-reform officials were exiled.
            However, when she died and Emperor Zhezong (r. 1085–1100), a firm supporter of the
            reform, took authority, the reform policies were continued and the anti-reformers were
            persecuted, and this tug of war had its culmination in the uncontrollable political
            strife during the reign of Emperor Huizong (r. 1100–1126).</p>
         <p>Because of the controversial nature of the reform, debates on it have never stopped.
            Since the reform was a decisive political issue of that time, all contemporary officials
            had to take their sides, and many of them had a fairly radical stance. For example, one
            anti-reformer, Yang Shi (1053–1135) claimed that <quote rend="inline">the origin of the disaster today was
            because of Wang Anshi</quote> <ptr target="#tuotuo1985" loc="12741"/>, and imputed the collapse of Northern
            Song to the reform. However, many 20th century scholars argued that the reform was the
            only way to save the corrupt government and bring prosperity to the state. For instance,
            Liang Qichao held the view that Wang Anshi’s effort was a response to the need of his
            time, and a recuperation from the crisis <ptr target="#liang1993" loc="1"/>. No matter how scholars’
            views differ on the reform, its significance was undoubted, and there is a consensus
            that the political struggle following the reform was the direct cause of the fall of the
            empire.</p>
         <p>The historical and cultural context of the reform should also be addressed. The Song
            dynasty featured <soCalled>literati politics</soCalled>, a regime in which the government officials mostly
            came from the scholar-gentry who had earned academic degrees. Under this regime, the
            officials are known as scholar-officials and are both active in political and literary
            circles. According to the enduringly influential and widely accepted model <q>Tang-Song
               transition</q> by Naito Konan <ptr target="#fogel1984"/>, the Song dynasty is considered as a decisive
            period of the development of the literati politics, a period when government openings
            began to be widely occupied by scholar-officials. The Song dynasty also witnessed an
            unprecedented prosperity of <emph>Daoxue</emph> [Neo-Confucianism], in which
            scholars were affiliated to different schools of <emph>Daoxue</emph> and held
            different academic and ideological views. During the reform, these scholar-officials
            with different academic inclinations also tended to hold different views about the
            reform. The shaping power of the literati’s academic backgrounds on their stances toward
            the reform was discussed by a 20th century scholar Cheng Yangzhi, who considered that
            the dispute between the reformers and the anti-reformers was rooted in their different
            academic opinions <ptr target="#cheng1942"/>.</p>
         <p>But this view is still not widely accepted, and the debate on the origin of the
            political struggle among factions in the light of the reform is not yet settled.
            Different scholarly views chiefly rise from different interpretations of existing
            historical sources, which are themselves not sufficient enough in many cases to serve as
            concrete pieces of evidence. By introducing digital methods and observing existing
            historical data in a more comprehensive way, however, it is possible to gain more solid
            arguments for the problem.</p>
         <p>Thanks to the proliferation of digitized historical records, digital methods have been
            adopted in many studies of Sinology. Specifically, a relational database for Sinology,
            CBDB (China Biographical Database) <ptr target="#harvarduniversity2018"/> has inspired much
            research, among which the political factions in the Song dynasty (960–1279) have
            attracted a wealth of attention. For instance, Hilde De Weerdt et al. investigated the
            structure of Song dynasty faction lists on the basis of large-scale network analysis
            with the help of CBDB data <ptr target="#deweerdt2019"/>, while one of our previous studies focused
            on the relationship between scholars and politicians in the Yuanyou Era (1086–1094)
            based exclusively on the data harvested from CBDB <ptr target="#shang2018"/>. Following the
            direction opened up by previous work, this article investigates the experimental data
            from CBDB with exploratory statistical methods to revisit the debates around the origin
            of the factionalized struggle. In this sense, our research can be considered as an
            attempt from the community of digital humanities to facilitate the study of premodern
            Chinese history.</p>
         <p>Following Cheng Yangzhi, but based on a totally different methodology, we try to provide
            a supplement to understand how close the links among scholars and politicians are by
            investigating the relationships among people who are active in late 11th century when
            the reform took place. Our study tries to verify the following hypotheses: </p>
         <list type="unordered"><item>a. People who were engaged in common literary pursuits tended to share political
            interests <note>We already expected this hypothesis to be verified, as our previous work has proved
               this to hold true for scholar-officials who were active in the Yuanyou Era (1086–1094),
               a period covered by the investigation of this article, the range of which is between
               1069 and 1094 <ptr target="#shang2018"/>.</note>.</item>
         <item>b. People in common literary groups were likely to belong to the same political
            groups.</item>
         <item>c. Literati politics and political struggle in the Northern Song dynasty interrelated
            with each other.</item></list>
         <p>Here, the first two hypotheses can be directly tested with exploratory experiments.
            Verifying them with quantitative evidence would strongly suggest the existence of the
            feature of <soCalled>literati politics</soCalled>, where scholar-officials are active in both literary and
            political groups that formed around common literary pursuits and political interests.
            And since the opinion leaders in the literary world and the leaders of prominent
            philosophical schools in the Northern Song dynasty, such as Wang Anshi, Su Shi, and
            Cheng Yi, were also important politicians who carried out and resisted the reform,
            confirming the concomitance between political and literary relations would shed light on
            the origin and nature of the political struggle. In order to gain insights into it, the
            last hypothesis is discussed based on primary historical sources to demonstrate how the
            mechanism of “literati politics” actually influenced the political struggle.</p>
         <p>We use quantitative methods to explore and texture literary and political affiliations
            among people. First, two correlation matrices constructed from the data collected from
            CBDB indicate their connections in literary and in political aspects, respectively. The
            features of the matrices, having been processed by dimensionality reduction, are then
            extracted as literary pursuits and political interests. Afterwards, Louvain Modularity
            is applied for community detection. Our experiment results in some interesting points,
            which can also be confirmed with primary historical sources.</p>
         <p>We present a literature review on discussions of the origin and nature of the political
            struggle and the literati politics in part two. Our method is outlined in part three,
            including data collection, dimensionality reduction and community detection. The
            findings are shown in part four based on our results, and discussion in the context of
            the primary historical sources is given in part five. We offer a conclusion in part
            six.</p></div>

         <head>2.1 Origin and Nature of the Struggle among Political Factions in the Light of
            Reform</head>
         <p>There are four typical views towards the origin and nature of the factionalized struggle
            in the light of the reform. The dominant view in the late 20th century Chinese academic
            world is that the struggle was rooted in different class interests. Yang Rongguo is a
            representative scholar holding the view <ptr target="#yang1946"/>. He and other scholars holding this
            view frequently cite the remonstration of Wen Yanbo (1006–1097) to Emperor Shenzong,
            <quote rend="inline">Your majesty rules the nation with the scholar-officials, instead of the ordinary
               people</quote> <ptr target="#li2004" loc="5370"/></p>
         <p>The second view, chiefly held by Liang Qichao, imputes the political struggle to
            <q>emotionality</q>, and his main point is <quote rend="inline">the members of each faction weren’t necessary to
            combine with each other purposefully. However, they will raise disputes whenever an
            issue occurs. If there is one person initiating an argument, there will be hundreds of
            henchmen following him. In a word, they just acted out of emotionality</quote> <ptr target="#liang1993" loc="159"/>. Liang’s opinion had a great influence on later scholars although his attribution
            of the political struggle to “emotionality” is criticized as oversimplifying the
            problem.</p>
         <p>The third view is to attribute the problem to different regional ideas. It is proposed
            by Hu Shi in his comments on Li Gou (1009–1059), a philosopher and a countryman of Wang
            Anshi. <quote rend="inline">Both Li Gou and Wang Anshi were from Jiangxi, and Wang’s thought was an
               inheritance of Li</quote> <ptr target="#hu1921"/>. And it is developed by Qian Mu, who further argues that
            <quote rend="inline">(the criticism of the anti-reformers to Wang Anshi) was actually based on different
            views of the south and the north,</quote> and that <quote rend="inline">the southern literati are considered
            frivolous while the northern literati are thought to be esteemed, thus Sima Guang
            (1019–1086) and his followers were incompatible with Lü Huiqing and his followers</quote>
             <ptr target="#qian1936"/>. This view became very influential because of Qian Mu’s widespread work,
            <title rend="italic">Guoshi dagang </title>[A General History of China] <ptr target="#qian2013"/>.</p>
         <p>The last view, held by Cheng Yangzhi, is to ascribe the problem to different academic
            opinions. He states that <quote rend="inline">Sima Guang’s opposition to Wang Anshi’s reform was because of
            his political belief and his basic principle, the <emph>Dao</emph>, was
            different from that of Wang. Wang believed that the <emph>Dao </emph>of human
            was separated from but based on the <emph>Dao</emph> of nature. The <emph>Dao </emph>of nature tends to change, and so should that of human.
            However, Sima believed the two types of <emph>Dao </emph>cannot be separated.
               The Dao of nature doesn’t change, and neither should that of human</quote> <ptr target="#cheng1942"/>.</p>
         <p>All of the views above were proposed in the first half of the 20th century, and many
            later scholars stayed within the bounds they suggest. Luo Jiaxiang, who wrote a group of
            papers on this in the 1980s and 1990s, defines the reformers as <quote rend="inline">those who take the
            responsibility of the nation</quote> and the anti-reformers as <quote rend="inline">the political group which is
               both decadent and inert</quote> <ptr target="#luo1985"/>. From there he proposes the innovative
            interpretation that <quote rend="inline">they are both the representative of the whole class of landed
               gentry</quote> <ptr target="#luo1984"/>, rather than considering them as different social classes. Moreover,
            he notices the importance of censors, the <emph>Taijian</emph> officials, 
            claiming that they composed another significant part of the anti-reformers other than
            the <quote rend="inline">decadent and inert senior politicians</quote> <ptr target="#luo1993"/>.</p>
         <p>Recent scholars have proposed new perspectives. Li Xianchen thoroughly opposes the
            traditional view about different class interests, arguing that <quote rend="inline">The dispute between Wang
            Anshi and Sima Guang was one within the reformers. Both of them advocated reformation,
            and they were just different in specific methods of reform</quote> <ptr target="#li1986"/>. Likewise, Luo
            Xiaosheng claims that <quote rend="inline">Both<emph> Wengong</emph> (honorific title of Sima
            Guang) and <emph>Jinggong</emph> (honorific title of Wang Anshi) had an ideal
            of taking the responsibility of the nation, and they both proposed a scheme of reform
            respectively</quote> <ptr target="#luo1987"/>.</p>
         <p>Finally, most of the scholars agree that the political struggle among factions in the
            light of the reform made a profound impact on the Northern Song politics no matter what
            they think the reason was. For example, Chen Zhenyang attributes the failure of the
            reform to the struggle among factions. He states that <quote rend="inline">[the anti-reformers] were glad of
            the increment of the disadvantages of the reform and the nonfulfillment of its
            advantages furtively,</quote> and that <quote rend="inline">Wang Anshi’s reform was in trouble because of it</quote>
            <ptr target="#chen1943"/>. Besides, apart from the disputes between the anti-reformers and the
            reformers, in the Yuanyou Era, there were also debates among the anti-reformers
            themselves. The dispute between<emph> Luodang</emph> [the party of <emph>Luo</emph>] <note>A political group in the Yuanyou Era led by Cheng Yi (1033–1107).</note> and <emph>Shudang</emph> [the party of <emph>Shu</emph>] <note>A political group in the Yuanyou Era led by Su Shi (1037–1101).</note>, which was named as <quote rend="inline"><emph>Luoshu
               Dangzheng</emph></quote> [<emph>Luo</emph>-<emph>Shu</emph> faction
            struggle], was also of significant influence. Cheng Ruizhao believes the struggle’s
            influence lasted until 1155 when Qin Hui (1091–1155) dead, and even to 1224 when Emperor
            Lizong (r. 1224–1264) ascended to the throne <ptr target="#cheng1998"/>.</p></div>

         <head>2.2 Literati Politics in the Song Dynasty</head>
         <p>A distinct feature of premodern Chinese government (which became an autocratic monarchy
            governed by scholar-officials in the Ming and Qing dynasties), <q>literati politics</q>
            played a crucial role in the cultural-political life of the Song Dynasty. For example,
            in a case study on the Huizhou, in the period of 1200–1550, local literati’s spatial
            imagination resembled a mode that <quote rend="inline">every local place was a microcosm of
            ‘all-under-heaven’, and thus they practiced political ideas on their local governance</quote>
            <ptr target="#du2012" loc="440"/>. But it was in the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) when the tendency of
            the importance of literati on imperial politics mushroomed notably: these
            scholar-officials occupied most of the government openings. This feature is considered
            as a part of the <q>Tang-Song transition</q> by the academic world.</p>
         <p>The idea of the <q>Tang-Song transition</q> was brought up by Naitō Konan, who argues that
            <quote rend="inline">the fall of the Tang dynasty was the collapse of aristocratic government in China, and
               the rise of monarchial autocracy and populism</quote> <ptr target="#fogel1984"/>. According to this model,
            the Song dynasty was a period when the <quote rend="inline">local elite gentry families</quote> replaced the
            <quote rend="inline">semi-hereditary professional bureaucracy</quote> <ptr target="#luo2005" loc="107"/>.</p>
         <p>The influence of the literati on imperial politics was prevalent in the Song dynasty.
            Hilde De Weerdt finds that <emph>Daoxue</emph>, the ideology held by the
            literati, became the official ideology in the Southern Song (1127–1279) when it adapted
            itself to the convention of examination culture <ptr target="#deweerdt1998"/>. Besides, Ong’s study
            on <term>Guanxue</term>, a school of <term>Daoxue</term>, finds it
            to be a bond between <quote rend="inline">the monarch, the court, the local officials, the <emph
               >shi </emph><note>A concept raised in the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) which was later explained as
                  scholar-officials. According to <ptr target="#hucker1985"/>, <emph>shi</emph> means <q>elite,</q>
                  and is <quote rend="inline">a broad generic reference to the group dominant in government, which also was
                     the paramount group in society.</quote> The concept <q>gradually transformed</q> from <quote rend="inline">a warrior
                        caste…into a non-hereditary, ill-defined class of bureaucrats among whom litterateurs
                        were most highly esteemed</quote> (421, item 5200).</note>, and the ordinary people</quote> <ptr target="#ong2005" loc="56–57"/>. Deng and Lamouroux focus
            their attention on the importance of the literati in their study on the <emph>zuzong jiafa </emph>[ancestors’ family instruction], claiming that they
            <quote rend="inline">invoked the image of a turning point in the Family Instructions</quote> <ptr target="#deng2005" loc="80"/>.</p>
         <p>Moreover, in the Northern Song, the development of the literati politics also
            effectively carried cultural interactions among literati into the realm of politics. For
            example, Amy McNair finds that many eminent scholar-officials active in the eleventh
            century, including Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Su Shi (1037–1101)
            and many others, promoted the calligraphy style of Yan Zhenqing (709–784) because of
            ideological considerations <ptr target="#mcnair1998"/>. For another instance, Zhang’s study on the
            Inn-wall writings during the Song dynasty finds them to point at <quote rend="inline">the centrality of
            travel in the lives of the scholar-officials and the travelers’ representations of their
            experiences</quote> <ptr target="#zhang2005" loc="27"/>.</p>
         <p>The commonness and impact of the literati’s practice of writing prefaces and postscripts
            to each other is attested in the idea of <q><emph>wen yi xu chuan</emph></q>
            [writings are disseminated because of the prefaces], which is another manifestation of
            the cultural-political relationships of the literati. The literati changed the function
            and significance of the genres of prefaces and postscripts to gradually endow them with
            robust political significance, especially when they wrote prefaces or postscripts for
            political memorials <ptr target="#mei2015"/>.</p>
         <p>These phenomena also influenced the political struggle among factions. For
            scholar-officials, their academic views were intimately related to their political
            views, exerting a deep influence on the political struggle in late 11th century. Liang
            Qichao noticed their relationship. In his analysis on <emph>Xinxue </emph>[the
            new school of <emph>Daoxue</emph>] <note>A philosophical school led by Wang Anshi, thus also called <q><emph
               >Jinggong Xinxue</emph></q> [the new school of <emph>Daoxue </emph>of <emph>Jinggong</emph> (Wang Anshi)].</note>, he described it as follows: <quote rend="inline">Whatever
            useful for molding the character of oneself or exerting an influence on politics are all
            included in his academics</quote> <ptr target="#liang1993" loc="203"/>. Since Wang’s philosophical ideas were
            intimately connected with his political ideas, his criticizers opposed it as well. Qiu
            Hansheng associated the academic disputation with the theory of class conflict, arguing
            that <quote rend="inline">the opposition to <emph>Xinxue </emph>academically has the same meaning
               as the opposition to reform politically, which is class conflict</quote> <ptr target="#qiu1959"/>. The
            remarkable concomitancy between academics and politics was even thought to be the reason
            why <emph>Xinxue</emph> failed to prosper after Wang’s death by Deng
            Guangming, who assumed that <quote rend="inline">if Wang Anshi had not come into power or enacted a reform,
            his academic ideas…would certainly have been inherited by the Confucianists working on
            Confucianism principles for a long time</quote> <ptr target="#deng1994"/>.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, with <q>literati politics</q>, a regime in which scholar-officials dominated
            political life, culture and politics formed a dynamic and interactive relationship
            during the Song dynasty. In the case of the large-scale political struggles among
            factions after Wang Anshi’s reform, the interaction between literati and politicians, as
            well as the political nature of various literary activities, can throw light on the
            ensuing debates concerning their origin and nature. In the following sections, we will
            therefore start by studying the literary and the political relationships among the
            contemporaries during the reform and discuss the origin and nature of the political
            struggle.</p></div>

         <head>3 Methods</head>
         <p>A framework including four data processing steps used in our study is shown in Figure 1.
            In the first stage, data collection, a list of people active in the era of reform is
            generated from CBDB, which is a relational database developed from primary historical
            sources. Based on the list, the data about relationships among them are extracted, which
            act as original data in the next stage. In the second stage, matrix construction, the
            relationship data of literature and politics are processed and constructed into the
            literary and political matrix respectively. The matrices are operated under the third
            stage, dimensionality reduction, which mainly extracts the feature factors of the two
            matrices, and the fourth stage, community detection, where communities are detected from
            these matrices with Louvain Modularity. Both the results of the third and the fourth
            stages are visualized and compared, while in the fourth stage, relation analysis is
            adopted after comparison. Afterwards, the overall results are interpreted and discussed.
            The details of the frameworks are discussed hereinafter <note>Three parts of the framework: data collection, matrix construction, and
               dimensionality reduction adopt the basic idea of our previous work <ptr target="#shang2018"/>. However, as the two articles focus on different topics, their data are different,
               and their strategies of selecting factors to be discussed after dimensionality reduction
               are also different. Please refer to part three of that previous article for details.</note>.</p>

           <div>
         <head>3.1 Data Collection and Matrix Construction</head>
         <p>In the stage of data collection, we first generate a list of people active in the era of
            reform. Since people recorded in CBDB are arranged chronologically from various
            dynasties, we selected from the database only those who were active in the era of reform
            from the second year of Xining (1069) to the last year of Yuanyou (1094), 1064 being the
            year when Wang Anshi started the reform and 1094 the year before factional struggles
            turned into thorough political persecutions. Furthermore, the people selected must be at
            least 15 years old in 1094 since the age of 15, called <quote rend="inline"><emph>zhi xue zhi
               nian</emph></quote> [an age of aspiring to learn] in Chinese culture <ptr target="#yang1980" loc="12"/>, is
            considered the threshold of adulthood, after which one can actively participate in
            literature and politics. As a result, people born before 1080 (or at 1080) and dead
            after 1069 (or at 1069) are selected in our experiment.</p>
         <p>After generating the list, we continue to extract the relation data among the people in
            the list generated from CBDB. In order to collect the literary relations among the
            people selected, the concept of bibliographic coupling <ptr target="#kessler1963"/> in the field of
            informetrics is adopted and adapted as <quote rend="inline">two people who have active literary relation to
            a common third person</quote> in our study. Here, <quote rend="inline">active literary relation</quote> means the person
            is <q>writing</q> (prefaces and postscripts, for instance) rather than <q>being written for</q>.
            Two people writing for a common third person implies that they share a mutual favor of
            this person, suggesting a closer literary bond. However, in the case of two people being
            written for by a common third person, there isn’t necessarily any such bond, since the
            third person may do this simply out of the two other people’s great reputations.</p>
         <p>The method of extracting data about political relations is similar to that for literary
            relations, but data of direct interactions between two people, rather than their
            relations with common third person, are collected. Besides, these interactions are
            further divided into three types: explicit positive relations, implicit positive
            relations and negative relations. Explicit positive relations include <term
               >supportive political associations</term>, <term>recommendation and
               sponsorship</term> and part of <term>connections via office</term> (the
            connections that directly indicate intimacy), implicit positive relations include most
            of <term>connections via office</term> (the connections that do not directly
            indicate intimacy, such as simple colleagueship), and negative relations include <term>oppositional political associations</term>. </p>
         <p>After data collection, the data extracted are used for matrix construction. Two
            correlation matrices — a literary matrix and a political matrix — are constructed, based
            on the data of literary relations and political relations respectively. Assume that
            there are <emph>n </emph>people selected from CBDB and the literary matrix can
            be noted as <emph>L<hi rend="subscript">nn</hi></emph>. Only the relations between the <emph
               >i-th</emph> and the <emph>j-th</emph> people who write for (rather are
            written for) by a common third person are counted in the literary matrix. Whenever the
               <emph>i-th </emph>and the <emph>j-th</emph> people have a <q>active
                  literary relation</q> with a common third person, the value of<emph> l<hi rend="subscript">ji</hi></emph>
            in the correlation matrix is added by one. The diagonal of the matrix is set as zero due
            to unmeaningful relationships between the person and himself. </p>
              <p>Similarly, the political matrix is noted as <emph>P<hi rend="subscript">nn</hi></emph> and the value of
                 <emph>p<hi rend="subscript">ij</hi></emph> is formulated as follows.</p>

         <head>3.2 Dimensionality Reduction</head>
         <p>Next, both matrices are operated under dimensionality reduction, which discovers
            <quote rend="inline">compact representations of high-dimensional data</quote> by generating a set of factors
            <ptr target="#roweis2000" loc="2323"/>. Since the data in both matrices are discrete and sparse
            (containing many exact zeros), a Poisson-Gamma factorization model is suitable and is
            thus adopted for the task <note>The basic idea of the Poisson-Gamma factorization model is to place a gamma process
               prior to a Poisson process, so that a hierarchical structure that shares statistical
               strength between groups of data can be obtained. This model is proved to be
               <q>theoretically and empirically more sound</q> in analyzing data with exact zero values
               <ptr target="#brown2011"/>, as is the case of this article. Specifically, we use the
               formulae introduced by Zhou Mingyuan et al. in constructing the model <ptr target="#zhou2012"/>.</note>.</p>
         <p>After running the model, twelve factors were obtained from each matrix. Similar to
            co-citation and bibliographic coupling analysis, where key factors are explained as an
            academic interest shared by a group of scholars, the historical meaning of the factors
            can be preliminarily explained as literary pursuits and political interests
            respectively. This interpretation is based on the following considerations: when two or
            more people share literary relationships with many common people, it is likely that they
            are driven by a common literary pursuit; likewise, when two or more people frequently
            offer political aids to each other, it is highly possible that they share a certain
            political interest. Furthermore, the mathematical meaning of factors that a single point
            could have a notable value in different factors matches with the fact that a person
            could have various literary pursuits and could be connected to different political
            groups through different political interests.</p>
         <p>Therefore, the people sharing a common factor can be interpretated as engaging in a
            common literary pursuit and sharing a certain political interest respectively, despite
            the fact that the precise meaning of the key factors requires further elaboration. The
            first extracted factors explain higher variance, and therefore are chosen as the objects
            of evaluation. We first discuss the people with the highest value in each factor, and
            offer visualizations of the results afterwards. Finally, we compare the results of
            dimensionality reduction of the two matrices.</p></div>
            <div>
         <head>3.3 Community Detection</head>
         <p>The last stage is community detection, which is also based on the two matrices. As a
            process of investigating the structure in a complex network, the method can aggregate
            and integrate all relation data among the people. Therefore, rather than adopting basic
            statistical methods, which separately analyze the relationships between each pair of
            people, community detection is capable of treating the entire social network in the
            reform era as a whole and analyzing it comprehensively. In this way, the results of
            community detection and dimensionality reduction, which suggest possible relationships
            among people regarding literary pursuits and political interests, can be complementary,
            providing a more comprehensive view of relationships among the people active in the era
            of the reform.</p>
         <p>In community detection, for the purpose of eliminating the algorithmic bias caused by
            negative values, since the minimum value in the political matrix is minus four, each
            element is increased by a constant four so that all elements would be non-negative. Then
            the matrices are converted into social networks, where the weight of edge between the
               <emph>i-th</emph> and the <emph>j-th</emph> people is the value
            of <emph>l<hi rend="subscript">ji</hi></emph> and <emph>p<hi rend="subscript">ji</hi></emph> of the literary matrix and
            political matrix respectively. Next, community detection is carried out in Gephi, which
            is an open-source software for graph and network analysis <ptr target="#bastian2009"/>. We lay
            out the original network by Yifan Hu multilevel layout <ptr target="#hu2005"/>, partition it using
            Louvain Modularity <ptr target="#blondel2008"/> <note>The Louvain method is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. Due to
               its high quality, which is proved to outperform other widely used algorithms including
               CNM, PL, and WT <ptr target="#blondel2008" loc="7"/>, it is implemented in social network platforms
               such as Gephi and NeworkX. Besides, as a hierarchical algorithm, it allows a further
               dynamical process that only changes the level of detail without affecting the nature of
               modularity.</note>, and determine the number of communities
            based on the resolution value from Laplacian dynamics <ptr target="#lambiotte2005"/> <note>The Laplacian dynamics is used to measure the quality of network partition. In both
               networks, the resolution value, which determines the granularity of the communities, is
               set as 1.0, so that the stability of the networks is optimized.</note>.
            Finally, the communities detected are considered as literary and political groups
            respectively. There are four core communities detected in the literary network and seven
            in the political network.</p>
         <p>Similar to dimensionality reduction, the results of community detection are analyzed
            separately and comparatively. When comparing the results of literary groups and
            political groups, the research adopts methods of relation analysis, referring to the
            main idea of association rule learning to evaluate the similarity between them.
            Association rule learning is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases
            using measures of interestingness <ptr target="#piateskyshapiro1991"/>. In this article,
            each person is considered as a one-item set, in order to study the distribution of the
            people in different literary groups and political groups. Specifically, the research
            defines <term>frequency</term> (referencing to the concept of <term>support</term> in association rule learning) of a certain literary group
            <emph>x<hi rend="subscript">0</hi></emph> and a political group <emph>y<hi rend="subscript">0</hi></emph> as the
            ratio of the number of people who appear in both of the groups, to the total number of
            people who appear in any literary group and any political group. The formula is as
            follows:</p>

         <head>4.1 Dimensionality Reduction</head>
         <p>Twelve key factors of a matrix are produced after dimensionality reduction on the
            literary matrix. Mean squared error (MSE) is adopted to measure the difference between
            the estimator and what is estimated, the factors that are extracted from the original
            matrix. Randomness or unaccountable information in the estimator is the major cause of
            the difference, thus the value of the MSE is positively related to the error <ptr target="#lehmann1998"/>.</p>
         <p>The algorithm is run iteratively 400 times, and the MSE of dimensionality reduction of
            the literary matrix is 0.233. Since the first extracted factor is not interpretable as
            all people have the same value on it, we chose to evaluate the factors ranking from
            second to fourth. And for each factor, we picked the ten people with the highest values.
            The factor matrix is shown in Table 1.</p>

            (1059–1129). Therefore, this factor indicates a group highly related to Su Shi, the

         <p>People with the highest values in factor <emph>1</emph> are mostly
            anti-reformers, including Sima Guang, Wang Gongchen (1012–1085), Zhao Bian (1008–1084),
            Cheng Yi, Sun Yong (1019–1086), Su Shi and Fan Chunli (1031–1106). Among them, Sima
            Guang, Cheng Yi, Su Shi and Fan Chunli are listed in the <q><emph>Yuanyou
               dangji bei</emph></q> [Stele of the <emph>Yuanyou</emph> Faction Members] <note>The <q><emph>Yuanyou dangji bei</emph></q> was created in 1104, and allegedly
                  aimed at <quote rend="inline">marking the officials who harm the politics in Yuanyou Era</quote> (i.e. the
                  anti-reformers). However, it has a complex nature. Because of the monopolization of Cai
                  Jing, the prime minister who created the stele, the 309 officials listed in the stele
                  were actually far beyond merely anti-reformers. Rather, Cai Jing used the stele as a
                  tool to suppress his political opponents. Even one of the firmest reformers, Zhang Dun,
                  was listed in it because of his hostility to Cai Jing. Therefore, it shouldn’t be
                  considered as an objective tool to distinguish the anti-reformers, although it is the
                  only available historical source which stated to list the anti-reformers.</note>.
            Furthermore, Sima Guang was the leader of the anti-reformers, Cheng Yi was the leader of
               <emph>Luodang</emph>, and Su Shi was the leader of <emph
               >Shudang</emph>.</p>
         <p>People with the highest values in factor <emph>2</emph> include Emperor
            Shenzong, who was the emperor to carry out the reform, Zhang Dun (1035–1105), Lü Huiqing
            (1032–1111), Cai Jing (1047–1126) and Li Qingchen (1032–1102), who were all reformers
            and among whom Zhang Dun and Lü Huiqing were listed in the <q><emph>Wang Anshi
               qindang</emph></q> [accomplice of Wang Anshi] by Liang Tao (1034–1097) <ptr target="#bi1957" loc="2055"/>.</p>
         <p>The result of dimensionality reduction of the political matrix with factor<emph> 1</emph> and <emph>2</emph> is shown in Figure 3. It is
            divided into four sections. Sect. <emph>A</emph> and <emph>B
            </emph>represent reformers, and Sect. <emph>C</emph> and <emph
               >D</emph> represents anti-reformers. Moreover, different sects of reformers and
            anti-reformers are also separated. Relatively mild reformers, Emperor Shenzong (named Zhao Xu, who both
            supported the reform and respected the anti-reformers), and Cai Jing (he hovered between
            reformers and anti-reformers before coming to power) are in Sect. <emph
               >B</emph> while more radical reformers, Zhang Dun and Lü Huiqing are in Sect. <emph>A</emph>. Among the anti-reformers, the members of <emph
               >Shudang</emph>, who had relatively mild political views, are mostly in Sect. <emph>C</emph>, including Su Zhe, Lü Tao (1028–1104) and Kong Wenzhong
            (1038–1088) <note>The members of <emph>Shudang</emph> and <emph>Luodang</emph>
               were distinguished by Huang Zhen (1213–1281), see <ptr target="#huang2013" loc='vol. 19, item pengdang [Clique]'/>. The subject was also studied by Zhuge Yibing,
               who included Kong Wenzhong into the list of <emph>Shudang</emph>, see <ptr target="#zhuge1996"/>.</note>. And those who had more radical political views, are mostly in Sect.
               <emph>D</emph>. The transition from Sect. <emph>A </emph>to Sect.
               <emph>D </emph>corresponds with the transition of political views from
            radical reformers to radical anti-reformers.</p>

         <p>Synthesizing the results above, we find that the reformers are all mostly in Sect. <emph>C</emph> in Figure 2 and in Sect. <emph>A </emph>and <emph>B</emph> in Figure 3, while among the anti-reformers, followers of <emph>Shuxue</emph> are mostly in Sect. <emph>B </emph>in Figure 2
            and Sect. <emph>C </emph>in Figure 3, those of<emph> Luoxue</emph>
            are mostly in Sect. <emph>A</emph> in Figure 2 and Sect. <emph
               >D</emph> in Figure 3. Therefore, we can confirm our original hypothesis that those who
            were engaged in common literary pursuits usually shared political interests with each
            other.</p></div>

         <head>4.2 Community Detection</head>
         <p>The correlation matrices are operated under Gephi, and a literary network and a
            political network are generated based on the data of the matrices respectively. After
            laying out and partitioning the networks, they are divided into several communities. The
            result of community detection of literary network is shown in Figure 4, with the size of
            the nodes representing the importance of the person:</p>

                  <figDesc>Literary groups detected</figDesc>
               </figure>
               
         
         <p>There are four core communities detected in the network, each representing a group of
            literati. Other communities are dispersed in the edge of the network and consist of only
            one component, thus should be considered as unimportant. The findings are as
            follows:</p>
         <list type="unordered"><item>a. Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Sima Guang, Su Zhe, Wang Anshi and Fan Chunren (1021–1101)
            are all attributed to Group <emph>A</emph>, which can be considered a core
            literary group.</item>
         <item>b. Although the components of Group <emph>A</emph> are complicated, Su Shi
            plays an extremely important role in it. Many of his family members (his brother Su Zhe
            and son Su Guo (1072–1123)), his students (Huang Tingjian, Zhang Lei, Chen Shidao
            (1053–1102) and Li Zhi (1059–1109)), his friends (Bi Zhongyou (1047–1121), Shi Huihong
            (1071–1128) and Mi Fu (1051–1107)), and his political allies (Lü Tao and Kong Wenzhong)
            are in the group. Most people in group A are mild anti-reformers, and many of them are
            followers of <emph>Shuxue</emph>.</item>
         <item>c. Most components of Group <emph>B</emph> are firm anti-reformers, including
            Liu Anshi (1048–1125) and many followers of <emph>Luoxue</emph> (Cheng Yi,
            Cheng Hao, Yang Shi, You Zuo, Zhu Guangting, Yin Tun, Hu Anguo, Liao Gang and Luo
               Congyan).</item>
          <item>d. Most components of Group <emph>C</emph> are reformers or have sympathy for
            reform. Those people include Zhang Dun, Lü Huiqing, Peng Ruli (1041–1095), Cai Bian
            (1048–1117), who were typical reformers and were listed in <q><emph>Wang Anshi
               qindang</emph></q> by Liang Tao <ptr target="#bi1957" loc="2055"/>, and Liu Yan (1048–1102), who was neither
            reformers nor anti-reformers but was friendly to reformers. Besides, most followers of
               <emph>Xinxue</emph> are in it.</item>
       <item>e. The components of Group <emph>D</emph> are mostly senior politicians active
            during the reign of Emperor Renzong (r. 1022–1063), including Han Qi (1008–1075), Fu Bi
            (1004–1083), Wen Yanbo (1006–1097), Wang Gui (1019–1085), Zhang Fangping (1007–1091) and
            Qiang Zhi (1022–1076).</item></list>
         <p>Of course, this categorization is reductive: people cannot be categorized into merely
            one or another literary or political group. However, as found above, despite some
            exceptions (such as the leader of reformers, Wang Anshi, is in the core group <emph>A</emph>, instead of Group <emph>C</emph>), the groups detected
            by the modularity algorithm still imply analytically-durable literary and political
            relations. These findings suggest the literary group a person belongs to corresponds to
            the person’s political views. Moreover, an interesting discovery is that the position in
            Figure 4 (which represents the position of the person in literary network) correlates to
            the person’s views on reform.</p>
         <p>The modularity of the political network is similar to that of the literary network.
            Since the matrix is high-density and most of the values in the matrix are around four
            (if two people don’t have associations in politics, the value of the element
            demonstrating the strength of their relation is four owing to our normalization during
            preprocessing), the degree range of the filter is set to be “greater than four” so that
            all of the edges shown connect two people that are positively related in politics. The
            result are as follows:</p>

         <p>Figure 5 shows fifty-four people in seven core communities. In a manner similar to the
            literary network, other unimportant communities are dispersed in the edge of the network
            and consist of very few components (at most three). The constituents of the seven core
            communities all have positive political relations with at least one person in the
            network.</p>
         <p>The communities, each representing a political group, are reasonably clear. Following
            the labels shown in Figure 5, the analyses of Group <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph>, <emph>C</emph>, <emph>D</emph> and <emph>E </emph>are as follows (size of group <emph>F</emph> and <emph>G</emph> being too small to analyze):</p>
         <list type="unordered"><item>Most people in <hi rend="bold">Group <emph>A</emph></hi> are firm anti-reformers, including Sima
            Guang, Fan Chunren, Fan Chunli (1031–1106), Cheng Yi, Zhu Guangting, Liu Anshi (the
            above six people are listed in the <q><emph>Yuanyou dangji bei</emph></q>), and Liu
            Shu. Sima Guang is the most important person in the group and the two distinct members
            of <emph>Luodang </emph>are both in it.</item>
         <item>Most people in <hi rend="bold">Group <emph>B </emph></hi>are radical reformers, including Zhang
            Dun, Zeng Bu (1036–1107), Cai Jing, Cai Bian, Zhao Tingzhi (1040–1107) and Zhang
            Shangying (1043–1121), all of the above people were listed in the <q><emph

            in the group.</item>
         <item>The leading figure in <hi rend="bold">Group <emph>C</emph></hi> is Su Shi. Most of people in it
            are mild anti-reformers, including many <emph>Shudang</emph> members. It
            contains Su Shi, his students (Huang Tingjian and Chen Shidao), his political ally (Kong
            Wenzhong), and also Wang Anli (1034–1095), brother of Wang Anshi.</item>
         <item>The leading figure in <hi rend="bold">Group <emph>D</emph></hi> is Wang Anshi. It contains
            reformers (Lü Huiqing), and also Emperor Shenzong (named Zhao Xu). </item>
         <item>Most people in <hi rend="bold">Group <emph>E </emph></hi>are senior politicians and
            anti-reformers, including Han Qi, Fu Bi, Su Song (1020–1101), Qiang Zhi and Feng Jing
            (1021–1094).</item></list>
         <p>These findings demonstrate the reliability of the data in the political matrix, and the
            network accurately reflects the political situation in the era of reform. An exception
            can be found in group <emph>C</emph>, where a mild reformer, Wang Anli,
            appears in the group of mild anti-reformers. This is considered as an outlier of the
            network, which will be discussed in part 5.1.</p>
         <p>Finally, we analyze the relations between literary groups and political groups referring
            to the main idea of association rule learning. The groups considered as related are

         <p>The results of relation analysis show twelve pairs of related political and literary
            groups, and they imply a close relationship between these groups. For example, political
            group <emph>A</emph> (firm anti-reformers) is related to literary group <emph>A</emph> (core group) and <emph>B</emph> (anti-reformers), and
            political group <emph>B</emph> (radical reformers) is related to literary
            group <emph>A</emph> (core group) and <emph>C</emph> (reformers).
            Specifically, those who were followers of <emph>Luoxue</emph> are mostly in
            literary group <emph>B</emph>, and members of <emph>Luodang</emph>
            are mostly in political group <emph>A</emph>, which are strongly related
            (highest <emph>f </emph>13.73% and third-highest <emph>r</emph>
            53.85%). Similarly, those who were followers of <emph>Shuxue</emph> are mostly
            in literary group <emph>A</emph>, and members of <emph
               >Shudang</emph> are mostly in political group <emph>C</emph>, which are also
            strongly related (highest <emph>f </emph>13.73% and highest <emph
               >r</emph> 77.78%).</p>
         <p>In general, the results confirm our original hypothesis that those who shared a literary
            group were more likely to share a political group.</p></div>

         <head>5.1 Positive Interactions between Reformers and Anti-Reformers</head>
         <p>In Figure 5, there is an outlier in the political network: Wang Anli is found to appear
            in the group of mild anti-reformers. This outlier is derived from the following
            historical record:</p>
         <cit><quote rend="block">Su Shi was imprisoned in the jail of the Censorate. He was in extreme danger and no one
            dared to save him. Wang Anli said (to Emperor Shenzong) calmly, ‘since ancient times,
            magnanimous emperors do not convict others because of their sayings.…If Your Majesty
            sentenced him (Su Shi) strictly according to the law, I am afraid that Your Majesty will
            be criticized by later generations as intolerant to the talents.’…Thus Su Shi was only
            punished lightly</quote>. <ptr target="#tuotuo1985" loc="10554"/></cit>
         <p>This is far from the only record showing positive interactions between reformers and
            anti-reformers. Actually, Su Shi, the leader of <emph>Shudang</emph>, and Wang
            Anshi, the leader of the reformers, showed respect to each other. When Su was relegated
            and went past Jinling <note>Current Nanjing.</note>, he advised Wang to exhort the emperor in return for being
            thought highly by the emperor. Feeling respected, Wang accepted his advice and warned
            him not to tell anybody else <ptr target="#tuotuo1985" loc="10809–10"/>. In the record, it is clear that
            Su thought highly of Wang, and Wang trusted Su and treated him as an intimate
            friend.</p>
         <p>Wang also listened to the advice of Su Zhe, who was the brother of Su Shi. When he
            carried out the reform policies, he asked for the opinion of Su Zhe on the <emph>qingmiaofa </emph>[green sprouts policy] <note>One of the most important policies of the reform, which provided direct government
               loan to farmers during planting seasons and to be repaid at harvest.</note>. When Su proposed
            objection, Wang answered: <quote rend="inline">What you said was really reasonable, I should rethink it
            carefully.</quote> And he stopped talking about <emph>qingmiaofa </emph>for several
         	months <ptr target="#tuotuo1985" loc="10822–3"/>.</p>
         <p>Similar records are not only found in those concerning the amiable relations between the
            reformers and the members of <emph>Shudang</emph>, who held relatively mild
            attitudes towards the reform, but also between reformers and other more radical
            anti-reformers. During the reign of Emperor Shenzong, who was the main supporter of the
            reform, the firm anti-reformers were still high-rank officials. Fu Bi, Wu Chong
            (1021–1080), Feng Jing, Wen Yanbo, Lü Gongbi (1007–1073) had all assumed offices of what
            was equivalent to the prime minister <ptr target="#li2013" loc="261"/>. Emperor Shenzong showed great
            tolerance and respect for the anti-reformers despite their political views, enabling
            positive and amiable interactions.</p>
         <p>Moreover, even the firmest anti-reformers tried to mediate with the reformers. In the
            fifth year of Yuanyou (1090), Liu Zhi (1030–1098), the leader of <emph
               >Shuodang </emph>[the party of <emph>Shuo</emph>] <note>A political group in the Yuanyou Era led by Liu Zhi. It was considered as the
                  direct political successor of Sima Guang and held the most radical view against the
                  reform. Most of its members are from northern China, which was called <emph
                     >Shuo </emph>in premodern China. The members of Shuodang were also distinguished by
                  Huang Zhen, see <ptr target="#huang2013" loc="vol. 19, item pengdang"/>.</note>, together with Lü
            Dafang (1027–1097) advised appointing the reformers as officials in order to alleviate
            the existing resentment between the reformers and anti-reformers. And they called it
            <q>mediation</q> <ptr target="#li2004" loc="10669"/>. In spite of factions, struggles and disputes, there are
            still a number of records showing positive interactions between reformers and
            anti-reformers, especially those of <emph>Shudang</emph>. </p></div>
            <div>
         <head>5.2 Anti-Reformers’ Views on the Reform</head>
         <p>We next investigated the difference between the reformers’ and the anti-reformers’
            political views, in order to discover to what extent they really hold irreconcilable
            political views.</p>
         <p>The anti-reformers who held the least radical views on the reform were still the members
            of <emph>Shudang</emph>. During the reign of Emperor Renzong, Su Shi wrote a
            memorial to the Emperor stating the urgency of the reform. <quote rend="inline">Nowadays, if we do not
               cleanse the old, we will not be able to establish something eminent</quote> <ptr target="#su1986"/>. In his
            early years, Su Shi strongly approved of the reform and was taunted by Zhu Xi
            (1130–1200) because of it. Zhu criticized that Su <quote rend="inline">talked about improving government
            finance in his early years, but never talked about it after seeing the failure of<emph> qingmiaofa</emph>. He talked about military actions in his early
            years…but never talked about it after seeing the failure of Wang Anshi’s military
            actions.</quote> <ptr target="#li1994" loc="3100"/></p>
         <p>Su Shi was not the only one who urged reform. Although criticizing Su Shi, Zhu Xi
            admitted that <quote rend="inline">not only <emph>Jinggong</emph> (Wang Anshi) wanted to reform,
               but all of the wise men then had an intention for reform</quote> <ptr target="#li1994" loc="3111"/> when
            discussing the situation of the era before the reform. Therefore, we can conclude that
            there was a consensus among officials on the eve of the era of reform, whether reformers
            or anti-reformers, when the reform was carried out by Wang Anshi.</p>
         <p>Moreover, during the era of the reform, members of <emph>Shudang</emph> still
            held relatively mild attitudes, even if they opposed it in general. When Sima Guang came
            into power and tried to abolish Wang Anshi’s policies, some members of <emph
               >Shudang</emph> argued against it. For instance, in the Yuanyou Era, Sima Guang planned
            to change the standard of imperial examination set by Wang Anshi. Su Zhe argued that
            since the next examination would take place very soon, it would be difficult for the
            examinees to adapt to the new standard. So he advised Sima to follow the standard set by
            Wang Anshi in the next year and consider changes afterwards <ptr target="#tuotuo1985" loc="10824"/>.
            Although Sima Guang didn’t take his advice, it was clear that Su Zhe held a relatively
            neutral view on the reform even in the Yuanyou Era, when political struggle grew more
            severe.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, before the era of the reform, most anti-reformers still approved of
            reform to a certain degree. And during the era of the reform, the members of <emph>Shudang </emph>still held relatively mild views on it. The mild
            perspectives held by anti-reformers and the positive interactions between them and
            reformers imply that in the early period of the reform, political struggle among
            factions was controllable and rational to some extent, and that there were no
            irreconcilable conflicts between the reformers and anti-reformers despite their
            differences.</p></div>
            <div>
         <head>5.3 Worsened Political Situation</head>
         <p>Nevertheless, the situation worsened as time went on. The first to be persecuted were
            the members of <emph>Shudang</emph>, especially Su Shi, who was described by
            Liu Anshi as:</p>
         <cit> <quote rend="block">In the Yuanfeng Era (1078–1085), the reformers were intolerant of him and wanted to
            kill him. In the Yuanyou Era, there was also dissension between him and the old
            gentlemen (i.e. the anti-reformers). He is not a man to fluctuate as situation changes.</quote>
            <ptr target="#ma1985" loc="5"/></cit>
         <p>As a result, he was relegated in the Xining Era (1068–1077) and the Yuanfeng Era when
            the reformers were in power, and was also forced to leave the capital in the Yuanyou Era
            when the anti-reformers were in power.</p>
         <p>The members of <emph>Shudang </emph>were not the only ones persecuted when the
            political struggle worsened. In the Yuanyou Era, reformers were massively persecuted.
            Fan Chunren, one of the anti-reformers, summed up the situation of political persecution
            as follows: <quote rend="inline">In my opinion, the origin of the factions is because of political views.
            Those who have the same view with me are considered to be righteous, while those who
            have different views are doubted to be devious</quote> <ptr target="#li2004" loc="10325"/>.</p>
         <p>In the Southern Song dynasty, when the arguments around the reform came to the
            definitive conclusion that the reform had been a mistake, people’s judgement on
            reformers and anti-reformers completely depended on their political views: the
            anti-reformers received praises and honors, while the reformers, no matter who they
            were, were severely criticized. In <emph>Guochao zhu chen zouyi
            </emph>[Memorials of All Ministers of Our Dynasty] edited by Zhao Ruyu (1140–1196), which
            was a collection of political memorials, the number of memorials of each person selected
            showed an overt relationship with their political views. Firm anti-reformers had the
            most memorials selected, for example, Sima Guang had 146, Lü Hui (1014–1071) had
            forty-five, Fu Bi had forty-four, Liu Zhi had thirty-four. Members of <emph
               >Shudang</emph> had less than that, with Su Zhe having twenty-four, and Su Shi having
            twenty-three. The memorials of the reformers were rarely selected. Wang Anshi had only
            six, while none of those written by Lü Huiqing, Zhang Dun or Zeng Bu were selected
            <ptr target="#zhao1999"/>. Only the anti-reformers were able to have their works memorialized, and
            the reformers were officially forgotten.</p></div>
            <div>
         <head>5.4 Influence of Literati Politics on Political Struggle</head>
         <p>In 5.1 and 5.2 we discussed positive interactions between reformers and anti-reformers
            and the anti-reformers’ views of the reform. We concluded that, at first, there were no
            irreconcilable conflicts between reformers and anti-reformers. But we found that
            conditions of political civility deteriorated in the last decades of 12th century, and
            the findings in part 4 offer a persuasive explanation for this: what we have called
            throughout <q>literati politics</q>. We conclude that those engaged in common literary
            pursuits were more likely to share political goals, and that shared affiliation to
            literary groups is likely to indicate shared affiliation to political groups. Both
            conclusions suggest the basic constitution of literati politics, which in turn exerts a
            deep influence on factionalized struggle.</p>
         <p>The relatively mild view held by members of <emph>Shudang</emph> on the reform
            corresponded to the similarity of their academic views to those avowed by reformers. In
            the epitaph of his brother Su Shi, Su Zhe recalled that when Su Shi read <emph>Zhuangzi </emph><note>A philosophical work written by Zhuang Zhou and considered as a scripture of
               Taoism.</note>, he found it resonant with his own ideas. And when
            he read the Sutras, he likewise reconciled it with Confucianism and Taoism <ptr target="#su1990"/>.
            The idea of fusing Confucianism with Taoism and Buddhism to a certain degree was
            identical to the proposals made by Wang Anshi. Therefore, both were criticized as
            profaning orthodox Confucianism.</p>
         <p>Zhu Xi, a representative of the orthodox Confucianists, stated that <quote rend="inline">Wang Anshi and Su
            Shi regarded the Buddha and Laozi <note>Founder of the Taoism philosophy and was worshiped in the Taoism religion.</note> as sages, and thus their academics were not pure
            Confucianism academics</quote> <ptr target="#zhu2006"/>. Therefore, he criticized both of them that <quote rend="inline">the
               academics of both of them were illicit.</quote> <ptr target="#li1994" loc="3100"/>. And he also extended the
            criticism to politics. <quote rend="inline">If Su Shi had been the prime minister, and invited Qin Guan
            (1049–1100), Huang Tingjian and other companies to assist him, things would have become
            worse (than what was caused by Wang Anshi)</quote> <ptr target="#li1994" loc="3112"/>.</p>
         <p>The similarities between the philosophical perspectives of the members of <emph>Shudang</emph> and reformers correlates to the <emph
               >Shudang</emph> members’ mild attitude towards the reform. And since their academics,
               <emph>Shuxue</emph>, was quite different from <emph
            >Luoxue</emph>, they were in dispute with the members of <emph>Luodang</emph> in
            the Yuanyou Era when anti-reformers came into power. Similarly, the dispute between the
            reformers and the anti-reformers can also be explained by their differences in academic
            inclinations.</p>
         <p>The distinct features of literati politics in the Song dynasty led to the extremely
            important social status of the literati. The actions of scholar-officials tended to be
         	<q>value-rational</q> instead of <q>instrumentally rational</q> <note>The definitions of the phrases refer to Max Weber, see <ptr target="#weber1978" loc="24–5"/>.</note>. Unlike officials in a
            typical bureaucratic government, they took actions based on their own senses of value,
            which was a natural result of the prosperity of <emph>Daoxue</emph>. It made
            the Song dynasty a golden age for the literati. However, it also resulted in inevitable
            disputes among the scholar-officials who held different academic views. Since the
            scholar-officials had the identity of <q>literatus</q> and <q>official</q> at the same time, their
            academic views would strongly influence their political views, which brought about
            political struggles. Even worse, the scholar-officials in the Song dynasty were
            concerned with Confucianism, which itself pertained largely to value judgements.
            Therefore, they criticized those who held different academic views, and eventually gave
            moral judgements on them. This was the chief reason why normal political struggles would
            turn into disastrous persecutions according to <ptr target="#xiao1998"/>. The findings of this paper
            on the extreme intimacy between the literary relations and political relations among the
            people active in the era of reform strongly reinforce this interpretation of the
            period.</p>
         <p>Nevertheless, a paradox remains, namely that in the Southern Song dynasty, the dispute
            between <emph>Luoxue</emph> and <emph>Shuxue </emph>finally turned
            into the fusion of different ideas and ideologies. Scholars such as Liu Guangzu
            (1142–1222) and Wei Liaoweng (1178–1237) worked to bring about the fusion of <emph>Luoxue </emph>and <emph>Shuxue</emph>. To some extent, Zhu Xi,
            who epitomized the idea of <emph>Luoxue</emph> and critically inherited <emph>Shuxue</emph>, also carried on the process <ptr target="#su1997"/>. In this way,
            academic disputes were solved. However, the political disputes which had their roots in
            those academic disputes were never successfully mitigated, and finally they accelerated
            the collapse of the Northern Song dynasty.</p></div>

         <head>6 Conclusion</head>
         <p>With the help of digital methods, this article preliminarily confirms that it was the
            literati’s different academic views that caused and exacerbated the political struggle,
            and the regime of <q>literati politics</q> was largely responsible for it. In part four we
            have found a distinct feature of literati politics from the results of our data
            analysis. And in part five, beginning with an outlier found in the automatically
            generated social network, we went back to the primary historical sources, and found that
            there were not irreconcilable conflicts between the reformers and anti-reformers at
            first. Further, in order to explain the reason why the political struggle worsened, we
            found that the development of literati politics in the Song dynasty offered a persuasive
            cause.</p>
         <p>In this article, the original data obtained from CBDB are entirely based on historical
            records, and the reliability of the findings generated by digital methods that
            <q>distantly</q> aggregate historical sources are further validated by traditional methods
            that <q>closely</q> look through such sources. This is particularly necessary as both
            dimensionality reduction and community detection algorithms adopted in this article
            belong to the class of unsupervised learning. However, it should be noted that, without
            access to the workings of CBDB, work in this field would be held back. Moreover, the
            specific ways in which literati politics impacted political struggle still need
            elaboration in further studies, and our methodology can also be adapted by researchers
            in other fields such as exploring correlations between economic and political
            perspectives.</p>
         <p>With the above caveats in place, we can conclude that, as found in part four, although
            literary relations and political relations among people have their own characteristics,
            they have many clear connections during the era of the reform, making it a typical era
            with highly-related culture and politics. Therefore, based on the suggestiveness of the
            data and the confirmation offered by the primary historical records, this article
            reinforces the view held by Cheng Yangzhi on the origin and nature of political struggle
            surrounding the issue of reform, ascribing the problem to different academic opinions
            <ptr target="#cheng1942"/>.</p>
         <p>This result may shed light on further studies on the origin of the political struggle.
            This paper offers one way to bring to a close the debate on the origin and nature of the
            struggle among political factions in the reform era. Of course, other factors such as
            class interests, regionalism and simple emotionality still have weight, but literati
            politics offers the most comprehensive probative value of any of the possible
            explanations. Moreover, our paper also proves the explanatory force of the <q>Tang-Song
               transition</q> model <ptr target="#fogel1984"/> on Song politics. Scholars of ancient and medieval
            history have formed a critical tradition of analyzing and interpreting the limited
            sources available to them. We emphasize that the digital methods in this article are the
            intellectual successors to, and share in, this spirit of critical imagination.</p>
         <p>Niu Xi imputed the origin of the political struggle among <emph
            >Luodang</emph>, <emph>Shudang</emph> and <emph>Shuodang</emph> as
            follows: <quote rend="inline">The disputation had nothing to do with policies, nor with principles. It was
            just a disputation based on regionalism, parochialism, companionship between teachers
            and students, and academic styles</quote> <ptr target="#niu1931"/>. This statement is not only applicable
            for this specific political struggle among the anti-reformers. In the whole process of
            the political struggle among factions around reform, neither the disputations between
            the reformers and anti-reformers, nor those among anti-reformers, were fundamentally
            irreconcilable.</p>
         <p>It is generally acknowledged that the relation between the scholars and politicians
            became increasingly close in medieval China, and the feature of literati politics became
            more and more significant through the dynasties. Consequently, China eventually
            transformed into an autocratic monarchy governed by scholar-officials in the Ming and
            Qing dynasties. The Song dynasty acted as a pivotal period of the transformation with
            its distinct feature of literati politics, under the rubric of which scholar-officials
            holding different academic views criticized the political opinions of others, such that
            even political persecutions could be entirely driven by moral judgements.</p></div>
