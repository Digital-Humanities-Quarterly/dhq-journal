                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  
                  
                  <p>In late 11th century, a reform carried out by Wang Anshi (1021–1086) brought about
                     controversies and initiated a series of political struggles between factionalized
                     reformers and anti-reformers. The origin and nature of these factionalized struggles
                     have been discussed for a long time among scholars. In this paper, we discuss the
                     issue based on the literary and political relationships among people in the era of
                     the reform. First, two matrices are respectively constructed of the literary and
                     political relations among these people based on the data collected from CBDB (China
                     Biographical Database). Then a Poission-Gamma factorization model is adopted to
                     obtain the key factors of the matrices, and the Louvain Modularity algorithm is used
                     for community detection. The results show that people engaging in similar literary
                     pursuits were more likely to share political interests and people belonging to the
                     same literary groups were more likely to join in the same political groups,
                     suggesting a feature of “literati politics” which was prominent in 11th century
                     China. Ensuing discussions illustrate that people’s differing academic views indeed
                     played a shaping role in the formation and exacerbation of factionalized struggle,
                     for which the mechanism unfolded herein of “literati politics” was highly
                     responsible.</p>

                     China is considered as a decisive period in the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127).
                     Beginning in 1069, Wang Anshi carried out the <cite class="title italic">Wang Anshi bianfa
                        </cite>[Reform of Wang Anshi] under the support of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1067–1085), aiming
                     at changing the “<em class="emph">jipinjiruo</em>” [unceasingly impoverished and
                     weakened] situation of the state. The <em class="emph">xinfa</em> [new policies]
                     initiated in the reform include a group of financial, social, and military policies
                     that
                     enormously changed the state’s political mechanism, thus resulting in severe resistance
                     from the conservative officials and a long-lasting political dispute. In 1085, when
                     Emperor Shenzong died, the Empress Dowager Gao (1032–1093) came into power. During
                     her
                     reign, all reform policies were abolished and most pro-reform officials were exiled.
                     However, when she died and Emperor Zhezong (r. 1085–1100), a firm supporter of the
                     reform, took authority, the reform policies were continued and the anti-reformers
                     were
                     persecuted, and this tug of war had its culmination in the uncontrollable political
                     strife during the reign of Emperor Huizong (r. 1100–1126).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Because of the controversial nature of the reform, debates on it have never stopped.
                     Since the reform was a decisive political issue of that time, all contemporary officials
                     had to take their sides, and many of them had a fairly radical stance. For example,
                     one
                     anti-reformer, Yang Shi (1053–1135) claimed that “the origin of the disaster today was
                     because of Wang Anshi” [<a class="ref" href="#tuotuo1985">Tuotuo 1985</a>, 12741], and imputed the collapse of Northern
                     Song to the reform. However, many 20th century scholars argued that the reform was
                     the
                     only way to save the corrupt government and bring prosperity to the state. For instance,
                     Liang Qichao held the view that Wang Anshi’s effort was a response to the need of
                     his
                     time, and a recuperation from the crisis [<a class="ref" href="#liang1993">Liang 1993</a>, 1]. No matter how scholars’
                     views differ on the reform, its significance was undoubted, and there is a consensus
                     that the political struggle following the reform was the direct cause of the fall
                     of the
                     empire.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The historical and cultural context of the reform should also be addressed. The Song
                     dynasty featured “literati politics”, a regime in which the government officials mostly
                     came from the scholar-gentry who had earned academic degrees. Under this regime, the
                     officials are known as scholar-officials and are both active in political and literary
                     circles. According to the enduringly influential and widely accepted model “Tang-Song
                     transition” by Naito Konan [<a class="ref" href="#fogel1984">Fogel 1984</a>], the Song dynasty is considered as a decisive
                     period of the development of the literati politics, a period when government openings
                     began to be widely occupied by scholar-officials. The Song dynasty also witnessed
                     an
                     unprecedented prosperity of <em class="emph">Daoxue</em> [Neo-Confucianism], in which
                     scholars were affiliated to different schools of Daoxue and held
                     different academic and ideological views. During the reform, these scholar-officials
                     with different academic inclinations also tended to hold different views about the
                     reform. The shaping power of the literati’s academic backgrounds on their stances
                     toward
                     the reform was discussed by a 20th century scholar Cheng Yangzhi, who considered that
                     the dispute between the reformers and the anti-reformers was rooted in their different
                     academic opinions [<a class="ref" href="#cheng1942">Cheng 1942</a>].</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">But this view is still not widely accepted, and the debate on the origin of the
                     political struggle among factions in the light of the reform is not yet settled.
                     Different scholarly views chiefly rise from different interpretations of existing
                     historical sources, which are themselves not sufficient enough in many cases to serve
                     as
                     concrete pieces of evidence. By introducing digital methods and observing existing
                     historical data in a more comprehensive way, however, it is possible to gain more
                     solid
                     arguments for the problem.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Thanks to the proliferation of digitized historical records, digital methods have
                     been
                     adopted in many studies of Sinology. Specifically, a relational database for Sinology,
                     CBDB (China Biographical Database) [<a class="ref" href="#harvarduniversity2018">Harvard University et al. 2018</a>] has inspired much
                     research, among which the political factions in the Song dynasty (960–1279) have
                     attracted a wealth of attention. For instance, Hilde De Weerdt et al. investigated
                     the
                     structure of Song dynasty faction lists on the basis of large-scale network analysis
                     with the help of CBDB data [<a class="ref" href="#deweerdt2019">De Weerdt et al. 2019</a>], while one of our previous studies focused
                     on the relationship between scholars and politicians in the Yuanyou Era (1086–1094)
                     based exclusively on the data harvested from CBDB [<a class="ref" href="#shang2018">Shang and Huang 2018</a>]. Following the
                     direction opened up by previous work, this article investigates the experimental data
                     from CBDB with exploratory statistical methods to revisit the debates around the origin
                     of the factionalized struggle. In this sense, our research can be considered as an
                     attempt from the community of digital humanities to facilitate the study of premodern
                     Chinese history.</div>

                     feature of “literati politics”, where scholar-officials are active in both literary and
                     political groups that formed around common literary pursuits and political interests.
                     And since the opinion leaders in the literary world and the leaders of prominent
                     philosophical schools in the Northern Song dynasty, such as Wang Anshi, Su Shi, and
                     Cheng Yi, were also important politicians who carried out and resisted the reform,
                     confirming the concomitance between political and literary relations would shed light
                     on
                     the origin and nature of the political struggle. In order to gain insights into it,
                     the
                     last hypothesis is discussed based on primary historical sources to demonstrate how

                        “Your majesty rules the nation with the scholar-officials, instead of the ordinary

                     <div class="ptext" id="p11">The second view, chiefly held by Liang Qichao, imputes the political struggle to
                        “emotionality”, and his main point is “the members of each faction weren’t necessary to
                        combine with each other purposefully. However, they will raise disputes whenever an
                        issue occurs. If there is one person initiating an argument, there will be hundreds
                        of
                        henchmen following him. In a word, they just acted out of emotionality” [<a class="ref" href="#liang1993">Liang 1993</a>, 159]. Liang’s opinion had a great influence on later scholars although his attribution
                        of the political struggle to “emotionality” is criticized as oversimplifying the
                        problem.</div>

                        by Hu Shi in his comments on Li Gou (1009–1059), a philosopher and a countryman of
                        Wang
                        Anshi. Both Li Gou and Wang Anshi were from Jiangxi, and Wang’s thought was an
                        inheritance of Li [<a class="ref" href="#hu1921">Hu 1921</a>]. And it is developed by Qian Mu, who further argues that
                        “(the criticism of the anti-reformers to Wang Anshi) was actually based on different
                        views of the south and the north,” and that “the southern literati are considered
                        frivolous while the northern literati are thought to be esteemed, thus Sima Guang
                        (1019–1086) and his followers were incompatible with Lü Huiqing and his followers”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#qian1936">Qian 1936</a>]. This view became very influential because of Qian Mu’s widespread work,

                        opinions. He states that “Sima Guang’s opposition to Wang Anshi’s reform was because of
                        his political belief and his basic principle, the <em class="emph">Dao</em>, was
                        different from that of Wang. Wang believed that the <em class="emph">Dao </em>of human
                        was separated from but based on the <em class="emph">Dao</em> of nature. The <em class="emph">Dao </em>of nature tends to change, and so should that of human.
                        However, Sima believed the two types of <em class="emph">Dao </em>cannot be separated.

                        later scholars stayed within the bounds they suggest. Luo Jiaxiang, who wrote a group
                        of
                        papers on this in the 1980s and 1990s, defines the reformers as “those who take the
                        responsibility of the nation” and the anti-reformers as “the political group which is
                        both decadent and inert” [<a class="ref" href="#luo1985">Luo 1985</a>]. From there he proposes the innovative
                        interpretation that “they are both the representative of the whole class of landed
                        gentry” [<a class="ref" href="#luo1984">Luo 1984</a>], rather than considering them as different social classes. Moreover,
                        he notices the importance of censors, the <em class="emph">Taijian</em> officials, 
                        claiming that they composed another significant part of the anti-reformers other than

                        what
                        they think the reason was. For example, Chen Zhenyang attributes the failure of the
                        reform to the struggle among factions. He states that “[the anti-reformers] were glad of
                        the increment of the disadvantages of the reform and the nonfulfillment of its
                        advantages furtively,” and that “Wang Anshi’s reform was in trouble because of it”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#chen1943">Chen 1943</a>]. Besides, apart from the disputes between the anti-reformers and the
                        reformers, in the Yuanyou Era, there were also debates among the anti-reformers
                        themselves. The dispute between<em class="emph"> Luodang</em> [the party of <em class="emph">Luo</em>] <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e407">[2]</a> and <em class="emph">Shudang</em> [the party of <em class="emph">Shu</em>] <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e413">[3]</a>, which was named as “<em class="emph">Luoshu

                        struggle], was also of significant influence. Cheng Ruizhao believes the struggle’s
                        influence lasted until 1155 when Qin Hui (1091–1155) dead, and even to 1224 when Emperor

                        played a crucial role in the cultural-political life of the Song Dynasty. For example,
                        in a case study on the Huizhou, in the period of 1200–1550, local literati’s spatial
                        imagination resembled a mode that “every local place was a microcosm of
                        ‘all-under-heaven’, and thus they practiced political ideas on their local governance”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#du2012">Du 2012</a>, 440]. But it was in the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) when the tendency of

                        scholar-officials occupied most of the government openings. This feature is considered

                        example, Amy McNair finds that many eminent scholar-officials active in the eleventh

                        of
                        the cultural-political relationships of the literati. The literati changed the function

                        scholar-officials, their academic views were intimately related to their political
                        views, exerting a deep influence on the political struggle in late 11th century. Liang
                        Qichao noticed their relationship. In his analysis on <em class="emph">Xinxue </em>[the
                        new school of <em class="emph">Daoxue</em>] <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e529">[5]</a>, he described it as follows: “Whatever
                        useful for molding the character of oneself or exerting an influence on politics are
                        all
                        included in his academics” [<a class="ref" href="#liang1993">Liang 1993</a>, 203]. Since Wang’s philosophical ideas were
                        intimately connected with his political ideas, his criticizers opposed it as well.
                        Qiu
                        Hansheng associated the academic disputation with the theory of class conflict, arguing
                        that “the opposition to <em class="emph">Xinxue </em>academically has the same meaning
                        as the opposition to reform politically, which is class conflict” [<a class="ref" href="#qiu1959">Qiu 1959</a>]. The
                        remarkable concomitancy between academics and politics was even thought to be the
                        reason
                        why <em class="emph">Xinxue</em> failed to prosper after Wang’s death by Deng
                        Guangming, who assumed that “if Wang Anshi had not come into power or enacted a reform,
                        his academic ideas…would certainly have been inherited by the Confucianists working
                        on

                     literary and political matrix respectively. The matrices are operated under the third
                     stage, dimensionality reduction, which mainly extracts the feature factors of the
                     two
                     matrices, and the fourth stage, community detection, where communities are detected
                     from
                     these matrices with Louvain Modularity. Both the results of the third and the fourth
                     stages are visualized and compared, while in the fourth stage, relation analysis is
                     adopted after comparison. Afterwards, the overall results are interpreted and discussed.

                        co-citation and bibliographic coupling analysis, where key factors are explained as
                        an
                        academic interest shared by a group of scholars, the historical meaning of the factors
                        can be preliminarily explained as literary pursuits and political interests
                        respectively. This interpretation is based on the following considerations: when two
                        or
                        more people share literary relationships with many common people, it is likely that
                        they
                        are driven by a common literary pursuit; likewise, when two or more people frequently
                        offer political aids to each other, it is highly possible that they share a certain
                        political interest. Furthermore, the mathematical meaning of factors that a single
                        point
                        could have a notable value in different factors matches with the fact that a person
                        could have various literary pursuits and could be connected to different political
                        groups through different political interests.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">Therefore, the people sharing a common factor can be interpretated as engaging in
                        a
                        common literary pursuit and sharing a certain political interest respectively, despite
                        the fact that the precise meaning of the key factors requires further elaboration.
                        The
                        first extracted factors explain higher variance, and therefore are chosen as the objects
                        of evaluation. We first discuss the people with the highest value in each factor,
                        and
                        offer visualizations of the results afterwards. Finally, we compare the results of

                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">The last stage is community detection, which is also based on the two matrices. As
                        a
                        process of investigating the structure in a complex network, the method can aggregate
                        and integrate all relation data among the people. Therefore, rather than adopting
                        basic
                        statistical methods, which separately analyze the relationships between each pair
                        of
                        people, community detection is capable of treating the entire social network in the
                        reform era as a whole and analyzing it comprehensively. In this way, the results of
                        community detection and dimensionality reduction, which suggest possible relationships
                        among people regarding literary pursuits and political interests, can be complementary,
                        providing a more comprehensive view of relationships among the people active in the
                        era
                        of the reform.</div>

                        by
                        negative values, since the minimum value in the political matrix is minus four, each
                        element is increased by a constant four so that all elements would be non-negative.
                        Then
                        the matrices are converted into social networks, where the weight of edge between
                        the

                        which
                        is an open-source software for graph and network analysis [<a class="ref" href="#bastian2009">Bastian et al. 2009</a>]. We lay

                        Finally, the communities detected are considered as literary and political groups
                        respectively. There are four core communities detected in the literary network and
                        seven
                        in the political network.</div>

                        Association rule learning is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases

                        relations. These findings suggest the literary group a person belongs to corresponds
                        to

                           magnanimous emperors do not convict others because of their sayings.…If Your Majesty
                           sentenced him (Su Shi) strictly according to the law, I am afraid that Your Majesty

                        into power and tried to abolish Wang Anshi’s policies, some members of <em class="emph">Shudang</em> argued against it. For instance, in the Yuanyou Era, Sima Guang planned
                        to change the standard of imperial examination set by Wang Anshi. Su Zhe argued that

                        Wang Anshi in the next year and consider changes afterwards [<a class="ref" href="#tuotuo1985">Tuotuo 1985</a>, 10824].

                        pursuits were more likely to share political goals, and that shared affiliation to
                        literary groups is likely to indicate shared affiliation to political groups. Both

                        important social status of the literati. The actions of scholar-officials tended to
                        be
                        “value-rational” instead of “instrumentally rational” <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1952">[19]</a>. Unlike officials in a
                        typical bureaucratic government, they took actions based on their own senses of value,
                        which was a natural result of the prosperity of <em class="emph">Daoxue</em>. It made
                        the Song dynasty a golden age for the literati. However, it also resulted in inevitable
                        disputes among the scholar-officials who held different academic views. Since the
                        scholar-officials had the identity of “literatus” and “official” at the same time, their
                        academic views would strongly influence their political views, which brought about
                        political struggles. Even worse, the scholar-officials in the Song dynasty were
                        concerned with Confucianism, which itself pertained largely to value judgements.
                        Therefore, they criticized those who held different academic views, and eventually
                        gave
                        moral judgements on them. This was the chief reason why normal political struggles

                        turn into disastrous persecutions according to [<a class="ref" href="#xiao1998">Xiao 1998</a>]. The findings of this paper

                        between <em class="emph">Luoxue</em> and <em class="emph">Shuxue </em>finally turned
                        into the fusion of different ideas and ideologies. Scholars such as Liu Guangzu
                        (1142–1222) and Wei Liaoweng (1178–1237) worked to bring about the fusion of <em class="emph">Luoxue </em>and <em class="emph">Shuxue</em>. To some extent, Zhu Xi,
