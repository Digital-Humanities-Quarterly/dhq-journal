                  <p>The increasing prevalence of computer models within humanities research has raised
                     a number of challenges for humanities scholars. Chief 
                     among them are the ways in which computational modelling fundamentally transforms
                     the conventional methodologies and epistemological 
                     frameworks that have long defined research within the humanities. In <cite class="title italic">Modelling Between Digital and Humanities: 
                        Thinking in Practice</cite> (2023), Arianna Ciula, Øyvind Eide, Cristina Marras, and 
                     Patrick Sahle evaluate the impact of this paradigm shift on humanities scholarship and varying
                     strategies for addressing 
                     the challenges that it presents. In particular, the authors take up the idea of formulating
                     a new digital humanities mode of thinking 
                     that can enable the humanities to adapt and thrive in the digital age while retaining
                     their core values.

                     models have fundamentally transformed how we 
                     approach and interpret complex phenomena while simultaneously challenging traditional
                     notions of knowledge and authority. As 
                     Marshall McLuhan once warned about the influence of electronic communications, “The medium is the 
                     message” [<a class="ref" href="#mcluhan_2010">McLuhan 2010</a>]. In this specific instance, the model has become the message as the very act of modelling
                     
                     has and continues to reshape the way(s) in which we perceive, interpret, and engage
                     with a particular subject matter, influencing our 
                     understanding of reality itself. The increasing influence of computer models over
                     knowledge acquisition, thus, raises critical questions 
                     about our growing reliance on computational methodologies and their algorithmic thinking.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">When it comes to addressing the above questions, the book's emphasis on the humanities'
                     significance for computer modelling may at first 
                     seem somewhat unexpected, with the humanities often assumed to exist in diametric
                     tension with such algorithmic thinking. Yet, modelling's 
                     origins, in fact, reside within the humanities where scholars have historically pioneered
                     conceptual modelling and narrative construction 
                     models as analytical tools. As the authors explain: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>The use of models and the process of modelling have a long 
                           tradition in the humanities. Going back to early modern Europe, the use of models in what could be called scholarship in 
                           “the Humanities” included modelling in natural philosophy, which later developed into the natural
                           sciences. 
                           [<a class="ref" href="#ciula_et_al_2023">Ciula et al. 2023</a>, 21]</p>
                     </blockquote>It was, ultimately, the humanities, with their focus on conceptualization, 
                     interpretation, and narrative construction that would lay the epistemological groundwork
                     needed for the development and application of 
                     modelling techniques across various disciplines.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">That disjuncture between modelling's historical significance for humanities disciplines
                     and contemporary perceptions of the humanities' 
                     tension with modelling raises important questions about the causes of any such tension
                     as well as the need for a larger analysis of 
                     modelling's history and potential for the humanities. In that light, the book devotes
                     significant attention to examining how 
                     formalization, or the process by which data are structured for computational analysis,
                     have contributed to the perceived tension.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Formalization is essential for populating computer systems with data, yet it also
                     entails a fundamental transformation of the objects of 
                     study, altering their interpretive possibilities in ways that necessitate critical
                     reflection. Describing the process, the authors 
                     explain: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>In these processes of modelling for operationalisation, the change of the sources
                           (loss of variation, gain 
                           of processability) thus enables formal processing and at the same time highlights
                           what cannot (within the limitations of specific 
                           processing methods) be formalised and thus is left behind. [<a class="ref" href="#ciula_et_al_2023">Ciula et al. 2023</a>, 4]</p>
                     </blockquote>Computers do not just change 
                     objects of study, but they transform them into something entirely new and different
                     from what they were before. Following the book's 
                     argument, their transformation necessitates a new digital humanities mode of thinking
                     that can account for the shift and specifically 
                     address the loss of contextualization that occurs when humanities research is subjected
                     to computational methods. This loss of 
                     contextualization presents a significant challenge to humanities research in that
                     it leads to the very loss of cultural knowledge and 
                     context that is necessary to conduct humanities research in the first place. As systems
                     design engineer and media theorist Wendy 
                     Chun has explained, formalization routinely leads to the conflation of correlation with
                     causation because the complex 
                     socio-cultural factors that influence data are lost. As a result, the underlying causes
                     behind the data are misinterpreted and obfuscated 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#chun_2021">Chun 2021</a>]. In Chun's words, “If almost anything can be shown to be real, if almost any 
                     correlation can be discovered, how do we know what is true?” [<a class="ref" href="#chun_2021">Chun 2021</a>, 51].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">In an age where cultural knowledge is increasingly mediated through computational
                     algorithms, Chun's warning underscores the 
                     importance of understanding the limitations of their formalization process. Indeed,
                     much of <cite class="title italic">Modelling Between 
                        Digital and Humanities</cite> is devoted to addressing such concerns and laying the groundwork for a new digital
                     humanities mode of 
                     thinking in the aftermath of large-scale distrust of computational biases and errors.
                     The authors are particularly invested in the 
                     creation of a mode of thinking that can effectively balance interpretative and computational
                     approaches, addressing the challenges of 
                     formalization while simultaneously yielding new insights and methodologies that enhance

                     strategies that were cultivated through experimentation, iterative refinement, and
                     reflective engagement with modelling. Balancing 
                     theoretical approaches with more practical concerns enables the book to capture the
                     complexity of modelling for humanities research while 
                     also providing tangible ways for humanities scholars to integrate such methodologies
                     into their research.

                     around the theoretical and practical challenges 
                     of modelling as well as its untapped potential for humanities research. The first
                     three chapters lay the theoretical groundwork for the 
                     book, focusing on language, metaphor, and semiotics as critical aspects for understanding
                     modelling's history and its larger role in the 
                     history of humanities research. The first chapters offer critical insight into the
                     relationship between language and modelling, as the 
                     authors define modelling as a “process of translation and in particular of interpretation in the sense that it makes
                     
                     understandable facts and data correlated by the model” [<a class="ref" href="#ciula_et_al_2023">Ciula et al. 2023</a>, 40]. Here natural language plays a 
                     critical role in mediating the meaning between data and the model itself, ultimately
                     providing the very framework for which meaning can be 
                     constructed and shared.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">In Chapter Two, the authors develop that insight further and explore the central and
                     indispensable role of metaphor in modelling, since it 
                     enables us to make sense of abstract, intangible phenomena and simplify complex subjects.
                     While metaphor has routinely been the subject of 
                     study in humanities research, the book offers important insight into what is referred
                     to as “pragmatic metaphorical 
                     modelling”, or an approach to metaphor that goes beyond analogy by rethinking disciplinary boundaries
                     and thus reshaping the ways 
                     in which knowledge is organized and understood. In particular, the authors explain
                     how metaphor is intrinsically involved in computational 
                     settings where visual and textual aids, as in the case of diagrams, are used to make
                     objects interpretable to humans.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">It is in this discussion of metaphor that the authors capture a key insight about
                     modelling when it comes to the interpretation of data. 
                     As they explain, modelling's act of interpretation ultimately implies translation
                     as the action provides the very foundation upon which 
                     modelling finds its resonance and purpose, bridging the “dichotomy between formal and informal, object and theory, 
                     physical and mental” [<a class="ref" href="#ciula_et_al_2023">Ciula et al. 2023</a>, 58]. Moreover, as a process of translation, modelling has semiotic 
                     implications in that models function as icons, conveying meaning through representation
                     and symbolic abstraction. Understanding the 
                     iconicity of modelling, as the book makes clear in Chapter Three, enables researchers
                     to recognize the multiple layers of meaning embedded 
                     into these representations, ultimately facilitating more dynamic and diverse interpretations.

                     ultimately leads to the development of complex media 
                     products where texts are transformed into interactive visualizations, transformed
                     by the constraints and interpretive frameworks of their 
                     modality. In the case of virtual reality (VR), the book offers an interesting example
                     of virtual puppets from the Theatre Collection of

                     interactivity that allow users to engage with models in much more dynamic and immersive
                     ways. In transforming textual representations into 
                     dynamic and interactive visualizations, such VR models are introducing material and
                     sensorial modalities that reformulate representation 
                     around embodied experience and expand the possibilities of what humanities research
                     might look like in the future as modelling continues 
                     to favor dynamic visualizations.

                     more text-centric methodologies is among its

                     ways in which texts or text-based mediums can be 
                     transformed by modelling into dynamic visualizations.

                     it comes to the obvious tensions between images and

                     In <cite class="title italic">Becoming Besides 
                        Ourselves</cite>, mathematical theorist and philosopher Brian Rotman explains that alphanumeric language follows a certain 
                     seriality in that it presents information in a serial manner [<a class="ref" href="#rotman_2008">Rotman 2008</a>]. By contrast, visual models operate according to 
                     a parallelism in which multiple ideas are presented all at once to the viewer, producing
                     an obvious antagonism or iconoclasm. As he 
                     explains: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>With the result that technologies of parallel computing and those of a pluri-dimensional
                           visualization are 
                           inculcating modes of thought and self, and facilitating imaginings of agency, whose
                           parallelisms are directly antagonistic to the 
                           intransigent monadism, linear coding, and intense seriality inseparable from alphabetic
                           writing.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">There is an inherent parallelism to visualizations in that they require a strategic
                     mode of thinking that necessitates a different way of 
                     thinking than that of alphanumeric texts. Whereas the serialism of text-based mediums
                     favors a linear approach, visual-based modalities 
                     demand a simultaneous, multidimensional approach, allowing for multiple meanings to
                     co-exist all at once. The two different modes of 
                     thinking foment a potential conflict in that they prompt a fundamental reevaluation
                     of traditional knowledge hierarchies. Their tensions 
                     are perhaps most apparent in the growing conflict over the idea of what constitutes
                     humanities research and even knowledge itself as 
                     traditional definitions rooted in textual analysis are challenged by the emergence
                     of visual and computational modelling.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Interjecting into that debate, Ciula, Eide, Marras, and Sahle ultimately present what 
                     they describe as a “middle position” in that it “moves from the dichotomic interplay 
                     between bottom-up and top-down approaches to a middle-out model of knowledge” [<a class="ref" href="#ciula_et_al_2023">Ciula et al. 2023</a>, 109]. Their 
                     middle position involves a collaborative approach to knowledge where the researcher
                     engages in iterative cycles of inquiry that could be 
                     compared to the creative processes involved in the building and maintenance of collaborative
                     websites. To think and work iteratively with 
                     others will require a significant shift in conventional training programs as well
                     as an entirely new culture that prioritizes cooperation 
                     over individualized success.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">The increasing prevalence of modelling within humanities research, thus, poses a challenge
                     to not only integrate computational 
                     methodologies into varying fields of study but to change the ways in which humanities
                     scholars approach the research process itself. That 
                     issue is perhaps most evident in the book's emphasis on VR's potential for humanities
                     research. VR is not necessarily recreating 
                     historical scenarios. Rather, it is creating entirely new immersive environments that
                     necessitate new ways of interacting with and 
                     understanding the objects of study. The book illustrates that with the Theatre Collection
                     of the University of Cologne, 
                     explaining, 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>In order to re-establish the main original purpose of the collection, it was necessary
                           to create new 
                           objects, that is, to transfer their functionality to new objects. The decision was
                           made not to make a physical replica, but rather to 
                           establish the new object in another medium. [<a class="ref" href="#ciula_et_al_2023">Ciula et al. 2023</a>, 109]</p>
                     </blockquote>In such an environment, play or 
                     experimentation as opposed to verbal reasoning serve as the primary research tool,
                     allowing for entirely new embodied and hands-on modes 
                     of exploration. That shift towards embodied exploration in digital environments will
                     undoubtedly open up new avenues for understanding and 
                     interpretation in humanities scholarship.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">Even so, the paradigm shift will necessitate the formulation of collaborative, interactive,
                     and iterative approaches to research and 
                     knowledge production. The challenge, consequently, for digital humanities scholarship
                     will be to create a culture or mode of thinking for 
                     itself that shifts away from conventional verbal and text-centric modes of inquiry
                     and embraces more playful, experimental, and visual 
                     modes of iniquity. Whether or not that cultural shift can be successfully navigated
                     by digital humanists will likely decide the future 
                     trajectory of humanities research for generations to come.
