         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>As digital humanities projects grow in size and complexity university programs will
               need to adapt, balancing the needs of technological systems with the imperatives of
               the humanities tradition. While it makes sense to adapt the accumulated expertise of
               the commercial and government IT sectors, care needs to be taken to ensure any new
               approaches enhance rather than undermine the aims of the humanities generally. While
               digital humanists are uniquely positioned to help the humanities, care needs to be
               taken to ensure new project management and design techniques sourced from the IT
               world are applied critically and do not undermine the core aims of the discipline. If
               these caveats are kept in mind the IT world has a lot to offer digital humanists,
               however, especially in the field of Enterprise Architecture (EA), which aims to
               produce a holistic, high level view of technological systems with a view to
               understanding social and cultural as well as technological issues.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p> Unlike the often cozy cultures of small software shops and, at their best,
               university departments, the IT departments of government departments or traded
               companies tend towards factories. They have a tendency to be hierarchical, intensely
               structured and risk-averse: project managers will themselves be managed by project
               directors; teams of developers work off functional specifications written by systems
               analysts who in turn work off business requirements produced by business analysts;
               databases will be designed from class diagrams upwards by specialist teams and
               critiqued by database administrators experienced with enterprise-class persistence
               layers; release schedules will be managed by a cross-functional Change Advisory Board
               (CAB) composed of senior managers from across the enterprise. Although there is a
               growing willingness to import Agile methods into these environments, especially for
               smaller projects, it’s frequently remarked that the method doesn't scale to large
               projects. The fact is, of course, that when projects start to grow beyond the $4 or
               $5 million mark, they become business entities in their own right. While they might
               function on a principle of planned obsolescence, as long as they are active the
               fiduciary and managerial functions need to be almost as robust as that of an
               independent company. Agile is fantastic for software development, but software
               development is only one component of a large project. Large projects don't only
               deliver software, they deliver <soCalled>Change</soCalled>, leading the project to
               focus on <soCalled>transition management</soCalled> as much as software development.
               Complex teams develop within these environments, requiring in turn more scalable
               development, governance and maintenance strategies. And this is perhaps what
               interests me the most about enterprise IT: even the largest software development
               projects are dwarfed by the logistics of deploying them into human environments.
               Difficult as it may be because of massive disparities in scale and purpose, this
               editorial is my attempt to consider what IT might have to offer the digital
               humanities. </p>
            <p> As impressive as some enterprise IT environments sound, few experienced
               professionals could provide you with an example of one (whether composed of 50 or 500
               staff) that runs seamlessly and without a degree of stress: the industry is known as
               a challenging one. The obvious reason for this is that it is involved in engineering
               and maintaining complex systems, and complexity brings with it difficulty. Another
               reason is that the industry is young. Compare the 70 years since the development of
               Colossus <ptr target="#copeland2006"/> to the several thousand that have elapsed
               since the major engineering feats of antiquity. We are only just beginning to find
               processes that will genuinely assist our software engineering tasks. There are now a
               handful of broadly accepted methodologies that claim – and generally do – make the
               task of software engineering and maintenance easier (RUP, AGILE, PRINCE 2, ITIL), but
               few organisations have either the will or the means to deploy these approaches in a
                  <soCalled>purist</soCalled> sense. For a variety of reasons, they will need to be
               tailored to specific circumstances and the most extreme financial or legal
               motivations, like Sarbanes Oxley or governmental archive standards, need to be
               present to justify the expense of full deployment.</p>
            <p>This is a perspective that digital humanists might find useful. Although the
               enterprise IT world tends towards being over-engineered, and often seems to aspire to
               a kind of 21st-century Taylorist nirvana, it struggles with exactly the same kind of
               problems that the lone digital humanist does when confronted with a page of .php. The
               difference relates, of course, to scale and purpose: where digital humanists’ IT
               messes can usually be scrapped and restarted in a healthy spirit of experimentation
               and discovery, an IT mess in the enterprise world has to be maintained and further
               developed according to the dictates of the business, often over decades rather than
               years. This can result in spectacularly complex mélanges of workarounds and patches -
               a situation that even the most rigorous methods and large teams of people can only
                  <soCalled>manage</soCalled>, never tame. Much of the over-engineering (in both
               technology and culture) is due to this fact rather than an innate desire on the part
               of the workers to function in that way. Experience has shown that unless rigorous
               development and operational methods are applied to building and maintaining
               enterprise software systems, life can get messy. Hence the dictum that <q>no-one ever got fired for buying IBM</q>: Chief Information
               Officers are quite happy to pay extra for the insurance of a trusted brand. </p>
            <p>Two points bear comment here. Firstly, digital humanists might not only be the
               advance guard of a movement of the humanities into the digital world. They might also
               be, in effect if not intent, narrowing the gap between the commercial and scholarly
               worlds. For the first time since World War Two, a significant humanist movement has
               appeared that engages directly with methods and attitudes commonly held in the
               commercial and governmental worlds. Far from being a flight into cyberspace, the
               digital humanities might represent an emergent movement out of the ivory tower and
               back to an engagement with the <soCalled>real world</soCalled>. If this is the case,
               humanists might want to be concerned. Even if the intent isn’t there, the need to
               control increasingly complex technologies demands a degree of rationalization and
               control that runs counter to a great deal of our tradition. Secondly, if such a shift
               is occurring, it provides us with a potentially fruitful area of research. Mathew
               Kirschenbaum urges us to consider the entanglement of the digital humanities in the
               material systems we use <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2007"/>; there is equal reason to
               explore the entanglement of those material systems with the discourse and
               methodologies of the corporate and governmental worlds. It may not be a subject to
               everyone’s taste, but it offers historical grounding and solid intellectual leverage.
               We need only go so far as the role of DARPA in the birth of the internet, or worse,
               the role of IBM Hollerith machines in the holocaust,<ptr target="#black2001"/> to
               find evocative examples of our debt to dubious aspects of technological history.
               These are morally complex and decidedly humanistic topics, and as such they could
               become central to our discipline.</p>
            <p>The entanglement of the digital humanities with the commercial and governmental
               worlds symbolised by DARPA and IBM is connected to the fact that digital systems (at
               both a hardware and software level) are engineered. And as Thomas Hughes points out,
               engineered systems are the products of highly complex social, cultural and political
               processes: they are embedded in the fabric of history.<ptr target="#hughes2004"/>
               Rosalind Williams likens their architecture to the layers in the Wachowski brothers’
               film <title rend="italic">The Matrix: Reloaded</title> (2003): as you descend to
               deeper levels, more is revealed, but it is only at the deepest engineering level that
               the truth really comes out.<ptr target="#williams2007"/> Similarly, while robust and
               satisfying exploration is possible at the uppermost levels (in the context of the
               digital humanities, perhaps <soCalled>merely</soCalled> analyzing textual content
               presented on the screen), a journey to deeper levels presents a more intellectually
               rounded experience. The question for the digital humanities is what role these
               broader cultural and historical contexts should play in the development of the
               discipline. My feeling is that the digital humanities are about more than code and
               applications, and that students should learn about the culture and history of the
               tools they use as well. A slightly stronger position might suggest that digital
               humanists, because of their understanding of computing and digital culture, have a
               responsibility to pose these kinds of questions. </p>
            <p>The question, then, is just what kinds of analysis digital humanists will bring to
               the broader humanist culture. One thing seems certain enough: while there are a few
               groups doing things on the fringes, <note> For example <ref target="http://www.vectorsjournal.org">http://www.vectorsjournal.org</ref>.
               </note> the community doesn’t seem particularly interested in theoretical complexity
               or grand narratives. Most practitioners seem to be quite practical people who
               experience daily the laudatory effect of things breaking when they don’t design them
               correctly or drop a semi-colon. It’s unlikely that people like that are going to
               stand up and proclaim victory or special insight, because they harbor a sinking
               feeling that the code could break, a bug could be introduced. They might even have to
               reinstall the operating system and start again. It’s not the kind of job that’s
               conducive to proclamations of universal truth. What it is conducive to, however, is a
               sense of responsibility when it comes to questions of technology. Digital humanists
               understand technology, and coupled with their background in the humanist tradition,
               are extremely useful as analysts of our technology-obsessed age. Limited theorizing
               (a little is always healthy), practical daily experience with the subject-matter, the
               context offered by 2000+ years of history and culture. What more could be asked for?
               The enterprise world is certainly crying out for it. <ptr target="#times2011"/> While
               the humanist tradition has (almost) always eschewed riches in favor of a commitment
               to art and culture, we should remember that people are getting paid very good money
               to provide technical analysis to corporations and government agencies around the
               world. Demand is high for people who combine solid technical understanding with the
               ability to write cogent, focused, easily-digestible prose. Computer Science degrees
               have to pack so much into them that these skills often can’t be taught, and many of
               the students might not be particularly interested anyway. This wasn’t a problem when
               IT products were less embedded into businesses’ core operations, but those days are
               long gone. Today, businesses need people who can answer those curly questions <q>What
                  will happen if I deploy this $3 million piece of kit into this particular human
                  environment? What impact will it have? What will I need to do to decrease any
                  financial, legal or cultural exposure? How can we design the technology to
                  minimize these risks?</q> The answer is often <q>hire a consultant</q>, but I see
               no reason why it can’t be <q>read an article by this digital humanist I heard of</q>
               or <q>hire one of those smart graduates from XYZ University</q>. It might take a
               while, but one day digital humanists’ environments may well become complex enough
               that we’ll have to devise new methodologies to make sense of that complexity, and
               that could make our students sought-after in the job market. </p>
            <p>This has been the case, broadly, in enterprise IT. Going by anecdotes from colleagues
               (men as well as women) who have been coding since the 1980s, the transition from
               mainframe computing to networked PCs during the early 1990s introduced a degree of
               human complexity that demanded a fundamental change in thinking. The movement away
               from mainframes not only decentralized computing power to the desktop, it also
               embedded computer systems within complex human-driven organizations, destabilizing
               the safe mainframe model and requiring a fundamental shift from <soCalled>computer
                  design</soCalled> to <soCalled>solution design</soCalled>. By the late 1980s the
               complexity of distributed IT systems were beginning to engender new ways of thinking
               about how to design robust distributed computing systems, to the point where
               engineers were being forced to think on a continental and even inter-continental
               scale. The end result was a (still relatively new) discipline known as Enterprise
               Architecture. Part of my purpose in this editorial is to introduce this methodology
               to the digital humanities community in the hope it will seed new shoots of thought.
               I’m not sure how much of the practice will be taken up, but it might at least prompt
               some thoughts about the scale we limit ourselves to.</p>
            <p>Unlike solution architecture, then, which concerns itself with the functional and
               non-functional specifics of a single system like a mainframe <note>Codebase, data
                  models, messaging structure, concurrency, availability and so on. </note> and is
               therefore intuitively understood by anyone who has spent time building software or
               web applications, enterprise architecture presents a holistic view of <emph>many
                  related systems</emph> and exists to ensure those related systems are at once
               compatible, extensible, and maintainable. Unlike solution architecture, which
               functions at the level of components and code, enterprise architecture functions at
               the level of standards definition, process and (importantly) purpose. It exists to
               ensure solution designers have enough knowledge about the broader technical ecology
               to design systems that are not only fit for purpose, but likely to function in an
               optimal manner both in their immediate deployment context and into the future. </p>
            <p>Significantly, because of the vast scale and corresponding degrees of complexity that
               enterprise architects work with, this is the point at which the known hits the
               unknown, leading their methodologies to take on some of the characteristics of the
               humanities themselves. It is a level of abstraction that should come naturally to
               most humanists, trained as we are in large-scale thinking. Just as it isn’t possible
               to unravel the complexities surrounding the origins of World War One into a neat
               formula, so it isn’t possible to reduce a description of a national health system to
               a tidy technical diagram that only includes discreet physical models. Logical models
               must also be used, and these need to be aligned to political purpose or
               organizational intent. At an enterprise level, technological systems function within
               a human environment that reaches beyond the archetypal <soCalled>end user</soCalled>
               and into the cultural and political spheres. Decisions about fitness for purpose are
               not only made through reference to basic technical architecture, but also more subtle
               issues like risk appetite, strategic direction, and relationships to desired or
               redundant capabilities. And hot topics include not only domain-specific issues like
               these, but general problems like the movement towards the cloud, adoption of open
               access models, social computing, mobile computing, security, and the implications of
               open data and the semantic web. While the practice is almost antithetical to the
               digital humanities’ focus on do-it-yourself, organic growth and a decentralized
               ‘networked’ structure, <ptr target="#scheinfeldt2010"/> its ability to make sense of
               highly complex, heterogonous IT environments suggests it might offer perspectives we
               can use. The key here is that, unlike some of the more business and
               efficiency-oriented enterprise methodologies, enterprise architecture aims to provide
               a view of technological systems that assists with technical, commercial
                  <emph>and</emph> human decision-making. It is the most
                  <soCalled>intellectual</soCalled> of any of the IT disciplines (a fact which is
               often noted with disdain by solution architects, analysts, coders and testers faced
               with coal-face technical realities). In short, it grapples with large issues, and
               that sits quite well with a humanist sensibility. Indeed, and perhaps at the risk of
               stretching a point too far, if the technical nature of the digital humanities has
               signaled a rupture between the old and the new, (elements of) enterprise architecture
               might allow the closing of the circle.</p>
            <p>John Zachman is widely considered to be the father of systems architecture. His paper
                  <title rend="quotes">A Framework for Information Systems Architecture</title>
               appeared in <title rend="italic">IBM Systems Journal</title> in 1987, in the context
               of an exponential rise in the scale and complexity of information systems, prompted
               in large part by the movement from centralized mainframes with dumb clients to the
               vast networks of individual machines I mentioned earlier. As he put it:</p>
            <cit>
               <quote rend="block" source="#zachman1987">... since the technology permits
                     <soCalled>distributing</soCalled> large amounts of computing facilities in
                  small packages to remote locations, some kind of structure (or architecture) is
                  imperative because decentralization without structure is chaos. Therefore, to keep
                  the business from disintegrating, the concept of information systems architecture
                  is becoming less an option and more a necessity for establishing some order and
                  control in the investment of information systems resources. The cost involved and
                  the success of the business depending increasingly on its information systems
                  require a disciplined approach to the management of those systems.</quote>
               <ptr target="#zachman1987" loc="276"/>
            </cit>
            <p>System architecture, as my more experienced colleagues suggested, grew out of a need
               to manage the explosion in complexity attendant upon the movement towards the
               personal computers that dot our homes and workplaces today. At the true enterprise
               scale, of course, we are not only talking about swarms of networked PCs, but vast
               industrial computing systems that might process billions of transactions a minute and
               be composed of hundreds of separate sub-systems. While my own discipline of History
               always makes even the most complex computing systems seem manageable, there can be no
               doubt that at the macro level – where the systems touch human social, cultural and
               political structures – there is a need for methodological rigor.</p>
            <p>Zachman spent a great deal of his article describing in detail how architects go
               about designing buildings, and the different views that are required in order for the
               architect, owner, contractor and sub-contractors to work together to a common goal,
               even when the task might be so complex that none of the people involved have a full
               understanding of what the others are doing. Extrapolating this to software
               engineering, Zachman proposed a framework that, if completed, would offer a complete,
               holistic view of any complex software system from the perspective of managers,
               analysts, architects, testers and developers. As long as the framework was complete,
               the business could be confident that the project would be a success, even if some
               teams were never fully aware how their piece fitted into the larger picture.</p>

            <p>In reality, and although still used today, few organizations have the resources or
               the will to design and document a system with the three dimensional rigor demanded by
               Zachman’s framework. It fitted well with the period in the history of computing from
               the late 1980s to the 1990s when the IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP) and waterfall
               software development processes held sway, and where complexity was controlled by
               large teams, hierarchical management and strict division of labor: Fordism (with a
               strong element of Taylorism) applied to software development.<note>Note that RUP is
                  still widely used; it merely competes with a plethora of other approaches.</note>
               While Zachman’s framework remains useful to any enterprise development project there
               has been a change in approach over the last decade to a more flexible focus on
               process and standards definition, business modeling, and strategic requirements
               analysis. More than being a rejection of Zachman’s methods, the various new
               approaches reflect an increasing demarcation between solution (or perhaps
                  <soCalled>technical</soCalled>) architecture and enterprise (or, perhaps
                  <soCalled>organizational</soCalled>) architecture.</p>
            <p>As with software development methodologies, there are several different enterprise
               architecture frameworks available, but the most widely accepted approach is that
               offered by The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). TOGAF was released in 1995,
               and was based on the <title rend="quotes">Technical Architecture Framework for
                  Information Management</title> (TAFIM) developed by the US Department of Defense
               (DoD). The method aims to provide structure and process to the development and
               maintenance of large, highly complex information systems. The Group describes the
               framework as a <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#TOGAF2006">detailed method and a set of supporting tools -
                  for developing an enterprise architecture</quote><ptr target="#TOGAF2006"/></cit>. It
               is free to use by any organization wanting to develop an enterprise architecture, and
               is run on a commercial open source basis, charging for publications and
               certification. Simply put, TOGAF provides a set of seven guidelines, models and
               procedures for developing an enterprise architecture that will help ensure the smooth
               functioning and interoperability of heterogeneous systems. Unlike the Zachman
               framework, which focuses on creating a complete set of plans for the development of
               homogeneous systems, TOGAF assumes a splintered, heterogeneous environment composed
               of many different systems, standards and methodologies. It is particularly focused on
               the development of capability models, frameworks and standards that will foster reuse
               and the successful implementation of open architectures, to assist with
               interoperability in complex environments and ensure organizations aren’t locked into
               proprietary systems or constrained by single-vendor models. The opening pages of the
               framework point out that the approach is designed to be used either in whole or in
               part depending on the maturity of the organization in question and the task at hand;
               it offers a set of conceptual <soCalled>components</soCalled> as much as an
               end-to-end process: <cit>
                  <quote rend="block" source="#TOGAF2006">The intention of dividing the TOGAF specification into these
                     independent parts is to allow for different areas of specialization to be
                     considered in detail and potentially addressed in isolation. Although all parts
                     work together as a whole, it is also feasible to select particular parts for
                     adoption whilst excluding others.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#TOGAF2006"/>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p>TOGAF focuses on the development of an enterprise architecture function within an
               organization, and the development of that function over time by implementing
               architecture repositories and fostering EA as a specialization for suitable staff
               members. In practical terms, therefore, all that is required to start using TOGAF is
               for projects to refer to the framework, and develop and store enterprise architecture
               artifacts (such as their capability model, their development process, their
               governance model, their technology stack) in a repository for future reference. </p>
            <p>The development of enterprise architecture methods in the digital humanities
               community may take some time, but it might produce benefits in terms of consistency
               of approach and therefore potential future extensibility. It would also offer softer
               benefits associated with the development of a new specialization within the community
               and recognition of the benefits of specialization generally. Aside from developing a
               healthy <soCalled>ecosystem</soCalled>, and the obvious financial benefits associated
               with the use of Enterprise Architecture (lower software development, implementation
               and maintenance costs, increased portability of applications, reduced complexity,
               reduced risk, increased financial transparency), there are three other compelling
               reasons for developing the specialization within the digital humanities:
               interoperability, critical analysis and political transparency.</p>
            <p>The benefits of developing interoperable systems seem almost too obvious to mention,
               and to a large degree interoperability is enabled by the technological choices we
               have in front of us when creating new information systems (in a lot of cases it
               doesn’t really matter whether a project decides to use Apache Tomcat, Zend or
               Glassfish on their web server, or Windows or Linux for their OS), but as the digital
               humanities scale to a global level and implement more sophisticated layers for data
               analysis and messaging this will become more important. This isn’t to suggest that we
               are inevitably moving towards a situation where major digital humanities projects
               developed in isolation aren’t going to be able to talk to each other, but it does
               mean that people developing those systems might be working without a full toolset, or
               might encounter integration issues down the track. At the very least I imagine it
               would be reassuring for solution designers of major digital humanities projects to be
               able to consult an enterprise repository to gain an insight into how similar projects
               approached similar design issues. In some cases I expect they would find work that
               has already been done for them, or perhaps a more elegant solution to a particular
               problem. A related benefit to interoperability, then, is reusability: a good
               enterprise repository should offer patterns that can be reworked and reused,
               resulting in turn in further enhancements in interoperability. The aim is to
               implement not only enterprise architecture, but a virtuous cycle of sharing,
               interoperability and integration.</p>
            <p> At the same token, of course, the development of enterprise architecture for the
               digital humanities would foster analysis of the field at a <soCalled>meta</soCalled>
               level that is necessary if the field is to gain respect among more traditional
               disciplines. At the moment it is difficult to present a critical analysis of the
               digital humanities, because we aren’t sure just what the digital humanities are.
               Indeed, the last year or two have been characterized in part by a flurry of activity
               focused on deciding just what the discipline is, with some progress but little
               agreement. <note>

               </note> This lack of definition can be contrasted with my own discipline of History,
               where historiography, historical philosophy and method are sub-disciplines in their
               own right and have their own established journals. Centuries of scholarly research
               and debate informs historical practice. Attempts by digital humanists to define the
               discipline and prompt debate implicitly recognize this: an academic discipline
               without a tradition of self-analysis will never enter the scholarly mainstream. By
               working towards transparency, by defining the terrain, by questioning the
               relationships between the technology we use and the purposes it was designed to
               fulfill, enterprise architecture could well help us mature intellectually as well as
               technologically.</p>
            <p> One of the key questions that this level of transparency and attendant perspicacity
               would raise relates to political transparency. The discipline is clearly driven in
               large part, for instance, by social networks like Twitter that are first and foremost
               commercial concerns. How deep is this relationship? Would it change if an open source
               alternative became available? Conversely, what are the implications of gating
               university resources like JSTOR, and do digital humanists have a role to play in
               opening them up? If we have a choice, do we choose proprietary or open source
               products? To what degree are those choices dictated by university IT departments
               already heavily invested in certain technologies and unwilling or unable to change?
               The development of enterprise architecture would lead digital humanists down a path
               strewn with interesting questions, and in doing so offer a level of maturity the
               discipline has to strive towards if it is to be taken seriously.</p>
            <p>In order to indicate what an artifact in a digital humanities enterprise architecture
               repository might look like, I’ve produced a tentative capabilities model. TOGAF
               recommends the development of models to map relationships between objects, processes
               and standards, and define the limits of the knowledge domain. An important point to
               recognize is that enterprise artifacts are never complete. The aim is not to create a
               finite body of knowledge, but begin a process of discovery that will enable more
               sophisticated levels of engagement and analysis in the future. The approach should be
               second-nature to humanists. I hope the model shows how useful (if not revelatory and
               certainly not unarguable) enterprise architecture methods can be. The main point to
               be gleaned from the capability model below is that the digital humanities function
               mainly within the upper tiers of the model: the Tools &amp; Application, Content, and
               Theory / Method layers. This is understandable given the digital humanities are by
               nature content-oriented; the development of content is supported by a set of tools
               and applications, and methodologies which guide practice. While many areas of the
               model are either poorly defined or simply unexplored, there are clear indications
               that they will be ‘filled in’ as the discipline matures.</p>

               <head>Theory / Method</head>
               <p>This layer is self-explanatory, except insofar as it is anchored in the humanities
                  proper, rather than information technology. Two representative texts are perhaps
                  Dan Cohen and Roy Rosenweig's <title rend="italic">Digital History: A Guide to
                     Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web</title>
                  <ptr target="#cohen2005"/> and Matthew Kirschenbaum's <title rend="italic">Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</title>
                  <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2007"/>. Both texts are firmly grounded in the analog
                  humanities, and are effectively attempts to graft the digital humanities onto the
                  main trunk of the tradition. Although a non-technical audience might find them
                  intimidating, to most digital humanists they represent readable and penetrative
                  overviews of the field. John Willinsky's book <title rend="italic">The Access
                     Principle</title>
                  <ptr target="#willinsky2006"/> also fits into this layer (as well as the <soCalled>Philosophy / Ideology</soCalled> layer – see below), as do the
                  essays on the Centre for History and New Media’s essay list.<note> See <ref target="http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/">http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/</ref>. </note>

                     Humanities Lab</ref> and machine-oriented sites like MIT’s <ref target="http://www.media.mit.edu/">Media Lab</ref>. Indeed, the last 5 years
                  have seen a marked increase in essays and websites that seek to define methods and

                  presented online, and that the internet offered a radical new channel for
                  humanities output. Similarly, the arrival of Wikipedia may have provoked
                  widespread panic about the quality of online content, but it is also the perfect
                  example of how content-centric the digital humanities are. Above anything else,
                  the new media requires content, just like the old media. This will only increase
                  as the publishing industry transition more of their assets into the online world,
                  new delivery platforms like the iPad proliferate, and universities come to realize
                  the cost-efficiencies implicit in the online content model. When blogs and social
                  media are included in the Content layer, it becomes clear that, for the digital
                  humanities as for the rest of the online world, <q>content is
                     king</q>. There is little reason to launch into an extended discussion of
                  this layer, because it is where most of us work on a daily basis.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Tools and Applications</head>
               <p>The Tools and Applications layer is another crowded space, but unlike the content
                  layer, it is of little interest to mainstream humanities scholars. This is the
                  layer where technical expertise takes over from content development, and in the
                  digital humanities this normally amounts to development effort that aims to
                  facilitate production and dissemination in the Content layer. It would be possible
                  to argue for a separate Tools layer at this point in the structure, but I'm
                  describing a single layer because tools and applications are bound by the Software
                  Development Life Cycle: they are developed in code and inevitably reference
                  each-other. For instance, at this layer we not only have operating systems like
                  Ubuntu, Snow Leopard and Windows, but tools like Zotero and Monk and web
                  applications like Omeka, not to mention the IDEs, code repositories and project
                  management tools used to build them. Note that at this tier we also have the
                  languages and frameworks used to write the applications: primarily .php and .css
                  but also perhaps application technology stacks like Zend or web development
                  frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Vaadin. Common content management systems like
                  Drupal, Joomla, Moodle and Wordpress would also fit into this layer, as do
                  developing web services like Google Maps and platforms like Hypercities. As the
                  digital humanities scale both vertically (in size) and horizontally (into the
                     <soCalled>web of things</soCalled>) we may find Java being used more,
                  and there is no reason to deny at least the possibility of DH-friendly languages
                  appearing in the future, like Cobol and Fortran in the maths and sciences. This is
                  a messy layer. It is essentially the engine-room of the digital humanities,
                  churning out products that enable the growth of the discipline beyond 'mere'
                  content creation. It actually needs a sub-model of its own. I suspect that most
                  digital humanists would argue that, for the moment at least, this is the most
                  crucial layer because this is the layer that will be filled completely by the
                  large corporations if the digital humanities fail to expand into mainstream
                  academia.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Middleware</head>
               <p>The Middleware layer could be the next area to be <soCalled>built out</soCalled>
                  by digital humanists. I note this possibility because middleware will presumably
                  provide a key layer in the growth of the semantic web and the web of things.
                  Significant projects like <ref target="http://sudamih.oucs.ox.ac.uk/">SUDAMIH</ref> are already underway, focusing on the development of
                  humanities-centric data management infrastructures. It could well be that the
                  engineering of this layer (and <soCalled>engineering</soCalled> is the defining
                  term to use for this layer, just as <soCalled>development</soCalled> is the
                  defining term for the layer above it) is left to commercial organizations who
                  provide <soCalled>plug-and-play</soCalled> middleware tools, but I suspect a lot
                  of work will be done by computer scientists working in tandem with humanists, as
                  with SUDAMIH and <ref target="http://projectbamboo.org/">Project Bamboo</ref>. It
                  isn't as though digital humanists are going to need specialist application servers
                  or other similar products, but there are fascinating questions around the
                  development of, say, an enterprise service bus (ESB) to facilitate data
                  interchange across connected humanities infrastructures. With that in place we
                  would presumably be one step close to a global Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
                  for the discipline. Whether this is possible or even desirable at an international
                  level is beyond me, and the term <soCalled>middleware</soCalled> does tend to
                  escape precise definition, but it surely raises some interesting questions.
                  Organizations like the <ref target="http://www.jisc.ac.uk">Joint Information
                     Systems Committee</ref> (JISC), <ref target="http://www.dariah.eu">Digital
                     Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities</ref> (DARIAH) and <ref target="http://www.arts-humanities.net/chain">Coalition of Humanities and Arts
                     Infrastructure Networks</ref> (CHAIN) are best positioned to investigate these
                  questions, in combination with projects like SUDAMIH that are developing both
                  systems and expertise. It will be interesting to see whether they view generic web
                  middleware as adequate, or whether we need to put some effort into ensuring that
                  the various international digital humanities systems can function at an
                  inter-connected, global level. From their websites it appears they see some room
                  for growth at this layer, even if it remains in fairly specialist, circumscribed
                  areas. Defining the standards for the semantic web is one thing; ensuring our
                  myriad legacy systems are interoperable is another thing altogether. The
                  determining factor in the development of this layer will be whether the digital
                  humanities' emerging Governance bodies (see below) decide that normalization is
                  required to enhance interoperability across disparate infrastructures, or whether
                  – as is perhaps more likely – a more loosely federated model is required, with an
                  emphasis on clear articulation of standards and frameworks to prompt increasing
                  alignment over the long-term.</p>

               <head>Standards</head>
               <p>Our large public sector libraries have traditionally provided the most in terms of
                  standards, stemming from their centuries old investment in classification and
                  metadata, and their now decades-old move into the digital world. Like Governance,
                  the Standards layer provides a crucial vertical structure to support the core
                  Infrastructure, Middleware, Tools &amp; Applications and Content layers. I have no
                  empirical evidence, but my feeling is that Europe-based digital humanists seem
                  more focused on this layer than US-based practitioners who tend to produce
                  applications and content, and engage with social media, undoubtedly due to funding
                  priorities. It's interesting to note that Project Bamboo have discussed not being
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#bamboo2008">involved in creating standards, but rather in helping
                     creators express their work</quote>. Their notes point out the risk of <quote rend="inline" source="#bamboo2008">too much normalization</quote> and <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#bamboo2008">obstructing standards development</quote>
                  <ptr target="#bamboo2008"/></cit>. This is understandable, especially in terms of TCP/IP
                  protocols that can be left up to network specialists (and could be viewed as being
                  part of the Middleware layer), but as I've noted above, digital humanists need to
                  remain aware of the issues and perhaps identify areas where we can contribute in
                  an efficient, focused manner. Following their discussion, Project Bamboo decided

               <head>Governance</head>
               <p>The digital humanities have no over-arching governance framework, which perhaps
                  accounts for the slight lack of clarity amongst the discussants on Standards at
                  Project Bamboo, who seemed to place TCP/IP middleware protocols in the same bucket
                  as metadata standards, before discarding them again. Like Standards, the
                  Governance layer provides a critical vertical structure to support the proper
                  functioning of the core Infrastructure, Middleware, Tools &amp; Applications and
                  Content layers. This layer has only very recently started to be built out.

                  future governance models: we are at the stage of initial analysis and exploration.
                  Bodies such as DARIAH, CHAIN, JISC and Project Bamboo clearly have an important
                  role to play in this layer too. The appearance of publications exploring the
                  field, and the growth of organizations focused on governance and the facilitation
                  of global interoperability is heartening. It suggests that the last layer in an
                  enterprise model is beginning to be filled out and promises the level of
                  co-ordination – or at least communication – necessary to the health of the broader
                  system. Governance of the digital humanities is a thorny issue, however. It will
                  not, and should not, be akin to the governance of an enterprise IT system: the
                  field is too broad, the parties too disparate in their priorities, and the
                  participants have a healthy disregard for processes and frameworks derived from
                  the government and business worlds. Standard enterprise governance frameworks like
                  ITIL and TOGAF are useful, but were designed for fundamentally different purposes
                  than those of the digital humanities. At a philosophical level there will
                  undoubtedly also be concerns about the intellectual lineage of such frameworks,
                  based as they are on Tayloresque efficiency-maximising systems that are anathema
                  to much of what the traditional humanities represent. But herein lies the problem:
                  the digital humanities are fundamentally tied to the systems that enable the
                  practice itself, and as the discipline grows so too will the complexities
                  involved. It makes sense to pick models that have worked for other undertakings
                  involving complex IT systems and apply them, critically, to our own. Perspectives
                  like this should remind us that the health (and therefore viability) of the system
                  as a whole relies on a balance between its component parts: the enterprise view
                  isn't so much a normative view, as a guiding process. When a model loses its
                  utility it should be discarded.</p>

               <head>Infrastructure</head>
               <p>The infrastructure layer appears to hold the least interest for digital humanists,
                  dealing as it does with the plumbing of the web, but it should not remain as
                  neglected as it has been. Viewed from one perspective (the one typically found in
                  the communications rooms of enterprise-scale IT departments), it isn't Microsoft,
                  Apple or IBM that rule the IT world, after all, but companies like CISCO who
                  provide the routers, switches and network infrastructure. In the future it may
                  well involve companies who offer cloud platforms like Amazon AWS and Rackspace,
                  both of whom are developing services of immense interest to digital humanists: on
                  the one hand it appears it’s becoming possible to outsource the IT department, on
                  the other there are warnings from experts of the pitfalls of cloud services and
                  the need for caution. Who is looking out for and providing advice to digital
                  humanists on these topics? </p>
               <p>This opaque world is understood completely by a relatively small number of
                  specialists, but some things are clear enough: it is at this level that real
                  control of the WWW resides, at the level of routing and packet switching. Indeed,
                  this layer is so opaque that its main interest for digital humanists may well be
                  the point where the discipline intersects with philosophy. (As Matthew
                  Kirschenbaum has shown, there are equally beguiling problems to be found at the
                  level of logic gates, hard-drives and the machine code that runs atop them.) The
                  infrastructure layer includes a myriad of hardware and infrastructure: M9000 and
                  P7 servers, blade racks and SATA drives, not to mention supercomputing facilities
                  that measure performance in petaflops. Operating Systems could also be positioned
                  in this layer, but note that these will often be IBM AIX systems, or other
                  Unix-based ones like Ubuntu Linux, BSD, Solaris or Red Hat. They will not be made
                  by Apple and may not necessarily be made by Microsoft. Whether this matters to
                  digital humanists is moot in practical terms because they typically purchase
                  services from either university or commercial providers and only ask that those
                  services remain functional; as a discipline we are as much infrastructure agnostic
                  as infrastructure ignorant. In political terms, though, digital humanists should
                  surely be interested in the development of a safe and competitive ecosystem at
                  this level as much as they are at the application level, with a healthy degree of
                  variety and an emphasis on security. Perhaps of more topical concern at this layer
                  are the questions of data centers and virtualization: on the one hand we have
                  giant data centers being built by the likes of Google and Facebook, who are both
                  amassing an unparalleled degree of control over our personal data, and on the
                  other we have widespread moves towards virtualization which looks likely to take
                  us back to the days of thin clients and mainframes. The world's IT infrastructure
                  is moving full circle back to the days where HAL9000 was conceived: massive,
                  centralized computing centers accessed only by a monitor and keyboard. In our
                  case, instead of time-sharing on a single operating system we may well be served
                  our own copy of Windows, Apple or Ubuntu. The trend seems both economically and
                  environmentally sound, but there is ample fodder for the novelists among us. The
                  days of the Homebrew Computer Club, and the absolute level of control those days
                  offered us, is coming to an end.</p>

               <head>Philosophy / Ideology</head>
               <p>In terms of an enterprise model of the digital humanities, the weakest point could
                  well be that of Philosophy. It is because of that that I've bracketed it here with
                  Ideology, because it is my assertion that in the absence of a robust philosophical
                  approach to the digital humanities we will only have ideology, which is not a
                  pleasing prospect in the context of IT. Some of the potential topics for a
                  philosophy of the digital humanities were touched on in my introduction to
                  enterprise architecture and my discussion of the infrastructure layer, but there
                  are many more topics that require investigation. Open Access and academia is one
                  obvious area for further investigation. As I suggested above, I strongly support
                  the open access and open source movements and believe the digital humanities
                  should align to them. I also intuitively believe that the humanist tradition has a
                  natural affinity towards them, but is this the case when it comes to
                  university-based humanists? Academia has long been a bedfellow of the commercial
                  publishing world, and is closely allied to both government and private industry.
                  John Willinsky has given us good reason to accept the alignment between the
                  academy and open access as a natural one, but all of us know academics who would
                  vigorously disagree with him. Open source and open access principles are as likely
                  to be championed and practiced by a computer science student or employee of a
                  commercial IT company as an academic humanist schooled in the philosophies of John
                  Stuart Mill. What does this say about the state of not only the digital
                  humanities, but university-based humanities generally, and how would we gather
                  evidence to test the assertion? Do we need a renewed commitment to open access and
                  open source principles? Are we focusing enough on consciousness raising across the
                  academy? Are universities so dependent on a commercial business model that we
                  can’t go open access without undermining the entire enterprise? Cultural and media
                  studies have a lot to offer here, as do literary critics with a focus on
                  technology and ideas.</p>
               <p>Another interesting question is perhaps the history of ideas that binds classical
                  logic with the logic of information systems, and the history of mathematics that
                  details the development of algorithms and the methods used in object oriented
                  programming. The history of technology and the humanities computing tradition have
                  a lot to offer in this layer, putting the discipline into its proper context and
                  reminding us of the engineered nature of not only the hardware, but the software
                  that runs on it. Without this kind of research, digital humanists are apt to
                  forget, or fail to adequately understand, the implications of working with two
                  state machines. The issue runs deeper than the relationship between hardware logic
                  gates and binary code: it bears upon a philosophical domain that sits somewhere
                  between machine-level logic and frontier-issues like cybernetics and artificial
                  intelligence. To locate this domain, we need to imagine a ‘continuum of
                  understanding’ that takes us from two state machines, to the application of
                  discrete mathematics and predicate logic to those machines in order to build
                  creative work environments. This much is clear enough, but our understanding is
                  severed here: as soon as we are presented with our creative environments we ignore
                  the prior continuum and work as though our tool was as natural as parchment and
                  pen. The continuum is then re-entered and we readily move to questions of
                  cybernetics and artificial intelligence, quite forgetting that there is a huge gap
                  in our humanist understanding of computers and the digital world at that earlier
                  and far more fundamental interface between two-state logic and human creativity.
                  Something seems to have been missed here. This is the precise point, after all, at
                  which the (classically derived) logic that powers our machines enables the
                  (classically derived) humanist logic that powers all that we create on them. It
                  is, in sum, the event horizon of the digital humanities.</p>

               <head>Conclusion</head>
               <p>A capabilities model such as that sketched here represents the <soCalled>view from
                     40,000 feet</soCalled>. By its very nature it is both general and liable to
                  adaption and change. It is also, however, one of the tried and tested means by
                  which large, complex information systems are conceptualized, governed and improved
                  through enterprise architecture. As the digital humanities grow, it is no longer
                  going to be enough to focus on code and content in the 'engine rooms' of the Tools
                  &amp; Applications and Content layers. There will be a need for some people to
                  adopt a high-level overview of the undertaking as a whole so that they can create
                  philosophies, practices and frameworks that will ensure the transparent
                  functioning of the whole. Because as much as humanists may baulk at a view of
                  their world that seems to imply a growing leviathan, it is surely better to learn
                  from the history of systems development and deploy (and adapt) methodologies that
                  will help us understand the boundaries of our subject area, produce maximally
                  efficient designs, and point us towards the more esoteric limits of our
                  discipline. </p>
