                  <p>In this article, we discuss the main challenges in finding and extracting translation
                     data from national library
                     catalogues and the literary press and propose solutions for researchers to access
                     and analyze bibliographic data
                     for translations. To illustrate these issues, we present two case studies: the first
                     being dedicated to translation
                     invisibility in the literary press, i.e., specialized and general literary journals
                     and magazines, discussing
                     overall trends in the Canadian literary press and giving specific examples from the
                     <span class="hi italic">Quill &amp;
                        Quire</span> and the <span class="hi italic">Montreal Review of Books</span>. The second deals with the institutional
                     practices of collecting and cataloguing translations according to metadata standards
                     at three national libraries:
                     the German National Library (DNB), the Austrian National Library (ÖNB), and the Bibliothèque
                     et Archive nationales
                     du Québec (BAnQ). By doing so, we problematize how the cataloguing, collecting, and
                     reviewing of translated
                     material can be viewed as a systemic issue, highlighting the parallels between these
                     different types of practices.
                     We hope to broaden the understanding of translation invisibility by looking at how
                     institutional, cultural, and
                     editorial practices inform the cataloguing, collecting, reviewing, and publishing
                     of translations.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Though translation scholars such as Diana Roig-Sanz and Laura Fólica have begun to
                     advocate for and categorize
                     research that applies computational methods to translation history<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e196">[1]</a>, a brief look at some important research
                     outlets illustrates that quantitative translation research occupies a marginal position
                     in the Digital Humanities
                     (DH). At the 2023 Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations conference, for instance,
                     a total of seven papers
                     and one panel on translation research are scattered in a programme of over 200 presentations<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e202">[2]</a>. At the 2023 Digital Humanities Summer Institute, no workshop or talk on translations
                     was
                     offered<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e208">[3]</a>. This sparsity of quantitative
                     translation research can also be observed in DH scholarly publications. In <span class="hi italic">DH Quarterly</span>, one
                     of the central outlets for DH research, we could find only a single title <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="palladino_etal2021">palladino_etal2021</a></span>
                     that explicitly mentions translations or their data in the last five years. The same
                     is true for the <span class="hi italic">International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing</span> <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="ngueum_etal2022">ngueum_etal2022</a></span>. <span class="hi italic">Current Research in Digital History</span> as well as <a href="https://www.digitalstudies.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.digitalstudies.org/'); return false" class="ref"><span class="hi italic">Digital Studies / Le champ numérique</span></a> do not have any articles on translation from the
                     last five years. The one exception seems to be <span class="hi italic">Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</span>: a
                     search for the keywords “corpus-based translation studies” reveals 582 articles, while
                     “quantitative translation”
                     reveals 377. The majority of these results, however, pertain to machine translation,
                     which shows how challenging it
                     can be to find and identify research that applies quantitative methods in literary
                     translation studies.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">While a comprehensive review of the state of quantitative translation studies in DH
                     beyond these few exemplary
                     environments is certainly required, this quick overview nevertheless illustrates an
                     absence of translation data and
                     its analysis in DH, which, as we argue in this article, goes hand in hand with the
                     invisibility of translation
                     itself. On the one hand, the phenomenon has been extensively discussed by translation
                     scholars<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e243">[4]</a>, though this has mostly resulted in a textual conceptualization of the translator’s
                     invisibility

                     has been only marginally addressed in terms of the challenges posed by bibliography-based
                     quantitative translation
                     studies <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="seeRoig-SanzandF%C3%B3lica2021;ZhouandSun2017;Pickford2016;Smith-Yoshimura2017">seeRoig-SanzandFólica2021;ZhouandSun2017;Pickford2016;Smith-Yoshimura2017</a></span>. This paper is dedicated to this very issue and aims at broadening our
                     understanding of the invisibility of translations by looking at the institutional,
                     cultural, and editorial
                     practices involved in the cataloguing, collecting, reviewing, and publishing of translations.
                     These problems go
                     beyond a textual understanding of translation invisibility toward a data-driven one.
                     Some of these issues, such as
                     the relative availability but dispersion of historical translation data (Belle 2023,
                     798–799) and the limitations
                     of DH methods with regard to translations (Wakabayashi 2019, 141–143), have already
                     been discussed. In contrast, we
                     argue that this aspect, that is, the invisibility of translations in the literary
                     press, academic journals,
                     national library collections, and web archives, speaks to overarching institutional,
                     cultural, and editorial
                     practices.These facts thus challenge DH to rethink some of its tools in the light
                     of the specific characteristics
                     of translations.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Translation invisibility occurs at various levels in the publication process. For
                     example, a translator’s name is
                     unlikely to be found on the cover of their work. In Canada, where such translation
                     credit is legally required, over
                     35% of translators still struggle to have their name printed on the front page of
                     their publications (Whitfield
                     2013, 218 and 225). On a larger scale, translations are often ignored by literary
                     reviewers. Recent studies on
                     translation reviews in publications like <span class="hi italic">The New York Review of Books</span> (USA), <span class="hi italic">The London Review of Books </span>(UK), <span class="hi italic">The Times Literary Supplement </span>(UK), <span class="hi italic">Le Monde des livres</span> (France), and <span class="hi italic">Domenica</span> (Italy) <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="seeMonti2013and2016;Wardle2020">seeMonti2013and2016;Wardle2020</a></span> reveal that translation researchers do not even bother quantifying translation
                     credit because it occurs so infrequently. According to the translation database established
                     by Chad Post for <span class="hi italic">Three Percent</span>, translations represent approximately 1% of the book market in the United States
                     (cited by Monti 2016, 123–124).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Ironically, what initially prompted the development of the <span class="hi italic">Three Percent</span> translation
                     database was the lack of statistics on translations in the book market. Book publishing
                     reports only marginally
                     include records on translations. For instance, the Federation of European Publishers’
                     annual report for 2023 does
                     not include any mention of translations. Though other organizations — such as Literature
                     Across Frontiers (LAF) —
                     have been reporting translation percentages in the book market <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="see%E2%80%9CPublishingTranslationsinEurope,%E2%80%9DB%C3%BCchler2011">see“PublishingTranslationsinEurope,”Büchler2011</a></span>, the most recent global picture of translation from 1990–2005 stresses the central
                     position of
                     Germany with 7.9% of all literature translations. However, no such reports have been
                     produced for 2022 or 2023, and
                     publishing data remain inaccessible<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e303">[5]</a>. Limited access to data
                     on translations and the book market, and statistics on fiction especially, thus contribute
                     to the marginalization
                     and invisibility of translation to readers, publishers, and researchers.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">From these examples, we see that while invisibility is indeed a hurdle for quantitative
                     studies of translation, it
                     is also revelatory, a finding in and of itself. The few existing translation metrics
                     can inform us about literary
                     flows between literary catalogues, or lack thereof, and about the agents involved
                     in constituting and reviewing
                     these objects. Additionally, the marginalization of translation in bibliographic data
                     is but one aspect of
                     invisibility, which can in turn reveal much about the different definitions given
                     to “translation” in each
                     source<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e308">[6]</a> and the motivations of
                     translational agents in the field, be they domestication (à la Venuti) or repertoire
                     broadening (according to the
                     logic of polysystem theory). Finally, DH demands that we document the practices (translation
                     invisibility being one
                     phenomenon) that condition how we work with various data sources. This allows us to
                     discuss the space translations
                     occupy in the literary field, and also how different agents (libraries, the press,
                     publishers) interact with that
                     space.</div>

                        Venuti’s well-known “regime of fluency” in English-language translations explores
                        Anglophone cultural preferences
                        for so-called domestication, that is the tendency to erase traces of cultural and
                        linguistic difference in
                        literary translations. Venuti’s findings have been echoed by other researchers, with
                        studies on translation
                        reviews confirming, for instance, that “fluid and idiomatic texts are [still] more
                        likely to be accepted without
                        resistance” (Monti 2016, 126–127, my translation). A more recent study of Goodreads
                        user attitudes with regard to
                        translation has shown that these preferences are also present among average readers
                        of English-language
                        translations, who often use “a trope of loss, mostly linked particularly to stylistic

                        sense of the word. In the
                        English-speaking world, these preferences have been integrated into periodical editing
                        practices. As early as
                        1982, translator and author Ronald Christ described how quick magazines were to cut
                        critiques of the translation
                        process from literary reviews (17). Indeed, according to his exchanges with various
                        editors, the consensus seems
                        to be that “[…] unless the translation is notably poor, […] it’s simply assumed that
                        the competent translator has

                        into the packaging of translated literature from the start. She has formulated the
                        concept of a “translation

                        contexts. Keeping this in mind,
                        we can begin to employ interpretative strategies to make this silence speak, and draw

                        and cultural trends
                        tending to render translations invisible. As noted above and by a number of translation

                        40 years at the head of <span class="hi italic">Translation Review</span>, Rainer Schulte continues to assert that “[t]he field of reviewing
                        translations is still in its infancy” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="2022">2022</a></span>. In addition to impacting readers’ perception
                        of translated literature, the invisibility of translations in these publications greatly
                        affects researchers’
                        capacity to study reviewing practices in context. Similarly to studies underpinned
                        by library collections as we
                        will see in the following section, existing studies of translations in the literary

                        scope<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e366">[8]</a>: corpora sizes are either determined by the translations identified by periodical
                        editors or by
                        researchers themselves, and longitudinal studies are difficult to execute. When dealing
                        with translated fiction
                        in periodicals, researchers are thus faced with a plethora of challenges: (re)translations
                        and translators can go
                        unmentioned; ephemeral publications and formats may not have been adequately preserved;

                        literature magazine <span class="hi italic">Lurelu</span>, on the other hand, uses the tag “T” to signal the presence of
                        a translator among a work’s contributors, allowing readers to identify translated
                        children’s books at a glance. A

                        to varying degrees of
                        exhaustivity. At one extreme, we have the <span class="hi italic">Montreal Review of Books </span>(<span class="hi italic">mRb</span>), where, with the exception of children’s literature<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e457">[10]</a>, all translators are credited. At the other end, we have publications like <span class="hi italic">Books in Canada</span>, in which no translator’s name is guaranteed a spot in review headers, and <span class="hi italic">Prairie Books NOW</span>, where books are systematically reviewed in their original language (French
                        or English). In the middle, we find most other periodicals (e.g., <span class="hi italic">The Malahat Review</span>, <span class="hi italic">The Fiddlehead</span>, <span class="hi italic">Canadian Literature</span>, and <span class="hi italic">Muskrat

                        and translation
                        visibility in the target publishing context (as in studies cited above). In terms
                        of reviewing standards,
                        however, the greatest challenge facing researchers working with reviews of translated
                        literature is how difficult
                        these sources are to identify on a mass scale. Most pre-existing catalogues of reviews,
                        such as the <span class="hi italic">Canadian Book Review Annual</span>, and digital periodical platforms (<span class="hi italic">Nuit
                           blanche</span> <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e491">[11]</a> being a good example) do not
                        allow one to filter by a translator’s name and fail to tag translations in any consistent
                        way, thus making
                        anything except semi-manual extraction impossible. In many ways, these review repositories
                        are structured in a
                        similar way to the online library catalogues that will be discussed in the next section.
                        Such catalogues have
                        been criticized since their conception in the mid-90s, for being “[...] arranged on
                        the assumption that searchers
                        arrive at the catalog knowing at least one of the three access points (author, title,
                        or subject)” (Borgman 1996,
                        495). Under these conditions, researchers seeking reviews of translations must proceed
                        via proxy: filtering for
                        known translations, translated authors, or translators; keyword searches for variations
                        of the verb “to
                        translate” or the nouns “translation” and “translator” in different languages; or
                        looking for mentions of foreign
                        languages. In all cases, exhaustive studies of these digital sources are impossible,
                        and translations published
                        by smaller presses, translated by lesser-known translators, or from marginalized languages
                        that have been more
                        thoroughly rendered invisible by the editing or review process are not likely to be

                        “invisibility” beyond the single axis of “translator invisibility.” While large corpora
                        of peritextual
                        information in review headers can indeed act as a proxy for translator and translation
                        visibility in the target
                        publishing context, we will also be looking at how qualitative analyses of individual
                        reviews showcase the
                        reviewing and crediting practices that work to foreground or background translation
                        in the literary press. As
                        Wakabayashi <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="2019">2019</a></span> underlines, quantitative DH methods allow “[...] greater focus on the ‘mundane’

                        institutional, cultural, and editorial trends from which a handful of exceptional

                        thus making it an ideal point from which to study the intersection of French- and
                        English-language writing in the
                        province. The study we describe here was founded on the digital version of the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span>
                        <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e551">[12]</a> and the digital archive of paper issues of the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> between 2000 and
                        2020<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e560">[13]</a>.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">Due to differences in reviewing standards at both these publications, our corpus assembly
                        varied from journal to
                        journal. While the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> meticulously includes the translator’s name below the author’s in
                        every review peritext, the translator is only sporadically included among the contributors
                        in <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q </span>reviews. The relative sizes of the journals also played a significant role in study
                        design: on the
                        one hand, with a total number of 1,700 reviews, the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> was well suited to semi-manual
                        corpus assembly; on the other, the 7,642 reviews published in the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span> were
                        automatically extracted using Web Scraper<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e581">[14]</a>. As summarized in figure 1, using the presence of
                        a translator in the review header as a proxy, this approach yielded two corpora: 255
                        translation reviews in the
                        <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> (15% of the total) and 127 translation reviews in the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span>
                        (1.6% of the total). Already, we see a large discrepancy in reviewing practices, leading
                        us to understand that
                        “translation invisibility” should be nuanced according to the degree of literary contact
                        taking place (here,
                        between Canadian, Québécois and Anglo-Québécois literature). Though it is impossible
                        to know how many
                        translations our scrape of the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span> missed without a manual verification, the disparity
                        in reviewing translations is immediately apparent (see figure 1): despite having nearly
                        four and half times as
                        many reviews as the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span>, the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span> seems to have reviewed (or at
                        least identified) only half as many translated books in the same twenty-year period.
                        In this case, we see that
                        the regional specificity of the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span>, which insists on Québec-published books regardless of
                        source language, leads to a greater consideration for translators and translations
                        in the periodical’s reviewing
                        and crediting standards than in those of the pan-Canadian, predominantly Anglophone
                        <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span>. Indeed, even if a greater number of translations was reviewed in the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span> between 2000 and 2020, their invisibility in the periodical is nevertheless revelatory
                        when placed
                        in relation to the credited translations in the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span>.</div>

                        reviewing practices with
                        regard to translation, there are also many similarities. In-text mentions of translation
                        and translators in <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> and <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q </span>reviews are quantitatively quite similar. For example,

                        translation in the body of
                        reviews (figure 2). Between 2000 and 2020, in the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span> and the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> alike, only one sentence out of each review is used to review the translator’s work
                        or to comment on
                        the quality of the translation process. A quantitative picture of the reviews reveals
                        that almost 40% of all

                        Translation remains a marginal question, with few words on these lists used to describe
                        the process — we should
                        note the presence of “French,” “English” (among the top 10 in both columns of figure
                        3), “translation,” and
                        “language,” but the absence of the word “translator”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1120">[15]</a> as well as any evaluative terms relating to this agent’s work. At first view, it
                        does
                        indeed appear as though both these periodicals treat translated literature nearly
                        identically. Figure 3 plausibly
                        suggests that the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> and the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span> have adopted similar

                     <div class="ptext" id="p23">Yet, what our synchronic, distant reading of these reviews and their peritextual information
                        in the respective
                        periodicals has not revealed are the micro-trends that demonstrate the many ways in
                        which translation
                        invisibility evolved between 2000 and 2020 and how it has been leveraged by editors
                        to suit other cultural or
                        literary agendas. In order to interpret these relatively “silent” corpora of translation
                        reviews and their
                        peritexts, we must pair our previous DH analysis with a diachronic, close reading
                        of the data revealed by these
                        preliminary quantitative analyses. A closer analysis of translation reviews in the
                        <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span>, for instance, revealed a series of outliers that showcase various editorial strategies
                        that have
                        contributed to increasing the visibility of translations<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1139">[16]</a>. We see, for
                        instance, that the presence of the translator’s name on the cover, a translator’s
                        note, or a glossary all
                        increase the chances of a thorough translation review <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="seeWells2009;Whiteman2014">seeWells2009;Whiteman2014</a></span>. This is the
                        case for works such as <span class="hi italic">One</span>, written by Serge Thibodeau and translated by Jo-Ann Elder,
                        which features the translator’s name and input prominently. The reviewer, Zachariah
                        Wells, dedicated over three
                        quarters (77%) of the review’s sentences to translation commentary and distinguishes
                        between the original ( <span class="hi italic">Seul on est</span>) and the translation, which he calls “Elder’s <span class="hi italic">One</span>” (2009,
                        parag. 4). In another notable case, half of the body of the review of <span class="hi italic">Sanaaq</span> by Mitiarjuk
                        Nappaaluk, translated from Inuktitut into French by Bernard Saladin d’Anglure and
                        from French into English by
                        Peter Frost, is used to discuss translation. While the review is not positive — “the
                        constant pain to which an
                        English reader is put to check the glossary for untranslated Inuktitut words becomes
                        tiresome” (Whiteman 2014,
                        parag. 3) — it quickly becomes clear that its author’s Inuit background is of great
                        interest when it comes to
                        translation. Reviewer Bruce Whiteman concludes that <span class="hi italic">Sanaaq</span> is “an important cultural and
                        literary document” (parag. 3) that can now be read by English-speaking readers.</div>

                        evolution in the types of translation commentary over time, with an increasing number
                        of reviews interested in

For example, while early reviews in the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> tended to focus
                        on how “[e]ach language has a unique syntactic style that defies perfect translation”
                        (Smith 2003, parag. 7),
                        later reviews praised the “creative” choices made by certain translators — “[Oana
                        Avasilichioaei’s] creative use
                        of the pronouns <span class="hi italic">s/he</span>, <span class="hi italic">hir</span>, <span class="hi italic">hirself</span>, <span class="hi italic">e</span>, <span class="hi italic">em</span>, and <span class="hi italic">eir</span> when representing Tiresias while
                        in a state of flux is especially inspired” (Garlick 2020, parag. 4). Additionally,
                        certain reviews of canonical
                        Québécois texts by figures like Dany Laferrière <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="Bourgeois2009">Bourgeois2009</a></span> and Kim Thúy <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="Moser2014">Moser2014</a></span> conduct interviews with the authors in English and strategically avoid identifying
                        these
                        works as translations. These choices contribute to the geographical specificity of
                        the Anglo-Québécois literary
                        repertoire represented in the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span> and illustrating how translation invisibility can be

                        examples above illustrate the importance of mixed methods for these readings: starting

                        distant readings, which tend to flatten differences between our sources and make invisibility

                        turning next toward diachronic, context-informed close readings of the results generated.
                        As demonstrated in the
                        case of the <span class="hi italic">Q&amp;Q</span> and the <span class="hi italic">mRb</span>, while distant reading methods
                        provide us with a general context for a larger corpus of translations and their reviews,
                        close readings reveal
                        evolutions in predominant conceptions and expectations of translated literature as
                        well as certain strategic
                        manipulations of literary repertoires by translators, editors, and reviewers alike.
                        As we will see in library
                        collections and catalogues, the invisibility of translations in the literary press
                        is incredibly multifaceted and
                        nuanced, demonstrating the contribution of large-scale corpus studies of these new
                        sources of information. These
                        newly available corpora of texts can now be studied on a great enough scale to make
                        their apparent silence speak
                        volumes, revealing patterns that could not be registered through older, traditionally
                        text-focused methods in

                        at work, library
                        cataloguing is still a black box, and practices can sometimes be revealed only by
                        close collaboration with the
                        librarians who create this metadata<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1241">[19]</a>. For
                        example, when approaching the DNB’s digital services (<span class="hi italic">Abteilung Digitale Dienste der Deutschen
                           Nationalbibliothek</span>) for curating a dataset of German fiction in translation <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="seeTeichmann2022">seeTeichmann2022</a></span>, we noted that it was possible to query the catalogue and filter the collection for
                        translations using the
                        language field contained in the metadata. What was less obvious, and what DNB librarians
                        confirmed, is that the
                        language field had only been in use for items catalogued since 1996, meaning that
                        the metadata from before that
                        date was still being updated. This shift highlights the fact that translation invisibility
                        is strongly tied to
                        cataloguing and collection practices<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1251">[20]</a>, not mention that
                        metadata standards that need to be contextualized and documented over time<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1253">[21]</a>.
                        We can think of the library as a living archive, where entries and their information
                        are added and redacted on a
                        running basis. Hence, it can be challenging to unravel on what basis translations
                        are catalogued, how they are
                        catalogued, and in what ways they can be extracted using a replicable method. This,
                        in turn, results in the
                        sparsity and rare utilization of library metadata for curating a translation dataset.</div>

                        Additionally, due to the
                        lack of a formalized method with respect to cataloguing practices and standards, it
                        remains difficult to access
                        and extract bibliographic data on translations from national collections. Diana Roig-Sanz
                        and Laura Folica (2021,
                        242) stress that libraries as sources for metadata remain largely unexploited, while
                        scholars like Susan Pickford
                        have repeatedly insisted on how incomplete existing databases such as the <span class="hi italic">Index
                           Translationum</span> or VIAF are for bibliographic translation data<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1261">[22]</a>. Bibliographic data<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1263">[23]</a> contain information on the author, publisher, language,
                        etc. of a given edition and are typically collected and maintained by libraries <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="seeUmerle_etal2022">seeUmerle_etal2022</a></span><a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1269">[24]</a>
                        according to strict metadata standards such as MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloguing
                        record)<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1277">[25]</a>, Dublin Core, or the
                        Library of Congress Classification. Translations bring with them specific characteristics
                        to bibliographic data,
                        one of them being that language has a rather high importance, and an imposed relationship
                        to an original edition
                        (which may or may not be documented). Additional creators of translated editions,
                        such as translators, original
                        publishers, etc., also need to be contained in the bibliographic data. All this information
                        indicates to the user
                        of the library catalogue whether the edition is a translation or not, a fact which
                        is not always apparent and
                        poses specific challenges for the extraction of bibliographic data. An additional
                        issue is that
                        translation-specific information may be in the metadata but not included in the online
                        catalogue, which further
                        marginalizes translations. Utilizing the library’s bibliographic translation data
                        therefore requires that the
                        data be available, accessible, and that cataloguing practices make it possible to
                        extract them.</div>

                        this can be very challenging:
                        the invisibility of translations in library catalogues results in a sparsity of translation
                        data, which

Projects that make use of bibliographic translation data are therefore
                        mainly case-study specific and limited to the translations of a single author, such
                        as the <span class="hi italic">Jane

                        language, such as Philipp Hofeneders work on visualizing translation spaces of 19th-century
                        Russia <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="Hofeneder2022">Hofeneder2022</a></span> or the project Intra-Belgian literary translations since 1970 (BELTRANS).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1297">[26]</a> While these studies do use bibliographic data and sometimes draw on library
                        collections for their datasets, they also all highlight the necessity for semi-manual
                        curation due to the
                        difficulties in identifying translations in the respective library catalogues, extracting
                        these records, and the
                        limitations in applying these methods to other sources of data<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1300">[27]</a>.</div>

                        practises do not allow

                        data extraction and
                        quantitative analyses that can be generalized across different datasets. As we show
                        in this section, extracting
                        bibliographic translation data from different libraries (since researchers often work

                        as metadata standards for translations to develop a replicable workflow for their
                        extraction so that researchers
                        can use the (in)visibility of translations in various national collections to their

                        not always in the same place
                        in the online library catalogues, and it can be difficult to differentiate a translation
                        from an original
                        edition. The main challenge here is that, when it comes to a library collection or
                        online catalogue, a
                        translation is treated as another edition of a publication. Translations thus do not
                        form a distinct category, as
                        do genres or topics. Additionally, in most collections, it is not possible to trace
                        a translation back to its
                        original<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1316">[28]</a>. The information on languages and translators is also not contained in the same fields
                        across
                        library catalogues. This is one of the central challenges in identifying and extracting
                        bibliographic data on
                        translations in national libraries. We hence need to ask: how can we discern translations
                        from other catalogue
                        entries, and can we formulate a rule that allows us to identify and extract translations
                        across different library
                        collections? In this section, we exemplify differences in cataloguing practices by
                        looking at three national
                        library online catalogues — the BAnQ, the ÖNB, and the DNB — explore the challenges
                        they present, and propose
                        solutions for extracting bibliographic translation data.</div>

                        catalogue, we can immediately see the fields indicating the edition’s language in
                        addition to the original
                        language. As figure 4 shows, besides the translator in the “Titel” (title) field and
                        the original title in the
                        “Werk(e)” (works) field, the DNB online catalogue has a “Sprache” (language) field
                        that includes the original
                        language (an excellent indicator for our definition of translation). This mandatory
                        field is really simple to
                        work with, since we may easily formulate a rule for it — -a translation is any edition
                        that has an
                        “Originalsprache(n),” (original languages), next to the language of the edition. The
                        language field in the DNB
                        follows ISO conventions for languages and is therefore consistent across all entries,
                        with a standardized format.
                        Thus, even though a separate field or category for translation does not exist in the
                        online catalogue, as is the
                        case for the BAnQ, it is possible to distinguish a translation by the language field.
                        For comparison, let us look
                        at the BAnQ and ONB and see if they also keep a language field, to which we could
                        theoretically apply the same
                        rule for identifying translations.</div>

                        that we are dealing with a translated work in the “Title” field, which contains the
                        translator’s name, and in the
                        “Preferred Title” field, which contains the edition’s language but not the original
                        language. Besides the
                        indicator “translated by,” there is no separate category that distinguishes this edition
                        as a translation from an
                        original edition. Additionally, the “Content” field contains the categorical descriptor
                        “Romans allemands – 20e
                        siècle” (German novels – 20th century), which stresses the importance of categorizing
                        editions according to their
                        national literature in the BAnQ. This can also be an indicator of translation, albeit
                        on an implied basis. It is
                        important to note that there is no other field in the online catalogue containing
                        the original language or title,
                        which, as the next example shows, is also the case for the ÖNB<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1369">[29]</a>.</div>

                        field for a work’s original
                        language in its online catalogue. Some indicators that this edition is a translation
                        can be found in the field
                        “Weitere Beteiligte” (additional participants), which includes the “ÜbersetzerIn”
                        (translator), and the field
                        “Verantwort.angabe,” (responsible entity), which includes the note “Trad. de” (translated
                        by). Again, there is no
                        separate field for translation as its own category. If we wanted to identify all translations
                        of Kafka, we would
                        have to look for any edition that either has a translator in the “Weitere Beteiligte”
                        field or search for all the
                        different variations of the phrase “Trad. de” in each language — for English we had
                        “Trans.” or “translated from”
                        in the examples above. In either case, formulating a rule based on these fields is
                        challenging and has a larger
                        error margin due to the numerous variations. Going by language field, as for the DNB
                        online catalogue, seems much
                        more feasible.</div>

                        work in each library<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1397">[30]</a>. How, then, can we utilize the metadata and especially the language fields to propose

                        collections, we may
                        formulate a “rule” based on the language field, according to a linguistic definition
                        of translation — presuming
                        that the translated edition has a different original language than the current edition<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1407">[31]</a>. To extract translations from the
                        DNB, we can write a query that finds any edition with both an original and other language
                        listed. In the
                        catalogue, this appears as “Originalsprache(n),” which is included only for translations,
                        while “Sprache” is used
                        to indicate the given edition’s language<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1412">[32]</a>. A search for the original
                        language (“spo”) in the DNB, “spo=ger”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1417">[33]</a>, for instance, yields all titles that originally appeared in German. We can
                        hence apply this rule with high confidence that it will yield only translations<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1423">[34]</a>. The question
                        remains if the same rule can be applied to the other library catalogues, such as the
                        ÖNB and the BAnQ, even in
                        the absence of an original language field in their online catalogues.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">Metadata standards are a precondition for applying this (and other) rule(s) across
                        catalogues and extracting
                        large quantities of bibliographic translation data for analysis. The catalogues in
                        question hence need to contain
                        a language field. In the online catalogues, this field is only visible for the DNB,
                        but not for the ÖNB and BAnQ.
                        However, since all these catalogues follow the same standards for bibliographic metadata
                        in a fixed MARC or MARC
                        21 format, we can therefore utilize the MARC 21 fields and operationalize the search
                        query to extract
                        translations. How do the fields containing the original language (which are specific

                        BAnQ or ÖNB catalogues) translate to MARC 21 as a standard format? Let us have a look
                        at our Süskind translation,

                        importantly, contains the original language (“ger”). This is the field that has been
                        made visible in the online
                        catalogue of the DNB. Hence, using the information in MARC 21 field 41ǂh, we could
                        apply our rule and query the
                        catalogue for any entries that have German (“ger”) as an original language under the
                        assumption that these are
                        translations. Indeed, according to OCLC standards, 41ǂh is a required field (if applicable)
                        and hence should
                        include original language of a translation<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1457">[36]</a>. Additionally, there is the option to add information on whether the edition is a
                        translation as a first indicator (see field 41 “ind1”). If this translation indication
                        is set to “ind1=‘1’” then,
                        according to OCLC standards, “the work is or includes a translation and is used regardless
                        of whether the work in
                        the original language has been published”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1466">[37]</a>. As we can see in figure 4, however, the first indicator for field 41 is left
                        blank, which suggests that the indicator (which categorizes the edition as a translation)
                        is not consistently
                        used in some libraries’ metadata.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p46">Nevertheless, even without the first indicator, the information on original and edition

                        extract the editions that are
                        translations. Since field 41 is required according to OCLC standards and according

                        fields to identify
                        translations, we also need to establish whether and to what extent libraries even
                        collect translations. As the
                        astute reader will have noticed, the last example for cataloguing practices mentioned
                        above is not Süskind’s <span class="hi italic">Perfume</span>, but Franz Kafka’s <span class="hi italic">La métamorphose</span>. Indeed, the ÖNB’s catalogue
                        does not contain any translations by Süskind, because the library does not collect
                        them in the first place<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1523">[40]</a>.
                        When approaching a library to obtain bibliographic data, we oftentimes need to contact
                        the responsible librarians
                        and ask not only whether they collect translation data but when and how much. As the
                        ÖNB catalogue illustrates,
                        not all libraries collect translations to the same extent and in the same manner.
                        When we contacted the ÖNB to
                        ask whether they collect translations, they confirmed that they only do so to a very
                        limited extent. Indeed, in
                        addition to cataloguing practices, collection practices condition the (in)visibility
                        of translations. This brings
                        us to our second challenge: just as the representation of the bibliographic data varies
                        for each catalogue, so
                        too does data availability and accessibility. Collection practices — the rate, amount,
                        and type of publications
                        that are collected by national libraries — are by no means standardized, a problem
                        that also affects data
                        availability<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1529">[41]</a>. Not all national libraries collect translations or editions published
                        outside of their national boundaries, due to budget and resource constraints, for
                        instance. Depending on a
                        national library’s priorities, users, resources, and staff, translations may or may
                        not be collected. Coming back
                        to Belantara and Bradinski, when working on bibliographic data we need to remind ourselves
                        that “[m]etadata
                        reflects a compromise between what the cataloguer knows about an item and the existing
                        system into which she is
                        bound to embed it” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="BelantaraandBradinski2022">BelantaraandBradinski2022</a></span>. Hence, whether and how translations are
                        catalogued and collected is not only due to the cataloguers at work, but also the
                        institutional policies,
                        standards, and practices. This subsection is thus dedicated to the collection practices
                        in the institutional
                        system and the resulting availability and accessibility of bibliographic translation
                        data.</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p50">From the examples of the online catalogues above, we can get a sense of which national
                        libraries collect
                        translations and which do not, or more precisely which authors they collect — the
                        ÖNB did not have translations
                        of Süskind, but of Kafka. While this may be conditioned by a library’s target readerbase,
                        it comes down to the
                        library’s collection policy. The DNB, for instance, has a legal deposit regulation
                        (Pflichtablieferungsverordnung
                        or PflAV) that includes translations. It therefore collects “all publications issued
                        in Germany, irrespective of
                        their language,” and “media works published abroad for which a publisher or a person
                        who has a legal domicile,
                        business premises or their principal residence in Germany has sold (licensed) the
                        right to publish the work
                        abroad”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1539">[42]</a> (emphasis
                        ours)⁠ need to be deposited at the DNB. The latter specifically includes translations
                        published outside of
                        Germany.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1545">[43]</a></div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p51">In comparison, the ÖNB’s deposit regulation is applicable to works published in<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1553">[44]</a> or relevant to
                        Austria (Auslandsaustriaca)<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1559">[45]</a>, which explains why the translation of Süskind’s Perfume is missing from their
                        online catalogue. While the DNB and ÖNB’s deposit regulations are geographically defined,<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1568">[46]</a> the BAnQ predominantly collects works in French and, on occasion, in English published
                        outside of Québec<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1570">[47]</a>. However,
                        which authors’ translations are collected may depend on many factors, including readership.
                        Again, translations
                        do not explicitly appear in any of the lists of works collected, which underlines
                        their invisibility and the
                        challenges in establishing whether a library collects translations published outside
                        of their official languages
                        or geographic borders. A collection policy or deposit regulation that explicitly reaches
                        beyond the linguistic
                        and geographic borders is a good indicator of whether a library collects translations.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p52">Finally, data accessibility may vary for each library and lead to severe usage restrictions.
                        Not all libraries
                        give free access to their data. For instance, even though MARC 21 is also a metadata
                        standard in Canadian
                        libraries<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1582">[48]</a>, the Library
                        and Archives of Canada only provide access to MARC records for their employees. Similarly,
                        the BAnQ does not
                        provide any access to its MARC records, and information on how to access these data
                        is difficult to find. These
                        differences between the Germanophone national libraries and the Canadian libraries
                        highlight the last major

                        data from libraries arising
                        from institutional practices: data accessibility. As figure 9 illustrates, access
                        to data ranges from accessible

                        and to re-publish their
                        data under a universal license. Their Datenshop online portal allows registered users
                        to query the online
                        catalogue by original language, for instance, and to save their selection and extract
                        it. This makes
                        bibliographic data from the DNB accessible and easy to find, extract, and publish.
                        For comparison, the ÖNB does
                        not have any such option, and records can only be individually, manually selected
                        and extracted from the online
                        catalogue. For extraction in batches with specific search queries, the ÖNB offers

                        in MARCXML (MARC data in an
                        XML environment). Additionally, a Gitlab repository<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1607">[50]</a> needs to be consulted for the
                        respective Python scripts, which adds an additional hurdle to data accessibility for

                     and cultural standards as

                     the collection of translated material altogether. What is more, these trends persist
                     despite the presence of
                     translation-specific and language fields in the metadata underlying library records.
                     Similarly, reviewing standards
                     in the Canadian literary press — specifically literary journals publishing reviews
                     of translated literature — often
                     do not account for the specific bibliographic information required to identify translations
                     in the header and body
                     of reviews. As a result, researchers face many challenges when assembling corpora
                     of bibliographic data pertaining
                     to translations drawn from these resources, mainly due to difficulties in identifying
                     which books are translations
                     in the first place.</div>

                     catalogues and collections as

                     and interpretation that future
                     researchers can employ to overcome and use this invisibility to their advantage. In
                     particular, we suggest that
                     researchers rely on the predominantly linguistic definition of translation in use
                     by libraries and utilize the
                     language fields contained in MARC records to retrieve translations from library catalogues
                     with a high degree of
                     precision<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1665">[53]</a>. We also encourage translation researchers to
                     collaborate with librarians to understand and document collection practices over time.
                     Additionally, bibliographic
                     data should be extracted at various points in time in order to illustrate translation
                     collection and cataloguing
                     practices at different points throughout the duration of the research. When dealing
                     with the literary press, we
                     urge researchers to employ mixed methods, creating large datasets to quantitatively
                     showcase translation
                     (in)visibility within given publications on a large scale and at many levels, but
                     following up with close readings
                     of reviews themselves, which tend to nuance these preliminary impressions. Such qualitative
                     analyses reveal the
                     context-specific agents and motivations behind predominant trends that make translations
                     invisible, which vary
                     widely as we have seen.</div>

                     the relatively recent

                     a publication that has a translator, an original edition in another language, and
                     is attributed to an author

                     Many other
                     definitions of translation are possible, often depending on the source from which
                     the data is extracted. We
                     encourage researchers in quantitative translation studies to consider these various
