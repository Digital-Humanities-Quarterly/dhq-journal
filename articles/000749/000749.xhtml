                  <p>In this article, we discuss the main challenges in finding and extracting translation
                     data from national library
                     catalogues and the literary press and propose solutions for researchers to access
                     and analyze bibliographic data
                     for translations. To illustrate these issues, we present two case studies: the first
                     being dedicated to translation
                     invisibility in the literary press, i.e., specialized and general literary journals
                     and magazines, discussing
                     overall trends in the Canadian literary press and giving specific examples from the
                     <cite class="title italic">Quill
                        &amp; Quire</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">Montreal Review of Books</cite>. The second deals with the
                     institutional practices of collecting and cataloguing translations according to metadata
                     standards at three
                     national libraries: the German National Library (DNB), the Austrian National Library
                     (ÖNB), and the Bibliothèque et
                     Archive nationales du Québec (BAnQ). By doing so, we problematize how the cataloguing,
                     collecting, and reviewing of
                     translated material can be viewed as a systemic issue, highlighting the parallels
                     between these different types of
                     practices. We hope to broaden the understanding of translation invisibility by looking
                     at how institutional,
                     cultural, and editorial practices inform the cataloguing, collecting, reviewing, and
                     publishing of
                     translations.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Though translation scholars such as Diana Roig-Sanz and Laura Fólica have begun to
                     advocate for and categorize
                     research that applies computational methods to translation history<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e241">[1]</a>, a brief look at some important research
                     outlets illustrates that quantitative translation research occupies a marginal position
                     in the Digital Humanities
                     (DH). At the 2023 Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations conference, for instance,
                     a total of seven papers
                     and one panel on translation research are scattered in a programme of over 200 presentations<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e246">[2]</a>. At the 2023 Digital Humanities Summer Institute, no workshop or talk on translations
                     was
                     offered<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e252">[3]</a>. This sparsity of quantitative
                     translation research can also be observed in DH scholarly publications. In <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities
                        Quarterly</cite>, one of the central outlets for DH research, we could find only a single title [<a class="ref" href="#palladino_etal2021">Palladino, Foradi, and Tariq 2021</a>] that explicitly mentions translations or their data in the last five years. The same
                     is true for the <cite class="title italic">International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing</cite> [<a class="ref" href="#ngueum_etal2022">Ngué Um et al 2022</a>]. <cite class="title italic">Current Research in Digital History</cite> as well as <a href="https://www.digitalstudies.org/" onclick="window.open('https://www.digitalstudies.org/'); return false" class="ref"><cite class="title italic">Digital Studies / Le champ numérique</cite></a>
                     do not have any articles on translation from the last five years. The one exception
                     seems to be <cite class="title italic">Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</cite>: a search for the keywords “corpus-based translation
                     studies” reveals 582 articles, while “quantitative translation” reveals 377. The majority of these results,
                     however, pertain to machine translation, which shows how challenging it can be to
                     find and identify research that
                     applies quantitative methods in literary translation studies.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">While a comprehensive review of the state of quantitative translation studies in DH
                     beyond these few exemplary
                     environments is certainly required, this quick overview nevertheless illustrates an
                     absence of translation data and
                     its analysis in DH, which, as we argue in this article, goes hand in hand with the
                     invisibility of translation
                     itself. On the one hand, the phenomenon has been extensively discussed by translation
                     scholars<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e291">[4]</a>, though this has mostly resulted in a textual conceptualization of the
                     translator’s invisibility [<a class="ref" href="#venuti1995">Venuti 1995</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rybicki2012">Rybicki 2012</a>]. On the other hand, the
                     invisibility of translations themselves has been only marginally addressed in terms
                     of the challenges posed by
                     bibliography-based quantitative translation studies [<a class="ref" href="#roig-sanz_etal2021a">Roig-Sanz and Fólica 2021</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#zhou_etal2017">Zhou and Sun 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#pickford2016">Pickford 2016</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#smith-yoshimura2017">Smith-Yoshimura 2017</a>]. This paper is
                     dedicated to this very issue and aims at broadening our understanding of the invisibility
                     of translations by
                     looking at the institutional, cultural, and editorial practices involved in the cataloguing,
                     collecting, reviewing,
                     and publishing of translations. These problems go beyond a textual understanding of
                     translation invisibility toward
                     a data-driven one. Some of these issues, such as the relative availability but dispersion
                     of historical translation
                     data [<a class="ref" href="#belle2023">Belle 2023</a>, 798–799] and the limitations of DH methods with regard to translations [<a class="ref" href="#wakabayashi2019">Wakabayashi 2019</a>, 141–143], have already been discussed. In contrast, we argue that this aspect,
                     that is, the invisibility of translations in the literary press, academic journals,
                     national library collections,
                     and web archives, speaks to overarching institutional, cultural, and editorial practices.These
                     facts thus challenge
                     DH to rethink some of its tools in the light of the specific characteristics of translations.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Translation invisibility occurs at various levels in the publication process. For
                     example, a translator’s name is
                     unlikely to be found on the cover of their work. In Canada, where such translation
                     credit is legally required, over
                     35% of translators still struggle to have their name printed on the front page of
                     their publications [<a class="ref" href="#whitfield2013">Whitfield 2013</a>, 218 and 225]. On a larger scale, translations are often ignored by literary
                     reviewers. Recent studies on translation reviews in publications like <cite class="title italic">The New York Review of
                        Books</cite> (USA), <cite class="title italic">The London Review of Books</cite> (UK), <cite class="title italic">The Times
                        Literary Supplement</cite> (UK), <cite class="title italic">Le Monde des livres</cite> (France), and <cite class="title italic">Domenica</cite> (Italy) [<a class="ref" href="#monti2013">Monti 2013</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#monti2016">Monti 2016</a>] <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#wardle2020">#wardle2020</a></span> reveal that translation researchers do not even bother quantifying translation credit
                     because it occurs so infrequently. According to the translation database established
                     by Chad Post for <cite class="title italic">Three Percent</cite>, translations represent approximately 1% of the book market in the United
                     States [cited by <a href="#monti2016">Monti 2016</a>].</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Ironically, what initially prompted the development of the <cite class="title italic">Three Percent</cite> translation
                     database was the lack of statistics on translations in the book market. Book publishing
                     reports only marginally
                     include records on translations. For instance, the Federation of European Publishers’
                     annual report for 2023 does
                     not include any mention of translations. Though other organizations — such as Literature
                     Across Frontiers (LAF) —
                     have been reporting translation percentages in the book market <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#see%E2%80%9CPublishingTranslationsinEurope,%E2%80%9DB%C3%BCchler2011">#see“PublishingTranslationsinEurope,”Büchler2011</a></span>, the most recent global picture of translation from
                     1990–2005 stresses the central position of Germany with 7.9% of all literature translations.
                     However, no such
                     reports have been produced for 2022 or 2023, and publishing data remain inaccessible<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e373">[5]</a>. Limited access to data on translations and the book market, and statistics on fiction
                     especially, thus contribute to the marginalization and invisibility of translation
                     to readers, publishers, and
                     researchers.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">From these examples, we see that while invisibility is indeed a hurdle for quantitative
                     studies of translation, it
                     is also revelatory, a finding in and of itself. The few existing translation metrics
                     can inform us about literary
                     flows between literary catalogues, or lack thereof, and about the agents involved
                     in constituting and reviewing
                     these objects. Additionally, the marginalization of translation in bibliographic data
                     is but one aspect of
                     invisibility, which can in turn reveal much about the different definitions given
                     to <em class="word">translation</em> in
                     each source<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e380">[6]</a> and the motivations of translational agents in the field, be they domestication (à
                     la Venuti) or
                     repertoire broadening (according to the logic of polysystem theory). Finally, DH demands
                     that we document the
                     practices (translation invisibility being one phenomenon) that condition how we work
                     with various data sources.
                     This allows us to discuss the space translations occupy in the literary field, and
                     also how different agents
                     (libraries, the press, publishers) interact with that space.</div>

                        Venuti’s well-known <em class="term">regime of fluency</em> in English-language translations explores Anglophone cultural
                        preferences for so-called domestication, that is the tendency to erase traces of cultural
                        and linguistic
                        difference in literary translations. Venuti’s findings have been echoed by other researchers,
                        with studies on
                        translation reviews confirming, for instance, that “fluid and idiomatic texts are [still]
                        more likely to be accepted without resistance” [<a href="#monti2016">Monti 2016</a>,
                        my translation]. A more recent study of Goodreads user attitudes with regard to translation
                        has shown that these
                        preferences are also present among average readers of English-language translations,
                        who often use “a trope of loss, mostly linked particularly to stylistic or fluency loss [...]” [<a class="ref" href="#kotze_etal2021">Kotze et al 2021</a>, 167] when reviewing translated texts.</div>

                        various editors, the consensus seems to be that “[…] unless the translation is notably poor,
                        […] it’s simply assumed that the competent translator has accomplished what translators

                        Alvstad goes beyond editorial guidelines and explores how translation invisibility
                        is baked into the packaging of
                        translated literature from the start. She has formulated the concept of a <em class="term">translation pact</em> to
                        explain the invisibility of translations at all levels of readership — from editors

                        periodicals and libraries is in fact a reflection of various overarching cultural
                        norms regarding translation. It

                        and cultural trends
                        tending to render translations invisible. As noted above and by a number of translation

                        unreviewed or uncommented, and translators are often not credited in review headers.
                        Indeed, after 40 years at
                        the head of <cite class="title italic">Translation Review</cite>, Rainer Schulte continues to assert that “[t]he field of reviewing translations is still in its infancy” [<a class="ref" href="#schulte2022">Schulte 2022</a>, 3]. In addition to impacting readers’ perception of translated literature, the invisibility
                        of
                        translations in these publications greatly affects researchers’ capacity to study
                        reviewing practices in context.
                        Similarly to studies underpinned by library collections as we will see in the following
                        section, existing studies
                        of translations in the literary press are often limited in scope<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e475">[8]</a>: corpora sizes are either determined by the translations identified
                        by periodical editors or by researchers themselves, and longitudinal studies are difficult
                        to execute. When
                        dealing with translated fiction in periodicals, researchers are thus faced with a
                        plethora of challenges:
                        (re)translations and translators can go unmentioned; ephemeral publications and formats
                        may not have been

                        both theoretically — due to the cultural marginalization of translation — and technically

                        and two
                        catalogues<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e502">[9]</a> surveyed in the context of this article,
                        none offer the possibility to filter by translator or source language, for instance.
                        It is not uncommon, however,
                        for publications to have a separate section for translated literature: <cite class="title italic">Les

                        étrangère” (foreign literature), while <cite class="title italic">Lettres québécoises</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">University of Toronto Quarterly</cite> both publish distinct articles dealing with recently
                        translated books. The children’s literature magazine <cite class="title italic">Lurelu</cite>, on the other hand, uses
                        the tag “T” to signal the presence of a translator among a work’s contributors, allowing readers
                        to identify
                        translated children’s books at a glance. A number of periodicals sporadically include
                        the translator’s name in
                        the review header, to varying degrees of exhaustivity. At one extreme, we have the

                        translators are credited. At the other end, we have publications like <cite class="title italic">Books in
                           Canada</cite>, in which no translator’s name is guaranteed a spot in review headers, and <cite class="title italic">Prairie Books NOW</cite>, where books are systematically reviewed in their original language (French or
                        English). In the middle, we find most other periodicals (e.g., <cite class="title italic">The Malahat Review</cite>,
                        <cite class="title italic">The Fiddlehead</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Canadian Literature</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Muskrat Magazine</cite>), where translation credit is attributed sporadically.</div>

                        visibility in the target publishing context (as in studies cited above). In terms

                        however, the greatest challenge facing researchers working with reviews of translated
                        literature is how difficult
                        these sources are to identify on a mass scale. Most pre-existing catalogues of reviews,
                        such as the <cite class="title italic">Canadian Book Review Annual</cite>, and digital periodical platforms (<cite class="title italic">Nuit

                        one to filter by a translator’s name and fail to tag translations in any consistent
                        way, thus making anything
                        except semi-manual extraction impossible. In many ways, these review repositories
                        are structured in a similar way
                        to the online library catalogues that will be discussed in the next section. Such
                        catalogues have been criticized
                        since their conception in the mid-90s, for being “[...] arranged on the assumption that
                        searchers arrive at the catalog knowing at least one of the three access points (author,

                        subject)” [<a class="ref" href="#borgman1996">Borgman 1996</a>, 495]. Under these conditions, researchers seeking reviews of
                        translations must proceed via proxy: filtering for known translations, translated
                        authors, or translators;
                        keyword searches for variations of the verb <em class="word">to translate</em> or the nouns <em class="word">translation</em> and
                        <em class="word">translator</em> in different languages; or looking for mentions of foreign languages. In all cases,
                        exhaustive studies of these digital sources are impossible, and translations published
                        by smaller presses,
                        translated by lesser-known translators, or from marginalized languages that have been
                        more thoroughly rendered
                        invisible by the editing or review process are not likely to be uncovered by any of

                        copies and reviews 29 books
                        on average <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mRb2022">#mRb2022</a></span>. The publication is characterized by a geographical specificity, focusing on
                        books whose “author, publisher, illustrator, or translator [is] based in the province of
                        Quebec” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mRb2021">#mRb2021</a></span>, thus making it an ideal point from which to study the intersection of
                        French- and English-language writing in the province. The study we describe here was
                        founded on the digital
                        version of the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e699">[11]</a> and the digital archive of paper issues
                        of the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> between 2000 and 2020<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e707">[12]</a>.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p17">Due to differences in reviewing standards at both these publications, our corpus assembly
                        varied from journal to
                        journal. While the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> meticulously includes the translator’s name below the
                        author’s in every review peritext, the translator is only sporadically included among
                        the contributors in <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> reviews. The relative sizes of the journals also played a significant role in study
                        design: on the one hand, with a total number of 1,700 reviews, the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> was well
                        suited to semi-manual corpus assembly; on the other, the 7,642 reviews published in
                        the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> were automatically extracted using Web Scraper (<a href="https://webscraper.io/" onclick="window.open('https://webscraper.io/'); return false" class="ref">https://webscraper.io/</a>, accessed April 22, 2024). As summarized in <a href="#table01">Table 1</a>,
                        using the presence of a translator in the review header as a proxy, this approach
                        yielded two corpora: 255
                        translation reviews in the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> (15% of the total) and 127 translation reviews in the
                        <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> (1.6% of the total). Already, we see a large discrepancy in reviewing
                        practices, leading us to understand that <em class="term">translation invisibility</em> should be nuanced according to the
                        degree of literary contact taking place (here, between Canadian, Québécois and Anglo-Québécois
                        literature).
                        Though it is impossible to know how many translations our scrape of the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite>
                        missed without a manual verification, the disparity in reviewing translations is immediately
                        apparent (see <a href="#table01">Table 1</a>): despite having nearly four and half times as many reviews as the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite>, the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> seems to have reviewed (or at least
                        identified) only half as many translated books in the same twenty-year period. In
                        this case, we see that the
                        regional specificity of the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite>, which insists on Québec-published books regardless
                        of source language, leads to a greater consideration for translators and translations
                        in the periodical’s
                        reviewing and crediting standards than in those of the pan-Canadian, predominantly
                        Anglophone <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite>. Indeed, even if a greater number of translations was reviewed in the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> between 2000 and 2020, their invisibility in the periodical is nevertheless
                        revelatory when placed in relation to the credited translations in the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite>.</div>

                        translation in the body of reviews (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). Between 2000 and 2020, in the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> alike, only one sentence out of each

                        Translation remains a marginal question, with few words on these lists used to describe
                        the process — we should
                        note the presence of <em class="word">French,</em> <em class="word">English</em> (among the top 10 in both columns of <a href="#table02">Table 2</a>), <em class="word">translation,</em> and <em class="word">language,</em> but the absence of the

                        these periodicals treat
                        translated literature nearly identically. <a href="#table02">Table 2</a> plausibly suggests that the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> have adopted similar postures, both
                        tending to marginalize translated literature in book reviews.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">Yet, what our synchronic, distant reading of these reviews and their peritextual information
                        in the respective
                        periodicals has not revealed are the micro-trends that demonstrate the many ways in
                        which translation
                        invisibility evolved between 2000 and 2020 and how it has been leveraged by editors
                        to suit other cultural or
                        literary agendas. In order to interpret these relatively “silent” corpora of translation reviews and their
                        peritexts, we must pair our previous DH analysis with a diachronic, close reading
                        of the data revealed by these
                        preliminary quantitative analyses. A closer analysis of translation reviews in the
                        <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite>, for instance, revealed a series of outliers that showcase various editorial strategies
                        that
                        have contributed to increasing the visibility of translations<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1191">[14]</a>.
                        We see, for instance, that the presence of the translator’s name on the cover, a translator’s
                        note, or a glossary
                        all increase the chances of a thorough translation review [<a class="ref" href="#wells2009">Wells 2009</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#whiteman2014">Whiteman 2014</a>]. This is the case for works such as <cite class="title italic">One</cite>, written by Serge Thibodeau and
                        translated by Jo-Ann Elder, which features the translator’s name and input prominently.
                        The reviewer, Zachariah
                        Wells, dedicated over three quarters (77%) of the review’s sentences to translation
                        commentary and distinguishes
                        between the original (<cite class="title italic">Seul on est</cite>) and the translation, which he calls “<cite class="title italic">Elder’s <cite class="title italic">One</cite></cite>” [<a class="ref" href="#wells2009">Wells 2009</a>, ¶4]. In
                        another notable case, half of the body of the review of <cite class="title italic">Sanaaq</cite> by Mitiarjuk
                        Nappaaluk, translated from Inuktitut into French by Bernard Saladin d’Anglure and
                        from French into English by
                        Peter Frost, is used to discuss translation. While the review is not positive — “the constant
                        pain to which an English reader is put to check the glossary for untranslated Inuktitut
                        words becomes
                        tiresome” [<a class="ref" href="#whiteman2014">Whiteman 2014</a>, ¶3] — it quickly becomes clear that its author’s Inuit
                        background is of great interest when it comes to translation. Reviewer Bruce Whiteman
                        concludes that <cite class="title italic">Sanaaq</cite> is “an important cultural and literary document” (<a href="#whiteman2014">2014</a>, ¶3) that can now be read by English-speaking readers.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p22">Similar trends characterize translation reviews in the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite>. Not only did we find an
                        evolution in the types of translation commentary over time, with an increasing number
                        of reviews interested in
                        translator agency and source-culture representation [<a class="ref" href="#webster2016">Webster 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#miller2019">Miller 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#garlick2020">Garlick 2020</a>], but a high number of reviews in this periodical are also written by fellow
                        translators<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1247">[15]</a>. For example, while early
                        reviews in the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> tended to focus on how “[e]ach language has a
                        unique syntactic style that defies perfect translation” [<a class="ref" href="#smith2003">Smith 2003</a>, ¶7], later reviews
                        praised the “creative” choices made by certain translators — “[Oana Avasilichioaei’s]
                        creative use of the pronouns <em class="word">s/he</em>, <em class="word">hir</em>, <em class="word">hirself</em>, <em class="word">e</em>,
                        <em class="word">em</em>, and <em class="word">eir</em> when representing Tiresias while in a state of flux is especially
                        inspired” [<a class="ref" href="#garlick2020">Garlick 2020</a>, ¶4]. Additionally, certain reviews of canonical Québécois
                        texts by figures like Dany Laferrière [<a class="ref" href="#bourgeois2009">Bourgeois 2009</a>] and Kim Thúy [<a class="ref" href="#moser2014">Moser 2014</a>]
                        conduct interviews with the authors in English and strategically avoid identifying
                        these works as translations.
                        These choices contribute to the geographical specificity of the Anglo-Québécois literary
                        repertoire represented
                        in the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite> and illustrating how translation invisibility can be instrumentalized in

                        generated. As demonstrated in the case of the <cite class="title italic">Q&amp;Q</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">mRb</cite>, while distant reading methods provide us with a general context for a larger corpus
                        of translations
                        and their reviews, close readings reveal evolutions in predominant conceptions and
                        expectations of translated
                        literature as well as certain strategic manipulations of literary repertoires by translators,
                        editors, and
                        reviewers alike. As we will see in library collections and catalogues, the invisibility
                        of translations in the
                        literary press is incredibly multifaceted and nuanced, demonstrating the contribution
                        of large-scale corpus
                        studies of these new sources of information. These newly available corpora of texts
                        can now be studied on a great
                        enough scale to make their apparent silence speak volumes, revealing patterns that
                        could not be registered
                        through older, traditionally text-focused methods in translation studies.</div>

                        close collaboration with the
                        librarians who create this metadata<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1332">[17]</a>. For example, when approaching the DNB’s digital services (<cite class="title italic">Abteilung
                           Digitale Dienste der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek</cite>) for curating a dataset of German fiction in
                        translation [<a class="ref" href="#teichmann2022">Teichmann 2022</a>], we noted that it was possible to query the catalogue and filter the
                        collection for translations using the language field contained in the metadata. What
                        was less obvious, and what
                        DNB librarians confirmed, is that the language field had only been in use for items
                        catalogued since 1996,
                        meaning that the metadata from before that date was still being updated. This shift
                        highlights the fact that
                        translation invisibility is strongly tied to cataloguing and collection practices<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1345">[18]</a>, not mention that metadata standards that need to be contextualized and documented
                        over time<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1347">[19]</a>. We can think of the library as a living archive, where entries and
                        their information are added and redacted on a running basis. Hence, it can be challenging
                        to unravel on what
                        basis translations are catalogued, how they are catalogued, and in what ways they
                        can be extracted using a
                        replicable method. This, in turn, results in the sparsity and rare utilization of
                        library metadata for curating a
                        translation dataset.</div>

                        Additionally, due to the
                        lack of a formalized method with respect to cataloguing practices and standards, it
                        remains difficult to access
                        and extract bibliographic data on translations from national collections. Diana Roig-Sanz
                        and Laura Folica (2021,
                        242) stress that libraries as sources for metadata remain largely unexploited, while
                        scholars like Susan Pickford
                        have repeatedly insisted on how incomplete existing databases such as the <cite class="title italic">Index
                           Translationum</cite> or VIAF are for bibliographic translation data<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1355">[20]</a>. Bibliographic data<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1360">[21]</a> contain information
                        on the author, publisher, language, etc. of a given edition and are typically collected
                        and maintained by
                        libraries [<a class="ref" href="#umerle_etal2022">Umerle et al 2022</a>, 12]<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1369">[22]</a> according to strict metadata standards such as MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloguing

                        Core, or the Library of Congress Classification. Translations bring with them specific
                        characteristics to
                        bibliographic data, one of them being that language has a rather high importance,
                        and an imposed relationship to
                        an original edition (which may or may not be documented). Additional creators of translated
                        editions, such as
                        translators, original publishers, etc., also need to be contained in the bibliographic
                        data. All this information
                        indicates to the user of the library catalogue whether the edition is a translation
                        or not, a fact which is not
                        always apparent and poses specific challenges for the extraction of bibliographic
                        data. An additional issue is
                        that translation-specific information may be in the metadata but not included in the
                        online catalogue, which
                        further marginalizes translations. Utilizing the library’s bibliographic translation
                        data therefore requires that
                        the data be available, accessible, and that cataloguing practices make it possible
                        to extract them.</div>

                        this can be very challenging:
                        the invisibility of translations in library catalogues results in a sparsity of translation
                        data, which
                        oftentimes prompts scholars to curate a dataset semi-manually [<a class="ref" href="#roman2022">Roman 2022</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#norrick-ruhl_etal2016">Norrick-Rühl and Bold 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#zhou_etal2017">Zhou and Sun 2017</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#pickford2016">Pickford 2016</a>]. Projects that
                        make use of bibliographic translation data are therefore mainly case-study specific
                        and limited to the
                        translations of a single author, such as the <cite class="title italic">Jane Eyre</cite> project by Reynolds and
                        Vitali (<a href="#reynolds_etal2021">2021</a>); a single genre; a single source or target language, such as
                        Philipp Hofeneders work on visualizing translation spaces of 19th-century Russia [<a class="ref" href="#hofeneder2022">Hofeneder 2022</a>]

                        for
                        their datasets, they also all highlight the necessity for semi-manual curation due
                        to the difficulties in
                        identifying translations in the respective library catalogues, extracting these records,
                        and the limitations in
                        applying these methods to other sources of data<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1415">[25]</a>.</div>

                        practises do not allow

                        data extraction and
                        quantitative analyses that can be generalized across different datasets. As we show
                        in this section, extracting
                        bibliographic translation data from different libraries (since researchers often work

                        as metadata standards for translations to develop a replicable workflow for their
                        extraction so that researchers
                        can use the (in)visibility of translations in various national collections to their

                     <div class="ptext" id="p29">The information that indicates whether a given edition is in fact a translation is
                        not always in the same place
                        in the online library catalogues, and it can be difficult to differentiate a translation
                        from an original
                        edition. The main challenge here is that, when it comes to a library collection or
                        online catalogue, a
                        translation is treated as another edition of a publication. Translations thus do not
                        form a distinct category, as
                        do genres or topics. Additionally, in most collections, it is not possible to trace
                        a translation back to its
                        original<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1431">[26]</a>. The information on languages and translators is also not contained in the same fields
                        across
                        library catalogues. This is one of the central challenges in identifying and extracting
                        bibliographic data on
                        translations in national libraries. We hence need to ask: how can we discern translations
                        from other catalogue
                        entries, and can we formulate a rule that allows us to identify and extract translations
                        across different library
                        collections? In this section, we exemplify differences in cataloguing practices by
                        looking at three national
                        library online catalogues — the BAnQ, the ÖNB, and the DNB — explore the challenges

                        catalogue, we can immediately see the fields indicating the edition’s language in
                        addition to the original
                        language. As <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a> shows, besides the translator in the “Titel” (title)
                        field and the original title in the “Werk(e)” (works) field, the DNB online catalogue has a “Sprache”
                        (language) field that includes the original language (an excellent indicator for our
                        definition of translation).
                        This mandatory field is really simple to work with, since we may easily formulate
                        a rule for it — -a translation
                        is any edition that has an “Originalsprache(n),” (original languages), next to the language of the edition.
                        The language field in the DNB follows ISO conventions for languages and is therefore
                        consistent across all
                        entries, with a standardized format. Thus, even though a separate field or category
                        for translation does not
                        exist in the online catalogue, as is the case for the BAnQ, it is possible to distinguish
                        a translation by the
                        language field. For comparison, let us look at the BAnQ and ONB and see if they also
                        keep a language field, to
                        which we could theoretically apply the same rule for identifying translations.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p32">When searching the BAnQ’s online catalogue for Süskind’s <cite class="title italic">Perfume</cite>, there are
                        indications that we are dealing with a translated work in the “Title” field, which contains the translator’s
                        name, and in the “Preferred Title” field, which contains the edition’s language but not the original
                        language. Besides the indicator “translated by,” there is no separate category that distinguishes this
                        edition as a translation from an original edition. Additionally, the “Content” field contains the
                        categorical descriptor “Romans allemands – 20e siècle” (German novels – 20th century), which stresses the
                        importance of categorizing editions according to their national literature in the
                        BAnQ. This can also be an
                        indicator of translation, albeit on an implied basis. It is important to note that
                        there is no other field in the
                        online catalogue containing the original language or title, which, as the next example
                        shows, is also the case
                        for the ÖNB<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1503">[27]</a>.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p33">Unlike the DNB but similarly to the BAnQ, the ÖNB online catalogue does not have a
                        field for a work’s original
                        language in its online catalogue. Some indicators that this edition is a translation
                        can be found in the field
                        “Weitere Beteiligte” (additional participants), which includes the “ÜbersetzerIn” (translator), and the
                        field “Verantwort.angabe,” (responsible entity), which includes the note “Trad. de” (translated by).
                        Again, there is no separate field for translation as its own category. If we wanted
                        to identify all translations
                        of Kafka, we would have to look for any edition that either has a translator in the
                        “Weitere Beteiligte”
                        field or search for all the different variations of the phrase “Trad. de” in each language — for English we
                        had “Trans.” or “translated from” in the examples above. In either case, formulating a rule based on
                        these fields is challenging and has a larger error margin due to the numerous variations.
                        Going by language
                        field, as for the DNB online catalogue, seems much more feasible.</div>

                        work in each library<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1546">[28]</a>. How, then, can we utilize the metadata and especially the language fields to propose
                        a solution for
                        identifying translations in these different libraries despite their overall invisibility

                        collections, we may
                        formulate a “rule” based on the language field, according to a linguistic definition of translation
                        —
                        presuming that the translated edition has a different original language than the current
                        edition<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1558">[29]</a>. To
                        extract translations from the DNB, we can write a query that finds any edition with
                        both an original and other
                        language listed. In the catalogue, this appears as “Originalsprache(n),” which is included only for
                        translations, while “Sprache” is used to indicate the given edition’s language<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1567">[30]</a>. A search for the original language (“spo”) in the DNB, “spo=ger”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1576">[31]</a>, for instance, yields all titles that originally appeared in German. We can
                        hence apply this rule with high confidence that it will yield only translations<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1582">[32]</a>. The question
                        remains if the same rule can be applied to the other library catalogues, such as the
                        ÖNB and the BAnQ, even in
                        the absence of an original language field in their online catalogues.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">Metadata standards are a precondition for applying this (and other) rule(s) across
                        catalogues and extracting
                        large quantities of bibliographic translation data for analysis. The catalogues in
                        question hence need to contain
                        a language field. In the online catalogues, this field is only visible for the DNB,
                        but not for the ÖNB and BAnQ.
                        However, since all these catalogues follow the same standards for bibliographic metadata
                        in a fixed MARC or MARC
                        21 format, we can therefore utilize the MARC 21 fields and operationalize the search
                        query to extract
                        translations. How do the fields containing the original language (which are specific
                        to DNB and do not appear in
                        BAnQ or ÖNB catalogues) translate to MARC 21 as a standard format? Let us have a look
                        at our Süskind translation,

                     <div class="ptext" id="p37">There are several mandatory fields in MARC 21 for language. Field 008, for instance,
                        contains the language of
                        the edition (the record in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a> contains “eng” in the language field).
                        Additionally, we have three more subfields that contain information on the languages:

                        </dl>For the Süskind record above, field 041 contains “eng” or the language of the edition, while subfield
                        41ǂh, more importantly, contains the original language (“ger”). This is the field that has been made visible
                        in the online catalogue of the DNB. Hence, using the information in MARC 21 field
                        41ǂh, we could apply our rule
                        and query the catalogue for any entries that have German (“ger”) as an original language under the
                        assumption that these are translations. Indeed, according to OCLC standards, 41ǂh
                        is a required field (if
                        applicable) and hence should include original language of a translation [<a class="ref" href="#oclc">OCLC</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1643">[33]</a>.
                        Additionally, there is the option to add information on whether the edition is a translation
                        as a first indicator
                        (see field 41 “ind1”). If this translation indication is set to “ind1=‘1’” then, according to OCLC
                        standards, “the work is or includes a translation and is used regardless of whether the work
                        in the original language has been published”[<a class="ref" href="#oclc">OCLC</a>]. As we can see in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>, however, the first indicator for field 41 is left blank, which suggests that
                        the indicator (which categorizes the edition as a translation) is not consistently
                        used in some libraries’
                        metadata.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p38">Nevertheless, even without the first indicator, the information on original and edition
                        language in the 41
                        language field is a consistent and reliable source of information to identify and
                        extract the editions that are
                        translations. Since field 41 is required according to OCLC standards and according
                        to the ÖNB’s documentation,

                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">As we can see in <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>, the ÖNB uses the 41 field and h subfield for
                        translation, but not the first indicator. Again, this confirms that our rule based
                        on original language to
                        extract translations can be applied not only to the DNB, but also the ÖNB, despite
                        apparent differences in their
                        visible online catalogues. This formalized method can thus be used across different
                        libraries to filter
                        translations, offering a solution to the invisibility and inconsistency challenges
                        researchers face. However, the
                        practice of including only the information from the bibliographic data on original
                        language and not the first
                        indicator that would categorize the edition as a translation (even though it is so
                        valuable and important for
                        translation researchers) highlights the marginal status of translations in our cultural
                        institutions, a fact even
                        more apparent in collection practices.</div>
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="div div1">
                     
                     <h2 class="head">Availability and Accessibility of Library Translation Data</h2>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p40">Now that we have established that we can utilize the metadata standards and the language
                        fields to identify
                        translations, we also need to establish whether and to what extent libraries even
                        collect translations. As the
                        astute reader will have noticed, the last example for cataloguing practices mentioned
                        above is not Süskind’s
                        <cite class="title italic">Perfume</cite>, but Franz Kafka’s <cite class="title italic">La métamorphose</cite>. Indeed, the
                        ÖNB’s catalogue does not contain any translations by Süskind, because the library
                        does not collect them in the
                        first place<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1721">[36]</a>.
                        When approaching a library to obtain bibliographic data, we oftentimes need to contact
                        the responsible librarians
                        and ask not only whether they collect translation data but when and how much. As the
                        ÖNB catalogue illustrates,
                        not all libraries collect translations to the same extent and in the same manner.
                        When we contacted the ÖNB to
                        ask whether they collect translations, they confirmed that they only do so to a very
                        limited extent. Indeed, in
                        addition to cataloguing practices, collection practices condition the (in)visibility
                        of translations. This brings
                        us to our second challenge: just as the representation of the bibliographic data varies
                        for each catalogue, so
                        too does data availability and accessibility. Collection practices — the rate, amount,
                        and type of publications
                        that are collected by national libraries — are by no means standardized, a problem
                        that also affects data
                        availability<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1727">[37]</a>. Not all national libraries
                        collect translations or editions published outside of their national boundaries, due
                        to budget and resource
                        constraints, for instance. Depending on a national library’s priorities, users, resources,
                        and staff,
                        translations may or may not be collected. Coming back to Belantara and Bradinski,
                        when working on bibliographic
                        data we need to remind ourselves that “[m]etadata reflects a compromise between what the
                        cataloguer knows about an item and the existing system into which she is bound to
                        embed it” [<a class="ref" href="#belantara_etal2022">Belantara and Drabinski 2022</a>, 4]. Hence, whether and how translations are catalogued and collected is not
                        only due to the cataloguers at work, but also the institutional policies, standards,
                        and practices. This
                        subsection is thus dedicated to the collection practices in the institutional system
                        and the resulting
                        availability and accessibility of bibliographic translation data.</div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">From the examples of the online catalogues above, we can get a sense of which national
                        libraries collect
                        translations and which do not, or more precisely which authors they collect — the
                        ÖNB did not have translations
                        of Süskind, but of Kafka. While this may be conditioned by a library’s target readerbase,
                        it comes down to the
                        library’s collection policy. The DNB, for instance, has a legal deposit regulation
                        (Pflichtablieferungsverordnung
                        or PflAV) that includes translations. It therefore collects “all publications issued in
                        Germany, irrespective of their language,” and “media works published abroad for which
                        a publisher or a person who has a legal domicile, business premises or their principal
                        residence in Germany has
                        sold (licensed) the right to publish the work abroad”[<a class="ref" href="#dnb_f">DNB (f)</a>] (emphasis ours)⁠ need to be
                        deposited at the DNB. The latter specifically includes translations published outside
                        of Germany.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1751">[38]</a></div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p42">In comparison, the ÖNB’s deposit regulation is applicable to works published in or
                        relevant to Austria
                        (Auslandsaustriaca) [<a class="ref" href="#onb_c">ÖNB (c)</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1760">[39]</a>, which explains why the translation of Süskind’s Perfume is missing from their online
                        catalogue. While
                        the DNB and ÖNB’s deposit regulations are geographically defined,<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1769">[40]</a> the
                        BAnQ predominantly collects works in French and, on occasion, in English published
                        outside of Québec<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1774">[41]</a>. However,
                        which authors’ translations are collected may depend on many factors, including readership.
                        Again, translations
                        do not explicitly appear in any of the lists of works collected, which underlines
                        their invisibility and the
                        challenges in establishing whether a library collects translations published outside
                        of their official languages
                        or geographic borders. A collection policy or deposit regulation that explicitly reaches
                        beyond the linguistic
                        and geographic borders is a good indicator of whether a library collects translations.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p43">Finally, data accessibility may vary for each library and lead to severe usage restrictions.
                        Not all libraries
                        give free access to their data. For instance, even though MARC 21 is also a metadata
                        standard in Canadian
                        libraries [<a class="ref" href="#marc">MARC</a>], the Library and Archives of Canada only provide access to MARC records for their
                        employees. Similarly, the BAnQ does not provide any access to its MARC records, and
                        information on how to access
                        these data is difficult to find. These differences between the Germanophone national
                        libraries and the Canadian
                        libraries highlight the last major challenge we will discuss in this section for extracting
                        bibliographic
                        translation data from libraries arising from institutional practices: data accessibility.

                     library collections and
                     the Canadian literary press, translation invisibility is just as present in institutional
                     and cultural standards as
                     in the textual features of many translations and their paratexts. Indeed, our survey
                     of the Canadian literary press
                     as well as the German, Austrian, and Québécois national libraries’ cataloguing and
                     collecting standards has
                     revealed a tendency to marginalize translations. In library catalogues, “translation” is not its own category,
                     translators and original editions are not consistently identified across languages,
                     while some institutions forgo
                     the collection of translated material altogether. What is more, these trends persist
                     despite the presence of
                     translation-specific and language fields in the metadata underlying library records.
                     Similarly, reviewing standards
                     in the Canadian literary press — specifically literary journals publishing reviews
                     of translated literature — often
                     do not account for the specific bibliographic information required to identify translations
                     in the header and body
                     of reviews. As a result, researchers face many challenges when assembling corpora
                     of bibliographic data pertaining
                     to translations drawn from these resources, mainly due to difficulties in identifying
                     which books are translations
                     in the first place.</div>

                     interpretation that future researchers can employ to overcome and use this invisibility
                     to their advantage. In
                     particular, we suggest that researchers rely on the predominantly linguistic definition
                     of translation in use by
                     libraries and utilize the language fields contained in MARC records to retrieve translations
                     from library
                     catalogues with a high degree of precision<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1940">[45]</a>. We also
                     encourage translation researchers to collaborate with librarians to understand and
                     document collection practices
                     over time. Additionally, bibliographic data should be extracted at various points
                     in time in order to illustrate
                     translation collection and cataloguing practices at different points throughout the
                     duration of the research. When
                     dealing with the literary press, we urge researchers to employ mixed methods, creating
                     large datasets to
                     quantitatively showcase translation (in)visibility within given publications on a
                     large scale and at many levels,
                     but following up with close readings of reviews themselves, which tend to nuance these
                     preliminary impressions.
                     Such qualitative analyses reveal the context-specific agents and motivations behind
                     predominant trends that make
                     translations invisible, which vary widely as we have seen.</div>

                     unauthorized translations in circulation — these included pirated books, fan-translated
                     media, and illegal
                     translations of censored content [<a class="ref" href="#dwyer2011">Dwyer 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#karaganis2011">Karaganis 2011</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#nkiko2014">Nkiko 2014</a>]. Finally, the institutional standards of the literary press and national libraries

                     those enforced by the publishing industry and (inter)national copyright policies.
