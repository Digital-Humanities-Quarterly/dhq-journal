        <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
        <p>In this article, we discuss the main challenges in finding and extracting translation data from national library
          catalogues and the literary press and propose solutions for researchers to access and analyze bibliographic data
          for translations. To illustrate these issues, we present two case studies: the first being dedicated to translation
          invisibility in the literary press, i.e., specialized and general literary journals and magazines, discussing
          overall trends in the Canadian literary press and giving specific examples from the <hi rend="italic">Quill &amp;
          Quire</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Montreal Review of Books</hi>. The second deals with the institutional
          practices of collecting and cataloguing translations according to metadata standards at three national libraries:
          the German National Library (DNB), the Austrian National Library (ÖNB), and the Bibliothèque et Archive nationales
          du Québec (BAnQ). By doing so, we problematize how the cataloguing, collecting, and reviewing of translated
          material can be viewed as a systemic issue, highlighting the parallels between these different types of practices.
          We hope to broaden the understanding of translation invisibility by looking at how institutional, cultural, and
          editorial practices inform the cataloguing, collecting, reviewing, and publishing of translations.</p>

        <head>Quantitative Translation Studies in the Digital Humanities</head>
        <p>Though translation scholars such as Diana Roig-Sanz and Laura Fólica have begun to advocate for and categorize
          research that applies computational methods to translation history<note> See the panel report on big translation
          history from 2019: <ref target="https://chronotopos.eu/index.php/cts/article/view/3182/3069"
          >https://chronotopos.eu/index.php/cts/article/view/3182/3069</ref> </note>, a brief look at some important research
          outlets illustrates that quantitative translation research occupies a marginal position in the Digital Humanities
          (DH). At the 2023 Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations conference, for instance, a total of seven papers
          and one panel on translation research are scattered in a programme of over 200 presentations<note> See <ref
          target="https://www.conftool.pro/dh2023/sessions.php">https://www.conftool.pro/dh2023/sessions.php</ref>, accessed
          August 23, 2023.</note>. At the 2023 Digital Humanities Summer Institute, no workshop or talk on translations was
          offered<note> See <ref target="https://dhsi.org/online-workshops/">https://dhsi.org/online-workshops/</ref>,
          accessed August 23, 2023.<ref target="https://dhsi.org/on-campus-courses/"
          >https://dhsi.org/on-campus-courses/</ref>, accessed August 23, 2023.</note>. This sparsity of quantitative
          translation research can also be observed in DH scholarly publications. In <hi rend="italic">DH Quarterly</hi>, one
          of the central outlets for DH research, we could find only a single title (Palladino et al. 2021) that explicitly
          mentions translations or their data in the last five years. The same is true for the <hi rend="italic"
          >International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing</hi> (Ngué Um <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 2022). <hi
          rend="italic">Current Research in Digital History</hi> as well as <ref target="https://www.digitalstudies.org/">
          <hi rend="italic">Digital Studies / Le champ numérique</hi> </ref> do not have any articles on translation from the
          last five years. The one exception seems to be <hi rend="italic">Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</hi>: a
          search for the keywords “corpus-based translation studies” reveals 582 articles, while “quantitative translation”
          reveals 377. The majority of these results, however, pertain to machine translation, which shows how challenging it
          can be to find and identify research that applies quantitative methods in literary translation studies.</p>
        <p>While a comprehensive review of the state of quantitative translation studies in DH beyond these few exemplary
          environments is certainly required, this quick overview nevertheless illustrates an absence of translation data and
          its analysis in DH, which, as we argue in this article, goes hand in hand with the invisibility of translation
          itself. On the one hand, the phenomenon has been extensively discussed by translation scholars<note> In general,
          quantitative translation research is more so situated in the bibliographic data sciences, information and library
          sciences, archival studies, cultural analytics, and, of course, translation studies, for which the number of
          projects using quantitative methodologies and bibliographic data increase each year. In the last five years, a
          number of titles on the topic have been published: <hi rend="italic">Advances in Empirical Translation Studies</hi>
          (Ji and Oakes 2019); <hi rend="italic">Complexity Thinking in Translation Studies</hi> (Marais and Meylaerts 2018);
          <hi rend="italic">Advances in Corpus Applications in Literary and Translation Studies</hi> (Moratto and Li 2022);
          to name but three, not to mention the various articles on the topic. At the 2023 annual conference of the Canadian
          Association for Translation Studies, out of 60 contributions, at most five or six (including those by authors of
          this paper) presented quantitatively driven research projects. Questions pertaining to bibliographic translation
          data are, however, absent from the vast majority of these studies. </note>, though this has mostly resulted in a
          textual conceptualization of the translator’s invisibility (see Venuti 1995 and Rybicki 2012). On the other hand,
          the invisibility of translations themselves has been only marginally addressed in terms of the challenges posed by
          bibliography-based quantitative translation studies (see Roig-Sanz and Fólica 2021; Zhou and Sun 2017; Pickford
          2016; Smith-Yoshimura 2017). This paper is dedicated to this very issue and aims at broadening our understanding of
          the invisibility of translations by looking at the institutional, cultural, and editorial practices involved in the
          cataloguing, collecting, reviewing, and publishing of translations. These problems go beyond a textual
          understanding of translation invisibility toward a data-driven one. Some of these issues, such as the relative
          availability but dispersion of historical translation data (Belle 2023, 798–799) and the limitations of DH methods
          with regard to translations (Wakabayashi 2019, 141–143), have already been discussed. In contrast, we argue that
          this aspect, that is, the invisibility of translations in the literary press, academic journals, national library
          collections, and web archives, speaks to overarching institutional, cultural, and editorial practices.These facts
          thus challenge DH to rethink some of its tools in the light of the specific characteristics of translations.</p>

        <head>Translation Invisibility and Bibliographic Data</head>
        <p>Translation invisibility occurs at various levels in the publication process. For example, a translator’s name is
          unlikely to be found on the cover of their work. In Canada, where such translation credit is legally required, over
          35% of translators still struggle to have their name printed on the front page of their publications (Whitfield
          2013, 218 and 225). On a larger scale, translations are often ignored by literary reviewers. Recent studies on
          translation reviews in publications like <hi rend="italic">The New York Review of Books</hi> (USA), <hi
          rend="italic">The London Review of Books </hi>(UK), <hi rend="italic">The Times Literary Supplement </hi>(UK), <hi
          rend="italic">Le Monde des livres</hi> (France), and <hi rend="italic">Domenica</hi> (Italy) (see Monti 2013 and
          2016; Wardle 2020) reveal that translation researchers do not even bother quantifying translation credit because it
          occurs so infrequently. According to the translation database established by Chad Post for <hi rend="italic">Three
          Percent</hi>, translations represent approximately 1% of the book market in the United States (cited by Monti 2016,
          123–124).</p>
        <p>Ironically, what initially prompted the development of the <hi rend="italic">Three Percent</hi> translation
          database was the lack of statistics on translations in the book market. Book publishing reports only marginally
          include records on translations. For instance, the Federation of European Publishers’ annual report for 2023 does
          not include any mention of translations. Though other organizations — such as Literature Across Frontiers (LAF) —
          have been reporting translation percentages in the book market (see “Publishing Translations in Europe,” Büchler
          2011), the most recent global picture of translation from 1990–2005 stresses the central position of Germany with
          7.9% of all literature translations. However, no such reports have been produced for 2022 or 2023, and publishing
          data remain inaccessible<note> Partially because the data needs to be requested from publishers directly by
          conducting surveys (as in the case of the association of the German book trade).</note>. Limited access to data on
          translations and the book market, and statistics on fiction especially, thus contribute to the marginalization and
          invisibility of translation to readers, publishers, and researchers.</p>
        <p>From these examples, we see that while invisibility is indeed a hurdle for quantitative studies of translation, it
          is also revelatory, a finding in and of itself. The few existing translation metrics can inform us about literary
          flows between literary catalogues, or lack thereof, and about the agents involved in constituting and reviewing
          these objects. Additionally, the marginalization of translation in bibliographic data is but one aspect of
          invisibility, which can in turn reveal much about the different definitions given to “translation” in each
          source<note> In this article, we use a primarily linguistic definition of translation. As such, a “translation” is
          a publication that has a translator, an original edition in another language, and is attributed to an author
          distinct from the translator (with the exception of clearly identified cases of self-translation). Many other
          definitions of translation are possible, often depending on the source from which the data is extracted. We
          encourage researchers in quantitative translation studies to consider these various definitions when structuring
          their datasets and describing their sources, as in Poupaud et al. (2009, 268–269).</note> and the motivations of
          translational agents in the field, be they domestication (à la Venuti) or repertoire broadening (according to the
          logic of polysystem theory). Finally, DH demands that we document the practices (translation invisibility being one
          phenomenon) that condition how we work with various data sources. This allows us to discuss the space translations
          occupy in the literary field, and also how different agents (libraries, the press, publishers) interact with that
          space.</p>
        <p>In this article, we present two case studies: the first is dedicated to translation invisibility in the literary
          press (i.e., specialized and general literary journals and magazines) discussing overall trends in the Canadian
          literary press and specific examples from the <hi rend="italic">Quill &amp; Quire</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
          >Montreal Review of Books</hi>. The second deals with the institutional practices of collecting and cataloguing
          translations according to metadata standards and challenges for extracting translation data from three national
          libraries, the German National Library (DNB), the Austrian National Library (ÖNB), and the Bibliothèque et Archive
          nationales du Québec (BAnQ). We discuss some DH-related challenges in finding and extracting translation data from
          these sources and propose solutions for researchers looking to access and analyze bibliographic data for
          translations. By doing so, we show how the cataloguing, collecting, and reviewing of translations can be viewed as
          a systemic issue relating to translation invisibility, highlighting the parallels between these different types of
          practices. In describing these different levels of translation data, we hope to provide pointers to DH and
          translation researchers on how they can use invisibility to their advantage, and make this otherwise silent data
          “speak.”</p>

          <head>Beyond “The Translator’s Invisibility”</head>
          <p>This invisibility of translations has been explained in various ways — cultural, theoretical, and technical.
            Venuti’s well-known “regime of fluency” in English-language translations explores Anglophone cultural preferences
            for so-called domestication, that is the tendency to erase traces of cultural and linguistic difference in
            literary translations. Venuti’s findings have been echoed by other researchers, with studies on translation
            reviews confirming, for instance, that “fluid and idiomatic texts are [still] more likely to be accepted without
            resistance” (Monti 2016, 126–127, my translation). A more recent study of Goodreads user attitudes with regard to
            translation has shown that these preferences are also present among average readers of English-language
            translations, who often use “a trope of loss, mostly linked particularly to stylistic or fluency loss [...]”
            (Kotze et al. 2021, 167) when reviewing translated texts.</p>
          <p>These cultural norms do little to encourage literary reviews to properly cite translated books, which are deemed
            successful if the process of their translation is unremarkable, in the most literal sense of the word. In the
            English-speaking world, these preferences have been integrated into periodical editing practices. As early as
            1982, translator and author Ronald Christ described how quick magazines were to cut critiques of the translation
            process from literary reviews (17). Indeed, according to his exchanges with various editors, the consensus seems
            to be that “[…] unless the translation is notably poor, […] it’s simply assumed that the competent translator has
            accomplished what translators are supposed to accomplish […]” (James Atlas, cited by Christ 1982, 21). Cecilia
            Alvstatd goes beyond editorial guidelines and explores how translation invisibility is baked into the packaging
            of translated literature from the start. She has formulated the concept of a “translation pact” to explain the
            invisibility of translations at all levels of readership — from editors and literary critics to readers:</p>
          <p>[...] [T]here is [...] a pact-inviting mechanism at work in translations, a rhetorical construction through
            which readers are invited to read translated texts as if they were original texts written solely by the original
            author. [...] [T]his convention is rhetorically supported, even cultivated, by textual and paratextual features
            of translated books (2014, 271).</p>
          <p>According to Alvstad, the invisibility of translations is a reading strategy editors and readers are
            continuously invited to adopt by mutually agreed upon publishing standards<note> This might explain why
            translators continue to fight for name attribution of book covers, despite being legally extended this right in
            Canada, as mentioned above (LTAC 2020, 5; Whitfield 2006, 9–11, 19; see also Stewart 2021).</note>. As such, we
            can see how the marginalization of translated literature in periodicals and libraries is in fact a reflection of
            various overarching cultural norms regarding translation. It remains to be seen, however, how and to what extent
            these norms are applied across various publications and in various contexts. Keeping this in mind, we can begin
            to employ interpretative strategies to make this silence speak, and draw out meaning from what may otherwise
            appear to be an absence of information.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Translation(s) in/and the Literary Press</head>
          <p>The literary press — an expression used here to refer to any general or scholarly periodical publishing reviews
            of books and short-form original or translated fiction — is not exempt from institutional and cultural trends
            tending to render translations invisible. As noted above and by a number of translation researchers (see, in
            particular, Venuti 1995; Fawcett 2000; Alvstad 2014), translations may go completely unreviewed or uncommented,
            and translators are often not credited in review headers. Indeed, after 40 years at the head of <hi rend="italic"
            >Translation Review</hi>, Rainer Schulte continues to assert that “[t]he field of reviewing translations is still
            in its infancy” (2022, 3). In addition to impacting readers’ perception of translated literature, the
            invisibility of translations in these publications greatly affects researchers’ capacity to study reviewing
            practices in context. Similarly to studies underpinned by library collections as we will see in the following
            section, existing studies of translations in the literary press are often limited in scope<note> See, for
            instance, Vanderschelden (2000); Monti (2013 and 2016); Özmen 2019; Roman (2022); Regniers (2021 and 2023). While
            these studies reveal much about translation attitudes over time, the role of translators in periodicals, and
            perceptions of foreign cultures in given contexts, all are restricted in terms of timeframe, geography, genre,
            and exhaustivity, among others.</note>: corpora sizes are either determined by the translations identified by
            periodical editors or by researchers themselves, and longitudinal studies are difficult to execute. When dealing
            with translated fiction in periodicals, researchers are thus faced with a plethora of challenges:
            (re)translations and translators can go unmentioned; ephemeral publications and formats may not have been
            adequately preserved; citation standards may change over time, etc. (see Roig-Sanz et al. 2021, 201). Historical
            studies of periodicals aiming to identify and analyze translated texts in periodicals are thus both theoretically
            — due to the cultural marginalization of translation — and technically — due to imprecise text-recognition and
            multilingual limitations of software — hindered (see Roig-Sanz et al. 2021, 203–205; O’Connor 2019, 245–246).</p>
          <p>A quick survey of various Canadian periodicals reveals an incredibly diverse array of approaches to translation
            reviewing, all of which fall within the framework of invisibility. Among the 15 periodicals and two

            article, none offer the possibility to filter by translator or source language, for instance. It is not uncommon,
            however, for publications to have a separate section for translated literature: <hi rend="italic">Les
            libraires</hi>, for example, has a subsection of its literary reviews dedicated to “littérature étrangère”
            (foreign literature), while <hi rend="italic">Lettres québécoises</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">University of
            Toronto Quarterly</hi> both publish distinct articles dealing with recently translated books. The children’s
            literature magazine <hi rend="italic">Lurelu</hi>, on the other hand, uses the tag “T” to signal the presence of
            a translator among a work’s contributors, allowing readers to identify translated children’s books at a glance. A
            number of periodicals sporadically include the translator’s name in the review header, to varying degrees of
            exhaustivity. At one extreme, we have the <hi rend="italic">Montreal Review of Books </hi>(<hi rend="italic"
            >mRb</hi>), where, with the exception of children’s literature<note> It is worth mentioning that, as of the <hi
            rend="italic">mRb</hi>’s 25th anniversary edition in 2023 and following communication with the authors of this
            article within the context of a previous study, translators of children’s literature are also credited on the
            pages of this publication. </note>, all translators are credited. At the other end, we have publications like <hi
            rend="italic">Books in Canada</hi>, in which no translator’s name is guaranteed a spot in review headers, and <hi
            rend="italic">Prairie Books NOW</hi>, where books are systematically reviewed in their original language (French
            or English). In the middle, we find most other periodicals (e.g., <hi rend="italic">The Malahat Review</hi>, <hi
            rend="italic">The Fiddlehead</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Canadian Literature</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Muskrat
            Magazine</hi>), where translation credit is attributed sporadically.</p>
          <p>Of course, translator and translation credit is but one aspect of translation visibility in the literary press,
            though peritextual information in periodicals can and has been used to evaluate translator and translation
            visibility in the target publishing context (as in studies cited above). In terms of reviewing standards,
            however, the greatest challenge facing researchers working with reviews of translated literature is how difficult
            these sources are to identify on a mass scale. Most pre-existing catalogues of reviews, such as the <hi
            rend="italic">Canadian Book Review Annual</hi>, and digital periodical platforms (<hi rend="italic">Nuit
            blanche</hi> <note> <ref target="https://nuitblanche.com/commentaire-lecture"
            >https://nuitblanche.com/commentaire-lecture</ref>, accessed April 22, 2024.</note> being a good example) do not
            allow one to filter by a translator’s name and fail to tag translations in any consistent way, thus making
            anything except semi-manual extraction impossible. In many ways, these review repositories are structured in a
            similar way to the online library catalogues that will be discussed in the next section. Such catalogues have
            been criticized since their conception in the mid-90s, for being “[...] arranged on the assumption that searchers
            arrive at the catalog knowing at least one of the three access points (author, title, or subject)” (Borgman 1996,
            495). Under these conditions, researchers seeking reviews of translations must proceed via proxy: filtering for
            known translations, translated authors, or translators; keyword searches for variations of the verb “to
            translate” or the nouns “translation” and “translator” in different languages; or looking for mentions of foreign
            languages. In all cases, exhaustive studies of these digital sources are impossible, and translations published
            by smaller presses, translated by lesser-known translators, or from marginalized languages that have been more
            thoroughly rendered invisible by the editing or review process are not likely to be uncovered by any of these
            methods.</p>
          <p>We can thus see that the implications of translation invisibility in the literary press are multiple. In this
            section, our particular focus will be on using reviewing practices in periodicals to broaden our understanding of
            “invisibility” beyond the single axis of “translator invisibility.” While large corpora of peritextual
            information in review headers can indeed act as a proxy for translator and translation visibility in the target
            publishing context, we will also be looking at how qualitative analyses of individual reviews showcase the
            reviewing and crediting practices that work to foreground or background translation in the literary press. As
            Wakabayashi (2019) underlines, quantitative DH methods allow “[...] greater focus on the ‘mundane’ translations
            that constitute the bulk of translation history” (134), thereby identifying overarching institutional, cultural,
            and editorial trends from which a handful of exceptional items emerge. Hence, mixed methods are useful in
            revealing different<hi rend="italic"> degrees</hi> of invisibility, i.e., why and how translations are made
            (in)visible by certain agents in particular contexts.</p>

          <head>Interpreting (In)visibility in Translation Reviewing: The Case of the Quill &amp; Quire and the Montreal
            Review of Books</head>
          <p>In order to illustrate the difficulties and possibilities facing researchers working with translations in the
            literary press, we will outline our experience curating datasets of translation reviews from two Canadian
            literary periodicals, the Toronto-based <hi rend="italic">Quill &amp; Quire </hi>(<hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi>)
            and the Montreal-based <hi rend="italic">Montreal Review of Books</hi> (<hi rend="italic">mRb</hi>). As a result
            of these journals’ position in two distinct English-language literary systems, Anglo-Canadian and Anglo-Québécois
            respectively, both their reviewing practices illustrate the well-documented trend of translation invisibility yet
            showcase wholly different rapports with translated literature. We found that, while translation invisibility
            remains relatively stable over time in the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi>, the space dedicated to translations in
            the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> — a purportedly “Québécois” publication — has increased over time.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> is a Canadian literary periodical founded in 1935 aimed at writers, editors,
            and other professionals in the publishing industry. It is published in two formats, digitally (since 2004, with
            an archive of reviews dating back to 1996) and physically (with 10 issues annually). It has a circulation of
            5,000 copies per print issue, reviewing around 40 books every time. Notably, the periodical boasts “the most
            comprehensive look at Canadian-authored books in the country” (<hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> 2013), making it a
            particularly interesting window for researchers studying this publishing landscape. The <hi rend="italic"
            >mRb</hi>, founded in 1997, is the official review of the Association of English-language Publishers of Quebec.
            It is also published both digitally (with an archive of issues dating back to 2000) and in print (thrice
            annually). Each print issue has a circulation of 45,000 copies and reviews 29 books on average (<hi rend="italic"
            >mRb</hi> 2022). The publication is characterized by a geographical specificity, focusing on books whose “author,
            publisher, illustrator, or translator [is] based in the province of Quebec” (<hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> 2021),
            thus making it an ideal point from which to study the intersection of French- and English-language writing in the
            province. The study we describe here was founded on the digital version of the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi>
            <note> <ref target="https://quillandquire.com/review/">https://quillandquire.com/review/</ref>, accessed April
            22, 2024.</note> and the digital archive of paper issues of the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> between 2000 and
            2020<note> <ref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20201029060549/https://mtlreviewofbooks.ca/archives/"

          <p>Due to differences in reviewing standards at both these publications, our corpus assembly varied from journal to
            journal. While the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> meticulously includes the translator’s name below the author’s in
            every review peritext, the translator is only sporadically included among the contributors in <hi rend="italic"
            >Q&amp;Q </hi>reviews. The relative sizes of the journals also played a significant role in study design: on the
            one hand, with a total number of 1,700 reviews, the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> was well suited to semi-manual
            corpus assembly; on the other, the 7,642 reviews published in the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> were
            automatically extracted using Web Scraper<note> <ref target="https://webscraper.io/"
            >https://webscraper.io/</ref>, accessed April 22, 2024.</note>. As summarized in figure 1, using the presence of
            a translator in the review header as a proxy, this approach yielded two corpora: 255 translation reviews in the
            <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> (15% of the total) and 127 translation reviews in the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi>
            (1.6% of the total). Already, we see a large discrepancy in reviewing practices, leading us to understand that
            “translation invisibility” should be nuanced according to the degree of literary contact taking place (here,
            between Canadian, Québécois and Anglo-Québécois literature). Though it is impossible to know how many
            translations our scrape of the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> missed without a manual verification, the disparity
            in reviewing translations is immediately apparent (see figure 1): despite having nearly four and half times as
            many reviews as the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> seems to have reviewed (or at
            least identified) only half as many translated books in the same twenty-year period. In this case, we see that
            the regional specificity of the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi>, which insists on Québec-published books regardless of
            source language, leads to a greater consideration for translators and translations in the periodical’s reviewing
            and crediting standards than in those of the pan-Canadian, predominantly Anglophone <hi rend="italic"
            >Q&amp;Q</hi>. Indeed, even if a greater number of translations was reviewed in the <hi rend="italic"
            >Q&amp;Q</hi> between 2000 and 2020, their invisibility in the periodical is nevertheless revelatory when placed
            in relation to the credited translations in the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi>.</p>

            >Q&amp;Q</hi> between 2000 and 2020</p>
          <p>While our research revealed key differences in the reviewing standards of two Anglophone journals based in the
            same country, illustrating unique features of the Anglo-Canadian and Anglo-Québécois reviewing practices with
            regard to translation, there are also many similarities. In-text mentions of translation and translators in <hi
            rend="italic">mRb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q </hi>reviews are quantitatively quite similar. For example,
            if one compares the median number of sentences dedicated to the discussion of the translation in the body of
            reviews (figure 2). Between 2000 and 2020, in the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
            >mRb</hi> alike, only one sentence out of each review is used to review the translator’s work or to comment on
            the quality of the translation process. A quantitative picture of the reviews reveals that almost 40% of all
            reviews in both periodicals make no mention of translation whatsoever:</p>

          <p>As we see in figure 2, only a marginal number of reviews in the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >Q&amp;Q</hi> take note of translation issues and comment on them in length. The traditional paradigm of
            translation invisibility does not appear to have been challenged in any meaningful way. The same impression
            persists on when we zoom in from a sentence- to a word-level analysis of these translation reviews. For instance,
            the 25 most frequent words employed in reviews of translated books in the two journals were near identical

          <p>What is most striking about these two lists is their similarity in terms of both words present and ranking.
            Translation remains a marginal question, with few words on these lists used to describe the process — we should
            note the presence of “French,” “English” (among the top 10 in both columns of figure 3), “translation,” and
            “language,” but the absence of the word “translator”<note> While this article deals primarily with so-called
            translation invisibility, it is important to note that many other figures involved in book publishing have also
            been marginalized to various degrees — editors, literary agents, and cover artists, for instance — and are
            equally absent from these reviews and lie beyond the scope of our analysis. For a discussion of editorial
            invisibility, for instance, see Taivalkoski-Shilov (2013); Glinoer and Lefort-Favreau (2019).</note> as well as
            any evaluative terms relating to this agent’s work. At first view, it does indeed appear as though both these
            periodicals treat translated literature nearly identically. Figure 3 plausibly suggests that the <hi
            rend="italic">mRb</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> have adopted similar postures, both tending to
            marginalize translated literature in book reviews.</p>
          <p>Yet, what our synchronic, distant reading of these reviews and their peritextual information in the respective
            periodicals has not revealed are the micro-trends that demonstrate the many ways in which translation
            invisibility evolved between 2000 and 2020 and how it has been leveraged by editors to suit other cultural or
            literary agendas. In order to interpret these relatively “silent” corpora of translation reviews and their
            peritexts, we must pair our previous DH analysis with a diachronic, close reading of the data revealed by these
            preliminary quantitative analyses. A closer analysis of translation reviews in the <hi rend="italic"
            >Q&amp;Q</hi>, for instance, revealed a series of outliers that showcase various editorial strategies that have
            contributed to increasing the visibility of translations<note> The results of this analysis of <hi rend="italic"
            >Q&amp;Q</hi> reviews were first presented at the CATS 35th annual congress in May 2023.</note>. We see, for
            instance, that the presence of the translator’s name on the cover, a translator’s note, or a glossary all
            increase the chances of a thorough translation review (see Wells 2009; Whiteman 2014). This is the case for works
            such as <hi rend="italic">One</hi>, written by Serge Thibodeau and translated by Jo-Ann Elder, which features the
            translator’s name and input prominently. The reviewer, Zachariah Wells, dedicated over three quarters (77%) of
            the review’s sentences to translation commentary and distinguishes between the original ( <hi rend="italic">Seul
            on est</hi>) and the translation, which he calls “Elder’s <hi rend="italic">One</hi>” (2009, parag. 4). In
            another notable case, half of the body of the review of <hi rend="italic">Sanaaq</hi> by Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk,
            translated from Inuktitut into French by Bernard Saladin d’Anglure and from French into English by Peter Frost,
            is used to discuss translation. While the review is not positive — “the constant pain to which an English reader
            is put to check the glossary for untranslated Inuktitut words becomes tiresome” (Whiteman 2014, parag. 3) — it
            quickly becomes clear that its author’s Inuit background is of great interest when it comes to translation.
            Reviewer Bruce Whiteman concludes that <hi rend="italic">Sanaaq</hi> is “an important cultural and literary
            document” (parag. 3) that can now be read by English-speaking readers.</p>
          <p>Similar trends characterize translation reviews in the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi>. Not only did we find an
            evolution in the types of translation commentary over time, with an increasing number of reviews interested in
            translator agency and source-culture representation (e.g., Webster 2016; Miller 2019; Garlick 2020), but a high
            number of reviews in this periodical are also written by fellow translators<note> For a close reading and
            analysis of translation reviews published in the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> between 2000 and 2020, see Roman
            2022, 47-67.</note>. For example, while early reviews in the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> tended to focus on how
            “[e]ach language has a unique syntactic style that defies perfect translation” (Smith 2003, parag. 7), later
            reviews praised the “creative” choices made by certain translators — “[Oana Avasilichioaei’s] creative use of the
            pronouns <hi rend="italic">s/he</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hir</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hirself</hi>, <hi
            rend="italic">e</hi>, <hi rend="italic">em</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">eir</hi> when representing Tiresias while
            in a state of flux is especially inspired” (Garlick 2020, parag. 4). Additionally, certain reviews of canonical
            Québécois texts by figures like Dany Laferrière (Bourgeois 2009) and Kim Thúy (Moser 2014) conduct interviews
            with the authors in English and strategically avoid identifying these works as translations. These choices
            contribute to the geographical specificity of the Anglo-Québécois literary repertoire represented in the <hi
            rend="italic">mRb</hi> and illustrating how translation invisibility can be instrumentalized in certain target
            culture contexts<note> For the reverse trend, that is the assimilation of Anglo-Québécois translated into French
            in Quebec, see Lane-Mercier 2018, 461-466; Leconte 2019, 114-115</note>.</p>
          <p>As we can see, though predominant reviewing standards tending to invisibilize translations in the literary press
            apply at both the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi>, interpretative strategies
            abound and allow us to draw conclusions that go beyond an unfaceted translation invisibility framework. The
            examples above illustrate the importance of mixed methods for these readings: starting with classic DH synchronic
            distant readings, which tend to flatten differences between our sources and make invisibility stand out, and
            turning next toward diachronic, context-informed close readings of the results generated. As demonstrated in the
            case of the <hi rend="italic">Q&amp;Q</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">mRb</hi>, while distant reading methods
            provide us with a general context for a larger corpus of translations and their reviews, close readings reveal
            evolutions in predominant conceptions and expectations of translated literature as well as certain strategic
            manipulations of literary repertoires by translators, editors, and reviewers alike. As we will see in library
            collections and catalogues, the invisibility of translations in the literary press is incredibly multifaceted and
            nuanced, demonstrating the contribution of large-scale corpus studies of these new sources of information. These
            newly available corpora of texts can now be studied on a great enough scale to make their apparent silence speak
            volumes, revealing patterns that could not be registered through older, traditionally text-focused methods in
            translation studies.</p>

          <head>Cataloguing Translations and the Library as a Living Archive</head>
          <p>“Each catalog record is the product of a complex yet hidden negotiation between a cataloguer and the constraints
            of library systems and practices.” (Belantara and Bradinski 2022, 1)</p>
          <p>As Belantara and Bradinski point out in their 2022 ethnographic study of cataloguers at work, library
            cataloguing is still a black box, and practices can sometimes be revealed only by close collaboration with the
            librarians who create this metadata<note> Belantara and Bradinski’s study showed to what extent cataloguing
            practices represent a process of negotiation of the cataloguer with the existing metadata standards such as MARC.
            They claim that “[m]etadata reflects a compromise between what the cataloger knows about an item and the existing
            system into which she is bound to embed it” (Belantara and Bradinski 2022, 4).</note>. For example, when
            approaching the DNB’s digital services (<hi rend="italic">Abteilung Digitale Dienste der Deutschen
            Nationalbibliothek</hi>) for curating a dataset of German fiction in translation (see Teichmann 2022), we noted
            that it was possible to query the catalogue and filter the collection for translations using the language field
            contained in the metadata. What was less obvious, and what DNB librarians confirmed, is that the language field
            had only been in use for items catalogued since 1996, meaning that the metadata from before that date was still
            being updated. This shift highlights the fact that translation invisibility is strongly tied to cataloguing and
            collection practices<note> In this article, cataloguing practices encompasses the process of how the information
            on the records (author, publisher, year, edition, etc.) is curated and published in the online catalogue so that
            the user can browse, filter, and access the collection as well as the bibliographic data. Accordingly, the online
            catalogue represents the interface or index that allows us to see what the collection contains. In comparison,
            collection practices describe the process of adding editions to the library collection according to the deposit
            regulations — described in detail in the last subsection.</note>, not mention that metadata standards that need
            to be contextualized and documented over time<note> Hence, researchers should be cautious to either run analyses
            on recent data (e.g., a researcher may choose to exclude pre-1996 data extracted from the DNB), or contextualize
            changing cataloguing practices when dealing with earlier DNB datasets. </note>. We can think of the library as a
            living archive, where entries and their information are added and redacted on a running basis. Hence, it can be
            challenging to unravel on what basis translations are catalogued, how they are catalogued, and in what ways they
            can be extracted using a replicable method. This, in turn, results in the sparsity and rare utilization of
            library metadata for curating a translation dataset.</p>
          <p>As evoked in the introduction, translation datasets remain sparse in and beyond DH. Additionally, due to the
            lack of a formalized method with respect to cataloguing practices and standards, it remains difficult to access
            and extract bibliographic data on translations from national collections. Diana Roig-Sanz and Laura Folica (2021,
            242) stress that libraries as sources for metadata remain largely unexploited, while scholars like Susan Pickford
            have repeatedly insisted on how incomplete existing databases such as the <hi rend="italic">Index
            Translationum</hi> or VIAF are for bibliographic translation data<note> A data quality assessment of these
            databases revealed that their translation data appears to be less comprehensive as compared to the German
            National Library (see Teichmann 2022, 56-58).</note>. Bibliographic data<note> According to the Bibliographic
            Data Working Group (BDWG), “[b]ibliographical data are structured information about the form, content, and
            context of documents in any form (textual, graphic, musical notation, etc.) or medium (printed, electronic,
            etc.)” (Umerle et al. 2022, 6).</note> contain information on the author, publisher, language, etc. of a given
            edition and are typically collected and maintained by libraries (see Umerle et al. 2022, 12)<note> Bibliographic
            data on translations is also collected by companies for marketing purposes or other institutions such as UNESCO
            in case of the <hi rend="italic">Index Translationum</hi>, publishing agencies, foundations, or alliances such as
            Bücher in Zahlen, Literatures Across Frontiers, European, and the Federation of European Publishers. The BDWG
            also notes that “[t]oday OCLC’s WorldCat is the main service used to access the currently collected contents of
            library catalogues” (Umerle et al. 2022, 25). This is the case for the German National Library, though their
            collection and deposit regulations differ slightly, which we discuss in the last subsection of this case
            study.</note> according to strict metadata standards such as MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloguing record)<note>
            MARC can be defined as a “[s]tandard for the representation and exchange of data in machine-readable form”
            (Umerle et al. 2022, 115), which “provides the mechanism by which computers exchange, use, and interpret
            bibliographic information, and its data elements make up the foundation of most library catalogs used today” (see
            “Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Network Development and MARC Standards Office, Library of Congress.” <ref
            target="https://www.loc.gov/marc/faq.html#definition">https://www.loc.gov/marc/faq.html#definition</ref>,
            accessed August 23, 2023).</note>, Dublin Core, or the Library of Congress Classification. Translations bring
            with them specific characteristics to bibliographic data, one of them being that language has a rather high
            importance, and an imposed relationship to an original edition (which may or may not be documented). Additional
            creators of translated editions, such as translators, original publishers, etc., also need to be contained in the
            bibliographic data. All this information indicates to the user of the library catalogue whether the edition is a
            translation or not, a fact which is not always apparent and poses specific challenges for the extraction of
            bibliographic data. An additional issue is that translation-specific information may be in the metadata but not
            included in the online catalogue, which further marginalizes translations. Utilizing the library’s bibliographic
            translation data therefore requires that the data be available, accessible, and that cataloguing practices make
            it possible to extract them.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, as we saw in the previous section and continue to illustrate below, this can be very challenging:
            the invisibility of translations in library catalogues results in a sparsity of translation data, which
            oftentimes prompts scholars to curate a dataset semi-manually (Roman 2022; Norrick-Rühl and Bold 2016; Zhou and
            Sun 2017; Pickford 2016). Projects that make use of bibliographic translation data are therefore mainly
            case-study specific and limited to the translations of a single author, such as the <hi rend="italic">Jane
            Eyre</hi> project by Reynolds and Vitali (2021); a single genre; a single source or target language, such as
            Philipp Hofeneders work on visualizing translation spaces of 19th-century Russia (Hofeneder 2022) or the project
            Intra-Belgian literary translations since 1970 (BELTRANS).<note> The Digital Library &amp; Bibliography for
            Literature in Translation and Adaptation (DLBT) is another constantly expanding project that collects
            bibliographic data on translation from national libraries such as the DNB and from research projects.</note>
            While these studies do use bibliographic data and sometimes draw on library collections for their datasets, they
            also all highlight the necessity for semi-manual curation due to the difficulties in identifying translations in
            the respective library catalogues, extracting these records, and the limitations in applying these methods to
            other sources of data<note> Several scholars working with translation data have noted similar difficulties in a
            panel discussion on big translation history that took place at the Congress of the European Society for
            Translation Studies in Stellenbosch in September of 2019 (see Vimr 2020).</note>.</p>
          <p>An important issue with former, case-study specific studies is that manual data curation practises do not allow
            for the (re)use of formalized operations that can be replicated, both in terms of data extraction and
            quantitative analyses that can be generalized across different datasets. As we show in this section, extracting
            bibliographic translation data from different libraries (since researchers often work with more than one source:
            for Germanophone literature, we have the Swiss, German, and Austrian national libraries besides the German, while
            for Québécois Francophone literature, we must work with Québec and the French library collections) poses
            challenges and highlights the limitations and possibilities of harvesting these data with a single formalized
            method. The aim of presenting this case study hence is to describe cataloguing and collection practices as well
            as metadata standards for translations to develop a replicable workflow for their extraction so that researchers
            can use the (in)visibility of translations in various national collections to their advantage in curating and
            analyzing bibliographic translation datasets.</p>

          <p>The information that indicates whether a given edition is in fact a translation is not always in the same place
            in the online library catalogues, and it can be difficult to differentiate a translation from an original
            edition. The main challenge here is that, when it comes to a library collection or online catalogue, a
            translation is treated as another edition of a publication. Translations thus do not form a distinct category, as
            do genres or topics. Additionally, in most collections, it is not possible to trace a translation back to its
            original<note> Indeed, this information tends to be omitted in printed versions of books as well, making it
            difficult to know with which edition of a book a given translator worked with when producing their
            translation.</note>. The information on languages and translators is also not contained in the same fields across
            library catalogues. This is one of the central challenges in identifying and extracting bibliographic data on
            translations in national libraries. We hence need to ask: how can we discern translations from other catalogue
            entries, and can we formulate a rule that allows us to identify and extract translations across different library
            collections? In this section, we exemplify differences in cataloguing practices by looking at three national
            library online catalogues — the BAnQ, the ÖNB, and the DNB — explore the challenges they present, and propose
            solutions for extracting bibliographic translation data.</p>
          <p>Let us begin by looking at a couple of examples of translations in these three online library catalogues as
            presented to any user searching for a translation. What indicates that this is a translation and where can this
            information be found? We will be using Patrick Süskind’s bestselling novel <hi rend="italic">Das Parfum</hi>,
            which has been translated into numerous languages, as an example.</p>

          <p>When looking up the English translation of Süskind’s <hi rend="italic">Das Parfum</hi> in the DNB online
            catalogue, we can immediately see the fields indicating the edition’s language in addition to the original
            language. As figure 4 shows, besides the translator in the “Titel” (title) field and the original title in the
            “Werk(e)” (works) field, the DNB online catalogue has a “Sprache” (language) field that includes the original
            language (an excellent indicator for our definition of translation). This mandatory field is really simple to
            work with, since we may easily formulate a rule for it — -a translation is any edition that has an
            “Originalsprache(n),” (original languages), next to the language of the edition. The language field in the DNB
            follows ISO conventions for languages and is therefore consistent across all entries, with a standardized format.
            Thus, even though a separate field or category for translation does not exist in the online catalogue, as is the
            case for the BAnQ, it is possible to distinguish a translation by the language field. For comparison, let us look
            at the BAnQ and ONB and see if they also keep a language field, to which we could theoretically apply the same
            rule for identifying translations.</p>

          <p>When searching the BAnQ’s online catalogue for Süskind’s <hi rend="italic">Perfume</hi>, there are indications
            that we are dealing with a translated work in the “Title” field, which contains the translator’s name, and in the
            “Preferred Title” field, which contains the edition’s language but not the original language. Besides the
            indicator “translated by,” there is no separate category that distinguishes this edition as a translation from an
            original edition. Additionally, the “Content” field contains the categorical descriptor “Romans allemands – 20e
            siècle” (German novels – 20th century), which stresses the importance of categorizing editions according to their
            national literature in the BAnQ. This can also be an indicator of translation, albeit on an implied basis. It is
            important to note that there is no other field in the online catalogue containing the original language or title,
            which, as the next example shows, is also the case for the ÖNB<note> The same is the case for the Library and
            Archives Canada online catalogue, which does not include the original title or an additional language field for
            the original language. See <ref target="https://bac-lac.on.worldcat.org/oclc/59166116"

          <p>Unlike the DNB but similarly to the BAnQ, the ÖNB online catalogue does not have a field for a work’s original
            language in its online catalogue. Some indicators that this edition is a translation can be found in the field
            “Weitere Beteiligte” (additional participants), which includes the “ÜbersetzerIn” (translator), and the field
            “Verantwort.angabe,” (responsible entity), which includes the note “Trad. de” (translated by). Again, there is no
            separate field for translation as its own category. If we wanted to identify all translations of Kafka, we would
            have to look for any edition that either has a translator in the “Weitere Beteiligte” field or search for all the
            different variations of the phrase “Trad. de” in each language — for English we had “Trans.” or “translated from”
            in the examples above. In either case, formulating a rule based on these fields is challenging and has a larger
            error margin due to the numerous variations. Going by language field, as for the DNB online catalogue, seems much
            more feasible.</p>
          <p>What these examples of translations in various online catalogues — all revelatory of the general trend to
            invisibilize translations — illustrate are the plethora of cataloguing practices at work in each library<note> In
            addition, a certain level of expertise is required to successfully query the online catalogues for translations,
            a difficulty that was pointed out by Borgman as early as 1996. Currently, most query languages do not contain an
            option to only display translations since, as our examples show, translations are not visibly categorized as
            such.</note>. How, then, can we utilize the metadata and especially the language fields to propose a solution for
            identifying translations in these different libraries despite their overall invisibility in these catalogues?</p>

          <head>Extracting Translations from Libraries: A Replicable Method Using the Language Fields in MARC Records</head>
          <p>For a formalized, replicable method of extraction of translation metadata from library collections, we may
            formulate a “rule” based on the language field, according to a linguistic definition of translation — presuming
            that the translated edition has a different original language than the current edition<note> Smith-Yoshimura
            proposed to identify translations by using the author/title field in the bibliographic data from WorldCat in
            combination with Wikidata to establish whether it exists in another language. If it was the case, it could be
            classified as a translation (see Smith-Yoshimura 2017).</note>. To extract translations from the DNB, we can
            write a query that finds any edition with both an original and other language listed. In the catalogue, this
            appears as “Originalsprache(n),” which is included only for translations, while “Sprache” is used to indicate the
            given edition’s language<note> A similar definition has also been used for extracting data from the Biblioteca
            Nacional de Espana by Roig-Sanz and Folica (2020).</note>. A search for the original language (“spo”) in the DNB,
            “spo=ger”<note> For ISO language codes see: <ref
            target="https://www.dnb.de/DE/Service/Hilfe/Katalog/kataloghilfeExpertensuche_node.html"

            accessed August 23, 2023.</note>, for instance, yields all titles that originally appeared in German. We can
            hence apply this rule with high confidence that it will yield only translations<note> For a quality assessment of
            the resulting data extracted from the DNB using this query see Teichmann 2022, 60–65.</note>. The question
            remains if the same rule can be applied to the other library catalogues, such as the ÖNB and the BAnQ, even in
            the absence of an original language field in their online catalogues.</p>
          <p>Metadata standards are a precondition for applying this (and other) rule(s) across catalogues and extracting
            large quantities of bibliographic translation data for analysis. The catalogues in question hence need to contain
            a language field. In the online catalogues, this field is only visible for the DNB, but not for the ÖNB and BAnQ.
            However, since all these catalogues follow the same standards for bibliographic metadata in a fixed MARC or MARC
            21 format, we can therefore utilize the MARC 21 fields and operationalize the search query to extract
            translations. How do the fields containing the original language (which are specific to DNB and do not appear in
            BAnQ or ÖNB catalogues) translate to MARC 21 as a standard format? Let us have a look at our Süskind translation,
            extracted in MARC 21 from the DNB:</p>
          <figure>

            2023.</p>
          <p>There are several mandatory fields in MARC 21 for language. Field 008, for instance, contains the language of
            the edition (the record in figure 4 contains “eng” in the language field). Additionally, we have three more
            subfields that contain information on the languages:</p>
          <p>040‡b Cataloguing Source / Language of Cataloguing 041 Language Code 41ǂh Original Language<note> “MARC Code
            List for Languages,” 2007. <ref target="https://www.loc.gov/marc/languages/introduction.pdf"
            >https://www.loc.gov/marc/languages/introduction.pdf</ref>, accessed August 23, 2023.</note></p>
          <p>For the Süskind record above, field 041 contains “eng” or the language of the edition, while subfield 41ǂh, more
            importantly, contains the original language (“ger”). This is the field that has been made visible in the online
            catalogue of the DNB. Hence, using the information in MARC 21 field 41ǂh, we could apply our rule and query the
            catalogue for any entries that have German (“ger”) as an original language under the assumption that these are
            translations. Indeed, according to OCLC standards, 41ǂh is a required field (if applicable) and hence should
            include original language of a translation<note> See OCLC. “041 Language Code (R).” <ref
            target="https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/041.html#subfieldh"
            >https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/041.html#subfieldh</ref>, accessed April 18, 2024. The same applies to
            ExLibris, who provide services to most European national libraries. See ExLibris. “MARC 21 Indizes.” <ref

            accessed April 18, 2024.</note>. Additionally, there is the option to add information on whether the edition is a
            translation as a first indicator (see field 41 “ind1”). If this translation indication is set to “ind1=‘1’” then,
            according to OCLC standards, “the work is or includes a translation and is used regardless of whether the work in
            the original language has been published”<note> OCLC. “041 Language Code (R).” <ref
            target="https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/041.html">https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/041.html</ref>,
            accessed August 23, 2023.</note>. As we can see in figure 4, however, the first indicator for field 41 is left
            blank, which suggests that the indicator (which categorizes the edition as a translation) is not consistently
            used in some libraries’ metadata.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, even without the first indicator, the information on original and edition language in the 41
            language field is a consistent and reliable source of information to identify and extract the editions that are
            translations. Since field 41 is required according to OCLC standards and according to the ÖNB’s documentation,
            these (sub)fields’ metadata should be included<note> See OBV Wiki. “041 Sprachcode.” <ref

            We can now test whether our filter based on language can be applied to other library collections for identifying
            translations. Let us retrieve the MARC file for the French Kafka translation in the ÖNB catalogue we mentioned
            above<note> While the DNB online catalogue provides the option to export any record in MARC 21 to the user, for
            the ÖNB catalogue this is only possible by using a Python code or manually, by first looking up the Metadata
            Management System ID (MMS-ID), the AC-Nummer, or the barcode and adding it to a custom link: <ref

          <p>As we can see in figure 5, the ÖNB uses the 41 field and h subfield for translation, but not the first
            indicator. Again, this confirms that our rule based on original language to extract translations can be applied
            not only to the DNB, but also the ÖNB, despite apparent differences in their visible online catalogues. This
            formalized method can thus be used across different libraries to filter translations, offering a solution to the
            invisibility and inconsistency challenges researchers face. However, the practice of including only the
            information from the bibliographic data on original language and not the first indicator that would categorize
            the edition as a translation (even though it is so valuable and important for translation researchers) highlights
            the marginal status of translations in our cultural institutions, a fact even more apparent in collection
            practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Availability and Accessibility of Library Translation Data</head>
          <p>Now that we have established that we can utilize the metadata standards and the language fields to identify
            translations, we also need to establish whether and to what extent libraries even collect translations. As the
            astute reader will have noticed, the last example for cataloguing practices mentioned above is not Süskind’s <hi
            rend="italic">Perfume</hi>, but Franz Kafka’s <hi rend="italic">La métamorphose</hi>. Indeed, the ÖNB’s catalogue
            does not contain any translations by Süskind, because the library does not collect them in the first place<note>
            See <ref target="https://search.onb.ac.at/permalink/f/sb7jht/ONB_alma21252938780003338"
            >https://search.onb.ac.at/permalink/f/sb7jht/ONB_alma21252938780003338</ref>, accessed August 23, 2023.</note>.
            When approaching a library to obtain bibliographic data, we oftentimes need to contact the responsible librarians
            and ask not only whether they collect translation data but when and how much. As the ÖNB catalogue illustrates,
            not all libraries collect translations to the same extent and in the same manner. When we contacted the ÖNB to
            ask whether they collect translations, they confirmed that they only do so to a very limited extent. Indeed, in
            addition to cataloguing practices, collection practices condition the (in)visibility of translations. This brings
            us to our second challenge: just as the representation of the bibliographic data varies for each catalogue, so
            too does data availability and accessibility. Collection practices — the rate, amount, and type of publications
            that are collected by national libraries — are by no means standardized, a problem that also affects data
            availability<note> A discussion of the influence of WorldCat on the national library’s collection policies of
            translation lies beyond the scope of this study. The DNB shares bibliographic data with WorldCat, however, to
            what extent that applies to translations has yet to be investigated. As looking at the DNB, the ONB, and the BAnQ
            suggest, the collection practices are first and foremost tied to their deposit regulations and not to enriching
            their catalogue with data from WorldCat. However, these national libraries may still share their data with
            WorldCat, for which case I argue that documenting collection and cataloguing practices on a national level “can
            reveal the ways these large-scale discovery systems are built” (Belantara and Bradinski 2022, 2). How often, how
            many records, and which records are shared by national libraries with global databases such as OCLC or VIAF has
            yet to be studied.</note>. Not all national libraries collect translations or editions published outside of their
            national boundaries, due to budget and resource constraints, for instance. Depending on a national library’s
            priorities, users, resources, and staff, translations may or may not be collected. Coming back to Belantara and
            Bradinski, when working on bibliographic data we need to remind ourselves that “[m]etadata reflects a compromise
            between what the cataloguer knows about an item and the existing system into which she is bound to embed it”
            (Belantara and Bradinski 2022, 4). Hence, whether and how translations are catalogued and collected is not only
            due to the cataloguers at work, but also the institutional policies, standards, and practices. This subsection is
            thus dedicated to the collection practices in the institutional system and the resulting availability and
            accessibility of bibliographic translation data.</p>
          <p>From the examples of the online catalogues above, we can get a sense of which national libraries collect
            translations and which do not, or more precisely which authors they collect — the ÖNB did not have translations
            of Süskind, but of Kafka. While this may be conditioned by a library’s target readerbase, it comes down to the
            library’s collection policy. The DNB, for instance, has a legal deposit regulation (Pflichtablieferungsverordnung
            or PflAV) that includes translations. It therefore collects “all publications issued in Germany, irrespective of
            their language,” and “media works published abroad for which a publisher or a person who has a legal domicile,
            business premises or their principal residence in Germany has sold (licensed) the right to publish the work
            abroad”<note> Deutsche Nationalbibliothek. “Unser Sammelauftrag.” <ref

            2023. In comparison, the Library and Archives of Canada collect any publications on a selective basis that are of
            interest to Canada, which may reach beyond the national boundaries (see <ref
            target="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/l-7.7/page-1.html"
            >https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/l-7.7/page-1.html</ref>, accessed August 23, 2023).</note>. However,
            which authors’ translations are collected may depend on many factors, including readership. Again, translations
            do not explicitly appear in any of the lists of works collected, which underlines their invisibility and the
            challenges in establishing whether a library collects translations published outside of their official languages
            or geographic borders. A collection policy or deposit regulation that explicitly reaches beyond the linguistic
            and geographic borders is a good indicator of whether a library collects translations.</p>
          <p>Finally, data accessibility may vary for each library and lead to severe usage restrictions. Not all libraries
            give free access to their data. For instance, even though MARC 21 is also a metadata standard in Canadian
            libraries<note> “Normes MARC 21.” <ref target="https://www.marc21.ca/M21/BIB/B003-ListeDesZones.html#B4XX"
            >https://www.marc21.ca/M21/BIB/B003-ListeDesZones.html#B4XX</ref>, accessed August 23, 2023.</note>, the Library
            and Archives of Canada only provide access to MARC records for their employees. Similarly, the BAnQ does not
            provide any access to its MARC records, and information on how to access these data is difficult to find. These
            differences between the Germanophone national libraries and the Canadian libraries highlight the last major
            challenge we will discuss in this section for extracting bibliographic translation data from libraries arising
            from institutional practices: data accessibility. As figure 9 illustrates, access to data ranges from accessible
            and extractable in various formats (DNB) to limited access (BAnQ):</p>

          <p>Compared to the ÖNB and BAnQ, the DNB gives the most access to its bibliographic data, allowing users to freely
            extract the data directly from the online catalogue in large batches and various formats, and to re-publish their
            data under a universal license. Their Datenshop online portal allows registered users to query the online
            catalogue by original language, for instance, and to save their selection and extract it. This makes
            bibliographic data from the DNB accessible and easy to find, extract, and publish. For comparison, the ÖNB does
            not have any such option, and records can only be individually, manually selected and extracted from the online
            catalogue. For extraction in batches with specific search queries, the ÖNB offers an SRU (Search/Retrieve via
            URL) and an OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative Protocol) service for extracting data in MARCXML (MARC data in an
            XML environment). Additionally, a Gitlab repository<note> <ref

          <p>The BAnQ is the least accessible in terms of their bibliographic data. While they do supply some summary
            statistics on the BAnQ’s new acquisitions, full bibliographic records can only be obtained on a case-by-case
            basis by communicating directly with the institution. As preliminary data exploration of their collections has
            shown (see Brissette et al. 2023), the sharing of data for publication is not allowed. Comparing the DNB and ÖNB
            to the BAnQ clearly highlights the differences in availability and accessibility as well as the difficulties
            researchers face when trying to establish whether translation data is available to them and whether they can
            freely use and publish them.</p>

        <head>Next Steps: Toward a Snapshot Repository Documenting Collection Practices</head>
        <p>Coming back to our initial argument, collection and cataloguing practices give a good indication of the status of
          translations in the respective institutions and their practices as well as their agency in rendering this
          information accessible and available to the public. An open data policy, a legal deposit regulation that extends
          beyond linguistic and geographic boundaries, as well as close collaboration with the libraries are conditional for
          working with bibliographic translation data.</p>
        <p>One of the next steps toward a big translation history is to make visible not only translations but also the
          libraries’ respective collection practices. In this section we therefore propose a replicable workflow — using the
          query by original language in MARC records — that allows us to extract data at different points in time to build a
          snapshot repository of the catalogue. Preliminary work (Teichmann 2022, 62–63) on extracting translations of German
          fiction in 2017 and 2019 from the German National Library has highlighted that titles are retroactively being added
          for previous years, especially between 1980 and 1990 (see figure 10):</p>
        <figure>
          <head/>
          <graphic url="media/image8.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Figure 10. Snapshots of translations of German fiction in the DNB library extracted in 2021 and 2019 (Teichmann
          2022, 62–63)</p>
        <p>Re-extracting the data with the same query at a later point in time allows us to observe how, when, and to what
          extent translations are collected over time. Additionally, it would be of value to operationalize and test the rule
          for extraction by original language on different catalogues and to compare the catalogued translations by looking
          at where they overlap or differ. In this way, the underlying institutional practices that contribute to the
          invisibility of translations can be made visible.</p>
        <p>Making translations across library catalogues (as well as cataloguing and collection practices, accessibility, and
          availability) visible and developing tools and datasets for doing so is thus a crucial endeavour to open up these
          rich resources and build the infrastructure for future studies in quantitative translation research. In alignment
          with the main research focus of critical archival studies, one may ask what role libraries play in the
          dissemination and collection of translations, what status translations have in a given literary culture, the
          international canonization of national canons, and most importantly the institutional practices that contribute to
          translation (in)visibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>As demonstrated in the documented case studies of Germanophone and Francophone national library collections and
          the Canadian literary press, translation invisibility is just as present in institutional and cultural standards as
          in the textual features of many translations and their paratexts. Indeed, our survey of the Canadian literary press
          as well as the German, Austrian, and Québécois national libraries’ cataloguing and collecting standards has
          revealed a tendency to marginalize translations. In library catalogues, “translation” is not its own category,
          translators and original editions are not consistently identified across languages, while some institutions forgo
          the collection of translated material altogether. What is more, these trends persist despite the presence of
          translation-specific and language fields in the metadata underlying library records. Similarly, reviewing standards
          in the Canadian literary press — specifically literary journals publishing reviews of translated literature — often
          do not account for the specific bibliographic information required to identify translations in the header and body
          of reviews. As a result, researchers face many challenges when assembling corpora of bibliographic data pertaining
          to translations drawn from these resources, mainly due to difficulties in identifying which books are translations
          in the first place.</p>
        <p>Despite the prevalence of what we have called “translation invisibility” in library catalogues and collections as
          well as in the literary press, we propose a number of solutions for data extraction and interpretation that future
          researchers can employ to overcome and use this invisibility to their advantage. In particular, we suggest that
          researchers rely on the predominantly linguistic definition of translation in use by libraries and utilize the
          language fields contained in MARC records to retrieve translations from library catalogues with a high degree of
          precision<note> For example, in a subset of 552 translated titles extracted from the DNB for the year 2020, only
          three were identified as false positives (non-translations), which accounts for the high precision and efficacy of
          the extraction method (Teichmann 2022, 60).</note>. We also encourage translation researchers to collaborate with
          librarians to understand and document collection practices over time. Additionally, bibliographic data should be
          extracted at various points in time in order to illustrate translation collection and cataloguing practices at
          different points throughout the duration of the research. When dealing with the literary press, we urge researchers
          to employ mixed methods, creating large datasets to quantitatively showcase translation (in)visibility within given
          publications on a large scale and at many levels, but following up with close readings of reviews themselves, which
          tend to nuance these preliminary impressions. Such qualitative analyses reveal the context-specific agents and
          motivations behind predominant trends that make translations invisible, which vary widely as we have seen.</p>
        <p>Additionally, factors such as publishing standards, a Eurocentric market, and illegitimate translations also
          result in translation marginalization outside the institutional and cultural trends we have discussed. Market
          reports such as the<hi rend="italic"> Literature Across Frontiers</hi> are mainly available for the European and
          North American markets, where copyright is more readily enforced. They thus do not account for the countless
          unauthorized translations in circulation — these included pirated books, fan-translated media, and illegal
          translations of censored content (see, for instance, Dwyer 2011, Karaganis 2011, and Nkiko 2014). Finally, the
          institutional standards of the literary press and national libraries are intimately enmeshed with those enforced by
          the publishing industry and (inter)national copyright policies. The challenges we discuss here are but one element
          of a larger network of cultural attitudes that affect the accessibility and availability of translation data and
          therefore the diversity of DH research on translation.</p>
        <p>Overall, we wish to sensitize digital humanists and translation scholars alike to the multiple facets of
          translation invisibility at work in quantitative and data-based studies of translated sources. While the apparent
          textual invisibility of the translator has been well documented in translation studies, the relatively recent
          accessibility of bibliographic data has not yet led to many reflections on the data-related aspects of translation
          invisibility. We hope that the challenges, solutions, and interpretative strategies proposed in this article will
          be of use to future researchers harnessing these data sources. Additionally, we hope the multidisciplinary nature
          of DH will increase the visibility of translations in other fields — including literature, information science, and
          archival studies — leading scholars to consider these institutional and cultural aspects of translation
          cataloguing, collection, and reviewing practices and to import them into their respective disciplines.</p>
