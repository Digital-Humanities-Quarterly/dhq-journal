                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  
                  <p>This article critiques the rhetoric of openness, accessibility and collaboration
                     that features largely in digital humanities literature by examining the status
                     of student labour, training and funding withinin the discipline. The authors
                     argue that the use of such rhetoric masks the hierarches that structure academic
                     spaces, and that a shift to the digital does not eliminate these structural
                     inequalities. Drawing on two surveys that assess student participation in DH
                     projects (one for students, and one for faculty researchers), the article
                     outlines the challenges currently faced by students working in the digital
                     humanities, and suggests a set of best practices that might bridge the disparity
                     between rhetoric and reality.

                     of 2013 at Simon Fraser University (SFU), one of the collections we engaged with
                     extensively was the recently published first digital anthology of the <cite class="title italic">PMLA</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Literary Studies in the
                        Digital Age: An Evolving Anthology</cite> (<cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite>), edited by Kenneth M. Price and Ray Siemens. In their
                     introduction, Price and Siemens characterize DH as a field that brings "a refreshing spirit of sharing, exchange, and
                     openness"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 10] to literary studies. The form of the publication itself seeks to embody
                     that ethos: it is described as an "evolving
                     anthology," inviting comments on its essays via a <cite class="title italic">Wordpress</cite> plugin, <cite class="title italic">CommentPress</cite>, that allows readers to enter comments on a
                     paragraph-by-paragraph basis. In attempting to create an interface that borrows
                     from social media platforms (enabling commenting, sharing, and archiving), the
                     <cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite> presents a new and attractive model for
                     critical engagement, scholarly production, peer review, and publication.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The model put forward in <cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite>, both in theory and
                     practice, enticed us. We had been reading and discussing the essays in the
                     anthology, and began to contemplate the comment function and our reluctance to
                     use it: were we qualified to comment on the work of such prominent scholars in
                     the field? Could our questions and comments be informal, or should they have the
                     polish of scholarly prose? What did we have to contribute to this ongoing
                     conversation? It seemed, too, that this reluctance was not ours alone: the site
                     launched in 2013, and as of May 6, 2014, only eight comments on the essays had
                     been recorded; as of July 2, 2015, only 18 comments had been recorded.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e319">[2]</a> The lack of engagement raises the question:
                     if the <cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite> intends to replicate the democratic
                     structure of social media platforms, why aren’t more people using it? What is
                     inhibiting participation?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Our aim in this essay is both to participate in, and critically examine, the
                     rhetoric of "sharing, exchange and openness" advanced
                     by <cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite>, which permeates DH more generally. Todd
                     Presner and Jeffrey Schnapp suggest that DH’s "utopian
                     core" stems from the practices of co-creation and teamwork [<a class="ref" href="#presner2009">Presner 2009</a>, 4]. Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter
                     Lunenfeld, Presner, and Schnapp suggest that the "utopian
                     element" and "core human value" of the DH
                     espouses a future where anyone anywhere can participate at any time, in order to "bring about a public sphere in which no one [is]
                     excluded"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2014</a>, 94]. This essay investigates the extent to which these ideals extend to
                     student labour and training, a subject that is largely undertheorized in DH
                     literature. Lynne Siemens notes that literature on collaboration and teamwork in
                     DH projects is only now emerging [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2009">Siemens 2009</a>, 225], and a
                     survey of the extant scholarship shows that reflection on students’ roles in
                     these initiatives is even scarcer.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e356">[3]</a> Much of
                     the scholarship related to students in DH focuses on issues of pedagogy [<a class="ref" href="#brier2012">Brier 2012</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#beetham2013">Beetham and Sharpe 2013</a>] but very little deals with students as
                     collaborators or active participants in the projects whose success depends, to a
                     great degree, on their labour. Indeed, as Daniel Powell, et al. have recently
                     observed, professional publications often fail to address the topic of how to
                     train students for careers in DH.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e373">[4]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Speaking from the point of view of five female graduate students and one female
                     faculty member working in an English department at a university with limited
                     resources for DH infrastructure and training, we are in a unique position to
                     sound out the social, professional, and technological barriers that exist in DH.
                     Working across a range of national literatures and periods with interests in
                     manuscript, print, audio, and digital media, we believe our contribution brings
                     diversity and breadth to the discussion, and also voices an underrepresented
                     subject position in the field’s discourse. By analyzing the rhetoric of this
                     specific anthology, and drawing from DH scholarship more generally, our aim is
                     to interrogate the "construct" of DH from the
                     perspective of student labour, while also engaging with the "actually existing work" of the discipline [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2014">Kirschenbaum 2014</a>, 16]. This essay joins the effort to
                     discuss these issues through formal channels by presenting an exploratory
                     platform to define, assess, and critique student access, training, funding, and
                     collaboration in DH.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e392">[5]</a> It aims to
                     employ a rigorous mix of empirical evidence, personal insight, anecdotal
                     evidence, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and close reading of the
                     rhetoric employed in the ever-expanding literature of DH.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The empirical evidence is culled from two surveys: one designed for faculty (FS)
                     and the other for student researchers (SS) working on DH projects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e399">[6]</a> The surveys were
                     circulated through the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) and
                     Association of College Research Libraries (ACRL) listservs and remained open for
                     a period of 10 days, from November 15 to 25, 2013. In total we received 40
                     faculty and 39 student responses from a diverse spectrum of disciplines,
                     including art history, French and English literature, gender studies, rhetoric
                     theory, geography, and Internet studies. While the 79 respondents represent a
                     small segment of researchers active in DH, the responses provide a useful sample
                     of views, from a variety of roles and levels of experience: faculty researchers
                     included principal investigators, project managers, co-applicants, and
                     collaborators, and student researchers ranged from first-year undergraduates to

                        <li class="item">Most faculty respondents indicate that their DH projects are funded,
                           either by a national funding body (Social Sciences and Humanities
                           Research Council [SSHRC] or the National Endowment for the Humanities
                           [NEH]) or an internal institutional grant (FS 7).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e412">[7]</a> Funded projects pay for most student work in DH
                           (SS 8).
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">Most faculty researchers consider their work on these projects to be
                           highly collaborative (FS 5), while most students consider their work to
                           be only minimally or moderately collaborative (SS18).
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">Student researchers spend approximately three-quarters of their time
                           working individually, and over 40% of the respondents report spending an
                           hour or less a week working with others (SS 9-10a).
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">Student researchers report that the most significant challenge they
                           face is a lack of formal training to use the tools and technologies
                           required of them (SS 21).
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">While nearly half of faculty members’ projects had an anticipated
                           duration of six years or more (FS 6), a similar number of student
                           researchers anticipated working on their projects for two years or less
                           (SS 7).
                        </li>
                     </ol> These trends have significant implications for issues of student access,

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">While we find the goals and intentions of the DH community exciting, we also find
                     ourselves scrutinizing the gesture of inviting participation and promoting
                     academic openness in a commons-like virtual space. This notion of a commons
                     strongly echoes Jürgen Habermas’ conception of the bourgeois public sphere,
                     which, he claimed, enabled private individuals to communicate "in their common quality as human beings and nothing more than
                     human beings," thereby "[t]ranscending the barriers of social hierarchy"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#habermas1989">Habermas 1989</a>, 34-5]. But, in line with critiques of his notion of the public sphere, there is
                     a potential gap between the ideal and the reality of an open commons for the
                     exchange of ideas. Nancy Fraser suggests that "despite the
                     rhetoric of publicity and accessibility," the public sphere of which
                     Habermas spoke was constituted by exclusions based on gender, class, and race
                     that could not be effectively "suspended" or "bracketed"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#fraser1990">Fraser 1990</a>, 59]. Fraser’s critique challenges the assumption that it is possible for
                     people working in a striated society to deliberate in the public sphere <em class="emph">as
                        if</em> they were equals by bracketing status differentials.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Fraser’s observations converge with those of Jo Freeman who, in "The Tyranny of Structurelessness," asserts that there
                     is no such thing as a structureless group: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           Any group of people of whatever nature coming together
                           for any length of time, for any purpose, will inevitably structure
                           itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible, it may vary over
                           time, it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources
                           over the members of the group.
                            [<a class="ref" href="#freeman1970">Freeman 1970</a>, 1]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> We are concerned that the rhetoric of DH — that of collaboration,
                     accessibility, and freedom from traditional hierarchy — can obscure those
                     structures that are already in place within this community. For example, Burdick
                     et al. describe DH as a part of an "economy of knowledge
                     production" that tends towards "abundance, decentralization, peer creation, creative
                     commons, and open-source models"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2014</a>, 77]. They place this kind of knowledge production in opposition to the
                     traditional humanities research models built on "scarcity, centralized control, hierarchy, division of
                     labour, property, and proprietary systems"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2014</a>, 77]. A perceived opposition between DH methodologies and traditional
                     humanities practices seems to deny the existence of a hierarchical power dynamic
                     within DH projects, which is exactly what Freeman warns against: that
                     structurelessness "becomes a way of masking power"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#freeman1970">Freeman 1970</a>, 1], and as Fraser suggests, "deliberation can serve as a mask for domination"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#fraser1990">Fraser 1990</a>, 64].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">We do not wish to suggest that this rhetoric is intentionally misleading or
                     malicious, but rather, that the problems are structural, and that a shift to the
                     digital does not eliminate these structural problems. We recognize that the best
                     intentions inform motivations to revolutionize the way we do scholarship.
                     However, this rhetoric is not neutral, and may mask and therefore perpetuate a
                     set of larger problems. Barriers to access include the inequities between those
                     with and those without permanent positions and the power dynamics already at
                     play within the academy, which is a hierarchical social space, as Price and
                     Siemens acknowledge [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 11]. Though this
                     hierarchy is built on a number of factors — including race, class, and gender —
                     academic credentials play a large part in structuring it. The reality is that
                     students do not share the same intellectual or social authority as their
                     supervisors and other academics. 
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Such a reality is reflected in students’ minimal dissemination of peer-reviewed
                     articles or conference presentations about their work on DH projects (SS 19,
                     discussed further in "Best Practices" below; [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2009">Siemens 2009</a>], Tables 6-11). Here we suggest that students may
                     feel that their work is the intellectual property of their supervisor or
                     employer, or that their work is not substantive enough to justify scholarly
                     publication. This reality is borne out by findings that when students do
                     participate in research dissemination in DH, they often do so via blogs and
                     social media forums (SS 19). However, even within social media-like platforms
                     such as the <cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite>, participation can be limited,
                     likely because the authority of the MLA as a print-based institution extends
                     into its virtual counterpart. Thus, the gesture to invite participation in
                     refereed electronic spaces, while appearing to eliminate hierarchical barriers,
                     is unlikely to succeed, with the shift to digital spaces itself being
                     insufficient to eliminate structural and hierarchical barriers that exist within
                     academic communities. It is important that DH as a community acknowledge that
                     such barriers do exist; only then can we initiate the structural changes
                     required to open participation to new audiences, and realize the inclusive
                     potential of digital space.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">One of the central issues that DH students face is how to acquire training. Price
                     and Siemens acknowledge this in the introduction to the <cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite>, with their observation that the digital age has altered the "types of education and training the academy needs to
                     offer"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 1]. Unequal access to training is not a problem unique to DH; inequalities
                     permeate student training in the humanities in terms of funding, resources, and
                     access to the professoriate. However, for students wanting to work within this
                     burgeoning discipline, those who are able to find RA positions on large DH
                     projects and/or work within established DH centres have an obvious advantage.
                     Powell et al. acknowledge that "it can be quite difficult to
                     'break in' to DH in the absence of committed faculty
                     and established digital projects" since the most common method for
                     developing the skills required to become a digital humanist is to "apprentice" on a large scale DH project [<a class="ref" href="#spiro2010">Spiro 2010</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e565">[8]</a> DH centres can also provide crucial access to training,
                     technical expertise, and resources. However, while the list of DH centres in
                     North America is growing, most universities are without them, and, given current
                     budget constraints, are unlikely to get them any time soon.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e571">[9]</a> According to Price, the results
                     are inequitable: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           Such a model is new to literary studies, however, and it
                           is developing as a problematically exclusive one. While certain scholars
                           have ready access to expertise, others do not. Uneven access to
                           resources, which greatly affects who can do digital humanities and
                           where, is not an issue we have had to address in such stark terms in
                           other types of literary or humanistic scholarship.
                            [<a class="ref" href="#price2011">Price 2011</a>, 12]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> One model that has been proposed to mitigate these inequities is Lisa
                     Spiro’s suggestion that the DH community adopt a "mostly
                     online" certificate program to provide scholars with the necessary
                     training to participate in such large collaborative research projects [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 14]. However, an online certification
                     solution sounds very much like the "digital delivery"
                     model for a "virtual campus" that Liu has critiqued
                     as a dangerous attempt to respond to an "economic
                     crisis" of reduced funding [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 9]. While
                     this idea does attempt to solve the problem of access to training, it conflicts
                     with the collaborative ethos that is integral to the DH community, and places
                     too great a burden on students to acquire training outside of their programs of
                     study.

                     acquiring their own training, and online solutions seem to extend this "self-fashion[ed]" learning [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 14]. In our survey of student researchers, 30% of respondents
                     stated that their knowledge about how to utilize the tools required to
                     participate in DH projects resulted from trial-and-error, 25% attributed their
                     knowledge to informal mentorship, and 18% stated that they brought such
                     knowledge from previous experience (SS 16). These results demonstrate that of DH
                     students we surveyed, 73% of respondents engaged in some form of self-fashioned
                     training. Only 10% of respondents acknowledged academic coursework as the means
                     by which they were able to acquire such training (SS 16). Interestingly, while
                     the student respondents to our survey listed trial-and-error as the most common
                     method of training, only 15% of the faculty respondents acknowledged this
                     learning method, which suggests a disparity between the student and faculty
                     perspectives of training in DH (FS 16).

                     student respondent raised the issue of having to take on many new tasks at once
                     without receiving any formal training, claiming that the trial-and-error process
                     lead to slow progress and a sense of frustration (SS 21, Respondent 1). We do
                     not wish to imply that trial-and-error does not have its own rewards; in fact,
                     recent studies suggest that learning by trial-and-error can have beneficial
                     effects on memory and retention.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e632">[10]</a> However, the sense of frustration
                     associated with unguided trial-and-error learning would more than likely persist
                     with any form of training that does not involve face-to-face guidance from a
                     personal instructor and a community of peers. L. Siemens notes that digital
                     interactions cannot replace the benefits that arise from "in-person interactions," and that striking a balance between both is
                     a major factor for the success of DH projects [<a class="ref" href="#siemens2009">Siemens 2009</a>, 231]. Models of online training lack the "in-person interactions" that are an integral component for the
                     success of DH projects, and by extension, the acquisition of the training
                     required to utilize the tools to participate in such projects.

                     online training to develop DH skills while also completing the rigorous
                     requirements of graduate level studies in the humanities. One respondent to our

                     opening their labs, classes, and even their projects, to students in nearby

                     concerns of attempting to acquire skills outside of their main field of study
                     would be to have universities develop introductory computer and statistics
                     courses intended for humanities students. While such a solution does not help
                     current graduate students, it would be a step towards building future
                     generations of humanities scholars who train in this area before they begin

                     holds the promise of renewal through its strong "language of change"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2013">Flanders 2013</a>, par. 2]. For instance the 4Humanities advocacy project’s "Mission Statement" emphasizes DH’s potential to invigorate the
                     humanities by helping it to "communicate with, and adapt to,
                     contemporary society." Similarly, in Canada, SSHRC has listed "Digital Economy" as a priority area that "supports research and related activities into the
                     nature, impact and integration of digital technologies in all aspects of
                     our economy, society and culture"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#de2013">Digital Economy</a>]. The NEH Office of Digital Humanities offers DH Start-Up and
                     Implementation Grants, as well as funding towards Institutes for Advanced Topics
                     in DH Grants. There have now been three rounds of the Digging into Data
                     Challenge, from funding institutes in Canada, the Netherlands, the United
                     Kingdom, and the United States. These examples point towards an acknowledgment
                     by funding agencies of the importance of DH projects and their need for
                     sustained funding. However, those working in DH also need to make explicit the
                     necessary role that funding plays at every level of their work, and acknowledge
                     that the renewal in the humanities is at least in part a function of its
                     (new-found) ability to attract large levels of funding.

                     of survey respondents noted that their projects are funded by federal grants; an
                     additional 35% are funded by institutional grants, often in combination with a
                     federal grant, and most of the rest have funding from other sources (FS 7).
                     Notably, only three of the 40 faculty respondents indicated that their projects
                     were not funded in any way (FS 7).

                     of funding agencies — both quantitatively and qualitatively — on DH student
                     training. As Price notes, scholars may not rely upon funding agencies in order
                     to produce print monographs, yet, in the DH context, funding agencies serve as
                     important collaborators due to the substantial costs associated with major
                     digital projects [<a class="ref" href="#price2011">Price 2011</a>, 23]. These costs include the
                     employment of student workers.

                     student researchers has to do with canonicity. A number of scholars have
                     examined DH’s relationship with consecrated writers and their texts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e734">[13]</a> For instance, Susan Belasco interrogates
                     DH’s tendency to "reinscribe the traditional canon [...] leaving out
                     women and minority writers"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#belasco2011">Belasco 2011</a>, 53]. She also notes that funding agencies tend to favour projects relating to
                     major texts and authors, but provide comparatively little support to the
                     non-canonical [<a class="ref" href="#belasco2011">Belasco 2011</a>, 53].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e753">[14]</a> In spite of this tendency, Susan
                     Schreibman positions the digital realm as "an environment of abundance"

                      [<a class="ref" href="#schreibman2013">Schreibman 2013</a>, par. 47]. In light of the contradictory possibilities of canon expansion and
                     re-entrenchment, how does the question of canonicity impact training
                     opportunities for students working in DH?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">DH projects can interrogate commonly held notions of cultural value and
                     canonicity by situating the text as an unstable and potentially interactive
                     site, or by disseminating texts and other manuscript and print materials that do
                     not fall within the parameters of the western canon. Yet, in most cases, these
                     projects can only do so, effectively and sustainably, with the provision of
                     substantial funding. Even though digital projects have the potential to provide
                     greater access to texts and authors that exist beyond the literary canon, major
                     projects, like the Walt Whitman and William Blake digital archives, are still
                     centered upon widely recognized authors — particularly those that figure in the
                     American and British literary traditions. According to Price and Siemens,
                     digitization projects do expand the "accessible
                     canon" but these efforts have not yet resulted in a broader "selective canon," that is, the broadening of the
                     accessible canon has not impacted the narrow field of texts valued by experts in
                     literary studies [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 6]. This reality presents
                     obvious limitations for those students who work on marginalized texts, authors,
                     small presses, or non-print media.

                     receive support from the federal government tend to have as their object the
                     expansion of a national canon. One such project is Editing Modernism in Canada
                     (EMiC) (discussed in greater detail in the "best practices" section below)
                     and another similar project is the Canada’s Early Women Writers (CEWW) project,
                     based at our home department at SFU. One of the student authors of this essay
                     recently joined the CEWW project, which currently employs six students on a
                     part-time basis (four graduate and two undergraduate). Students are involved in
                     conducting biographical research, compiling bibliographic information, and
                     inputting metadata. As one of the few major DH projects currently housed in our
                     English department, it provides these students with superb training. While this
                     opportunity with the CEWW is an ideal fit for one of the authors, aligning with
                     her own interests in marginalized Canadian women writers, students working in
                     different fields have fewer "apprenticeship" opportunities —
                     and none on the scale of CEWW. While it has always been the case that student
                     researchers are not at liberty to pick and choose the projects they can work on
                     as paid researchers, we believe that many students do have opportunities to work
                     as paid research assistants in their own, or closely adjacent, fields. The fact
                     that many humanities departments have no, or perhaps only one, major DH project
                     further supports Price’s concerns about "uneven access to
                     resources," and his awareness that this "is not an issue we have had to address [...] in other
                     types of literary or humanistic scholarship"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#price2011">Price 2011</a>, 12]. In order to broaden the terrain of literary studies, we must
                     acknowledge, and actively seek out ways to mitigate, the impact that the uneven
                     distribution of funding has on student access to training.

                     collaborative: collaboration is described as a "standard and vital practice in [DH]"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 17]. The <cite class="title italic">LSDA</cite> introduction notes that literary
                     scholars are joining forces in unlikely pairings with computer scientists,
                     "archivists, designers, programmers, database designers,
                     and many others" in order to develop tools that allow scholars to see
                     literature through a different lens [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 17].
                     Collaboration not only extends laterally, to incorporate various disciplines
                     into one project, but also vertically as researchers in DH scholarship "regularly" join forces with their students [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 5]. Price and Siemens assert that such
                     "alliances" help to facilitate student research
                     [<a class="ref" href="#price2013">Price et al. 2013</a>, par. 17]. Certainly, our own experience of
                     writing this essay (in person and via Google docs) reflects our attempt to
                     embody some of the principles we have articulated, and suggests that DH does
                     provide new and fruitful opportunities for collaboration.

                     identify student researchers as working within a truly collaborative environment
                     on many DH projects. Our student survey respondents worked an average of 11.5
                     hours a week on their digital projects, but only spent an average of three hours
                     working with others (SS 9; 10). More surprisingly, 43% of the respondents — a
                     near majority — reported working with others for only one hour a week or less
                     (SS 9; 10). Additionally, when asked to rate the collaborative nature of their
                     project, 67% of the students rated their work as minimally to moderately
                     collaborative (SS 18), whereas in the equivalent faculty survey question 63%
                     rated their projects as highly collaborative (FS 5).

                     student labour on their own projects (outside of the classroom) is never
                     mentioned. Tanya Clement does assert that student contributions to research are

                      [<a class="ref" href="#clement2013">Clement 2013</a>, par. 29], and in part that is because their work is preliminary. She suggests that

                     texts" before they are entered into the computer for analysis C[<a class="ref" href="#clement2013">Clement 2013</a>, par. 29].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e905">[15]</a> This
                     type of labour — including scanning, checking and proofreading digitized texts —
                     is further described as "tedious"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#hoover2013">Hoover 2013</a>, par. 14]. While this work is critical in assembling a corpus, it is preparatory
                     work. Students may not be involved in the scholarly interpretation of the
                     results generated by the computer programs or the discussion of larger issues in
                     project development and design. Student labour remains undervalued and hidden,
                     as it often is in the world of print scholarship, in acknowledgements sections
                     and footnotes of printed books. But their work is also literally "unseen" because it exists in hidden coding and
                     programming. This problem of student work being invisible intensifies in DH, as
                     Susan Brown has observed, since many digital projects are often "major experiments" that result in failure — how does
                     one evaluate efforts that produced no end "product"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#brown2010">Brown 2010</a>, 16]? This poses an additional labour problem for students: if their work is
                     "unseen" or "unfinished," how can it be valued or leveraged when entering the job
                     market?

                     to embrace the labour model of digital humanities? Brown suggests that the key
                     to this lies in understanding that all DH work — from "interface development" to "electronic
                     publishing" — is scholarly research [<a class="ref" href="#brown2010">Brown 2010</a>, 20]. Even though student research has been hidden and undervalued in the past, it
                     should not continue to be so in DH. Instead, as with many other aspects of
                     digital research, the field should look to revolutionize the student labour
                     model by rendering the invisible student visible.

                     of reform, which takes a pragmatic approach to student labour within the current
                     economic, cultural, and institutional climate. These suggestions attend to
                     practical solutions within the existing framework to help student and faculty
                     researchers foster and maintain strong, collaborative relationships across
                     levels of experience. Our final suggested reform addresses the power dynamics
                     that structure hiring practices, promotion and tenure decisions, and funding for
                     all researchers. Here, we call for a formal acknowledgment of the mentoring
                     activities – the affective and immaterial labour – that sustains much DH
                     training and many DH projects.

                        structural inequalities, since both our social and our academic spheres are
                        striated and hierarchical. However, we suggest that acknowledging these
                        inequalities is key in both structuring and creating meaningful work
                        environments for DH projects. Based on our survey of student researchers,
                        32% of students said that they did not know how long they would be working
                        on a project, versus 3% of faculty respondents (FS 6; SS 7). The second and
                        third most difficult aspects were "issues of
                        communication and/or organization" and "issues with time management or workload" (SS 21). To address
                        these issues, we follow Freeman’s suggestion that the assignment of tasks
                        and responsibilities, as well as communication about project timelines and
                        hiring practices, be transparent. To achieve this, there needs to be an
                        explicit, negotiated power structure.

                        hierarchy that operates within most faculty-led research projects should be
                        acknowledged and rethought. This attention to power structure "prevents monopoly of power and requires those in
                        positions of authority to consult with many others in the process of
                        exercising it"

                        completion, rather than as part of an active model of teaching and learning.
                        Training must be a deliberate and planned activity that is formally budgeted
                        and accounted for in the project’s timeline, and should be compensated to
                        the same degree as other tasks performed within the project. Principal

                        experience, contact between team members needs to happen in a more
                        formalized way. Creating projects with built-in, deliberate models of
                        training, sharing, and dissemination fosters a sense of intellectual agency
                        and community. Deliberate models of training include:

                        have a DH centre or major DH projects, is to support students who wish to
                        develop digital projects that relate to their own research. Currently,
                        students often face difficulties attempting to launch their own projects.
                        For example, one of the graduate student authors of this essay, having
                        completed some RA work on a large-scale digital archival project, wanted to
                        apply this skill set to her own work by building a digital archive from
                        materials she discovered through her own research initiatives. This idea was
                        initially met with some reluctance, however, because it did not fit the
                        usual paradigm of faculty-supervised (and funded) research. The resistance
                        in this case seemed to stem from concerns about the legitimacy of graduate
                        student research, and an uncertain sense of protocol surrounding
                        self-directed learning. Arguably, a longstanding perception of students as
                        consumers but not producers of knowledge undergird these barriers. However,
                        Amy Earhart has recently suggested that when institutions allow graduate
                        students to develop their own projects in a collaborative environment they
                        "challenge power structures" and enable
                        students to produce a "stronger final product"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#earhart2012">Earhart 2012</a>, 40]. Having seed funding explicitly available to students wishing to
                        develop their own DH projects would both enable and legitimize these
                        important initiatives, providing students with a measure of autonomy in
                        developing their own research trajectories.

                        to encouraging individual student projects. Of the 63 graduate fellows
                        listed on the site, more than half of this number reference independent

                        have done so by building a group structure that ensures that students are an

                        in the forms of publication that are esteemed by the academy — prevents both
                        students and the academic field as a whole from seeing student research as
                        tantamount to faculty research. It is important that student researchers are
                        encouraged to take ownership of their contributions to larger, grant-funded

                        contribution to research dissemination: less than 20% of respondents had

                        common form of dissemination (39%) was through Web-based or social media
                        content (blog posts, tweets, status updates, etc.), which, though an
                        important step toward students conceiving of their scholarship as a part of
                        public discourse, does not inspire the same degree of recognition and
                        cultural legitimacy as more traditional forms of publication (SS 19).

                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">For students and faculty alike who are conducting research outside of
                        large-scale DH projects, and at institutions without established DH centres,
                        we would like to propose a model of training that formally recognizes the
                        value of mentorship, what Michael Hardt terms "affective
                        labour." Affective labour "is itself… the constitution of communities and
                        collective subjectivities"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hardt1999">Hardt 1999</a>, 89] and the term describes the processes of human interaction that create
                        a sense of interconnectivity, compassion, and well-being. Within an academic
                        setting, affective labour involves forging connections with other
                        researchers through conferences, informal gatherings, social media, and
                        other channels. Researchers share their expertise in formal and informal
                        ways such as workshops or Skype conferences, email correspondence, and
                        informal peer review. Crucially, the exchange between speaker and audience
                        is not monetary, but communicative: both parties invest in a sense of
                        community-building, and the free and open exchange of knowledge. Mentoring
                        is perhaps the single most important and sustainable form of training in DH,
                        as students who benefit from these activities will be more likely to share
                        their own expertise in a similar way. But while this model is, in large
                        part, already the norm in DH circles, it rarely receives the notice and
                        reward it deserves. We recommend that affective labour be formally
                        recognized, through:

                        However, we believe that this is a discussion that the DH community must
                        have if it wishes to fulfill its promise of transforming the humanities.

                  as Ashley Reed suggests, and our survey confirms (SS 7), undergraduate and
                  some graduate students involved in DH projects are expected to have only

                  inevitably be short term, it is one that needs to be accounted for by
