            <dhq:abstract>
                <p>This article critiques the rhetoric of openness, accessibility and collaboration
                    that features largely in digital humanities literature by examining the status
                    of student labour, training, and funding within the discipline. The authors
                    argue that the use of such rhetoric masks the hierarches that structure academic
                    spaces, and that a shift to the digital does not eliminate these structural
                    inequalities. Drawing on two surveys that assess student participation in DH
                    projects (one for students, and one for faculty researchers), the article
                    outlines the challenges currently faced by students working in the field, and
                    suggests a set of best practices that might bridge the disparity between
                    rhetoric and reality.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>As members of a graduate course in digital humanities (DH) held in the fall of
                    2013 at Simon Fraser University (SFU), one of the collections we engaged with
                    extensively was the recently published first digital anthology of the <title
                        rend="italic">PMLA</title>, <title rend="italic">Literary Studies in the
                        Digital Age: An Evolving Anthology</title> (<title rend="italic"
                        >LSDA</title>), edited by Kenneth M. Price and Ray Siemens. In their
                    introduction, Price and Siemens characterize DH as a field that brings <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013">a refreshing spirit of sharing,
                            exchange, and openness</quote>
                        <ptr target="#price2013" loc="par. 10"/>
                    </cit> to literary studies. The form of the publication itself seeks to embody
                    that ethos: it is described as an <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013">evolving
                        anthology,</quote> inviting comments on its essays via a <title
                        rend="italic">Wordpress</title> plugin, <title rend="italic"
                        >CommentPress</title>, that allows readers to enter comments on a
                    paragraph-by-paragraph basis. In attempting to create an interface that borrows
                    from social media platforms (enabling commenting, sharing, and archiving), the
                        <title rend="italic">LSDA</title> presents a new and attractive model for
                    critical engagement, scholarly production, peer review, and publication.</p>
                <p>The model put forward in <title rend="italic">LSDA</title>, both in theory and
                    practice, enticed us. We had been reading and discussing the essays in the
                    anthology, and began to contemplate the comment function and our reluctance to
                    use it: were we qualified to comment on the work of such prominent scholars in
                    the field? Could our questions and comments be informal, or should they have the
                    polish of scholarly prose? What did we have to contribute to this ongoing
                    conversation? It seemed, too, that this reluctance was not ours alone: the site
                    launched in 2013, and as of May 6, 2014, only eight comments on the essays had
                    been recorded; as of July 2, 2015, only 18 comments had been recorded.<note>
                        Users must make an account with a user name in order to post comments, and
                        comments are moderated.</note> The lack of engagement raises the question:
                    if the <title rend="italic">LSDA</title> intends to replicate the democratic
                    structure of social media platforms, why aren’t more people using it and what is
                    inhibiting participation?</p>
                <p>Our aim in this essay is to interrogate from the student perspective the rhetoric
                    of <quote rend="inline" source="#presner2009">sharing, exchange and
                        openness</quote> advanced by <title rend="italic">LSDA</title>, and which
                    permeates DH more generally. Todd Presner and Jeffrey Schnapp suggest that DH’s
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#presner2009">utopian core</quote> stems from
                    the practices of co-creation and teamwork <ptr target="#presner2009" loc="4"/>.
                    Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Presner, and Schnapp suggest
                    that the <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">utopian element</quote>
                    and <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">core human value</quote> of DH
                    espouses a future where anyone anywhere can participate at any time, in order to <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">bring about a public sphere in
                            which no one [is] excluded</quote>
                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="94"/>
                    </cit>. This essay investigates the extent to which these ideals extend to
                    student labour and training, a subject that is largely undertheorized in DH
                    literature. Lynne Siemens notes that literature on collaboration and teamwork in
                    DH projects is only now emerging <ptr target="#siemens2009" loc="225"/>, and a
                    survey of the extant scholarship shows that reflection on students’ roles in
                    these initiatives is even scarcer.<note> Some notable exceptions include L.

                    <ptr target="#beetham2013"/> but very little deals with students as
                    collaborators or active participants in the projects whose success depends, to a
                    great degree, on their labour. Indeed, as Daniel Powell, et al. have recently
                    observed, professional publications often fail to address the topic of how to
                    train students for careers in DH.<note> The authors note that these topics are
                            <q>vigorously</q> discussed <q>in semi-official spaces like blogs, Twitter,
                            colloquia, and conferences.</q></note>

                <p>Speaking from the point of view of five female graduate students and one female
                    faculty member working in an English department at a university with limited
                    resources for DH infrastructure and training, we are in a unique position to
                    sound out the social, professional, and technological barriers that exist in DH.
                    Working across a range of national literatures and periods with interests in
                    manuscript, print, audio, and digital media, we believe our contribution brings
                    diversity and breadth to the discussion, and also voices an underrepresented
                    subject position in the field’s discourse. By analyzing the rhetoric of this
                    specific anthology, and drawing from DH scholarship more generally, our aim is
                    to interrogate the <q>construct</q> of DH from the perspective of student labour, while also
                    engaging with the <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2014">actually
                        existing work</quote> of the discipline <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2014"
                        loc="16"/>. This essay joins the effort to discuss these issues through
                    formal channels by presenting an exploratory platform to define, assess, and
                    critique student access, training, funding, and collaboration in DH.<note> We
                        must acknowledge the labour of other groups who equally contribute to
                        digital projects, and who are also implicated in asymmetrical power
                        relations: library workers, alternate academic university employees, staff
                        members of research centres, hired programmers, and designers. The
                        participation of these groups warrants further consideration that is outside
                        the scope of the current paper, which focuses on the student perspective. We
                        look forward to future scholarship that extends the discussion of labour and
                        participation to these groups.</note> It aims to employ a rigorous mix of
                    empirical evidence, personal insight, anecdotal evidence, qualitative and
                    quantitative analysis, and close reading of the rhetoric employed in the
                    ever-expanding literature of DH.</p>
                <p>The empirical evidence is culled from two surveys: one designed for faculty (FS)
                    and the other for student researchers (SS) working on DH projects.<note> The
                        collated results of these surveys may be viewed at <ref

                            >http://summit.sfu.ca/item/15260</ref>.</note> The surveys were
                    circulated through the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) and
                    Association of College Research Libraries (ACRL) listservs and remained open for
                    a period of 10 days, from November 15 to 25, 2013. In total we received 40
                    faculty and 39 student responses from a diverse spectrum of disciplines,
                    including art history, French and English literature, gender studies, rhetoric
                    theory, geography, and Internet studies. While the 79 respondents represent a
                    small segment of researchers active in DH, the responses provide a useful sample
                    of views, from a variety of roles and levels of experience: faculty researchers
                    included principal investigators, project managers, co-applicants, and
                    collaborators, and student researchers ranged from first-year undergraduates to
                    doctoral students </p>
                <p> The survey revealed several important findings: <list type="ordered">
                        <item>Most faculty respondents indicate that their DH projects are funded,
                            either by a national funding body (Social Sciences and Humanities
                            Research Council [SSHRC] or the National Endowment for the Humanities
                            [NEH]) or an internal institutional grant (FS 7).<note> All numerical
                                parenthetical citations for FS and SS refer to question numbers in
                                the surveys.</note> Funded projects pay for most student work in DH
                            (SS 8).</item>
                        <item>Most faculty researchers consider their work on these projects to be
                            highly collaborative (FS 5), while most students consider their work to
                            be only minimally or moderately collaborative (SS 18).</item>
                        <item>Student researchers spend approximately three-quarters of their time
                            working individually, and over 40% of the respondents report spending an
                            hour or less a week working with others (SS 9-10a).</item>
                        <item>Student researchers report that the most significant challenge they
                            face is a lack of formal training to use the tools and technologies
                            required of them (SS 21).</item>
                        <item>While nearly half of faculty members’ projects had an anticipated
                            duration of six years or more (FS 6), a similar number of student
                            researchers anticipated working on their projects for two years or less
                            (SS 7).</item>
                    </list> These trends have significant implications for issues of student access,
                    training, funding, and collaboration, which are elaborated upon in the sections

                <head>The Rhetoric of Public Space</head>
                <p>While we find the goals and intentions of the DH community exciting, we also find
                    ourselves scrutinizing the gesture of inviting participation and promoting
                    academic openness in a commons-like virtual space. This notion of a commons
                    strongly echoes Jürgen Habermas’ conception of the bourgeois public sphere,
                    which, he claimed, enabled private individuals to communicate <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#habermas1989">in their common quality as human beings and
                        nothing more than human beings,</quote> thereby <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#habermas1989">[t]ranscending the barriers of

                        <ptr target="#habermas1989" loc="34–5"/>
                    </cit>. But, in line with critiques of his notion of the public sphere, there is
                    a potential gap between the ideal and the reality of an open commons for the
                    exchange of ideas. Nancy Fraser suggests that <quote rend="inline" source="#fraser1990"
                        >despite the rhetoric of publicity and accessibility,</quote> the public
                    sphere of which Habermas spoke was constituted by exclusions based on gender,
                    class, and race that could not be effectively <quote rend="inline" source="#fraser1990"

                        <quote rend="inline" source="#fraser1990">bracketed</quote>
                        <ptr target="#fraser1990" loc="59"/>
                    </cit>. Fraser’s critique challenges the assumption that it is possible for
                    people working in a striated society to deliberate in the public sphere <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#fraser1990"><emph>as if</emph></quote> they were equals by <cit>

                        <ptr target="#fraser1990" loc="62"/>
                    </cit>. </p>
                <p>Fraser’s observations converge with those of Jo Freeman who, in <title
                        rend="quotes">The Tyranny of Structurelessness,</title> asserts that there
                    is no such thing as a structureless group: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#freeman1970">Any group of people of whatever
                            nature coming together for any length of time, for any purpose, will
                            inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be
                            flexible, it may vary over time, it may evenly or unevenly distribute
                            tasks, power and resources over the members of the group.</quote>
                        <ptr target="#freeman1970" loc="1"/>
                    </cit> We are concerned that the rhetoric of DH — that of collaboration,
                    accessibility, and freedom from traditional hierarchy — can obscure those
                    structures that are already in place within this community. For example, Burdick
                    et al. describe DH as a part of an <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">economy of
                        knowledge production</quote> that tends towards <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">abundance, decentralization, peer
                            creation, creative commons, and open-source models</quote>
                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="77"/>
                    </cit>. They place this kind of knowledge production in opposition to the
                    traditional humanities research models built on <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#burdick2012">scarcity, centralized control,
                            hierarchy, division of labour, property, and proprietary systems</quote>
                        <ptr target="#burdick2012" loc="77"/>
                    </cit>. A perceived opposition between DH methodologies and traditional
                    humanities practices seems to deny the existence of a hierarchical power dynamic
                    within DH projects, which is exactly what Freeman warns against: that
                    structurelessness <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#freeman1970">becomes a way of masking
                            power</quote>
                        <ptr target="#freeman1970" loc="1"/>
                    </cit>, and as Fraser suggests, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#fraser1990">deliberation can serve as a mask
                            for domination</quote>
                        <ptr target="#fraser1990" loc="64"/>
                    </cit>.</p>
                <p>We do not wish to suggest that this rhetoric is intentionally misleading or
                    malicious, but rather, that the problems are structural, and that a shift to the
                    digital does not eliminate these structural problems. We recognize that the best
                    intentions inform motivations to revolutionize the way we do scholarship.
                    However, this rhetoric is not neutral, and may mask and therefore perpetuate a
                    set of larger problems. Barriers to access include the inequities between those
                    with and those without permanent positions and the power dynamics already at
                    play within the academy, which is a hierarchical social space, as Price and
                    Siemens acknowledge <ptr target="#price2013" loc="par. 11"/>. Though this
                    hierarchy is built on a number of factors — including race, class, and gender —
                    academic credentials play a large part in structuring it. The reality is that
                    students do not share the same intellectual or social authority as their
                    supervisors and other academics. </p>
                <p>Such a reality is reflected in students’ minimal dissemination of peer-reviewed
                    articles or conference presentations about their work on DH projects (SS 19,
                    discussed further in <title rend="quotes">Best Practices</title> below; <ptr
                        target="#siemens2009"/>, Tables 6-11). Here we suggest that students may
                    feel that their work is the intellectual property of their supervisor or
                    employer, or that their work is not substantive enough to justify scholarly
                    publication. This reality is borne out by findings that when students do
                    participate in research dissemination in DH, they often do so via blogs and
                    social media forums (SS 19). However, even within social media-like platforms
                    such as the <title rend="italic">LSDA</title>, participation can be limited,
                    likely because the authority of the MLA as a print-based institution extends
                    into its virtual counterpart. Thus, the gesture to invite participation in
                    refereed electronic spaces, while appearing to eliminate hierarchical barriers,
                    is unlikely to succeed, with the shift to digital spaces itself being
                    insufficient to eliminate structural and hierarchical barriers that exist within
                    academic communities.<note> The question of how to make DH genuinely inclusive
                        and transformative of existing power structures has been an important topic
                        of discussion in the last five years, though not explicitly from the student
                        perspective: see <ptr target="#bailey2011"/>, <ptr target="#bianco2012"/>,
                            <ptr target="#mcpherson2012"/>, and <ptr target="#wernimont2013"/> and
                            <ptr target="#wernimont2015"/>.</note> It is important that the DH
                    community acknowledges that such barriers do exist; only then can we initiate
                    the structural changes required to open participation to new audiences, and
                    realize the inclusive potential of digital space.</p>

                <head>Student Training</head>
                <p>One of the central issues that DH students face is how to acquire training. Price
                    and Siemens acknowledge this in the introduction to the <title rend="italic"
                        >LSDA</title>, with their observation that the digital age has altered the <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013">types of education and training the
                            academy needs to offer</quote>
                        <ptr target="#price2013" loc="par. 1"/>
                    </cit>. Unequal access to training is not a problem unique to DH; inequalities
                    permeate student training in the humanities in terms of funding, resources, and
                    access to the professoriate. However, for students wanting to work within this
                    burgeoning discipline, those who are able to find RA positions on large DH
                    projects and/or work within established DH centres have an obvious advantage.
                    Powell et al. acknowledge that <quote rend="inline" source="#spiro2010">it can
                        be quite difficult to <soCalled>break in</soCalled> to DH in the absence of
                        committed faculty and established digital projects</quote> since the most
                    common method for developing the skills required to become a digital humanist is
                    to <quote rend="inline" source="#spiro2010">apprentice</quote> on a large
                    scale DH project <ptr target="#spiro2010"/>.<note> Anecdotally, this conclusion
                        is supported by the fact that all six authors of <title rend="quotes"
                            >Conversation, Collaboration and Credit</title> apprenticed on large
                        scale DH project.</note> DH centres can also provide crucial access to
                    training, technical expertise, and resources. However, while the list of DH
                    centres in North America is growing, most universities are without them, and,
                    given current budget constraints, are unlikely to get them any time soon.<note>

                    are inequitable: <cit>

                            not. Uneven access to resources, which greatly affects who can do

                    critiqued as a dangerous attempt to respond to an <quote rend="inline"

                        target="#liu2012" loc="9"/>. While this idea does attempt to solve the
                    problem of access to training, it conflicts with the collaborative ethos that is
                    integral to the DH community, and places too great a burden on students to
                    acquire training outside of their programs of study. </p>
                <p>Price and Siemens note that currently digital humanists are often responsible for
                    acquiring their own training, and online solutions seem to extend this <quote

                        target="#price2013" loc="par. 14"/>. In our survey of student researchers,
                    30% of respondents stated that their knowledge about how to utilize the tools
                    required to participate in DH projects resulted from trial-and-error, 25%
                    attributed their knowledge to informal mentorship, and 18% stated that they
                    brought such knowledge from previous experience (SS 16). These results
                    demonstrate that of DH students we surveyed, 73% of respondents engaged in some
                    form of self-fashioned training. Only 10% of respondents acknowledged academic
                    coursework as the means by which they were able to acquire such training (SS
                    16). Interestingly, while the student respondents to our survey listed
                    trial-and-error as the most common method of training, only 15% of the faculty
                    respondents acknowledged this learning method, which suggests a disparity
                    between the student and faculty perspectives of training in DH (FS 16). </p>

                <p>When asked what was the most difficult aspect of working on a DH project, one
                    student respondent raised the issue of having to take on many new tasks at once
                    without receiving any formal training, claiming that the trial-and-error process
                    lead to slow progress and a sense of frustration (SS 21, Respondent 1). We do
                    not wish to imply that trial-and-error does not have its own rewards; in fact,
                    recent studies suggest that learning by trial-and-error can have beneficial
                    effects on memory and retention.<note> See <ptr target="#cyrr2012"/> and <ptr
                            target="#jones2010"/>.</note> However, the sense of frustration
                    associated with unguided trial-and-error learning would more than likely persist
                    with any form of training that does not involve face-to-face guidance from a
                    personal instructor and a community of peers. L. Siemens notes that digital
                    interactions cannot replace the benefits that arise from <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#siemens2009">in-person interactions,</quote> and that striking a
                    balance between both is a major factor for the success of DH projects <ptr
                        target="#siemens2009" loc="231"/>. Models of online training lack the <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#siemens2009">in-person interactions</quote> that
                    are an integral component for the success of DH projects, and by extension, the
                    acquisition of the training required to utilize the tools to participate in such
                    projects.</p>
                <p>Formal programs of study that do not integrate self-directed training models also
                    threaten to overload students. For the five current graduate student authors, it
                    is difficult to imagine how much time we could dedicate to pursuing self-guided
                    online training to develop DH skills while also completing the rigorous
                    requirements of graduate level studies in the humanities. One respondent to our
                    survey shared this concern, stating: <quote rend="inline" source="#private">I’ve done
                        some CodeAcademy [sic] tutorials, but I don’t have time to devote to that
                        with so much else on my plate</quote> (SS 21, Respondent 6).</p>
                <p>A more successful approach has been the development of institutes (such as DHSI,
                    held at the University of Victoria, which has now implemented a Graduate
                    Certificate in DH) and other training opportunities (such as <q>thatcamps</q>)
                    that focus on the development of DH skills. While such opportunities cannot
                    provide the same level of attention that a formal apprenticeship or RA position
                    could, they do expose students to the kinds of methods and skills needed to
                    develop their own digital projects. Another way in which graduate student
                    training in DH can be expanded is by the <soCalled>have</soCalled> institutions
                    – those with established DH centres, curricula, or projects, for example –
                    opening their labs, classes, and even their projects, to students in nearby
                        <soCalled>have not</soCalled> institutions, thus providing a low-cost means
                    of sharing resources and training opportunities.</p>
                <p>The best solution, as William Pannapacker suggests, is to integrate digital
                    humanities training within traditional education curriculums <ptr
                        target="#pannapacker2013"/>. This solution was also advanced by one of our
                    survey respondents, who suggests that universities should support a minor in DH
                    studies, which would enable <quote rend="inline" source="#private"
                        >non-math/science majors</quote> to develop computer-based skills before
                    reaching the graduate level (SS Respondent 22).<note> DH Minors have been
                        recently at Stanford University, the University of Victoria, the University
                        of Western Ontario and UCLA.</note> A practical way to execute Pannapacker’s
                    solution and also address student concerns of attempting to acquire skills
                    outside of their main field of study would be to have universities develop
                    introductory computer and statistics courses intended for humanities students.
                    While such a solution does not help current graduate students, it would be a
                    step towards building future generations of humanities scholars who train in
                    this area before they begin their graduate studies.<note> One recent effort to
                        promote the integration of digital humanities into their curriculum has been
                        introduced at the University of Alberta, which now includes computer
                        languages as the language requirement for their graduate program.</note>

                        >Mission Statement</title> emphasizes DH’s potential to invigorate the
                    humanities by helping it to <quote rend="inline" source="#de2013">communicate with,
                        and adapt to, contemporary society.</quote> Similarly, in Canada, SSHRC has

                    </cit>. The NEH Office of Digital Humanities offers DH Start-Up and
                    Implementation Grants, as well as funding towards Institutes for Advanced Topics
                    in DH Grants. There have now been three rounds of the Digging into Data
                    Challenge, from funding institutes in Canada, the Netherlands, the United
                    Kingdom, and the United States. These examples point towards an acknowledgment
                    by funding agencies of the importance of DH projects and their need for
                    sustained funding. However, those working in DH also need to make explicit the
                    necessary role that funding plays at every level of their work, and acknowledge
                    that the renewal in the humanities is at least in part a function of its
                    (new-found) ability to attract large levels of funding. </p>
                <p>Our study supports the reality that funding is necessary to most DH projects: 33%
                    of survey respondents noted that their projects are funded by federal grants; an
                    additional 35% are funded by institutional grants, often in combination with a
                    federal grant, and most of the rest have funding from other sources (FS 7).
                    Notably, only three of the 40 faculty respondents indicated that their projects
                    were not funded in any way (FS 7). <figure xml:id="figure03">
                        <head>Funding of Faculty DH projects (FS 7)</head>
                        <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.png"/>
                    </figure> Additionally, just over 60% of students in our survey stated that they
                    are paid for their work in DH. These two findings suggest the significant impact
                    of funding agencies — both quantitatively and qualitatively — on DH student
                    training. As Price notes, scholars may not rely upon funding agencies in order
                    to produce print monographs, yet, in the DH context, funding agencies serve as
                    important collaborators due to the substantial costs associated with major
                    digital projects <ptr target="#price2011" loc="23"/>. These costs include the
                    employment of student workers. </p>
                <p>Internal and external funding sources might show a preference towards certain
                    kinds of projects, thus affecting the kinds of scholarly work that is available
                    for students wishing to pursue training in DH. One area of potential concern to
                    student researchers has to do with canonicity. A number of scholars have
                    examined DH’s relationship with consecrated writers and their texts.<note> See
                            <ptr target="#earhart2012"/>, <ptr target="#fraistat1998"/>, and <ptr
                            target="#price2011"/>.</note> For instance, Susan Belasco interrogates
                    DH’s tendency to <cit>

                    </cit>. She also notes that funding agencies tend to favour projects relating to
                    major texts and authors, but provide comparatively little support to the
                    non-canonical <ptr target="#belasco2011" loc="53"/>.<note> Other well-known

                    </cit>. In light of the contradictory possibilities of canon expansion and
                    re-entrenchment, how does the question of canonicity impact training
                    opportunities for students working in DH? </p>
                <p>DH projects can interrogate commonly held notions of cultural value and
                    canonicity by situating the text as an unstable and potentially interactive
                    site, or by disseminating texts and other manuscript and print materials that do
                    not fall within the parameters of the western canon. Yet, in most cases, these
                    projects can only do so, effectively and sustainably, with the provision of
                    substantial funding. Even though digital projects have the potential to provide
                    greater access to texts and authors that exist beyond the literary canon, major
                    projects, like the Walt Whitman and William Blake digital archives, are still
                    centered upon widely recognized authors — particularly those that figure in the
                    American and British literary traditions. According to Price and Siemens,
                    digitization projects do expand the <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013"
                        >accessible canon</quote> but these efforts have not yet resulted in a
                    broader <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013">selective canon,</quote> that
                    is, the broadening of the accessible canon has not impacted the narrow field of
                    texts valued by experts in literary studies <ptr target="#price2013"
                        loc="par. 6"/>. This reality presents obvious limitations for those students
                    who work on marginalized texts, authors, small presses, or non-print media.</p>
                <p>Because we work at a Canadian institution, we also note that many projects that
                    receive support from the federal government tend to have as their object the
                    expansion of a national canon. One such project is Editing Modernism in Canada
                    (EMiC) (discussed in greater detail in the <q>best practices</q> section below)
                    and another similar project is the Canada’s Early Women Writers (CEWW) project,
                    based at our home department at SFU. One of the student authors of this essay
                    recently joined the CEWW project, which currently employs six students on a
                    part-time basis (four graduate and two undergraduate). Students are involved in
                    conducting biographical research, compiling bibliographic information, and
                    inputting metadata. As one of the few major DH projects currently housed in our
                    English department, it provides these students with superb training. While this
                    opportunity with the CEWW is an ideal fit for one of the authors, aligning with
                    her own interests in marginalized Canadian women writers, students working in
                    different fields have fewer <soCalled>apprenticeship</soCalled> opportunities —
                    and none on the scale of CEWW. While it has always been the case that student
                    researchers are not at liberty to pick and choose the projects they can work on
                    as paid researchers, we believe that many students do not have opportunities to
                    work as paid research assistants in their own, or closely adjacent, fields. The
                    fact that many humanities departments have no, or perhaps only one, major DH
                    project further supports Price’s concerns about <quote rend="inline" source="#price2011"
                        >uneven access to resources,</quote> and his awareness that this <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#price2011">is not an issue we have had to
                            address [...] in other types of literary or humanistic

                    acknowledge, and actively seek out ways to mitigate, the impact that the uneven
                    distribution of funding has on student access to training. </p>

                <p>The rhetoric surrounding DH gestures to a bright future for new scholars, and one
                    of the most attractive aspects of the field is that it claims to be highly
                    collaborative: collaboration is described as a <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013">standard and vital practice in

                    </cit>. The <title rend="italic">LSDA</title> introduction notes that literary
                    scholars are joining forces in unlikely pairings with computer scientists,
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013">archivists, designers,
                        programmers, database designers, and many others</quote> in order to develop
                    tools that allow scholars to see literature through a different lens <ptr
                        target="#price2013" loc="par. 17"/>. Collaboration not only extends
                    laterally, to incorporate various disciplines into one project, but also
                    vertically as researchers in DH scholarship <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#price2013">regularly</quote> join forces with their students <ptr
                        target="#price2013" loc="par. 5"/>. Price and Siemens assert that such
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#price2013">alliances</quote> help to
                    facilitate student research <ptr target="#price2013" loc="par. 17"/>. Certainly,
                    our own experience of writing this essay (in person and via Google docs)
                    reflects our attempt to embody some of the principles we have articulated, and
                    suggests that DH does provide new and fruitful opportunities for collaboration. </p>
                <p>However, some of our survey results suggest that it may be an overstatement to
                    identify student researchers as working within a truly collaborative environment
                    on many DH projects. Our student survey respondents worked an average of 11.5
                    hours a week on their digital projects, but only spent an average of three hours
                    working with others (SS 9; 10). More surprisingly, 43% of the respondents — a
                    near majority — reported working with others for only one hour a week or less
                    (SS 9; 10). Additionally, when asked to rate the collaborative nature of their
                    project, 67% of the students rated their work as minimally to moderately
                    collaborative (SS 18), whereas in the equivalent faculty survey question 63%
                    rated their projects as highly collaborative (FS 5). <figure xml:id="figure04">

                    </figure> The results evidence that students perceive their work to be less
                    collaborative than faculty researchers, and this is possibly a consequence of
                    the nature of the work given to them. </p>
                <p>Within the <title rend="italic">LSDA</title>, students are discussed — though
                    almost always within the context of the classroom. Students as
                        <emph>labourers</emph> on DH projects are rarely acknowledged, whereas
                    student labour on their own projects (outside of the classroom) is never
                    mentioned. Tanya Clement does assert that student contributions to research are
                    important, but she notes that students <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#clement2013">are often unseen
                            collaborators</quote>
                        <ptr target="#clement2013" loc="par. 29"/>
                    </cit>, and in part that is because their work is preliminary. She suggests that
                    students often work <quote rend="inline" source="#clement2013">to preprocess
                        and clean the texts</quote> before they are entered into the computer for
                    analysis <ptr target="#clement2013" loc="par. 29"/>.<note> This trend may be the
                        result of expectations that student participation will be on a short-term
                        basis only; as Ashley Reed suggests, and our survey confirms (SS 7),
                        undergraduate and some graduate students involved in DH projects are
                        expected to have only <quote rend="inline" source="#reed2014">short- to
                            medium-term project tenures</quote>
                        <ptr target="#reed2014" loc="par. 34"/>. While it may be a reality that the
                        length of undergraduate and MA participation on such projects will
                        inevitably be short term, it is one that needs to be accounted for by
                        project managers so that such contributions are not undervalued.</note> This
                    type of labour — including scanning, checking and proofreading digitized texts —
                    is further described as <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#hoover2013">tedious</quote>
                        <ptr target="#hoover2013" loc="par. 14"/>
                    </cit>. While this work is critical in assembling a corpus, it is preparatory
                    work. Students may not be involved in the scholarly interpretation of the
                    results generated by the computer programs or the discussion of larger issues in
                    project development and design. Student labour remains undervalued and hidden,
                    as it often is in the world of print scholarship, in acknowledgements sections
                    and footnotes of printed books. But their work is also literally <q>unseen</q> because it exists in
                    hidden coding and programming. This problem of student work being invisible
                    intensifies in DH, as Susan Brown has observed, since many digital projects are
                    often <q>major experiments</q>
                    that result in failure — how does one evaluate efforts that produced no end <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#brown2010">product</quote>
                        <ptr target="#brown2010" loc="16"/>
                    </cit>? This poses an additional labour problem for students: if their work is
                        <q>unseen</q> or <q>unfinished,</q> how can it be
                    valued or leveraged when entering the job market? </p>
                <p>The field is certainly making progress in establishing how to evaluate such
                    efforts, but it is still questionable whether digital collaborations hold the
                    same weight in the academic world as published articles and monographs <ptr
                        target="#guidelines2012"/>. The question remains, are the humanities ready
                    to embrace the labour model of digital humanities? Brown suggests that the key
                    to this lies in understanding that all DH work — from <q>interface development</q> to <q>electronic publishing</q> — is scholarly research
                        <ptr target="#brown2010" loc="20"/>. Even though student research has been
                    hidden and undervalued in the past, it should not continue to be so in DH.
                    Instead, as with many other aspects of digital research, the field should look
                    to revolutionize the student labour model by rendering the invisible student
                    visible.</p>

                <head>Best Practices</head>
                <p>We conclude our essay with a set of best practices that advance a stadial model
                    of reform, which takes a pragmatic approach to student labour within the current
                    economic, cultural, and institutional climate. These suggestions attend to
                    practical solutions within the existing framework to help student and faculty
                    researchers foster and maintain strong, collaborative relationships across
                    levels of experience. Our final suggested reform addresses the power dynamics
                    that structure hiring practices, promotion and tenure decisions, and funding for
                    all researchers. Here, we call for a formal acknowledgment of the mentoring
                    activities – the affective and immaterial labour – that sustains much DH
                    training and many DH projects.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>(1) Formalizing Group Structure</head>
                    <p> We cannot suggest a best practice for DH projects that will eliminate
                        structural inequalities, since both our social and our academic spheres are
                        striated and hierarchical. However, we suggest that acknowledging these
                        inequalities is key in both structuring and creating meaningful work
                        environments for DH projects. Based on our survey of student researchers,
                        32% of students said that they did not know how long they would be working
                        on a project, versus 3% of faculty respondents (FS 6; SS 7). The second and
                        third most difficult aspects were <quote rend="inline" source="#private">issues of
                            communication and/or organization</quote> and <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#private">issues with time management or workload</quote> (SS 21). To
                        address these issues, we follow Freeman’s suggestion that the assignment of
                        tasks and responsibilities, as well as communication about project timelines
                        and hiring practices, be transparent. To achieve this, there needs to be an
                        explicit, negotiated power structure. </p>
                    <p>The distribution of authority should be as diffuse as possible. Though it is
                        important to recognize who has power within a group, the traditional pyramid
                        hierarchy that operates within most faculty-led research projects should be
                        acknowledged and rethought. This attention to power structure <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#freeman1970">prevents monopoly of power
                                and requires those in positions of authority to consult with many
                                others in the process of exercising it</quote>
                            <ptr target="#freeman1970" loc="5"/>
                        </cit>. If it is necessary for there to be a single project director, that
                        position should be both transparent and explicit to all members of the
                        group. Transparency can be achieved by: <list type="ordered">
                            <item>Drafting a document that outlines the responsibilities and roles
                                of each group member.</item>
                            <item>Delegating assignments and in a clearly defined and democratic
                                way. Allowing people to assume roles by default reinforces the
                                group’s hierarchal structure and exploits social inequalities. As a
                                result, group members are less likely to take responsibility for the
                                work they are doing.</item>
                            <item>Giving group members the opportunity to volunteer for tasks that
                                interest them. Participants are more likely to take responsibility

                            <item>Ensuring that members may work on their assigned tasks to

                    <head>(2) Project Management and Training as Research</head>
                    <p>Our second best practice advances a model of project management that sees
                        training as an end in itself, distinct from the project’s teleology. Too
                        often training is viewed as a necessary step towards the project’s
                        completion, rather than as part of an active model of teaching and learning.
                        Training must be a deliberate and planned activity that is formally budgeted
                        and accounted for in the project’s timeline, and should be compensated to
                        the same degree as other tasks performed within the project. Principal
                        investigators should take advantage of any available training on effective
                        project management, such as the workshop that L. Siemens has offered in the
                        past, and is offering again, at DHSI.</p>
                    <p>We also need formal opportunities to share methods and research across levels
                        of experience, and perhaps most significantly, laterally between students of
                        different disciplines. Because DH projects draw from such a diverse range of
                        experience, contact between team members needs to happen in a more
                        formalized way. Creating projects with built-in, deliberate models of
                        training, sharing, and dissemination fosters a sense of intellectual agency
                        and community. Deliberate models of training include: <list type="ordered">
                            <item>One-on-one meetings between students of different disciplines
                                where each can share their respective expertise. The average number
                                of students working on DH projects in our survey ranges between
                                three and five (FS 8), meaning that there are untapped opportunities
                                for knowledge exchange.</item>
                            <item>Professional development days where student and faculty
                                researchers work together on developing a specific skill, for
                                example, coding, database management, or editing.</item>
                            <item>Show-and-tell events where students and faculty alike can talk
                                about their individual contributions to a project, in both formal

                                    Talks</title> series: an informal, fast-paced, low-stakes panel
                                talk that allows graduate students to present their research to a
                                community of colleagues and peers. Participants offer a brief
                                introduction to their own research, and then engage in a roundtable
                                Q&amp;A period. The series provides an invaluable resource for
                                identifying common research goals, and discovering new tools and
                                methodologies.</item>
                            <item>Training institutes that offer students important contact with
                                scholars in their field and sustained, direct engagement with tools

                                institutions sponsor these types of training opportunities to make
                                them maximally accessible to students. For example, the SFU library
                                sponsors participation at DHSI, which reduces the tuition fees for
                                students from $500-800 to $300, and scholarships are also
                                available.</item>

                    <head>(3) Encouraging Student-led DH Projects</head>
                    <p>A best practice that should be encouraged, even at institutions that do not
                        have a DH centre or major DH projects, is to support students who wish to
                        develop digital projects that relate to their own research. Currently,
                        students often face difficulties attempting to launch their own projects.
                        For example, one of the graduate student authors of this essay, having
                        completed some work as a research assistant on a large-scale digital
                        archival project, wanted to apply this skill set to her own work by building
                        a digital archive from materials she discovered through her own research
                        initiatives. This idea was initially met with some reluctance, however,
                        because it did not fit the usual paradigm of faculty-supervised (and funded)
                        research. The resistance in this case seemed to stem from concerns about the
                        legitimacy of graduate student research, and an uncertain sense of protocol
                        surrounding self-directed learning. Arguably, a longstanding perception of
                        students as consumers but not producers of knowledge undergird these
                        barriers. However, Amy Earhart has recently suggested that when institutions
                        allow graduate students to develop their own projects in a collaborative
                        environment they <quote rend="inline" source="#earhart2012b">challenge power
                            structures</quote> and enable students to produce a <cit>

                        </cit>. Having seed funding explicitly available to students wishing to
                        develop their own DH projects would both enable and legitimize these
                        important initiatives, providing students with a measure of autonomy in
                        developing their own research trajectories.</p>
                    <p>The EMiC project presents a model that enables students to pursue their own
                        DH projects. The EMiC community emphasizes the importance of student
                        research by awarding stipends to graduate students who are working to create
                        their own editions of Canadian modernist texts and by providing these
                        students with the training they need to carry out this work <ptr
                            target="#about2013"/>. The <title rend="quotes">About Us</title> page on
                        their site devotes space for profiles not only of their co-applicants,
                        collaborators, and postdoctoral affiliates, but of graduate and
                        undergraduate fellows as well, which demonstrates the project’s commitment
                        to encouraging individual student projects. Of the 63 graduate fellows
                        listed on the site, more than half of this number reference independent
                        research in their personal profiles that their affiliation with EMiC has
                        enabled them to pursue. While the EMiC community has embraced the
                        collaborative ethos that transcends traditional academic boundaries, they
                        have done so by building a group structure that ensures that students are an
                        integral and recognized unit in the collaborative process. The level of
                        support that EMiC offers to student research and training at universities
                        across Canada could be taken up by a variety of projects hoping to encourage
                        students to both contribute to the overall objectives of the main project
                        while also learning new digital skills that they can apply to their own
                        research.</p>

                    <head>4) Encouraging Student-led Dissemination in Large-scale DH Projects</head>
                    <p>Fostering an atmosphere in which students feel their contributions to be
                        impactful and visible remains a significant challenge in DH. We posit that a
                        lack of involvement in the dissemination of project outcomes — particularly
                        in the forms of publication that are esteemed by the academy — prevents both
                        students and the academic field as a whole from seeing student research as
                        tantamount to faculty research. It is important that student researchers are
                        encouraged to take ownership of their contributions to larger, grant-funded
                        projects, especially because the majority of students are involved in
                        projects for a much shorter duration than the length of the project as a
                        whole (SS 7). Our student survey respondents indicated a lack of
                        contribution to research dissemination: less than 20% of respondents had
                        contributed to the dissemination of their project’s findings in the form of
                        single- or co-authored conference papers; fewer still (9%) had contributed
                        in the form of single- or co-authored print publications (SS 19). The most
                        common form of dissemination (39%) was through Web-based or social media
                        content (blog posts, tweets, status updates, etc.), which, though an
                        important step toward students conceiving of their scholarship as a part of
                        public discourse, does not inspire the same degree of recognition and
                        cultural legitimacy as more traditional forms of publication (SS 19).

                        </figure> We believe, in the spirit of digital collaboration, that student
                        researchers should be encouraged to disseminate their research — both
                        independently and as part of or on behalf of a larger collective.<note> The

                    <head>(5) Recognizing Affective Labour in DH</head>
                    <p>For students and faculty alike who are conducting research outside of
                        large-scale DH projects, and at institutions without established DH centres,
                        we would like to propose a model of training that formally recognizes the
                        value of mentorship, what Michael Hardt terms <quote rend="inline"
                            source="#hardt1999">affective labour.</quote> Affective labour <cit>
                            <quote rend="inline" source="#hardt1999">is itself… the constitution of
                                communities and collective subjectivities</quote>
                            <ptr target="#hardt1999" loc="89"/>
                        </cit> and the term describes the processes of human interaction that create
                        a sense of interconnectivity, compassion, and well-being. Within an academic
                        setting, affective labour involves forging connections with other
                        researchers through conferences, informal gatherings, social media, and
                        other channels. Researchers share their expertise in formal and informal
                        ways such as workshops or Skype conferences, email correspondence, and
                        informal peer review. Crucially, the exchange between speaker and audience
                        is not monetary, but communicative: both parties invest in a sense of
                        community-building, and the free and open exchange of knowledge. Mentoring
                        is perhaps the single most important and sustainable form of training in DH,
                        as students who benefit from these activities will be more likely to share
                        their own expertise in a similar way. But while this model is, in large
                        part, already the norm in DH circles, it rarely receives the notice and
                        reward it deserves. We recommend that affective labour be formally
                        recognized, through: <list type="ordered">
                            <item>Acknowledgement on project, course, and department
                                websites.</item>
                            <item>Acknowledgement in publications and other forms of
                                dissemination.</item>

                            <item>Evaluation for grants and other forms of funding.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>We hope that there will be further discussion about these, and other best
                        practices, and we acknowledge that all such attempts to develop new models
                        of student labour and training will take time and effort to implement.
                        However, we believe that this is a discussion that the DH community must
                        have if it wishes to fulfill its promise of transforming the humanities.</p>
