               <div class="ptext" id="p1">This article discusses <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>, a long
                  computational poem by Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland (2010). The poem’s length
                  prevents human readers from reading it completely. I argue that although the poem’s
                  global inaccessibility raises complex interpretive problems, we can surmount them
                  by
                  applying multiple interpretive modes to a single textual fragment, thereby meeting
                  the
                  fragmentary text with a fragmented critical discourse; the idea being that a more
                  coherent theoretical apparatus would, in its latent totalizing impulse, be intrinsically
                  unsuited to a fragment’s incompleteness. I use this technique to read <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> through various lenses including, <span class="hi italic">inter alia</span>, cosine similarity, affect theory, and code. I conclude
                  with a website that reimagines the poem by populating its sea with language from the
                  critical literature on the poem. Like <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>,
                  this website cannot be circumnavigated by human readers and so enacts this
                  article’s solution to the problem of how to read computational poems that cannot be
                  read
                  completely: to interrogate the assumptions that cause us to view unreadability as
                  a
                  problem, and to embrace incompleteness as a source of critical insight.

                     Dickinson”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#montfort2010">Montfort and Strickland 2010</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#montfort2013">Montfort and Strickland 2013</a>]. The stanzas are comprised of a subset of the union of
                     the words in Herman Melville’s <cite class="title italic">Moby-Dick</cite> and Emily
                     Dickinson’s poetry. The words are combined and recombined by the poem’s code in a
                     manner that moves the language back and forth between the compressed
                     interiority of Dickinson’s poetry and the expansive intensity of Melville’s prose.
                     The poem’s words flicker and change as the reader’s mouse navigates the sea, like
                     the
                     water disturbed by a prow moving through waves. At the bottom of the screen is a
                     search bar, where the reader can enter coordinates to move to a specific location
                     in
                     the sea; each stanza in <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> has, and is
                     locatable by, two unique coordinates, which Montfort and Strickland conceptualize
                     as
                     latitude and longitude. The set of latitude and longitude values both range from
                     0–14992382 inclusive, meaning that the total number of stanzas is 149923822.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e204">[1]</a>

                     the critical literature on <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Mainly, however, “consists” is misleading because the poem is impossible to read
                     completely and, by extension, the reader cannot definitively identify the poem’s
                     constituent parts. (By “impossible to read completely” I
                     mean “impossible for a human to read completely”; a
                     sufficiently advanced computer could parse the entire poem.) The poem is impossible
                     to read because of its scale. Montfort and Strickland write: “<cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> is a poetry generator which
                     defines a space of language populated by a number of stanzas comparable to the
                     number of fish in the sea, around 225 trillion”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#montfort2016">Montfort 2016</a>]. Its order of magnitude is therefore 10<span class="hi superscript">14</span>, a length
                     that makes <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> a nexus between one of
                     poetry’s oldest genres (epic) and one of its newest (computational poetry), though
                     here the <span class="hi italic">nostos</span> is incompletable and the hero, if there is
                     one, is anonymous. To use the Melvillean language that the poem invites, its length
                     transforms the reader into an Ahab surrogate, and the text into an analogue of the
                     white whale, though the pursuit of the latter by the former is indefinitely prolonged
                     because, as Stuart Moulthrop and Justin Schumaker write, a “complete reading” of the poem “would take more than
                     200 million years” [<a class="ref" href="#moulthrop2016">Molthrop and Schumaker 2016</a>, 135]. To appreciate the Sisyphean nature of
                     reading <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> more fully, observe that a
                     reader who has read 225 stanzas has only read 1e-10% of the poem. Given the
                     impossibility of completely reading <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar
                        Between</cite>, then, the question becomes whether it is possible (and if so, how)
                     to extrapolate an accurate sense of the poem’s architectonic whole from its
                     fragments. Although reconstructing the lost general from the extant particular is
                     a
                     common task in disciplines such as archaeology, it is an alien task to the readers
                     of
                     contemporary poetry, where the dominant genre, lyric, is characterized by structural
                     intelligibility (because lyric poems are conventionally brief). Moreover, as Joseph
                     Frank writes, “modern poetry asks its readers to suspend the
                     process of individual reference temporarily until the entire pattern of internal
                     references can be apprehended as a unit”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#frank1945">Frank 1945</a>, 230]. But in texts with largely unfathomable (because
                     unfathomably large) referential patterns, this process of referential suspension is
                     drastically extended, which effectively makes it impossible to a apprehend “the entire pattern of internal references”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#frank1945">Frank 1945</a>, 230]. In such cases, Stuart Moulthrop asks, how
                     “do we choose configurations of output to serve as
                     representations of the work or objects of study?”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#moulthrop2017">Moulthrop 2017</a>]. One way of answering Moulthrop’s question is to look
                     to classical studies. Due to the fragmentary state of much of the Greco-Roman corpus,
                     classicists have also had to confront the question of how to interpret splinters of
                     output from inaccessible signifiers. Although the separation of classical textual
                     parts from their original wholes is due to the historical vicissitudes of textual
                     transmission, whereas the separation of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar
                        Between</cite>’s parts from its whole is due to a contingent aesthetic decision
                     by its author-programmers, the consequences are identical: our tacit assumptions
                     about what it means for a text to be complete are foregrounded, and we are compelled
                     to explore new modes of interpretation and reading. Because “fragmentation . . . hinders our understanding of . . . narrative structure,
                     particularly our ability to form any critical reading of it”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#balmer2013">Balmer 2013</a>, 67], these new modes must be open-ended. And, as Susan Stephens argues, because hypotheses
                     about the relationship between a fragment and its whole are intrinsically non-falsifiable,
                     critics are “grant[ed] considerable latitude . . . for interpretation,” which results
                     in an “almost I wonder why ‘almost’?open-ended hermeneutic
                     environment”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#stephens2002">Stephens 2002</a>, 77]. Editing fragments, she suggests, should
                     therefore be conducted along subjunctive lines as a “negotiation,
                     an exploration of the possibilities rather than the transmission of dogma”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#martin2018">Martin and Langin-Hooper 2018</a>, 84]. Stephens’s emphasis on interpretive plurality
                     is representative of a theoretical shift in the criticism of classical fragments.
                     The
                     “standard scholarly practise,” S. Rebecca Martin and
                     Stephanie Langin-Hooper write, “was to understand them [i.e.,
                     fragments] as incomplete things, whose principal purpose was to serve as a
                     referent to a complete . . . whole”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#martin2018">Martin and Langin-Hooper 2018</a>, 1]. Increasingly, however, fragments are being
                     valued as texts and objects “in their own right” (ibid.),
                     rather than as the offcuts of an absent signifier, especially because fragments
                     implicitly “eschew” the totalizing impulse of conventional representational
                     modes such as naturalism, and thereby allow us to explore alternative modes that
                     embrace incompleteness (ibid., 10). Because fragments eschew totalities in favor of
                     the partial, the criticism of fragments can switch between multiple perspectives to
                     an extent that, in other critical contexts, could be condemned
                     as insufficiently rigorous. The benefit of thinking about <cite class="title italic">Sea
                        and Spar Between</cite> through the lens of fragmentation, then, is that the
                     poem’s main theoretical challenge (how to “choose configurations
                     of output to serve as representations of the work”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#moulthrop2017">Moulthrop 2017</a>]) dissolves because the work’s unreadability transforms
                     from an insoluble problem into an invitation to critical multiplicity.</div>

                     us to move between different critical paradigms, we end up looking at them from
                     various perspectives; ironically, therefore, we can see the fragment more completely

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">We can view (22, 22) through several different paradigms. For example, as a hub from
                     which spokes of stanzas radiate outwards, or as the temporary midpoint of a conveyor
                     belt of stanzas paratactically related to one another, or as a volta signalling a
                     pivot in thought or pitch that divides the stanzas of the upper half from those of
                     the lower, or as an element in an n-tuple. Of course, these examples do not exhaust
                     the possible perspectives we might adopt. As Barry Stroud writes, “The only limitation on possible conceptual schemes is our limited
                     ingenuity in inventing them” (1975, 92). But before selecting one of the
                     above paradigms to apply to (22, 22) and its local context, the limits of that
                     context have to be determined. How many of the stanzas in Figure 2 should we read?
                     (There are three obvious possibilities<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e379">[2]</a>: first, every stanza depicted within
                     Figure 2, second, the row or column within which (22, 22) appears, third, (22, 22)
                     <span class="hi italic">tout court</span>.) For if we want to focus on <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>’s textual micro-levels, then we must
                     decide how to partition the poem into micro-levels. And unless we choose to read each
                     stanza as if it were <span class="hi italic">sui generis</span> and therefore completely
                     unrelated to its neighbours, then our chosen micro-level must allow for the grouping
                     of interrelated stanzas and the mapping of relationships between stanza-groups. The
                     problem, in a nutshell, is that it is not immediately clear how to accomplish this.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"> These groups should be discrete insofar as the point of collapsing <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> into micro-levels is to create a set of
                     sub-poems that are feasibly interpretable in isolation, as opposed to stanzas that
                     are interpretively dependent on their connections to stanzas around them, and the
                     stanzas situated concentrically beyond those stanzas, and so on for some indefinite
                     distance. So, the partitioning of stanzas will ideally be based on a system that we
                     can use to distinguish nonarbitrary points at which one set of related stanzas ends
                     and another begins. For example, we might group stanzas together based on
                     linguistic-thematic coherence. The difficulty with formulating a partitioning system
                     and applying it to <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> is that the
                     gradation of the poem’s language is exceptionally fine; textual elements from one
                     stanza bleed subtly into its neighbouring stanzas, whereupon they are minutely
                     calibrated before bleeding into a neighbouring stanza’s neighbouring stanza, and so
                     on. Variation occurs gradually and delicately, much like oceanographic variation
                     between different bodies of water, making it difficult to identify points at which
                     to
                     nonarbitrarily separate groups of stanzas.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">For example, consider Figure 3. It
                     depicts each stanza from Figure 2 as a circle or circular segment — with each
                     stanza’s constituent words extending outwards from, and placed at equidistant points
                     around, its respective circle’s circumference — scattered at random points upon a
                     rectangle. Note that each coordinate is represented as an integer: (24, 22), for
                     example, becomes “2422.” The impression, bearing in mind that the placement of
                     the circles is random and therefore that imbrication does not imply relatedness, is
                     of a set of atomic stanzas. The most sensible textual micro-level against which to
                     align one’s reading of the stanzas depicted here, then, appears to be each stanza
                     in
                     and of itself. It is difficult to see, judging from Figure 3 alone, how one might
                     nonarbitrarily connect, say, the stanzas at (24, 21) and (23, 20). But when this
                     process is repeated (see Figure 4), with the crucial adjustment of diagramming word
                     <span class="hi italic">types</span>, not word <span class="hi italic">tokens</span>, the set of
                     twenty stanzas is replaced by a set of three stanzas.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e414">[3]</a>In other words, once
                     the reader has read three of the twenty stanzas (i.e., 15% of the stanzas), they will
                     have read every word type that appears in the stanza-rectangle; the remaining 85%
                     of
                     text consists solely of permutations of the tokens of those types. Figure 4 thus
                     illustrates that the stanzas within the rectangle are much more similar than Figure
                     3
                     suggests. The task of nonarbitrarily splitting the set of stanzas into subsets
                     therefore becomes more difficult because as similarity increases, so too does the
                     temptation to leave the entire set <span class="hi italic">in situ</span> as a textual
                     micro-level in and of itself. This point can also be illustrated mathematically, and
                     I want to do so to underscore the extraordinary extent to which <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> is indivisible, before considering what interpretive
                     purchase this indivisibility affords us.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Let us examine a rectangle, with vertices located at the coordinates (100, 109),
                     (104, 109), (104, 90), and (100, 90), that contains 100 stanzas. And let us place
                     those stanzas within a term vector model. Say we have a stanza S that is part of a
                     group of stanzas GS located in vector space VS. The number of dimensions in VS equals
                     the number of unique words (W) in GS. So, VS = {W<span class="hi subscript">1</span>, W<span class="hi subscript">2</span>, …, W<span class="hi subscript">n</span>}. And in VS, S = {w<span class="hi subscript">S1</span>,
                     w<span class="hi subscript">S2</span>, …, w<span class="hi subscript">Sn</span>}, where wSn represents the weight of Wn in S, where the weight is a
                     number that, in this case, is defined by how often Wn appears in S. For example, if
                     “Ishmael” were the 7th word in VS and occurred 5 times in S, then w<span class="hi subscript">S7</span> = 5. Repeating
                     this process for every stanza in GS for every word in VS would result in a sparse
                     matrix like the one depicted in Table 1. </div>

                     Although the above vectors are relatively dissimilar in terms of Euclidean distance
                     (vector magnitude), the angle they form is acute and they are therefore similar in
                     terms of vector orientation (which is intuitive, insofar as both documents are
                     comprised of the same words and differ only with respect to the frequency of those
                     words). Vector orientation is the better measurement of document similarity in vector
                     space. For example, though one might assume that if term z appears more frequently
                     in
                     document x than in document y by a factor of ten, then x is more concerned with z
                     than y, document x might simply be ten times larger than document y, in which case
                     both documents would be equally related (proportionally) to the topic denoted by term
                     z (assuming z is not polysemous). Vector orientation reflects this kind of
                     isomorphism better than vector magnitude. The cosine of the angle that two vectors
                     form is one way to measure text similarity. As the cosine of the angle between two
                     vectors approaches 1 (cos(θ) = 0°), the texts those vectors represent will
                     theoretically be more similar. As the cosine approaches 0 (cos(θ) = 90°) the texts
                     will theoretically be less similar. As the cosine approaches -1 (cos(θ) = 180°) the
                     texts will theoretically be more opposite.  I took the 100 stanzas located within
                     the above stanza-rectangle, computed each stanza’s cosine similarity to every other
                     stanza, and exported the results to a spreadsheet, which can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/moona740/Nat_Moore_MA_Thesis/blob/master/cosinebagofwords%20(1).xlsx" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/moona740/Nat_Moore_MA_Thesis/blob/master/cosinebagofwords%20(1).xlsx'); return false" class="ref">https://github.com/moona740/Nat_Moore_MA_Thesis/blob/master/cosinebagofwords%20(1).xlsx</a>. Note that the minimum cosine
                     similarity between two stanzas here is 0, not -1, because the algorithm I used is
                     based on term frequency (how often a word appears in a document, operating under the
                     assumption that if two texts share a roughly similar vocabulary, and the frequency
                     distribution of that vocabulary is also roughly similar, then they are roughly alike)
                     and a word cannot appear &lt; 0 times in a text. The cells highlighted in red are
                     those that show a cosine similarity between 0.7 and 0.99 inclusive. There are 3046
                     cells in this range. But this figure does not tell us the
                     number of <span class="hi italic">unique</span> instances of cosine similarities between 0.7
                     and 0.99 because cosine similarity calculation is based on multiplication (the cosine
                     of two vectors is essentially their scalar product divided by their length product),
                     which is commutative. In other words, the spreadsheet (E) equals its own transpose
                     (E
                     = ET); the value of the cell at row <span class="hi subscript">x</span> and column<span class="hi subscript">y</span> is identical to the cell at rowy and
                     columnx. So, to find the number of <span class="hi italic">unique</span> instances of cosine
                     values in the desired range, we need to divide 3046 in half, resulting in a quotient
                     of 1523. A rectangle with 100 stanzas has 10,000 ordered pairs of stanzas.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e777">[4]</a> This means
                     that 15.23% of the stanzas within the rectangle highly resemble (linguistically and
                     thematically), at least one other stanza also therein. What interpretive purchase
                     does this data give us? It reemphasizes that even relatively distant stanzas within
                     the poem’s stanza-lattice are similar. For example, the first stanza within the
                     rectangle has a cosine similarity of 0.8198 with the 99th stanza. The second stanza
                     has a cosine similarity of 0.8421 with the 94th stanza. The 76th stanza has a cosine
                     similarity of 0.9474 with the 35th stanza. These similarities complicate attempts
                     to
                     sculpt the poem into discrete micro-levels because they show that there is a low
                     correlation between Euclidean distance and linguistic-thematic gradation. Reading
                     the
                     stanza-rectangle is therefore complicated because it is less a stanza-rectangle than
                     a stanza-web, with a practically infinite number of interconnecting strands. For
                     example, if we took our previous stanza-web and stretched it from 100 stanzas to 1000
                     stanzas (an increase of 900%), the number of ordered pairs would increase from 10,000
                     to 1,000,000 (an increase of 9900%, which is an example of the curse of
                     dimensionality, i.e., the problems that occur when interpreting data in high
                     dimensional spaces). If roughly 15.23% of these ordered pairs were also significantly
                     like at least one other stanza in the same web, then we would be left with the
                     infeasibly large figure of 152,300 highly related stanza-pairs to read. </div>

                     returns us to the poem’s size and revolves around what J. H. Prynne terms “the principle of <span class="hi italic">scale</span> and its working in
                     poetical composition,” by which he means that “very
                     small, local details can point to and complicate very large ideas or features of
                     argument”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#prynne2013">Prynne 2013</a>, 3]. By extension, Prynne argues, we can use small
                     textual data as “primary instruments to think with, to uncover
                     and investigate connections that can extend far beyond their immediate
                     occurrence”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#prynne2013">Prynne 2013</a>, 3]. As a kind of proof of concept, Prynne proceeds
                     to use a single word (“incense”) as an interpretive key with which to unlock
                     <cite class="title italic">Paradise Lost</cite>. There is nothing in Prynne’s analysis
                     to suggest that he believes the inferential movement from the small to the large is
                     a
                     heuristic that should be limited to the analysis of Miltonic texts. It seems fair
                     to
                     assume that Prynne subscribes to a literary version of quantum entanglement. “Two quantum-entangled particles . . . can be arbitrarily separated
                     in space whilst remaining interdependent with respect to their measurable
                     properties, such that a change in one will invariably be accompanied by a change
                     in the other,” writes William M. R. Simpson [<a class="ref" href="#simpson2017">Simpson 2017</a>, 5]. If we replace “particles” with “signifiers” then we have a
                     gloss of Prynne’s vision of the poetic connection between the local and the global.

                     generates 149923832<span class="hi superscript">2</span> stanzas. 0.00120685493% of 149923832<span class="hi superscript">2</span> stanzas, rounded to the
                     nearest integer, is two billion, seven hundred twelve million, six hundred sixty-six
                     thousand, five hundred thirty-two stanzas. At my normal reading speed, I can read
                     about twelve stanzas of the poem in one minute. I would thus require roughly 43 years
                     to read 0.00120685493% of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>. And even
                     if I did devote my life to this quixotic task, I could not take what I had read and
                     “trace its . . . echoes and ambiguities of reference across
                     the entire poem,” as Prynne does with the word “incense,” for the
                     simple reason that I would still have another 99.9987931451% of the poem to read
                     before I could do so. Readers of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>
                     cannot use the “small to illustrate or endorse the large,”

                        Between</cite> resists division into subsets because its interconnectedness makes
                     it difficult to identify exactly where to nonarbitrarily split its macro-level into
                     different micro-levels. Even if <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> did
                     explicitly encourage textual partitioning, subsequent partitions would have to be
                     exceptionally minute to be feasibly readable, and they would therefore have little
                     extrapolative value. Prynne’s principle of scale — “that very
                     small, local details can point to and complicate very large ideas or features of
                     argument” — is ultimately subordinate to the principle of meta-scale
                     because the micro-level of a very large macro-level makes a mockery of its prefix:
                     1%
                     of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>, for example, is two trillion,
                     two-hundred fifty million stanzas. Consequently, to use the words of Aristotle,
                     “as the eye cannot take it all in at once, the unity and sense
                     of the whole is lost for the spectator”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#aristotle1911">Aristotle 1911</a>, 31], and readers are therefore restricted to
                     conjecture, using whatever they can glean from the poem’s fragments, when questions
                     are raised about the poem as a totality. The poem’s readers, then, have little choice
                     but to resemble those critics who Brian McHale censures for staking their arguments
                     on apparently key pieces of text, which are subsequently treated as “interpretive centres . . . around which to organize . . .
                     heterogenous material”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mchale2004">McHale 2004</a>, 139]. Poems thus interpreted, McHale argues, are
                     “reduced, in effect, to a skeletal structure of points that
                     yield most readily to a particular interpretive orientation”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mchale2004">McHale 2004</a>, 139]. “This strategy,”
                     McHale writes, leads to the reduction of a poem to a “collection
                     of decontextualized ‘key’ quotes,” and, as a result, “the bulk of the poem goes uninterpreted — unread, to all intents and
                     purposes”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mchale2004">McHale 2004</a>, 139]. The difference is that the bulk of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> is not unread “to
                     all intents and purposes,” but literally unreadable; the reader’s reliance
                     on fragments of text is an imposed and unavoidable constraint, not a culpable failure
                     to meet what McHale calls “the obligation toward the difficult

                     Montfort and Strickland have deliberately thwarted the possibility of understanding
                     the poem’s whole by restricting readers to a virtually endless series of fragmentary
                     parts. We are thus forced to navigate the text in a manner reminiscent of the <cite class="title italic">Pequod</cite>’s peripatetic voyage (our search for stable textual
                     meaning is therefore ambiguously conflated with Ahab’s dangerous and arguably
                     pointless obsession), and the conventional tools of close reading, as we have seen,

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20"> What we
                     need is a close reading of close reading. One place from which we might draw
                     inspiration for this task is the criticism of classical textual fragments. Here, I
                     argue, we can find a set of provisional, flexible principles that work with, rather
                     than against, the fragmentation of <span class="hi italic">Sea and Spar Between</span>.
                     According to the translator Diane Rayor, one such principle is the resolution to make
                     textual lacunae evoke “connections,” not “absences,” which thereby enables readers “to bridge the gap” between a fragment and its absent whole (quoted by <a href="#balmer2013">Balmer [2013], 50</a>). In the remaining sections
                     of this article, I attempt to invest the fragments of <cite class="title italic">Sea and

                     array of alternatives to close reading (for example, the mode I turn to next
                     concentrates upon the reader’s affectual experience of the poem). In doing so, I
                     suggest that the best way to interpret a text that always already comes to us in
                     fragmented form is not only through <em class="emph">using</em> the fragment as an organizing
                     critical trope, but also through the mimetic <em class="emph">making</em> of new interpretive

                     than the reader’s “brain,” which cannot absorb the blue to which it is,
                     paradoxically, both parallel (grammatically) and incommensurate (spatially). We have
                     seen that conventional close reading is ill-suited to circumventing the challenges
                     that this inversion poses. I want now to examine a mode of reading that may be better
                     suited to the vastness of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>. It is
                     the mode that each of the poem’s authors recommend (for now, we will reserve
                     judgement as to whether this counts in the mode’s favour or against it), though their
                     recommendations differ on a subtle but profound point. We can therefore add Montfort
                     and Strickland to the list of oppositions (e.g., sea and spar, Melville and
                     Dickinson, longitude and latitude) that cumulatively entrench juxtaposition as one
                     of
                     the poem’s central structural principles. First I want to address Montfort’s
                     recommendation: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>We do not consider that readers will often
                           seek out particularly apt stanzas and wish to return to them. While
                           returning to a favorite stanza is possible in our system, it may seem a curious
                           quest . . . . For some readers, the experience of <span class="hi italic">Sea and
                              Spar Between</span> will occur rather in the texture, operation, and journey
                           of reading the work as it presents itself, rather than in any particular
                           destination. Finding the free experience of reading to be better than the
                           saving of coordinates, they will soon be “Done with the Compass –– / Done
                           with the Chart!”

                     words in the best order, and on the high modernist values of originality and verbal
                     mastery, it is only somewhat of a surprise to read a poet predict that their readers
                     will prioritize texture over text. But it becomes more surprising when we recognize
                     that Montfort’s quote is from one of Dickinson’s most anthologized poems, “Wild Nights — Wild Nights!” The decision to use an acclaimed
                     poem to buttress the thesis that <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>’s
                     stanzas are fungible is, at best, dissonant; quoting apt words to promote the
                     interpretive equivalent of drifting at sea is potentially self-defeating. For it
                     might make us ask why a text that is purportedly a homage to Dickinson’s poetry would
                     meet certain distinctive features of her oeuvre — originality, concision, and
                     concentration of meaning — antithetically with repetition, prolix, and dispersal of
                     meaning. But we should be cautious of this question because were we to truly ask it,
                     then we would move beyond the textual analysis of “particularly apt stanzas” to
                     the meta-textual analysis of “texture, operation, and journey,” which would
                     leave us uncritically obeying Montfort’s interpretive vision in a manner reminiscent
                     of some of the more obsequious crew members of the <cite class="title italic">Pequod</cite>. Such obedience is already ubiquitous. The critical responses to
                     <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> (not excluding my own) are
                     marked on the one hand by little to no discussion about individual stanzas, and on
                     the other by prolonged discussion about the poem as a whole, or rather on the
                     impossibility of discussing the poem as a whole (see <a href="#moulthrop2016">Moulthrop and Schumaker [2016]</a>; <span class="error"><a href="#aquilina2017">Aquilina

                     entirely agree with the paradigm of reading that Montfort advocates is the figure
                     from whom one would least expect divergence: his co-author. Strickland writes:

                     often seek out particularly apt stanzas and wish to return to them”
                     contradicts Strickland’s assertion that any one of the poem’s stanzas might “resonate . . . with meme-like force,” because readers of
                     poetry typically return to resonant stanzas. This contradiction is surprising because
                     Montfort’s “we,” unless it is royal, implies consensus. Further shattering the
                     illusion of consensus, Montfort’s emphasis on the singular (“texture” as opposed
                     to “textures,”
                     <span class="hi italic">mutatis mutandis</span> for “operation” and “journey”)
                     implies that the poem is a vehicle for a single affect. Yet Strickland’s emphasis
                     on
                     plurality (expressed in the language of the consumer warning: “this impression will
                     vary”) implies that the reader can autonomously dictate the text’s affectual
                     impact because they can “choose” to “contextualize” their impressions
                     “within wider . . . waves of reading.” The contradiction seems intractable.
                     On the one hand, how can a poem that is so formally and conceptually excessive play
                     host to only one affect? But on the other, how could a poem so overwhelmingly large
                     fail to overwhelm the reader, and how could this irresistible devastation of
                     attention not be the poem’s sole texture? The answer is that both are correct at
                     different points in time. Strickland is initially correct, and then, after an
                     indefinite period, the varying impressions that underlie her vision of the
                     “registration” of experience degenerate to a single texture: fatigue.</div>

                           animal wins its way up against the stream, by alternate pulses of active and
                           passive motion, now resisting the current, and now yielding to it in order to
                           gather strength . . . . This is no unapt emblem of the mind’s self-experience

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">What I have been calling Strickland’s “prediction” also functions as a
                     prescription, and what it prescribes is prioritizing the mind’s self-experience in
                     the act of reading over the act of reading. In “The Function of
                     Criticism at the Present Time,” Matthew Arnold praises the self-scrutiny of
                     Edmund Burke (“that return of Burke upon himself”
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#burke1914">#burke1914</a></span>); Strickland similarly endorses the reader’s
                     return upon themselves as an object of critical reflection. In doing so, she reenacts
                     the so-called affective turn by turning to the reader’s affective experience as a
                     productive theoretical lens. (The “affective turn” names a growing fascination
                     with affect in the social sciences and humanities. It is difficult to be more precise
                     because “affect theory is a notoriously diffuse area of
                     study,” which lacks “any generally agreed definition of
                     the central object”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#brown2019">Brown et al. 2019</a>, 21]. However, the key idea is that humans are “imbued with subliminal affective intensities that . . . decisively
                     influence or condition our political and other beliefs”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#leys2011">Leys 2011</a>, 436]. Affect theory is grounded in these “affective intensities” and their entanglement with discursive
                     forces.) Affect theory, at first glance, seems a promising way of overcoming the
                     poem’s expansion of scale by situating the effects of that expansion in an inversely
                     <em class="emph">contracted</em> locus: the reader’s body. Because, regardless of a text’s
                     inscrutability, readers can always scrutinize their own subjective feelings (granted
                     the Cartesian presumption that individuals have secure and privileged access to the
                     first-person phenomenal realm, which is open to debate: see <span class="error"><a href="#srinivason2015">Srinivasan [2015]</a></span>). Even if a text is hostile to
                     intellectual assimilation, the reader’s conscious affective response to that
                     hostility is, <span class="hi italic">ceteris paribus</span>, still assimilable. So, although
                     <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> seems affectively recalcitrant
                     in its overall inscrutability, that blankness and closure invite an affective
                     response, and Strickland’s prediction hence begins to seem increasingly perceptive.
                     In a zone of partially unparseable poetic meanings, she denies that the reader’s
                     meaning-making capacity is consequently disabled. Instead, she predicts, the
                     impulses, attitudes, and emotions provoked by an unsynthesizable text will themselves
                     cohere into a meaningful gestalt. The poem’s effectively infinite scale is therefore
                     met, and neutralized, by the effectively infinite range of affects available to human
                     readers. According to the logic of Strickland’s prediction, the frustration of the
                     reader’s capacity to make meaningful claims about the textual whole stimulates
                     affective states; those states are meaningful; the reader’s meaning-making capacity
                     is therefore rehabilitated; experiential registration is therefore privileged over
                     experiential anticipation. Strickland’s impressionism is partially borne out by the
                     reader’s short-term experiential response to the poem. The only upper limit on the
                     quantity of these responses is the number of people who have read the poem because
                     each will have had a unique reading experience. But once the reader realizes that
                     they have no hope of circumnavigating the poem’s sea, the plurality of affectual
                     responses begins to converge to a deep and relentless boredom. For the longer one
                     reads, the less one is able to ignore the poem’s scale and its consequences,
                     including, most notably, fatigue. At this point, Montfort’s prediction comes into
                     effect: “finding the free experience of reading to be better than
                     the saving of coordinates . . . [the reader] will soon be ‘Done with the Compass
                     –– / Done with the Chart!’”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#montfort2013">Montfort and Strickland 2013</a>].The phrase “free experience” imbues the reader’s
                     dismissal of “compass” and “chart” with a liberating sense of <span class="hi italic">amor fati</span>, which conjures images of the reader traversing the
                     poem’s sea with insouciant disregard for the impossibility of ever reaching shore.
                     But if we return to the poem from which Montfort extracts his concluding quotation
                     (Dickinson’s “Wild Nights — Wild Nights!”), we can see
                     that Dickinson’s speaker is only “done” with navigational instruments because
                     they are immobilized, which renders such instruments superfluous:

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">Dickinson’s speaker is port-bound, and it is this confinement that inverts
                     traditional symbols of movement (wind) and autonomous exploration (maps) to make them
                     represent, with an almost perverse irony, their respective antitheses. Montfort’s
                     prediction therefore resembles the sea in its concealment of its contents below a
                     surface. Even if the reader begins to operate <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar
                        Between</cite> with a unique method, or with the aim of charting an
                     experimentally nonlinear journey, or by paying close self-referential attention to
                     their textural experience — thereby fulfilling Montfort’s ostensible prediction —
                     those operations, journeys, or textures will eventually contract into the texture
                     of,
                     and journey through, imposed determinism: the brute reality of the poem’s scale. The
                     reader thus moves from the poem’s operator to that which is operated upon, which
                     places their interpretive autonomy in peril. What Montfort conceals below the surface
                     of his prediction is that each “particular destination” is
                     merely a way-stop on the journey to the poem’s final destination of stupefaction,
                     a
                     terminus that is especially inescapable if one’s method of escape depends on “texture, operation, and journey.” Attempts to transcend the
                     poem’s size-imposed uninterpretability through tactical neglect of interpretation
                     will only manage to defer the problem of scale for an interval that is inversely
                     correlated to the duration of the reader’s reading session. Engaging with the poem’s
                     size is the <span class="hi italic">sine qua non</span> of prolonged engagement with the
                     poem. </div>

                     dethroned by Montfort’s, I want now to concretely demonstrate how this process
                     occurs. Suppose I am about to enter <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>
                     and have decided to focus on how I read rather than what I read. I then observe that
                     although many critics have noted that each stanza has two coordinates (denoting
                     longitude and latitude), the possibilities that these coordinates open up have been
                     neglected (apart from the obvious utilitarian functionality: coordinates can be typed
                     into a search bar to move the reader to that location). But if we let each horizontal
                     and vertical coordinate stand for an x- and y-value, respectively, then we can map
                     every stanza of the poem on to a Cartesian plane. For example, here are the stanzas

                     the exertion of “initial.” The sinusoidal pattern of reading could stimulate
                     hundreds of <span class="hi italic">initial</span> affectual experiences: curiosity,
                     displeasure, mesmerisation by the sine wave’s endless oscillation between its range
                     of [-1, 1] and so on. As Strickland correctly
                     predicts, the reader’s “impression will vary”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#montfort2013">Montfort and Strickland 2013</a>]. But only initially. If you have followed the above
                     instructions, then you will know that whatever affective response the poem first
                     provokes will, given enough time, eventually decay to a homogenous affectual
                     experience. The critical consensus is that this experience is one of sublimity. For
                     example, Aquilina writes that “‘Sea and Spar
                     Between’ . . . is a poetic experience that provokes the
                     ‘sublime’”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#aquilina2018">Aquilina 2018</a>, 209], and Hayles claims that the poem’s “effect is a kind of technological sublime”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2018">Hayles 2018</a>]. Moreover, the editors of the third volume of the
                     Electronic Literature Collection call <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between
                        </cite>an allegory of the relationship between readers and “a
                     digital sublime. Montfort and Strickland demonstrate how the massive scales of
                     computer data far exceed human phenomenology”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#boluk2016">Boluk et al. 2016</a>]. Finally, Moulthrop and Schumaker argue that <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> explores “a
                     topological sublime — a level of possibility and complexity that overloads
                     traditional cognitive structures,” noting also that the poem “countersigns its topological excursion with reference to an older
                     register of the sublime,” namely the sea, which functions as an “image of natural immensity”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#moulthrop2016">Molthrop and Schumaker 2016</a>, 135]. But the sublime, with its Romantic
                     connotations of awe and astonishment, is an incongruous paradigm with which to read
                     a
                     poem that ultimately induces overwhelming fatigue. A more appropriate aesthetic category
                     is Sianne Ngai’s “stuplime” (a portmanteau of “stupefaction” and
                     “sublime”), which she defines as “the unusual synthesis
                     of excitations and fatigue” stimulated by “encounters
                     with vast but bounded artificial systems resulting in repetitive and often
                     mechanical acts of enumeration, permutation and combination”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 36]. According to Immanuel Kant, sublimity is
                     experienced when an observer confronts an overwhelming whole that precipitates a
                     sense of cognitive and perceptual inadequacy [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 265]. But
                     for Kant, Ngai writes, the threat that this confrontation poses to the self is
                     nullified when the imagination’s inability to comprehend the sublime forces the
                     observer to fall back upon ratiocination as a last-gasp defensive mode of
                     comprehension, whereupon reason is entrenched “as a <span class="hi italic">superior</span> faculty — one capable of grasping the totality . .
                     . that the imagination could not in the form of a noumenal or supersensible idea,
                     and also of revealing the self’s final superiority to nature”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 266]. The sublime’s initial majestic power, and the
                     analytical mind’s final victory over that majesty, makes it a poor theoretical
                     instrument with which to interpret a text that grinds its readers down by the mundane
                     accumulation of iterative poetic offcuts. Because, as Ngai writes, the “initial experience of being aesthetically overwhelmed” by
                     such texts is one not of “terror or pain (eventually superseded
                     by tranquility), but <span class="hi italic">something much closer to an ordinary
                        fatigue</span>—and one that cannot be neutralized, like the sublime’s terror, by
                     a competing affect”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 270]. Given that <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar
                        Between</cite> is one such fatigue-inducing text, its repeated theorization
                     through the lens of sublimity has given rise to a partially false impression of its
                     affective scope. The poem’s patient erosion of the reader’s attention span and
                     curiosity does not “confirm the self’s sense of superiority over
                     the overwhelming or intimidating object”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 270], or cathartically dilute the terror instilled by
                     its own enormousness. Moreover, any astonishment it provokes is tempered by the
                     reader’s inability to read the poem in its entirety. Ngai writes that
                     fatigue-inducing texts demand new modes of thinking about what it means to be
                     incapacitated by aesthetic objects, on the assumption that “radically different forms of cultural production” call for equally radical
                     critical responses [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 271]; an assumption, incidentally,
                     that this article questions in its use of fragmentation to interpret <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>. “Stuplimity” is Ngai’s answer to
                     this call. The term names the affective interplay of fatigue (stupefaction) and awe
                     (sublimity) that promises, but perpetually falls just short of delivering, an
                     aesthetic denouement. We can see this stuplimic interplay in the language of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>, where a mere 268 words combine to form
                     225 trillion stanzas; a contradictory mixture of linguistic poverty and wealth that
                     ultimately “results,” to borrow Ngai’s description of a prose-poem by Samuel
                     Beckett, “in a language that is paradoxically both ascetic and
                     congested, ‘thickening’ even as it progresses into a narrative of
                     not-progressing”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 255]. The reader therefore succumbs to the fatigue
                     caused by the felt absence of propulsive linear narrative or hierarchical sequence,
                     which culminates, if that is the word, in an “indeterminate
                     affective state that lacks the punctuating ‘point’ of an individuated
                     emotion”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32"> It seems, then, that the mode of reading
                     recommended by Montfort and Strickland is one that engineers an inescapable transfer
                     of stupor from text to reader. Yet “by pointing to what obstructs
                     aesthetic or critical response,” Ngai writes, the stuplime — much like the
                     fragment — “prompt[s] us to look for new strategies of affective
                     engagement and to extend the circumstances under which engagement become
                     possible”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ngai2005">Ngai 2005</a>, 262]. The poem’s title hints at an alternative
                     strategy of affective engagement. <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>
                     quietly advises the reader that when the poem entertains an apparent opposition, such
                     as sea/spar, the binary is less important than what lies between it. For example,
                     consider the Melville/Dickinson binary. I write above that the poem’s language moves
                     “back and forth between the compressed interiority of
                     Dickinson’s poetry and the expansive intensity of Melville’s prose.” But it
                     is equally plausible to claim that Melville’s prose is painfully cramped in places,
                     insofar as the <cite class="title italic">Pequod</cite> is cramped (for example, the
                     blubber-room) and Ahab is constricted by, because in thrall to, an <span class="hi italic">idée fixe</span>. Similarly, one can adduce various lines of poetry to support the
                     argument that Dickinson’s poetry is centrifugal and expansive, despite or because
                     of
                     her Amherst exile:

                     surprising ease, which is evidence of the heed we should pay to the poem’s titular
                     emphasis on betweenness when making oppositional claims. One way of respecting the
                     title’s liminality is to examine what lies between the poem’s sea (the interface)
                     and
                     its spar (the various fragmentary strategies of reading that permit the reader to
                     float upon the poem’s sea): its algorithm. Because we can read the algorithm in its
                     entirety, it offers us a secure basis on which to speculate about the poetry that
                     it
                     generates. In the final section of this article, I ask whether reading the finite
                     code that generates an effectively infinite text allows us to imagine the poem’s
                     fragments as a cohesive whole. One might anticipate that at this point the article’s
                     emphasis on fragmentation will itself fragment, insofar as interpreting the poem’s
                     code involves understanding the system that structures its part/whole binary, which
                     is very different to working with nonalgorithmic classical text-fragments. However,
                     I
                     show that fragmentation remains a useful heuristic not only because <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>'s code raises more questions than it
                     does answers (which ultimately leaves the text in an even more fragmented state),
                     but
                     also because I use the poem’s code to double its fragments by making a duplicate
                     website, which exemplifies my argument that by bringing classical literary forms and
                     modern computation into dialogue, we can instigate a conversation that its greater

                     a distinctly pre-computational literary category: the fragment. Because fragments
                     are
                     cut off from their original context, they resist definitive critical judgements.
                     Although this resistance limits what we can and cannot say about <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite>, it also lets us move from one provisional and
                     speculative critical perspective to another (we moved from close reading, to cosine
                     similarity, to affect theory, to the sinusoidal method, to the sublime, to the
                     stuplime, and finally, to the poem’s code), which results, paradoxically, in a more

                     hypothesis is that somewhere within the new 225 trillion fragments of text is a line
                     that, due to a serendipitous combination of words and insights from the hivemind of
                     criticism that the poem has impelled, offers a novel idea that could lead the
                     theorization of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> in particular, and
                     combinatoric algorithmic poetry in general, in a pathbreaking direction. Of course,
                     the odds of someone ever finding this hypothetical fragment within a figurative ocean
                     of fragments is close to zero. But that is only fitting, given what this article has
                     demonstrated: that a productive mode of interpreting <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> is firstly through the classical model of fragmentation, and secondly through the
                     computational generation of new metacritical fragments. Because if we fragment a overwhelmingly
                     large poem into a series of smaller reflexive pieces, then not only do we gain a broader,
                     more nuanced critical perspective, but we also begin to mimetically enact the poem’s
                     stuplimity in reverse because an expansive text and a contractive text are equally
                     overwhelming once they expand or contract beyond the point of human comprehension.
                     More broadly, the metacritical version of <cite class="title italic">Sea and Spar Between</cite> signals the critical usefulness of replicating (as opposed to simply explicating)
                     the source code of a computational poem; the text thereby transforms from an interpretive
                     locus to a poetic template, and by studying the similarities and dissimilarities of
                     the different poetic instances made by the template, we can come to a deeper understanding
                     of the original text.
