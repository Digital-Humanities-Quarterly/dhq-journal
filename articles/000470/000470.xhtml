                  <p>In 2016, the Digital Matters Lab at the University of Utah launched a temporary
                     “pop-up” space in the Marriott Library, the culmination of eighteen months of
                     discussions between the College of Humanities, the College of Fine Arts, the College
                     of Architecture+Planning, and the Marriott Library. After a previously unsuccessful
                     attempt at creating a digital scholarship center in the late 2000s, our second
                     attempt was rooted in skepticism. Why would this version be any more successful than
                     the last? This paper chronicles how, learning from our mistakes, the Digital Matters
                     Lab negotiated between a loose community of scholars and administrative stakeholders
                     to navigate complex institutional legacies and bear a formal center with a
                     cross-campus partnership, mission, and identity. The Lab’s focus on environmental,
                     financial, and technological sustainability emerged in response to the situated
                     environment of Utah where water rights, public lands, and air quality are critical
                     concerns. As a second iteration digital humanities/scholarship center, the Digital
                     Matters Lab’s emphasis on sustainability also reflects awareness of its vulnerability
                     to the vicissitudes of administrative temperament or shifts in budgetary priorities.
                     This case study concludes by looking to the future of the Digital Matters Lab in
                     terms of scalability and permanence.

                     “pop-up” space in the Marriott Library. However tenuous, it was nevertheless
                     the culmination of eighteen months of meetings and policy writing sessions, and
                     represented the first step toward future plans to build a permanent home — a 3,000
                     square foot lab complete with virtual reality studio, 3D printing, collaborative
                     workspace, and classrooms. But the ghost of failure haunted these conversations, for
                     this was the University of Utah’s second attempt to build a Digital Humanities (or,
                     depending on discipline, Digital Scholarship) lab. Reminders of efforts past emerged
                     in unexpected ways throughout the process. For example, the Digital Matters
                     exploratory working group discovered early on that we had a predecessor. A small
                     group of librarians had led a similar group several years before, yet we had no
                     record or knowledge of their efforts, accomplishments, and missteps. The challenge
                     was two-fold: how could we track down the lessons learned from our first attempt if
                     little institutional memory remained, and how could we persuade hesitant stakeholders
                     that a second attempt would be worthwhile?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">This paper outlines the process through which we formed the Digital Matters Lab at
                     the University of Utah in the face of the aforementioned challenges, and the factors
                     that contributed to its launch. First, we recognized that the compulsion to bridge
                     the humanities and arts with technology and computing was, is, and always will be,
                     present on campus, albeit in unfocused and disparate forms. Regardless of whether
                     the
                     university pursued a DH initiative or not, these efforts would persist; and by
                     dedicating a space, funds, and personnel to the Digital Matters Lab, the university
                     would coalesce these efforts under a singular identity and focus. Second, due to a
                     confluence of elements that we later describe in detail, several colleges — led by
                     the Marriott Library — came together to agree to a cost-sharing scheme mitigating
                     risk and easing financial burden. And third, Digital Matters staff agreed that the
                     lab’s focus and mission would be grounded in critical scholarship and engage locally
                     with projects of significance to Utah and the broader Mountain West region. Building
                     on that mission, we adopted a four year theme of “sustainability,” which allowed
                     us to think through concerns about digital humanities itself while also casting an
                     eye toward our specific environmental challenges in Utah. Most importantly, we
                     embraced the legacy of failure and adopted a skeptical framework to guide our
                     approach. That is, we recognized ongoing campus DH research and avoided hyperbolic
                     promises of the “new,” eagerly collaborated both within and outside of the four
                     partner colleges, and constantly refined the DML's identity and mission to reflect
                     local interests and character.

                     success and struggle (“Registry of DH sites with library
                     participation”, 2018). Though several early digital humanities centers
                     started in English departments, in recent decades there has been a migration to
                     library-based models that range from a “virtual suite of
                     services” to full-fledged digital humanities centers [<a class="ref" href="#anne2017">Anne et al. 2017</a>]

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">There are distinct advantages in placing DH centers in libraries. Libraries provide
                     an inherently interdisciplinary space where faculty from across campus feel
                     comfortable taking advantage of technology and services. Libraries have high-traffic
                     physical spaces, technical infrastructure (server space, software, collections), and
                     human expertise (metadata, copyright, data management, digital preservation, project
                     management) that are potentially beneficial to digital humanities efforts. Many
                     high-profile digital scholarship and digital humanities efforts are based in
                     libraries such as HathiTrust at the University of Michigan Library, the Women Writers
                     Project at Northeastern University Library, Chronicling America at the Library of
                     Congress, and countless digital archives. Moreover, as libraries evolve from sites
                     of
                     knowledge circulation to knowledge production, an intimate relationship with a DH
                     center is strategically and mutually beneficial [<a class="ref" href="#vandegrift2013">Vandegrift and Varner 2013</a>].

                     services in an ad hoc manner with many libraries struggling to find an optimal
                     approach for DH engagement [<a class="ref" href="#schaffner2014">Schaffner and Erway 2014</a>]. Digital humanities in a
                     library might be subsumed under a broader category of digital scholarship, digital
                     publishing, digital library, or data management. Often there is a single librarian
                     responsible for supporting or leading digital humanities efforts in addition to their
                     core job duties.

                     we see as consisting of three subgenres. The first chronicles strategies for building
                     a DS/DH center or lab in resource-challenged environments. A. Miller, in “DH Start-Ups: A Library Model for Advancing Scholarship through
                     Collaboration”, details how Middle Tennessee State University's library was
                     able to establish its Digital Scholarship lab in its library by forming strategic
                     partnerships, co-opting faculty lines, and narrowing its mission and scope [<a class="ref" href="#miller2016">Miller 2016</a>]. Articles such as these are useful for visualizing the
                     processes and steps required to formulate a digital humanities lab, particularly
                     during financially challenged times. The various case studies in this corpus often

                     Nearly every “Building a DH Center” paper highlights a successful project and
                     reflects, at least implicitly, on the role libraries should play in digital
                     humanities. Moreover, these articles frequently rely upon the experiences of the
                     author in building a DH center or engaging in digital scholarship projects.

                     to do more than simply summarize our experience. Rather, by reflecting on our history
                     and process, we identify the local, structural, and cultural factors shaping the
                     Digital Matters Lab as well as generalizable lessons for building and sustaining a
                     digital humanities center. For example, sustained engagement with digital humanities
                     literature through biweekly reading groups informed our early decisions in setting
                     a
                     course for the Digital Matters Lab and helped us think critically about how our
                     burgeoning lab fit into the larger ecosystem of DH Centers.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">As mentioned above, the Digital Matters working group quickly discovered that
                     disparate digital humanities/scholarship efforts had been underway at the University
                     of Utah for nearly a decade. In 2007, a technology instruction librarian at the
                     Marriott Library returned from the Digital Scholarship/Digital Libraries Symposium
                     at
                     Emory University inspired to pursue a DH build. Fortuitously, her exposure to Digital
                     Humanities coincided with a renovation at the Marriott Library that included a
                     planned Advanced Technology Studio. Under her leadership, the multimedia center
                     expanded to include Digital Humanities services, including qualitative data and
                     textual analysis, GIS services, an AV Studio, and data management services, resulting
                     in the Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) in September 2009. By 2010, the Digital
                     Scholarship Lab had hired a GIS specialist, reassigned three existing staff members
                     to DSL, led a variety of software workshops, and hosted a Digital Scholarship Fair
                     to
                     highlight their burgeoning DH services.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">The Digital Scholarship Lab failed. Despite early administrative buy-in, staff
                     enthusiasm, and limited technological support, it was never able to summon a critical
                     mass of engagement with campus partners. Post-recession funding required library
                     administration to shift its focus to sustaining core library services, and campus
                     assessments revealed a lack of interest and understanding of digital scholarship
                     services. After seven years of struggle, it was subsumed by another department and
                     the Digital Scholarship Lab was officially disbanded in 2014, while individual
                     services such as GIS, data management, and the A/V Studio were spun off — and now
                     thrive — in other areas, such as the Marriott Library’s Creativity and Innovation
                     Services department.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">In many ways, the librarians at the Marriott Library were simply ahead of the curve;
                     a robust digital scholarship community did not yet exist at the University of Utah.
                     The Digital Scholarship Lab functioned in isolation of the rest of the campus, and
                     efforts to offer services or engage in collaborative research fell short without
                     resources for faculty incentives and/or established buy-in from administrators.
                     Awareness of digital humanities had not yet reached the necessary inflection point
                     for other departments to seek opportunities in the field. That is not to say that
                     the
                     DSL would have succeeded if it had simply appeared several years later, but the
                     addiitonal burden of defining DH for stakeholders while the Digital Scholarship Lab
                     was in its infancy compounded its difficulties. Finally, founding and housing the
                     Digital Scholarship Lab in the library, for better or worse, brought to bear
                     service-oriented associations that did not necessarily speak to more
                     research-oriented faculty.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Ironically, just as library administration shuttered the doors on the Digital
                     Scholarship Lab, elsewhere on campus, digital humanities was starting to gain
                     traction. Leveraging a block of funding for strategic hires in digital humanities,
                     the English Department brought on two scholars in 2015 and 2016, Dr. David Roh and
                     Dr. Lisa Swanstrom, with a mandate to build a DH community and space. Moreover, three
                     colleges at the University of Utah — College of Humanities, College of Fine Arts,
                     and
                     College of Architecture+Planning — independently reached out to the Marriott Library
                     in 2015 to gauge interest in developing a shared digital scholarship space. Still
                     mindful of the Digital Scholarship Lab’s isolation and failed attempts at engagement,
                     early discussions overcorrected slightly — initial talks comprised of more than
                     thirty representatives from all four partner colleges! After nearly a decade,
                     administrative will, faculty research interests, and library support regarding
                     digital humanities had finally converged.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">The Digital Matters working group met from fall 2015 to spring 2017 and later
                     transitioned to a more nimble steering committee, consisting of six representatives
                     from all partner colleges, that assumed leadership and kept the deans apprised of
                     its
                     efforts. By 2015, “digital humanities” had become a common buzzword in academic
                     libraries, and we strove to learn from the experiences of other libraries who had
                     successfully built digital humanities programs. The first phase of information
                     gathering included a series of interviews with Digital Humanities researchers Dan
                     Cohen (Center for New Media and History, DPLA), Miriam Posner (UCLA Center for
                     Digital Humanities), Bethany Nowviskie (University of Virginia Scholars’ Lab), and
                     John Unsworth (Brandeis University). A few notable themes emerged from these
                     interviews: 
                     <ol class="list">
                        <li class="item">A lab is a community. A strong community will be reflected in an active,
                           vibrant space. To do so, the lab should be a democratic environment empowering
                           students and staff. Moreover, staffing and expertise should take precedence
                           over technology and decor.
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">Strong relationships with a supportive administration are necessary. Not
                           only does administrative financial backing alleviate the need to rely on grant
                           funding, but the importance of political capital should not be
                           overlooked.
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">The mission should be driven by local needs. Some centers build tools, some
                           support faculty, others digitize content, and still others emphasize teaching.
                           Rather than trying to do everything in an unfocused manner, strategize, and be
                           selective. A narrow and focused mission should guide priorities.
                        </li>
                     </ol>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">We worked in stages. The first stage would be establishing a physical presence on
                     campus so that we could begin to build a community. In fall 2016, the Digital Matters
                     Lab “Pop-Up” Space moved into the Marriott Library with a launch party. The
                     space was light on technology but was equipped with collaborative spaces,
                     whiteboards, and a few desktop workstations. More than offering computing power and
                     expensive equipment, the temporary space became a hub where we could start building
                     relationships by hosting talks, workshops, reading groups, and a monthly research
                     interest group.
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">The second stage was to secure funding. Thanks to a mix of serendipity and
                     infrastructure, in May 2016 the Marriott Library Development team secured $1 Million
                     from an anonymous donor for staffing, equipment, and buildout of the Digital Matters
                     Lab. Heeding the advice we had received in our exploratory phase, we elected to use
                     the money to secure five years of staffing and modest equipment while we continue
                     to
                     raise money for the permanent space. The steering committee had to then discuss
                     several questions regarding personnel: what constitutes core staff for a digital
                     humanities space? Should they conduct a national search or hire from within? Is there
                     an immediate need for a developer? The committee considered the merits hiring various
                     configurations of Director, Librarian, Programmer/Developer, Operations Manager,
                     graduate students, visiting fellows, grant writer, and post-docs. The finalized
                     structure was determined by a consideration of the objectives and goals for the next
                     five years — sustainability, a regional identity, and campus integration. Ultimately,
                     the steering committee decided that the first hire would be the Digital Matters
                     Director who would set a vision for the Lab including its long-term sustainability.
                     The Marriott Library created a faculty line to hire a dedicated Digital Matters
                     Librarian who would be responsible for supporting projects, organizing speakers,
                     workshops, and various training opportunities, and liaising with relevant and
                     existing library services such metadata, copyright, and IT services. Our five-year
                     budget also included significant resources set aside to fund semester-long faculty
                     and graduate student fellowships and to eventually hire a program assistant to staff
                     the front desk, maintain the website, and assist the Director and Librarian in the
                     operations and events of the Lab.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">As of this writing, we are in the third and current stage — implementation. Over
                     several months in 2017, the steering committee undertook the unglamorous work of
                     hiring a director and librarian, procuring equipment, furniture, and a semi-permanent
                     facility. Later, as the Digital Matters Lab became more of a known quantity, chance
                     opportunities led to the hiring of an additional post-doctoral scholar from
                     Environmental Humanities and faculty fellow from Multi-Disciplinary Design.

                     scholarship with cultural criticism and theory while remaining grounded in our local
                     surroundings in Utah. We sought to penetrate the campus’s consciousness by adding
                     value, with the eventual goal of reaching financial and reputational stability so
                     that the Digital Matters Lab can withstand budgetary vagaries.

                     priorities and character of our partner departments and schools. We met regularly
                     to
                     develop relationships and, at times, define “digital scholarship” and “digital
                     humanities” in relation to their fields. It was also imperative to carefully
                     consider university legacies and strengths; for example, the University of Utah is
                     renowned for its Entertainment Arts and Engineering (EAE)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e432">[2]</a> program
                     where students learn the fundamentals of video game development and animation.
                     Accordingly, it would make sense for the Digital Matters Lab to incorporate game
                     studies into its programming and projects. Similarly, the Marriott Library has an
                     unparalleled Book Arts Program,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e436">[3]</a> which focuses on the
                     materiality and affordances of a print media; a strategic alignment of goals,
                     including hosting credit-bearing classes and collaborative exhibitions, would be
                     mutually beneficial.

                     campus that have created digital scholarship and public-facing research projects.
                     For
                     example, since the 1960s, the American West Center<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e443">[4]</a> has collected
                     and digitized oral histories of western peoples and lands. Faculty members in English
                     and Computer Science had developed software for poetic visualization,
                     Poemage.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e447">[5]</a> Professors of dance
                     worked in virtual reality environments, capturing choreography with drones. Over in
                     the School of Music, a faculty member collaborated with metadata specialists in the
                     library to create an opera database, SongHelix,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e451">[6]</a> to
                     promote discoverability of songs by a litany of criteria for recitals. When planning
                     for the first year, it benefited us to meet with faculty to think through how to best

                     Utah.

                     cohesiveness to our fledgling center and would also be legible to administration,
                     donors, and other stakeholders. Forming connections and figuring out our place in

                     identity as a lab that pushed the frontiers of critically-engaged digital research.
                     We strategically chose projects, workshops, and speakers that integrated cultural
                     criticism into their visions of digital arts and humanities. Sustainability not only
                     prompts us to think of the durability of digital projects, but also asks us to think
                     differently about the timescales on which we usually consider technology; instead
                     of
                     thinking in processing times and milliseconds, sustainability might prompt us to
                     consider the millennia that our e-waste takes to degrade. Sustainability also
                     challenges us to turn a critical eye toward our own methods, practices, and
                     assumptions as digital humanities practitioners. We have to ask: what does digital
                     humanities itself sustain? And how can we build a lab that is conscientious about
                     what it seeks to sustain and what it chooses not to? Ultimately, the idea of
                     <em class="term">sustainability</em> challenged us not only to think thematically around
                     environmental issues, but structurally as we considered the long-term viability of
                     our projects in terms of preservation, documentation, and formats.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Finally, the theme of sustainability foregrounds our situatedness in Utah. At the
                     same time that Utah has been the location of important events in the history of
                     trans-continental communication technology systems (the golden spike, the golden
                     splice, and fourth node of Arpanet), it has also become a testing ground for our
                     environmental futures. Often these technological advances go hand-in-hand with rising
                     environmental concerns. Utah has been the location of many commercial data centers
                     such as those for Twitter, eBay, and Oracle [<a class="ref" href="#hu2015">Hu 2015</a>, 78]. But
                     while commercial data centers benefit from cheap water, that does not reflect its
                     scarcity in a drought-prone state. At the same time that Utah is the site for
                     vanguard technology development, it sits at the forefront of debates about public
                     lands, climate change, and air quality. Our situatedness puts us into a political,
                     environmental, technological history rife with the intersection of technological and
                     environmental concerns. The Digital Matters logo, a simplified topographic
                     representation of the Great Salt Lake, whose water levels are steadily declining,
                     not
                     only reflects local geography but recognizes an arid future (see Figure 1).

                        projects, we were committed to maintaining time for them. For example, Rebekah
                        Cummings arrived with an active portfolio in data management and metadata studies;
                        David Roh and Elizabeth Callaway, trained in English, had their respective ongoing
                        monographs, in addition to their own experimental DH projects. Fortunately, around
                        the same time the Marriott Library started emphasizing research among the
                        tenure-track librarians, so our pursuing individual research agendas aligned with
                        the library’s strategic shift. There was no requirement for research to tie
                        directly with Digital Matters, but the hope was that as our interests evolved in
                        the lab environment, a natural convergence would occur. Moreover, rather than have
                        a set percentage of time devoted to self-directed research projects, a focus on
                        research naturally unfolded as part of the culture. For instance, at the beginning
                        of each semester, we met to outline our goals, which not only included our
                        commitments to Digital Matters, but our own research objectives. We could then
                        discuss time commitments, scheduling, and workloads as book projects and articles
                        went underwent various phases of production. Encouraging transparency not only
                        allowed us to make room for each member, but also provided a welcome source
                        accountability.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p26">In addition to continuing to pursue our research agendas, we sought to engage with
                        two types of research projects — a collaborative, multi-institutional research
                        project of local significance, and funding faculty and graduate student projects
                        across the four partner colleges of the College of Humanities, College of Fine
                        Arts, College of Architecture+Planning, and the Marriott Library, guided by the
                        broader contours of our theme, sustainability. After a few false starts, we
                        collaborated with a local nonprofit, Better Days 2020,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e492">[7]</a> and colleagues at Brigham
                        Young University’s Office of Digital Humanities to build an Omeka exhibit to
                        highlight the 150th anniversary of women’s suffrage in Utah, centered on the
                        digitizing, tagging, and analysis of the <cite class="title italic">Woman’s Exponent</cite>, a
                        nineteenth century Mormon feminist publication printed in Salt Lake City. While
                        Utah is quick to claim its place in history as the first state in which women cast
                        a ballot, there is more complex, nuanced story involving intersections of
                        suffrage, polygamy, and statehood. Still in the early stages, this project aims to
                        produce new knowledge and speak to the wider community in Salt Lake City and
                        Utah.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p27">In terms of funding research projects, we offer two graduate residency fellowships
                        and four faculty fellowships each year. This not only supports projects that
                        otherwise might not get off the ground but also legitimizes digital scholarship
                        across campus. In the first year offering these fellowships, our independent
                        advisory board selected projects that engage in some way with our four-year theme
                        of sustainability and with concerns important to Utah. Both of the Spring 2019
                        graduate fellows worked on digital/material art projects focusing on the
                        environment in the west. One graduate fellow, Tiana Birrell, used her time in the
                        Lab to map the extensive network of data centers, including the National Security
                        Administration (NSA), in Utah and the complicated network of rivers, dams, and
                        pipes that contribute to the cooling of those servers. A product of her research
                        is an art installation in the Lab comprised of video projection and sculptural
                        elements that convey the materiality and physicality of Utah’s network of rivers,
                        water, and data. A goal of her project — and the public art that accompanies it —
                        is to prompt discussion of local environmental concerns by highlighting the
                        significant allocation of public resources to these data centers, whose companies
                        select Utah expressly for its “cheap” water and electricity, low seismic
                        activity, few natural disasters, and access to an international airport. Our
                        second inaugural graduate student fellow, Jace Brittain, explored the tension
                        between human and animal agency through a literary aesthetic, focusing on the
                        epidemic of bark beetles and forest decimation in Utah. By using a combination of
                        3D scans, prints, poetry and prose, this work speculatively makes legible the
                        inscrutable patterns bark beetles create in boring through tree surfaces. Using
                        digital art as a commentary on nature, global warming, and agency granted
                        immediacy to this phenomenon, which has a tremendous effect on Utah’s ecosystems
                        yet often feels abstracted from daily life.

                        discourses of ownership of public and private bodies, and the relationship between
                        technology and indigeneity. Faculty fellow, Dr. Wendy Wisher, developed a piece
                        exploring the resonances between attitudes and policies toward public lands and
                        women's reproductive rights in Utah to propose a relationship between the two.
                        Another faculty fellow, Dr. Lourdes Alberto, created a digital archive of
                        documents generated by social activism in diasporic indigenous communities. While
                        not solely selected for their environmental/sustainability focus, these projects
                        reflect the range of interests expressed in our applicant pool of faculty and
                        students and speak to the interests of the broader Utah population.

                        scholars in digital humanities tools and methods, but serves as an opportunity to
                        strengthen our mission of being the locus for digital research on campus. Topics
                        are decided by the community by way of surveys and polls during the planning
                        process, and connecting with experts to lead workshops helps develop
                        relationships. Workshops focus not only on tools, but methods and competencies;
                        sessions on Tableau, Gephi, and Omeka might be interspersed with Data Management
                        for the Arts and Humanities or Storytelling with Data. Tool-based workshops are
                        possibly the most challenging activity during which to explicitly incorporate our
                        stated commitment to digital cultural studies and sustainability, but the choice
                        of sample datasets instructors choose to teach with often lead to critical
                        discussions about cultural assumptions and the implications of its affordances. We

                        departments and disciplines beyond the partner colleges. A Research Interest Group
                        (RIG) is open to all and meets regularly for events ranging from a speakers series
                        to reading groups to works-in-progress presentations; topics covered may range
                        from as environmental art or long-term data curation. The RIG provides occasions
                        for regular encounters among scholars from a variety of backgrounds, which then
                        lead to the building of a community that may result in collaborations on a given

                           resources, partnering with several academic partners within campus led to a sense
                           of shared ownership and institutional investment in the DML — in our case, the
                           College of Humanities, Fine Arts, Architecture+Planning, and the Marriott Library.
                           Moreover, by appointing a contact person for each college — as members of the
                           advisory board — we could ask them to represent the interests of their
                           constituents, as well as convey our programs, projects, and mission to them — a
                           bilateral relationship. This has the additional benefit of structurally
                           integrating the unique strengths and foci of the university, rather than the DML
                           venturing into areas that may not align with the strategic missions of its
                           partners. That is not to say that having several partnerships is not without risk;
                           the danger was that attempting to integrate conflicting interests could leave the
                           DML rudderless or desultory. To counter committee paralysis, leadership had to
                           take responsibility for a vision and direction while listening and integrating
                           comments, with the understanding that s/he will not be able to please

                        <li class="item">Lab identity should emerge organically in response to the environment. While we
                           polled and consulted with a number of more established DH institutions, we were
                           mindful of the fact that we would need to adapt our priorities and character to
                           our particular placement and character. For us, this meant leveraging the existing
                           strengths of our institution, such as game studies and history of the American
                           West. A focus on locality also led us to select projects that speak to concerns
                           such as water rights, public lands, air quality, and moments of local historical
                           significance such the 150th anniversary of women’s suffrage in Utah.
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">Sustainability is important but we must also allow for an experimental culture
                           where people feel allowed to fail or let projects die. With a new venture, there
                           is an incentive to take a conservative approach; after all, we have the dual
                           pressures of demonstrating our value to administration and figuring out a means of
                           stretching finite resources. At the same time, much of the research may not bear
                           fruit, or be immediately legible — and we want to allow for a culture that
                           provides room for research that is innovative, experimental, and even risky.
                           Taking a page from other institutions, we grant latitude for individual
                           researchers and staff to work on their own projects, with no expectation for
                           success or outcome other than their own intellectual fulfillment.
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">There is an inherent tension between what the administration and development
                           office want (e.g. glittery technology, such as a visualization wall) and what
                           researchers need (e.g. human capital, flexibility, funding).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e553">[8]</a> It has
                           also become clear that while administrative support may be enthusiastic, there is
                           a gap in priorities regarding their needs and the needs of the DML. For research
                           purposes, it may be that most of the high costs come in the form of human capital
                           — salaries for staff, researchers, and students to dedicate time for their
                           respective projects. At the same time, funding begets funding in the sense that
                           tangible and sleek technological apparatus may enchant and attract attention. We
                           have to think strategically in purchasing equipment that maximizes attention and
                           utility.
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">A multi-pronged approach. Mindful as we are of the kind of argument we are
                           attempting to make with our campus presence over the next few years, we must
                           balance the logistics of building a tight enough portfolio to distribute our
                           limited bandwidth efficiently with the need to integrate ourselves into the
                           greater campus in a way that results in a net positive. To that end, the DML
                           facilitates workshops for undergraduate, graduate students, and faculty, consults
                           on external projects, in addition to its own internal research.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Like many Digital Humanities centers, the future of the Digital Matters Lab is
                     promising but uncertain, and we suspect that its fate will depend on whether we are
                     able to make a convincing argument for its contributions on several fronts —
                     institutionally, regionally, and nationally. With enough initial funding to last four
                     years, the DML must make a compelling case with university administration and campus
                     constituents for its continued existence. Our first year (2018-2019) focused on
                     infrastructure — hiring staff, establishing identity, formalizing workflows, setting
                     a research agenda, and creating visibility. With a small staff comprised of two
                     faculty members and a post-doc, we juggled the responsibilities of research,
                     teaching, and service with administrative tasks such as maintaining our website,
                     planning events, and ordering promotional material.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Our primary concern heading into the second year is sustainability and permanence.
                     As
                     we move out of the foundation-building phase, we begin to consider what projects,
                     staff, relationships, and services will mark us as an indispensable campus resource.
                     Chief in our minds are the lessons learned from previous iterations of digital
                     scholarship centers and services on campus and nationwide. One of those lessons is
                     that DML needs to avoid insularity and remain connected to digital scholarship
                     efforts across campus and across Utah. DML faculty and staff will continue to provide
                     learning and research opportunities to undergraduate students, graduate students,
                     and
                     faculty to build a portfolio of innovative projects that speak to local concerns and
                     our theme of sustainability. Grant opportunities will be considered and pursued when
                     they align with the goals of the Digital Matters Lab but will not be used to maintain
                     core staff and services.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">The Digital Matters Lab benefits from administrative support, five years of secure
                     funding, and established cross-campus partnerships, but the long-term future is far
                     from secure. We strive to cultivate the right mix of digital scholarships services,
                     research and funding opportunities, instructional programming, and an active DH
                     community that will be compelling to donors and administrators. Ultimately, the
                     creation of a stable Digital Matters Lab and a permanent funding line for its staff
                     relies on our ability to establish the DML as an invaluable hub for computationally
                     enhanced humanities research and pedagogy, and a necessary resource at the University
                     of Utah.

                     decision was that Digital Matters had evolved beyond a space into a community, set
                     of services, and opportunities like the Digital Matters Fellowship Program and
