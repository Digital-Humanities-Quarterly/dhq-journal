            <p>Gloria Mugelli has a Ph.D. in Classics at the University of Pisa and at the Centre AnHiMA of the École
              des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris. She is member of the Lab of
              Anthropology of the Ancient World, at the University of Pisa. Her Ph.D. thesis
              discusses the form and function of rituals (sacrifice, supplication and funerary
              rites) in ancient Greek tragedy, focusing on the relationship between ritual and
              dramatic performances. Her research, based on the corpus of the surviving ancient
              Greek tragedies, adopted the Euporia system.</p>

        <p>EuporiaRAGT is one of the pilot projects that adopt the Euporia system as a digital
          support to an historico-anthropological research on the form and function of rituals in
          the texts of ancient Greek tragedy. This paper describes the bottom-up approach adopted in
          the project: during the annotation stage, performed with a Domain Specific Language
          designed with a user-centred approach, the domain expert can annotate ritual and religious
          phenomena, with the possibility of registering different textual and interpretive
          variants; the design of a search engine, in a second phase of the work, allows the
          database to be tested and reorganized. Finally, the construction of an ontology allows to
          structure the tags, in order to perform complex queries on the database.</p>

        <p>This paper will describe a project for the digital annotation of ritual and religious
          facts in ancient Greek tragedy. The project in question is the result of a collaboration
          between the Institute of Computational Linguistics <q>A. Zampolli</q> at CNR, Pisa and the
          Laboratory of Anthropology of the Ancient World at the University of Pisa. As part of this
          collaboration an annotation system, named <emph>Euporia</emph> has been developed in order
          to offer digital support to the historico-anthropological study<note>On the history and

            target="#mugelli2018b">Mugelli 2018b, defended on November 15 2018</ref>). The study in
          question involves the comparison of ancient Greek rituals as represented or described
          corpus of surviving Greek dramatic texts, with those same rituals as they have been
          reconstructed by scholars from literary, archaeological and epigraphic sources. The
          primary sources of this study were the texts of the surviving ancient Greek tragedies,
          texts which often allude to various kinds of rituals such as sacrifices, supplications,
          prayers, libations, funerary rites.<note>On the religious context of Ancient Drama see

              (2003)</ref>. </note> Greek tragedies themselves were originally performed as rituals
          and were performed during religious festivals in honour of the god Dionysus.<note>The
            ritual dimension of Greek tragedy has been widely discussed by <ref

          were participants in these festivals. It is important to note that a fifth century
          Athenian citizen would have gained a substantial amount of ritual experience through
          participating in various public religious festivals, in festivals or rites performed as
          part of a smaller group (e.g. the <emph>demes</emph> or the <emph>phratries</emph>) and in
          familiar rites performed by the citizens themselves.<note>The works by Robert Parker <ptr

        <p>The initial point of the departure of this historico-anthropological study was the idea
          that rituals as represented or described in the texts of ancient Greek tragedies do not
          constitute a faithful reproduction of the actual rites as they were performed in fifth
          century Athens. Indeed, when it comes to the representation of rituals in such works,
          compliance with the ritual norm was only one of the concerns of the tragic authors, along
          with respect of the performance rules and the function of the ritual in the dramatic plot,
          see <ref target="#didonato2010">Didonato (2010)</ref>; <ref target="#taddei2015">Taddei
            (2015)</ref>; <ref target="#taddei2016">Taddei (2016)</ref>. Even though the rites
          represented in Greek tragedy had to be plausible enough to be recognisable as such by
          their intended audiences, the authors of Greek tragedy were able to make use of a series
          of different strategies to adapt the representation of these rites to their tragic plots.
          These strategies included the use of allusion, the combination of different rites, and
          even modification of certain aspects of ritual norms <ptr target="#mugelli2018a"/>. In any
          case, the public would have had enough ritual experience to be able to immediately
          understand every reference to the actual rites as they were practised and to recognize
          variations from the norm <note>See <ref target="#taddei2009">Taddei (2009)</ref> and <ref
              target="#taddei2014">Taddei (2014)</ref>; in general, on the competence of the tragic
            public see <ref target="#revermann2006">Revermann (2006)</ref>.</note>
        </p>

        <p>The first step of the research was the retrieval and annotation of all the attestations
          of ritual facts in the corpus of tragic texts, with the purpose of establishing
          relationships between different passages in the corpus and then comparing this evidence
          with the rites as they have been reconstructed from other sources. The annotation system,
          Euporia, which was used to do this work was designed using a user-centred approach that
          was tailored to answer the specific research question <ptr target="#hemminger2009"/>
          <ptr target="#gibbsowens2012"/>. The system adopts a domain specific language (DSL) <ptr
            target="#parr2010"/> in order to avoid both a complex graphical user interface and
          verbose TEI-XML annotation. Translating Euporia DSL into a TEI-XML compliant document is
          easy as well as necessary in order to guarantee interoperability with other
            resources.<note>The annotation system and the DSL are described in <ref
              target="#mugelli2016">Mugelli (2016)</ref>. The current version of our DSL grammar is
            available at <ref target="https://github.com/CoPhi/euporia"> (last access:
              15/07/2019).</ref>
          </note> The system is designed to be flexible enough to faithfully simulate the citation
          practices of classicists. Euporia’s lightweight web user interface enables an entire text
          which is to be annotated to be visualised in a single page and allows the annotator to
          easily scroll up and down the page to copy and paste passages in the original text in
          order to quote them. The unique identifiers (IDs) which are necessary to create machine
          readable citations are embedded in the hidden HTML tags that surround the segments of the
          original texts which have been copied and pasted. The DSL deals with portions of text of
          varying lengths and as well as with discontinuous segments of texts.<note>In the
            annotation, the three dots (...) indicate continuity and the tilde (~) indicates
            discontinuity.</note> In addition, it also deals with textual operations (substitution,
          insertion, deletion and transposition), textual and interpretative variants and, finally,
          with constraints on the variants <ptr target="#boschetti2013"/>. The DSL is based on
          conventions that are similar to the conventions used in critical apparatuses and in
          philological, linguistic, historical or literary commentaries <ptr target="#boschetti2007"
          />; <ptr target="#lamé2015" loc="17–19"/>. In addition it uses other conventions that will
          be familiar to classicists in the age of social media: for example, the annotations are
          expressed using Latin hashtags<note>For the sake of readability in this paper the tags are
            cited in the form <code>#hashtag/english_translation</code>.</note> that, as in Twitter
          messages or del.icio.us taggings, are micro-annotations that can be retrieved in the
          context of other hashtags, in association with the document chunk that they annotate. The
          Latin language has been chosen for the sake of compatibility with <emph>Memorata
            Poetis</emph>, a project for the annotation of themes and motives in epigraphic and
          literary epigrams in Greek, Latin, Arabic and Italian languages (<ref
            target="http://www.memoratapoetis.it">http://www.memoratapoetis.it</ref>). Memorata
          poetis combines a top-down approach (with a Latin taxonomy of an index of <emph>rerum
            notabilium</emph>), and a bottom-up approach, with unstructured tags that are organized
          in an ontology in a second phase of the work <ptr target="#khan2016"/>. </p>

        <p>Given the complexity of the ritual facts which were annotated during the course of this
          research, facts which are difficult to organize in fixed schemes, we decided not to
          establish a taxonomy or fixed set of tags <emph>a priori</emph>. Instead we adopted a
          completely bottom-up approach which allows the annotator the freedom to create new tags
          according to his or her needs, as well as to modify or delete of tags and even their
          hierarchical grouping within an ontology as part of an iterative process. In order to give
          an overview of the thousand tags which have been created so far, we can categorize the
          annotations in four different categories. Namely we can identify: <list type="ordered">
            <item>Passages in which an entire ritual is performed (ex.
                <code>#sacrificium/sacrifice</code>, <code>#supplicatio/supplication</code>). These
              tend to be longer passages</item>
            <item>Parts of the ritual such as gestures, words, actions, objects (ex.
                <code>#victimam_iugulare/slauther_the_victim</code>, <code>#gemitus/cry</code>,
                <code>#vestis/dress</code>, <code>#culter/cutter</code>, <code>#terror/fear</code>)
              and even the emotions or the attitudes of those performing a ritual and the various
              moments or the spaces of the ritual itself</item>
            <item>The main implications of the ritual (ex.
                <code>#ritus_propositum/purpose_of_rite</code>,
                <code>#ritus_effectus/effects_of_rite</code>,
                <code>#ritus_irritus/ineffective_ritual</code>)</item>
            <item>Passages in which the characters or the chorus discuss the form or the implication
              of a ritual, or give instructions for how to perform it
                (<code>#ritum_praescribere/order_the_rite</code>;
                <code>#ritus_parare/prepare_the_rite</code>)</item>
          </list> We are also using two macro-categories of tags which are employed in combination
          with other tags. The tag <code>#scaenica/on_scene</code> is used to indicate everything
          that present on stage (objects, costumes, scenic design) as well as the movements and
          gestures performed on stage. This tag allows the annotator to indicate whether a rite is
          actually enacted on stage or whether it is simply described or alluded to. The tag
            <code>#hiera/sacred_things</code> indicates that an action may be considered as part of

        <p>The representation of sacrifice and other rituals is one of the main themes of Aeschylus’
            <title rend="italic">Agamemnon</title> and of the entire <title rend="italic"
            >Oresteia</title> trilogy which was performed for the first time in Athens in 458 BCE.
          The <hi rend="italic">Oresteia</hi> trilogy makes substantial use of so-called
            <emph>perverted sacrifice</emph>, that is, of sacrificial images and metaphors in the
          description of violence and murder <note><ref target="#zeitlin1965">Zeitlin (1965)</ref>
            was the first to introduce, for the <title rend="italic">Oresteia</title>, the notion of
              <emph>perverted sacrifice</emph>. On the history of the notion of perverted ritual and
            its applicability to Greek tragedy, see <ref target="#henrichs2004">Henrichs

          </note> Indeed, the main event of the plot of <title rend="italic">Agamemnon</title>, the
          murder of Agamemnon, is described using sacrificial metaphors. In line 1433 of <title
            rend="italic">Agamemnon</title>, for instance, Clytemnestra confirms that she has
          sacrificed (the verb <emph>sphazo</emph> meaning <q>ritually slaughter</q>) her husband to
          Ate and to the Erinyes. <quote rend="block">

        <p> Sacrifices of virgins and human sacrifices in general are attested in Greek myth and in
          ancient Greek tragedy, but they were not a common fact of life in fifth century Athens
            <ptr target="#bonnechere1994"/>; <ptr target="#georgoudi1999"/>; <ptr
            target="#bonnecheregagné2013"/>; <ptr target="#nagyprescendi2013"/>
          <ptr target="#georgoudi2015"/>. Since our research is focused on the reception of tragic
          rituals by the audience of Greek tragedy, our main intention in annotating the scenes of
          human sacrifices is not to establish relationships between those scenes and traces of
          human sacrifices in ancient Greece. The tragic scenes of human sacrifice are annotated so
          they can be used to compare aspects of the ritual (use of objects, attitude of the
          victims) with the actual ancient Greek animal sacrifice. Various sources represent the
          sacrifice of Iphigenia in a form that is very close to animal sacrifice; in Euripides’
            <title rend="italic">Iphigenia in Aulis</title> the young girl is substituted with a
          deer just before the ritual slaughter. In Aeschylus’ <title rend="italic"
            >Agamemnon</title> we can find a trace of the similarity between Iphigenia's sacrifice
          and an animal sacrifice at line 232, where the girl is lifted up on to the altar <quote

          human sacrifice or in scenes of homicide, to indicate that a virgin is being compared to
          an animal victim. <dhq:example>

        <p>From line 228 to line 232 (included the words λαβεῖν ἀέρδην at line 235) the sense of the
          passage is quite clear: Agamemnon, indifferent to his daughter’s prayers, orders the
          soldiers to lift the girl up on to the altar. The action has to be carried out after the
          ritual prayer, at the moment of the slaughter of the victim. <dhq:example>
            <p>☛ [232 δίκαν... ὕπερθε βωμοῦ ~ 235 λαβεῖν ἀέρδην]

          </dhq:example> The translation of line 233 is less straightforward and scholars have
          imagined three different situations, that the annotator chose to register as interpretive
          variants, since they involve major changes in the interpretation of the ritual.<note>Our
            annotation registers only the variants or interpretations that involve changes in the
            description of the ritual, see <ref target="#mugelli2016">Mugelli (2016)</ref>. On a

              >http://mizar.unive.it/mqdq/public/</ref>.</note> The three different solutions depend
          on the translation of the two words περιπετῆ and προνωπῆ that describe the attitude of
          Iphigenia at the moment of the sacrifice. According to <ptr target="#maas1951"/> πέπλοισι
          περιπετῆ means <q>enwrapped in her robe</q> and προνωπῆ means <q>prone.</q>

          </dhq:example> Maas’ interpretation is based on a comparison between the sacrifice of
          Iphigenia and the sacrifice of Polyxena as it is represented on a well-known black figured
          amphora, where the young girl is lifted upon the altar by soldiers, with her dress tight
          to her body. <figure xml:id="figure01">

          </figure> According to Maas' interpretation the dress is used to tie Iphigenia. The image
          of the tied sacrificial victim recurs after two lines, when Agamemnon orders to gag
          Iphigenia to avoid her speaking words of bad omen and cursing her family. <dhq:example>

          </dhq:example> The consent of the sacrificial victim has been identified as an essential
          trait in representations of ancient Greek sacrifice. <ref target="#meuli1946">Meuli
            (1946)</ref> invented the theory of the <quote rend="inline">comedy of

          iconography of sacrifice which rarely represents tied animals. In addition late sources

          (1986)</ref>, represent the ox voluntary walking towards the altar and offering itself for
          sacrifice; finally, some sources show the victim nodding at the altar, ideally showing its
          consent to the sacrifice.<note>The nodding of the victim was theorized by <ref

          the willingness of the sacrificial victim has recently being questioned, however, thanks
          to a new attention to the sources that shifted the focus to attestations of tied, forced
          or recalcitrant animals <ptr target="#bonnechere1999"/>; <ptr target="#georgoudi2005"/>;
            <ptr target="#georgoudi2008"/>; <ptr target="#naiden2007"/>. The binding and gagging of
          Iphigenia in Aeschylus’ <title rend="italic">Agamemnon</title> is therefore worthy of
          attention, in contrast with the well-known conclusion of Euripides <title rend="italic"
            >Iphigenia at Aulis</title>, where the girl is eventually convinced to offer herself in
          sacrifice. A comparison with the sacrifice of Polyxena in Euripides’ <title rend="italic"
            >Hekabe</title> is useful for the parallels it offers to the Aeschylean passage: at the
          beginning of the rite a group of young men has been assigned the task to hold the victim.
          However Polyxena decides to offer herself voluntarily as she refuses to be touched by the
          soldiers, Eur. <title rend="italic">Hec.</title> 525-527, 545-549. E. Medda, in <ptr

            >Ag.</title> 233, a translation proposed by LSJ9 and adopted by <ref
            target="#fraenkel1950">Fraenkel (1950)</ref>, according to which the expression means

          </dhq:example> This interpretation, which is corroborated by a comparison with the
          red-figured oinochoe of the Schuwalow painter, does not exclude the image of the young
          girl being enwrapped in her dress, but does exclude any explicit dissent on the part of
          the victim (at least at this moment of the ritual) which forces the soldiers to bind her.

        <p> A third interpretation of the passage, proposed by <ref target="#lloydjones1990">Lloyd
            Jones (1990)</ref> and adopted by <ref target="#bonanno2006">Bonanno (2006)</ref> in her
          article on the dramatic function of the messenger's speech describing the sacrifice in the
            <title rend="italic">Agamemnon</title>, shows Iphigenia supplicating to her father by
          touching his dress (literally <q>falling with the arms around his dress</q>). This
          interpretation entails some radical changes to our sacrificial image: we have to imagine
          Iphigenia falling forward, and grasping her father's knees. If we accept this
          interpretation then we have to add two tags that mark two common gestures in scenes of
          supplication: the act of falling at someone's knees and the gesture of touching someone's
          dress. <dhq:example>
            <p>☛ [233 πέπλοισι ... προνωπῆ ] <code>#supplicatio/supplication</code> legit Lloyd
              Jones ☚ ☛ [233 πέπλοισι περιπετῆ] <code>#vestem_tangere/touch_the_dress</code> (cum

                <code>#supplicatio/supplication</code> Lloyd Jones) ☚</p>
          </dhq:example> This last interpretation would certainly imply an act of dissent the part
          of Iphigenia, who in the middle of the sacrificial ritual and after the ritual prayer,
          continues begging her father and attempting to move him to pity. This hypothesis of the
          supplication also changes the reading of the two words παντὶ θυμῷ, <q>with all the
            heart</q> in line 233: in the two previous cases they refer to sacrificants who have to
          follow Agamemnon's order without hesitation. If we assume that Iphigenia is in the act of
          supplicating then the two words are referred to the suppliant's attitude. <dhq:example>

          willing victim at the very moment of the sacrifice). Scenes of supplication to Agamemnon
          are also shown on two terracotta reliefs which were directly inspired by the Euripidean

          criteria illustrated above, an SQL-based search engine was developed in order to query and
          to subsequently reorganize the database of the hashtags (The first version of
          EuporiaSearch is available at <ref target="http://cophilab.ilc.cnr.it/euporiaSearchx/"
            >http://cophilab.ilc.cnr.it/euporiaSearchx/</ref>). The Euporia search engine allows
          users to search the database by matching up to three keywords which are represented as
          hashtags. The results show the list of the passages on which the three keywords co-occur
          along with the list of other hashtags co-occuring with the keywords on those passages. The
          user can specify: <list type="ordered">
            <item>Up to three different keywords;</item>
            <item>The range of words within which the keywords should co-occur (ex. 0, 0 for the
              intersection between the keywords, 10, 10 for a query on 2 hashtags in a range of +/-
              10 words);</item>
            <item>The range of words on which the hashtags visualized in the results have to
              co-occur (e.g. 10, 10 to show all the hashtags co-occurring within a range of +/- 10
              words from the passages retrieved)</item>
          </list> An example will help to clarify the operation of the search engine. For instance,
          in order to retrieve all of the passages in the corpus in which a virgin is the victim of
          a sacrifice the user can match the 2 keywords <hi rend="bold">#virgo/virgin</hi> and <hi
            rend="bold">#victima/victim</hi> (within a range of 0 words) and ask the system to show
          all the other hashtags coinciding within a range of +/- 10 words. EuporiaSearch will then
          list all of the passages retrieved; the entire list of other hashtags coinciding with the
          passage is also displayed by clicking on each result. Using the search engine, we can
          perform multiple searches that check the coherence and the consistency of the tags. We
          decided to start testing our first search engine from the tragedies related to the
          Atreides’ cycle in order to have a well defined sub-corpus for our initial trials of the
          annotation system. A few examples dealing with the theme of the perverted sacrifice and
          the interference between homicide and sacrifice will help to illustrate the first results
          which we obtained. </p>
        <p>Since we made the decision to annotate only those actions which were actually conceived
          and performed as rituals with the tag <code>#sacrificium/sacrifice</code> or
            <code>#hominem_sacrificare/human_sacrifice</code>, a search into the intersection
          between homicide and sacrifice will return those cases of homicides carried out within the
          context of a sacrifice, like the killing of Aegisthus during the sacrifice to the Nymphs
          in Euripides’ <title rend="italic">Electra</title>. A search using the tag
            <code>#homicidium_sicut_sacrificium/homicide_as_sacrifice</code> returns the passage of
          the killing of Agamemnon discussed above (Aesch. <title rend="italic">Ag.</title> 1433)
          and the passage of the killing of Clytaemestra in Euripides’ <title rend="italic"
            >Electra</title> (Eur. <title rend="italic">El.</title> 1142). A broader perspective on
          sacrificial metaphors can be gained by carrying out queries using both tags
            <code>#homo_sicut_victima/human_as_victim</code> and
            <code>#virgo_sicut_victima/virgin_as_victim</code>. These will return a list of passages
          in which a human being is compared to a sacrificial victim amongst which there are various
          passages referring to Iphigenia’s sacrifice in Eur. <title rend="italic">IA</title>, where
          the virgin is sacrificed as if she were an animal victim. We will also find Aesch. <title
            rend="italic">Ag.</title> 1297, where Cassandra is invited to enter the house of
          Agamemnon to perform a sacrifice: <q>how comes it that you are walking boldly towards it
            like an ox driven by god to the altar?</q> The hashtag list shown in the search results
          will help users to understand the various contexts of the different occurrences of the
          keyword: for example, a query on the single hashtag <code>#libatio/libation</code> returns
          all the occurrences of libation events. Browsing the list of co-occurring hashtags
          returned by this query, the user can verify if the libation is performed on stage (as it
          is in Aesch. <title rend="italic">Cho.</title>, 15 where the tag #libatio/libation
          co-occurs with the tag <code>#scaenica/on_stage</code>) or whether it is simply mentioned
          or discussed by the characters (as it is for example in Soph. <title rend="italic"
            >El.</title> 52, where Electra and her sister discuss a libation that has to be
          performed on Agamemnon’s tomb, and the tag <code>#libatio/libation</code> co-occurs with
          the tags <code>#ad_ritum_ire/go_to_rite</code> and <code>#tumulus/tomb
            #extra_scaenam/off_stage</code>). </p>

        <head>Structuring the Tags</head>
        <p>Semantic technologies can be exploited to identify and structure the knowledge embedded
          in literary texts. They can support experts in defining hierarchical and associative
          relationships between semantically annotated chunks of text denoting relevant entities and
          thus allow for the visual structuring of knowledge. This knowledge, formally coded as part
          of an ontology, can then be used by scholars and students as an aid to further analysis of
          the text. In particular, the use of semantic technologies aims at facilitating intelligent
          searches on the text in a more sophisticated way in comparison to traditional
          keyword-based search as a means to the discovery of implicit information/knowledge. In the
          next two subsections, we will introduce the basics of formal ontologies along with the
          approach that we will use for structuring the tags, respectively. </p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="section05">
        <head>Knowledge Representation Background and Standards</head>
        <p>Formal ontologies have nowadays become a standard means of representing knowledge about
          concepts and the relations among them in various different domains. The term ontology
          itself derives from philosophy and was first applied within the field of Information
          Systems in the late seventies to describe formal representations of knowledge about a
          given domain typically expressed in a manner that can be easily processed by machines (in
          a way that unstructured text generally cannot). More specifically, an ontology (in the
          Information Systems sense of the term) is a computational resource that explicitly
          represents the types of entities that can exist in a domain, the properties these entities
          can have, and the relationships they can have to one another. It also describes how these
          entities are decomposed into parts, and the events and the processes in which they can
          participate. A number of ontology definition languages has been developed over the past
          few years. One of the most popular such languages is the Ontology Web Language (OWL <ref
            target="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">https://www.w3.org/OWL/</ref>) <ptr
            target="#heflin2007"/>, a recommendation of the W3C (<ref target="https://www.w3.org"
            >https://www.w3.org</ref>). OWL was designed to meet the need for an ontology language
          for the Semantic Web (RDF: <ref target="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb"
            >https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb</ref>). It is based on the use of a common
          data framework, the Resource Description Framework (<ref target="https://www.w3.org/RDF"
            >https://www.w3.org/RDF</ref>) in which the knowledge is represented as a series of
          statements each of which is in the form of a <code>&lt;subject-predicate-object&gt;</code>
          triple. These triples usually consist of three separate resource IDs (although they can
          also be so called blank nodes or literals in the case of objects), so called uniform
          resource identifiers (URIs), and this allows for the easy representation of such knowledge
          as graph structures. <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> (a) provides a simple example
          showing the involvement of participants in a sacrifice, by listing some RDF triples, such
          as <code>&lt;_h2,rdf:type,Human&gt;</code> meaning that _h2 is a Human,
            <code>&lt;_h2,rdf:predicate,_s&gt;</code> meaning that _h2 participates to the sacrifice
          _s, and so on. <figure xml:id="figure03">

        <p>OWL is a decidable fragment of first order logic and a so called Description Logic (DL)
            <ptr target="#baader2005"/>, a class of languages specially intended for purposes of
          Knowledge Representation (KR). Ontologies created in OWL can be split up into two parts:
          an intentional and an extensional part. The former, the so called <term>TBox</term>,
          contains knowledge about concepts (i.e., classes) and complex relations between them
          (i.e., roles). The latter part, the so called <term>ABox</term>, contains knowledge about
          entities (i.e., individuals) and how they relate to the classes and roles from the
            <term>TBox</term>. <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> (b) shows the same example as
          before but encoded in OWL. OWL provides a sophisticated mathematical semantics for the
          interpretation of RDF triples: the resource Sacrifice is interpreted as a set,
            <term>Sacrifice</term>, which stands for the class of sacrifices, the resource Human is
          a set, <term>Human</term>, standing for the class of humans, and the predicate is defined
          as a semantic relation between the class <term>Human</term> and the class
            <term>Sacrifice</term>. Formally, the domain of <term>participatesIn</term> is the class
            <term>Human</term> and its range is defined by the class <term>Sacrifice</term> (note
          that we could further elaborate the semantic of <term>participatesIn</term>, by for
          example defining cardinality constraints, and so on). One of the most widely used tools
          for managing OWL ontologies is called Protégé (<ref target="https://protege.stanford.edu/"
            >https://protege.stanford.edu/</ref>). It is free, open-source and is supported by a
          strong community of users working both in academia as well as in industry. </p>

        <p> Another important Semantic Web related standard is SPARQL (<ref
            target="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/"
            >https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/</ref>), a powerful query language which allows
          users to make queries over RDF knowledge bases by carrying out graph pattern matching on
          RDF triples. <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> (c) shows a query related to the
          example. We assume that the individuals to be modelled take part in two different
          relations, for example <term>hasStartingIndex</term> and <term>hasEndingIndex</term>,
          which specify the sections in the text to which the related tags refer. The example shows
          how it is possible to retrieve all text passages referring to sacrifices in which at least
          one of the two specific humans (_h1 and _h2) is a participant. </p>

        <p>One of the great benefits of developing Semantic Web based resources is the fact that it
          is straightforward to reuse and to link to other datasets. In this case, for example, we
          can make use of other already existing semantic web ontologies to provide a layer of more
          general, abstract concepts without having to create these from scratch ourselves. </p>

      <div xml:id="section06">
        <head>The Bottom-up Approach</head>
        <p> The annotation strategies adopted on the passages of Aeschylus’ <title rend="italic"
            >Agamemnon</title> and which were discussed in <ref target="#section02">Section 2</ref>
          should have made it clear that the variation of details, such as the consciousness or the
          willingness of the victim, its gestures or movements, the presence of blood and the use of
          particular garments, can strongly affect the tragic representation of the ritual. This is
          because every ritual has its own norms, varying through space and time, that govern the
          ritual: its actions, words and gestures, the use of objects in it, and even the right mood
          in which to perform the rite. At the same time, ritual norms are not always strictly
          followed. They can be modified depending on the circumstances or (in certain cases) they
          can even be subverted. Moreover, the same gestures, actions or words can have different
          meanings depending on the context.<note>The concept of ritual norm has recently been
            investigated, see <ptr target="#brulé2009"/>. In particular relating to the corpus of
            the so-called Greek Sacred Laws, see <ref target="#parker2004">Parker (2004)</ref>, <ref
              target="#chaniotis2009">Chaniotis (2009)</ref>, <ref
              target="#carbonpirennedelforge2012">Carbon Pirennedel Forge (2012)</ref>. A digital
            collection of Greek Ritual Norms is under construction at the University of Liège ( <ref
              target="http://web.philo.ulg.ac.be/thiasos/cgrn-collection-of-greek-ritual-norms/"
              >http://web.philo.ulg.ac.be/thiasos/cgrn-collection-of-greek-ritual-norms/</ref>).
          </note></p>
        <p>The bottom-up approach adopted in this project allows the annotator to create and to
          organize the tags in order to follow the complex intersections between textual,
          interpretative and ritual issues. The organization of the tags is an iterative process,
          performed as a process of ontology construction establishing relations between single tags
          and groups of tags. More precisely we organise the tags by defining the different
          relations between ritual actions, gestures, words, objects as part of a formal ontology.
          This allows us to connect a single action to the ritual contexts in which it can be
          performed, and to indicate the main implications of a ritual performed in a certain
            way.<note>The structure of our ontology is described in <ref target="#mugelli2017"
              >Mugelli (2017)</ref>, where we also discuss the use of the ontology itself within a
            system for querying the annotated corpus.</note>
        </p>
        <p>As was shown in the annotation example in <ref target="#section02">Section 2</ref>, the
          sacrifice of Iphigenia in Aeschylus’ Agamemnon is annotated in our corpus as a human
          sacrifice with a virgin in the role of victim and as discussed in <ref target="#section03"
            >Section 3</ref>, passages like this can be retrieved using the search engine, by
          matching two keywords (virgin and victim, or human sacrifice and virgin). However, a query
          on these keywords would not be sufficient to find all the occurrences of sacrifices of
          virgins in the database. In fact it became evident during the annotation process that
          there exist a number of tragic passages that, although they refer to human sacrifice in
          general, are actually alluding to the sacrifice of a virgin, even if the identity of the
          victim is not directly stated in the text. This happens, for example, in Euripides <title
            rend="italic">IA</title>, where a large part of the drama relies on the ambiguity
          between the rites for the fake marriage of Iphigenia and Achilles and the sacrifice of
          Iphigenia herself <ptr target="#foley1982"/>, <ptr target="#foley1985"/>. In this tragedy
          it is therefore important to distinguish between passages alluding to sacrifices in
          general and passages alluding to the sacrifice of Iphigenia. The annotator found it
          useful, for the sake of clarity, to mark the sacrifices of virgins with the more specific
          tag <code>#virginem_sacrificare/sacrifice_of_virgins</code>. The two annotation strategies
          (the more general tag <code>#hominem_sacrificare/human_sacrifice</code> with the
          specification of the type of victim involved, or the more specific tag
            <code>#virginem_sacrificare/sacrifice_of_virgins</code>) are not contradictory and can
          be managed in the construction of the ontology. </p>
        <p>
          <figure xml:id="figure04">
            <head>(a) Hypothesis of a fragment of knowledge concerning Sacrifices and victims. (b)
              pseudocode of SPARQL query that retrieves all the sacrifices of virgins. </head>
            <figDesc>SPARQL query sacrifice virgins </figDesc>
            <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
          </figure> We can do this by arranging the tags in a hierarchy so that whenever we carry
          out a query using the more general tag we will also get all the results from the more
          specific tags. In our case it means that it will be possible using a single query to
          retrieve the whole set of texts marked as human sacrifices along with the two subsets of
          the sacrifices of virgins and the sacrifices of other human victims. Figure 2 shows a
          possible arrangement of some of the relevant classes in a taxonomy. There the class ‘Human
          Sacrifice’ is split into two different kinds, ‘Virgin Sacrifice’ and ‘Other Sacrifice’;
          similarly we have also arranged the potential victims of a sacrifice into a hierarchy. The
          definition of the different types of human sacrifice is the starting point for more
          complex queries such as that which we describe below. </p>
        <p> As we demonstrated in the annotation example in <ref target="#section02">Section
          2</ref>, the attitude of the victim is an important trait in the representation of
          sacrifices, and it is one of the characteristics of the rite that allows the comparison to
          be made between human and animal sacrifice. The attitude of the sacrificial victim is
          expressed by two opposing tags, namely, <code>#victimae_consensus/consent_of_victim</code>
          and <code>#victimae_dissensus/dissent_of_victim</code>). A simple query on the two tags
          returns all the occurrences of victims (either human or animal) who either consent to or
          dissent from the ritual taking place. The tag
            <code>#victimae_consensus/consent_of_victim</code>, for example, marks the passages of
          Eur. <title rend="italic">IA</title> where Iphigenia consents to being sacrificed and the
          passage of Eur. <title rend="italic">IT</title>, 469 where Orestes and Pilades, victims of
          a fake human sacrifice, are untied so they can go to the ritual of their own volition.
          Among the occurrences of willing victims there is also Aesch. <title rend="italic"
            >Ag.</title> 1297, cited above, where Cassandra is compared to an ox willing to approach
          the sacrifice. Among the attestations of the
            <code>#victimae_dissensus/dissent_of_victim</code> tag there are the passages of
          Aeschylus’ <title rend="italic">Agamemnon</title> cited above, various passages of Eur.
            <title rend="italic">IA</title> preceding the voluntary sacrifice (for example Eur.
            <title rend="italic">IA</title> 1243 where Iphigenia is supplicating to her father), and
          Eur. <title rend="italic">Hel.</title> 1559, where an ox refuses to get in the ship where
          it will be sacrificed. Both the consent and the dissent of the victim are attitudes that
          can be adopted by the sacrificial victims, either animal or human. <figure

        <p>The construction of the ontology will also help researchers to retrieve and study
          so-called perverted sacrifices. As we described previously, in <ref target="#section02"
            >Section 2</ref> and in the example given in <ref target="#section03">Section 3</ref>,
          the tag <code>#homicidium_sicut_sacrificium/homicide_as_sacrifice</code> marks all those
          passages in which the comparison between homicide and sacrifice is explicitly stated in
          the text or where it is clear to the annotator. It is possible to say that a homicide is
          being described in sacrificial terms by a tragic author if the description includes
          details that are unequivocally associated with rituals. This dramatic mechanism is
          recognisable (and will have been recognised by an audience), for example, in cases when
          the ritual slaughter <code>#sphage</code> is mentioned in the description of a homicide,
          when a murder is carried out on an altar <ptr target="#durandlissarrague1999"/> or when it
          is carried out with ritual objects. The perception of an interference between homicide and
          sacrifice on the part of the tragic audience should not, however, be taken for granted in
          all the passages that describe a homicide with ritual features. It would be useful,
          however, for further research on sacrifice and supplication in Greek tragedy, if it were
          possible to retrieve the largest possible number of passages where an interference between
          homicides and rituals may be present, in order to give scholars and experts easy access to
          important textual evidence. To this end, in our ontology we can create a subclass of
            <term>Instruments</term> called <term>Ritual Instruments</term> that covers instruments
          used in ritual (see <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>). We can then define the class
          of events <code>Homicide_as_Sacrifice</code> using a logical axiom (presented below in the
          diagram in a description logic formalism) as the intersection of all events that are
          classified as a <term>Homicide</term> and where the instrument used belongs to
            <term>Ritual Instrument</term>. <figure xml:id="figure06">
            <head>Hypothesis of fragment of knowledge concerning the event Homicide as Sacrifice. </head>
            <figDesc>ontology ritual intruments </figDesc>
            <graphic url="euporiagddh/images/ritual_instruments.png"/>
          </figure></p>
        <p> A query on all the events in the class <term>Homicide as Sacrifice</term> will return
          the list of the tragic passages where a homicide is carried out by means of a ritual
          instrument and where the mechanism of the so-called perverted sacrifice may be involved.
          The resulting list of passages would be extremely interesting for the domain expert, who
          will be able to study the dramatic function of the tragic passages and to compare them
          with the ritual practices that can be reconstructed from other, different kinds of
          sources. In doing this, however, the domain expert will have to take into account the
          plasticity of the ancient Greek ritual norm: in the actual ritual practices as well as in
          their representations we can observe variations from the norm which do not always result
          in a perversion of the ritual process. The case of the ritual instruments used in violent
          context is exemplary: as a matter of fact, the set of ritual objects that can be used as
          weapons in murders is hard to define, and it is an interesting starting point for the
          further development of our ontology. The texts of Greek tragedy are rarely accurate as far
          as the technical lexicon of sacrificial instruments is concerned. The word μάχαιρα,
          denoting the sacrificial knife, is used only twice in the corpus of extant tragedies
          (Aesch. <title rend="italic">Pers.</title> 56 and Eur. <title rend="italic">Supp.</title>
          1206) and twice in Euripides’ <title rend="italic">Cyclops</title>. In Euripides <title
            rend="italic">Electra</title>, where the ritual competence of Orestes in the sacrificial
          butchery of the victim is at stake, the two technical terms σφαγίς and κοπίς are employed
          to indicate two different types of knives, the second of which is specifically chosen to
          kill Aegisthus. The terms generally used to indicate the sacrificial knife are the two
          unmarked terms indicating swords, ξίφος and φάσγανον <ptr target="#bruitzaidman2014"/>.
          These types of knives can be used as ritual instruments, and they are actually used for
          slaughtering victims in various tragic human sacrifices. At the same time, however, they
          should not be considered as instruments exclusively for use in rituals since they are used
          as instruments in battle and in other contexts. Some similar observations can be made
          concerning the axe used by Clytaemestra in the killing of Agamemnon (see <ref
            target="#section02">Section 2</ref>). The double-axe (<foreign xml:lang="gr"
            >πέλεκυς</foreign>) is not part of the hoplite armour, and it was not used as a weapon
          in Classical Greece. Being primarily an instrument for felling trees, it was not a ritual
          object per se. At the same time, its use in animal killings can be interpreted as a
          sacrificial use: various sources attest the presence of the double-axe in sacrificial
          contexts, and it is used in Homer to stun sacrificial victims of large size. A query on
          the intersection between the two keywords #ascia/axe and <code>#homicidium/homicide</code>
          returns various mentions of Agamemnon’s killing by his wife (e.g. Soph. <title
            rend="italic">El.</title> 486, Eur. <title rend="italic">El.</title> 170, 279, 1160). </p>
        <p>A further development of our ontology may include the distinction between objects that
          are unequivocally ritual instruments, objects that are not ritual instruments but may be
          used in rites and finally objects that are to be considered ritual instruments when used
          in a certain way. The insertion of the <q>killer-axe</q> and of the technical terms
          denoting ritual knives in a set of ritual instruments to be retrieved in the context of
          murders and violent actions could help interpreters of Greek tragedy to cast new light on
          various aspects of the so-called perverted sacrifice. A search on murders that present
          ritual features (e. g. that are accomplished with ritual instruments) will return a series
          of passages that are not explicitly characterized as perverted rituals, but that may be
          insisting on the tragic ambiguity between homicide and sacrifice. </p>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p> In this paper we have discussed a system for the annotation of a corpus of Greek tragic
          texts that focuses on the ritualistic and religious aspects of those texts. The annotation
          system adopts a bottom-up approach, three different phases of which have been described in
          this paper: first there was the annotation stage proper, with the possibility of
          registering different textual and interpretive variants, then there was the design of a
          search engine that allows the database to be tested, and finally the on-going construction
          of an ontology of the tags. The system was designed to answer a specific research
          question, described in the introductory section of this paper, and therefore finds its
          first application in the retrieval of tragic passages in support of this research. As we
          have shown in <ref target="#section03">Section 3</ref>, the search engine allows the
          domain expert to perform multiple-searches that return all those portions of the text
          which attest to the annotated phenomena. The passages which are retrieved as a result have
          of course to be studied in their textual and dramatic context (the list of hashtags shown
          in the search results is extremely useful for a quick look at the context of the passage).
          At the same time, since the construction of the ontology is based on the ritual norms
          reconstructed both from tragic texts themselves and from historical sources (as was
          described in <ref target="#section04">Section 4</ref>), the system offers users the
          possibility of performing queries on various aspects of Greek ritual such as the
          consenting of the sacrificial victim to the ritual or the so-called perverted sacrifice.
          This research on sacrifice and supplication in Greek tragedy is based on the idea that, in
          the tragic representations of rituals, variations from the norm could be recognized and
          understood by the audience. From this perspective, the lists of passages resulting from
          the queries illustrated above will help the domain expert to broaden the corpus of his/her
          sources, and to question his/her sources in a different way. The annotation combines
          textual variants as well as modern interpretations on the tragic texts and theories on
          ancient ritual based on different sources, and it strongly depends on the needs and the
          choices of the annotator. Therefore, the search results should not be taken to be certain
          attestations of given phenomena, but they can be read as signs of possible ambiguities
          resulting from a comparison between the actual ritual norm and its tragic representation.
          For instance, the list of passages resulting from the query pertaining the murders
          accomplished with ritual instruments discussed at the end of <ref target="#section06"
            >Section 6</ref>, is not to be taken as a list of all the attestations of the so-called
            <q>perverted sacrifice</q> in the corpus of Greek tragic texts, but as a list of all the
          tragic passages where the public could have perceived a ritualistic connotation in the
          description of a violent action. Analysing the passages in their context, the domain
          expert will be able to verify if the tragic text actually refers to the ritual and relies
          on the ritual skills of the audience. </p>
        <p> As we have described above, the peculiarity of the annotation system lies in the fact
          that it was designed to study religious aspects of ancient Greek civilisation on the basis
          of a well-defined corpus of literary texts. In future work we plan to make the tagset
          available (both in TEI format and as Linked Open Data) along with the ontology in order to
          allow these resources to be reused in other projects. We can imagine at least two axes of
          possible interchanges: projects for the annotation of themes and motifs in ancient Greek
          texts, and projects aiming to study ritual and religion as they are attested in other
          corpuses of ancient Greek sources (e.g. Greek epic and historical texts). </p>
