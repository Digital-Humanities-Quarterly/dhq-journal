                  <p>Widespread ideals about libraries are in conflict with
                     deep-rooted gender-based inequities within the library and
                     gendered perceptions of libraries and librarians by the larger
                     public. These contradictions are particularly striking when we
                     look at gender in conjunction with information technologies that
                     help to structure work-roles in the library, especially as these
                     change. This article uses conventional and
                     “fictional” timelines to survey the
                     historical junctures of gender and technology in the library and
                     to speculate about the future of the academic library, with
                     particular attention to deployments of the digital humanities in
                     the library and its potential for disrupting these long-standing
                     gender patterns.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p1"> As an institution that is defined by information technologies and
                  as a workplace where women have been in the majority for over a
                  century, the library offers a unique perspective from which to view
                  the evolving relations of gender and technology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e174">[1]</a> Widespread ideals about
                  libraries as “essential to the functioning of a
                  democratic society...the great symbols of the freedom of the
                  mind” are in conflict with deep-rooted gender-based
                  inequities within the library and gendered perceptions of libraries
                  and librarians by the larger public — and can only be enacted
                  through technologies that are now in flux, like books, catalogs,
                  databases, and the internet. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e196">[2]</a>
                  In other words, library ideals are stressed along gender lines and
                  in terms of technological practices. This juncture, where gender and
                  technology meet in the library, thus deserves our particular
                  attention, not only for feminist analyses of technology and
                  technological culture, but for ongoing debates about the identity of
                  the library in a period of technology-driven transformation.
                  <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e225">[3]</a>
                  
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">This juncture is equally important to the identity of the digital
                  humanities, given the library’s complex and symbiotic relationship
                  to the digital humanities. Practically speaking, the library,
                  especially the academic library, is the space where many
                  institutional embodiments of the digital humanities are staged, in
                  digital humanities programs or centers that are located within the
                  library or congruent to it; this means that many practitioners of
                  the digital humanities work in libraries or in units that rely on
                  libraries. Indeed, the digital humanities center in/adjacent to the
                  library has emerged as a key paradigm not only for the
                  implementation of the digital humanities but also for library
                  responses to the changing information environment. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e265">[4]</a>
                  The library serves symbolically as the founding genius loci of the
                  digital humanities, as an inter-disciplinary laboratory and
                  repository — but it is also perceived as an agent of the
                  “old” humanities, structured by traditional
                  disciplinary distinctions, one-way communication systems, slow
                  technology, and fixed professional identities. The library is
                  responsible for some of the confusion about the very definition of
                  the digital humanities, as the host of many of the digital tools,
                  digitized resources, digitization programs, and digitization
                  specialists that make the digital humanities possible, but are not
                  in and of themselves expressions of the digital humanities...except
                  for when they are. Finally, library ideals — the library as guardian
                  of free speech, information safe-haven, repository of cultural
                  memory, and nursery of self-determination, dedicated to serving
                  community needs — engage values that are also associated with the
                  digital humanities, whose practitioners often claim commitments to
                  public discourse, open access, and service to a broadly defined
                  interdisciplinary community. Because of this operational
                  interdependency and congruency of principles, questions about gender
                  and technology in the library matter to the digital humanities and
                  vice versa — and gain new urgency when we imagine a future in which
                  technological change continues to influence both libraries and the
                  digital humanities.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">One way to think our way into these connected futures is to survey
                  their histories for predictive patterns. The timeline, a visual
                  representation of chronological time, offers a means of discerning
                  such patterns by sequencing thematically connected but temporally
                  distant moments within particular stretches of history. The
                  timeline’s signature rhetorical elements — the indicative
                  presentation of a single date and fact, multiplied and ordered in a
                  supposedly unassailable progression — implicitly assert its
                  completeness and accuracy, creating the illusion of a record so
                  fully mastered it can be delineated in a few strokes, like a
                  connect-the-dots picture, and freed from the usual proof
                  obligations, such as footnotes. While the selectivity, linearity,
                  and compression of the timeline can reify the historical status quo,
                  resulting, for example, in a “traditional and
                  parochial display of Eurocentrism regarding the history of
                  science and technology,” the timeline can also be a tool
                  of revision: by identifying and linking isolated bits of data within
                  a mass of accumulated historical phenomena, timelines can help us
                  see and tell new stories [<a class="ref" href="#ihde2000">Ihde and Amato 2000</a>]. Timelines can
                  even serve as “interpretationally flexible”
                  devices for feeling our way towards an understanding of events that
                  are not yet finished. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e286">[5]</a> It is in the spirit of this
                  latter conception of a timeline’s utility that I offer the three
                  timelines below. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e294">[6]</a>
                  
               </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p4"> Timeline I — not a conventional timeline at all — sets up the
                  symbolic landscape: how library ideals function within a
                  civilization’s self-description, as they appear in one
                  representative sci-fi future. In this biased bullet-point recap of a
                  particular speculative fiction, library ideals that come into view
                  as mere background to the plot can be seen as significant vehicles
                  of gender patterning with respect to technology. This
                  timeline-that-is-not-one thus also helps illustrate the narrative
                  losses and gains of the timeline as a device.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">Timeline II, organized into three chronological periods, reviews
                  selected events in library history since the mid-nineteenth century.
                  Each set of events is brought together by a focus on the library
                  identity that has been created by historically specific imbrications
                  of gender and technology. While I make this focus more legible at
                  the end of each set and then reduce the whole chronological stretch
                  into a few key points, the events themselves may seem to exceed the
                  interpretation I extract from them — as indeed they should. I hope
                  that readers will feel free to skim, skip, or dip more deeply into
                  events, or identify missing events, to corroborate or question my
                  historical deductions.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">Timeline III returns to the mode of speculative fiction: how might
                  different configurations of gender and technology play out in the
                  library of the future? Three possibilities for the academic library
                  are described — three versions of the future, circa 2030 — each with
                  a title that again names a particular library identity. For each, I
                  have attempted to draw out what particular library commitments might
                  mean for gender roles within the library, for the digital
                  humanities, and for disciplines more generally. Here again the
                  governing structure is less a conventional timeline than a
                  “time outline,” each a model of an idea about
                  the future. Multiple options again offer an invitation to the
                  reader: to contest or embellish these models, propose others, or
                  refigure their gender and disciplinary implications.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7"> All of these timelines employ to a degree the genre’s indicative
                  mood and fantasy of comprehensiveness, but I have attempted to
                  frustrate these properties in several ways: by adding commentary and
                  interpretation; by including historical events that do not exactly
                  adhere to the interpretive scaffolding I have put in place, and that
                  therefore gesture to other possible stories; and of course by
                  turning the instrument of the timeline towards chronologies that are
                  incompatible with its factual arrays, ie, fictions and
                  suppositions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e313">[7]</a> Most
                  importantly, because we are still immersed in the sequences they
                  chart, these timelines cannot be conclusive — in the case of the
                  final three possibilities, we have not even reached the temporal
                  horizon they depict. They are necessarily shaped by weighted
                  interpretations of history and current concerns; they inevitably are
                  or will be “wrong,” according to the criteria of
                  a later analysis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e319">[8]</a> To compound the
                  inaccuracy by setting these timelines within the fixed frame of a
                  traditional argument seems to me both unwise and, ultimately,
                  antithetical to their more open-ended purpose: to use the past to
                  refocus our view of the present and our possibilities for the
                  future. So, in place of a thesis statement, I offer the guiding
                  questions below — and, at the very end, a proposal for a possible,
                  partial remedy for the gender fractures in library ideals, and their
                  disciplinary and technological repercussions. My aim is not to
                  suggest a single answer, but to prompt a more explicit conversation
                  about the relationship between the library and the digital
                  humanities in terms of gender and technology.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p8">First, the questions that have shaped this selection of timeline
                  events. Where do gender stresses in libraries come from, how have
                  they shifted, and in what forms do they persist — despite decades of
                  feminist attention? What is the history of technology in the
                  library, especially those technologies that are indigenous to the
                  library and those in the deep background of digital poesis? Does the
                  history of gender in the library look different when we examine it
                  in tandem with the history of technology? Does the future? What does
                  the rise of the digital humanities in the twenty-first century augur
                  for libraries in terms of these long-standing gender stresses? In
                  short, why do we who work in libraries — which have been,
                  historically, on the front lines of “the shock of the
                  new” when it comes to information technology — still
                  experience “the shock of the familiar” when it
                  comes to gender?

                     the words “New York Public Library,”
                     just barely legible); the long tables and lamps of the reading
                     room; a wooden book cart; a large globe; shelves;
                     books.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e470">[10]</a> While Jack’s hide-out has
                     all the accoutrements of a beloved personal library, at the other
                     end of the public-private spectrum, the two spaces are connected
                     by the books themselves — these are the true
                     “temples” for the “ashes of the
                     fathers.”
                     <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite> incorporates many of the
                     preoccupations of mainstream science fiction: a deep ambivalence
                     about technological change, for one thing — excitement about its
                     promises coupled with fears about its potential effects; a
                     tenacious attachment to traditional gender roles, for another.
                     Jack’s and Victoria’s respective relationships to the
                     technologies of the mission are illustrative. Jack descends every
                     day from the tower to the surface, which he reaches via the
                     gyroscopic spaceship that he flies with aplomb; he fixes drones
                     with chewing gum and gins up pre-war record players in his secret
                     lake house. In contrast, as communications officer, Victoria
                     ascends every day to the top of their Jetson-style quarters — a
                     domestic pedestal far removed from the contradictions of the
                     surface. Victoria dresses more like a sexy secretary à la Mad Men
                     fantasy than a military staffer; in her tight, pale skirts and
                     silver shoes, with a delicate radio transmitter on one ear, she
                     sits at her hi-tech podium and moves icons around on its many
                     screens, mediating between Jack and mission control, uploading
                     and downloading data, watching his activities through grainy
                     video feeds, and losing contact with him when he goes rogue. Like
                     most films of its ilk, <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite>
                     assures us that the future, with respect to the ways gender
                     animates technology, will look a lot like the present: Jack
                     hacks; Victoria yacks.

                     them for a connection to history and a better future. It would
                     even be possible to argue that Jack himself represents a kind of
                     human library, an archive of personal memories that are preserved
                     (as we eventually learn) through many iterations of Jack clone
                     bodies. As for the scene set in the ruins of the NYPL, it is
                     important that <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite> offers clues
                     for recognizing the actual building, for it is a structure that
                     symbolizes two of the library’s most admired missions: it is a
                     democratic institution that is also a precinct of scholarship.
                     Given its age — the building was designed in 1895 and opened in
                     1911 — it serves perfectly as the emblem of library ideals that
                     were articulated in the late nineteenth century, through the
                     public library movement and the professionalization of
                     librarianship, and have come to define “the
                     library” as an institution. But all of the library
                     scenes in <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite> — the NYPL,
                     Jack’s hide-out, and a collection of books and works of art
                     maintained by the Scavs — express enduring and cherished
                     conceptions of the library as a storehouse of human knowledge and
                     achievement, and by extension, of democratic principles. The
                     library, then, is a storehouse not just of cultural matériel but
                     of cultural memory itself, and thereby its promise of
                     continuation — it links a civilization’s past and present to its
                     future. These are functions the film suggests are timeless,
                     sacred, and worth dying for.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e506">[12]</a></div>

                     actual operations as the library mythos is to the values it
                     protects. These stresses, originating in patriarchal systems that
                     regulated women’s legal rights, work, education, and
                     self-determination, took on forms specific to the library with
                     the advent of the public library movement, when the articulation
                     of modern library ethics and a related practical expansion opened
                     up librarianship to women. That shift led in turn to feminized
                     definitions of library work and public perceptions of the

                     action, his private hide-out a cultural refuge — echoes
                     long-standing anxieties about librarianship’s gender, and
                     reiterates moves made throughout the twentieth century to rescue

                        decades of the twentieth century, the American librarian
                        became a “professional,” part of a “national movement towards occupational
                        cohesion”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#garrison1979">Garrison 1979</a>, 7]. Professionalization transformed librarianship from a
                        job variously undertaken by clerks, amateurs, and scholars
                        into a specialized work-role. Key to this shift was the
                        development of a library association, training programs, and a
                        classification “science.” In a parallel
                        move, attitudes about library architecture turned away from
                        the alcoves and galleries of older libraries towards large
                        buildings spatially organized by distinct library functions —
                        reference, cataloging, business departments — and by the
                        classification of books.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p13">Late nineteenth-century professionalization helped to advance
                        a vigorous “masculine” culture of
                        enterprise, in opposition to “feminine”
                        genteel culture. This conflict had special consequences for
                        librarianship. Women in the library work force were perceived
                        as important custodians of morality and providers of service
                        who could enhance the credibility of the new public library
                        movement, especially as agents of the civilizing influences of
                        reading; at the same time, by “feminizing”
                        the profession, they undermined the library’s contribution to
                        “masculine” projects such as serious
                        scholarship, civic engagement, science, and business. By the
                        early twentieth century, women dominated the work force in
                        public libraries and librarianship’s low pay and low status
                        were secured.

                        The industrialization of print technology that began in the
                        early nineteenth century led, by century’s end, to new
                        techniques of mass production and complex trade networks.
                        Within these networks, librarians had to invent new tools and
                        systems for selecting, ingesting, storing, organizing, and
                        circulating books and periodicals, as both the quantity of
                        material and patron traffic increased. The need for automation

                        “the librarian” — the bookish spinster
                        as a recognizable pop culture figure. In contrast to the
                        prevailing image of the generic “shush
                        lady,” part clerk, part bluestocking, however,
                        librarianship became more specialized and systematic as
                        libraries had to adapt to changes in the knowledge economy and
                        escalating demands for services. As research with an emphasis
                        on empirical detail assumed a central role in academia,
                        university library collections expanded and use intensified.
                        New management problems arose from the growth not only in the
                        number but of types of items in libraries. And the aging of
                        library materials led to the recognition of the need for
                        conservation and preservation programs, adding to the
                        obligations of good stewardship.

                        affected classification, cataloging, circulation, and
                        preservation methods. In these arenas, new protocols developed
                        from bureaucratic innovation and experimental competition:
                        different methods and tools were tried out over time, until a
                        particular method or tool became dominant. Librarians studied,
                        reported on, and debated these practices in new professional
                        journals and library groups, which served as fora for
                        developing consensus. Automated and mechanized processes were
                        embraced to save time, money, and labor.

                        influenced the approach librarians took to public service.
                        Service to library patrons gained momentum through the adult
                        education movement, but this also created distinctions:
                        librarians would not serve as teachers in their own right.
                        Rather, as “readers’ advisor” became a
                        common duty central to librarianship, readers’ and reference
                        services were codified through the development of definitions,
                        guidelines, and standards.

                        wanted to modernize the work force by defining a distinct area
                        of library expertise and building up professional credentials.
                        This set of pressures led to a turn away from the older idea
                        of the librarian’s educational role and towards an identity
                        that prioritized access to information and the librarian as a

                        comfort with library services and librarians’ professional
                        status, and to grapple with rapid technological change that
                        restructured the information environment. In particular, the
                        librarian’s key role as an information specialist —
                        specifically, a mediator of access to information — grew more
                        important as new technologies complicated information
                        experience, but was also strained by the greater independence
                        these new technologies offered to information seekers.

                        called information science, and the conflicted rapprochement
                        of library science with information science. Whereas
                        information scientists might have associated librarianship
                        with the practical management of repositories, and information
                        science with the history of science and technology,
                        information business, computerization, and the organization of
                        knowledge, librarians might have associated librarianship with
                        public service, information retrieval, and bibliographic
                        control, and information science with “library science for boys”

                        paradigms emerged and then gradually merged: as a pragmatic
                        social science, library science was devoted to studying its
                        own systems and roles and the needs and behaviors of users,
                        whereas information science incorporated theories of
                        information, public policy, and human-computer interaction.
                        Although the two domains are now generally understood to be
                        coincident or at least as complementary, information science
                        is still sometimes represented as distinct from librarianship.
                        Gender is certainly in play in these designations, as many of
                        the traditional functions of librarianship continue to be
                        perceived as feminine, while the status of information science
                        benefits from masculine associations.

                        technological responsibility, place in the hierarchy and
                        occupation — and the public perception of librarians. Feminist
                        critique was integrated into the professional apparatus
                        through groups and publications. By the end of this period, a

                           libraries were modernized by approaches to information
                           management that took three technologic forms: a symbolic form,
                           ie, classification structures; a physical form, which turned
                           classification structures into information storage and
                           retrieval systems, like architectural designs, shelving, and
                           card catalogs; and an administrative form, which gave rise to
                           procedures to manage the storage and retrieval systems, and
                           services to mediate between readers and the materials they
                           sought. These technologies of information management, but
                           especially the administrative form, became the foundation of
                           library training programs and professional identity.

                           address problems of scale: the mass production of printed
                           matter, increasing numbers of library users, and library
                           values that emphasized the provision of free content to all.
                           Library technologies were oriented, accordingly, both towards
                           efficiency, in terms of storage and retrieval, and access, in
                           terms of use. Extensions of these approaches, such as indexing
                           techniques, reader’s services, and eventually, conservation
                           and preservation operations, were designed to improve access
                           and efficiency.

                           the library was seen by the public through the filter of
                           ideals that retained masculine associations with freedom of
                           thought, self-determination, and the protection of cultural
                           heritage; but as a workplace, it was seen through the filter
                           of the “woman’s work” performed within it —
                           as a bureaucracy requiring a service orientation and clerical
                           competence, not professional expertise.

                           librarianship was retained.

                           (as opposed to “librarianship”), raised the
                           cultural status of information technology. As new information
                           technologies migrated into the library, however, the value
                           they brought with them was absorbed by pre-existing gender
                           patterns. In other words, new work roles required by new
                           technologies attracted more men to the library workplace, but
                           fewer women took on these roles relative to their population
                           in the overall library workforce, especially in leadership
                           positions, and the cultural status of these new technologies
                           did not greatly affect public perceptions of
                           librarianship.

                     a constitutive feature of the library for over 150 years, has
                     always helped to organize the gender valences of library work and
                     perceptions of the library, but the changes in, authority of, and
                     rising value of technology in the twentieth century have
                     increased the stakes of these patterns. As long as they have
                     worked in libraries, women have been “yackers”
                     who interface with the community of users through administrative
                     procedures and the provision of services: helping patrons,
                     mediating between readers and the materials they seek. In roles
                     that are often more technical, men have been
                     “hackers” — but also
                     “yackers” when it comes to the big picture:
                     modernizing the library through new information management
                     technologies, articulating its democratic and scholarly missions,

                        or so years hence. Each describes a kind of library and
                        library workforce that we might encounter in 2030 — a
                        “time outline” rather than a timeline
                        <em class="emph">per se</em>. Each could evolve from the path laid
                        down so far, in keeping with certain assumptions about the
                        future of information and higher education: the digital
                        ecosystem will continue to grow in scope, complexity, and
                        importance; and the economic constraints on higher education
                        of the past several decades and especially the past several
                        years will persist, with at best a mix of ups and downs.
                        Second order factors derive from these basic conditions: the
                        importance of the library building as a place for people as
                        opposed to storage for a collection; the increased
                        accountability of the library in terms of advancing
                        institutional missions; the demand for different skills in the
                        library workforce; the recognition that libraries have
                        competition as information providers; and the need to reduce,
                        rearrange, or replace the traditional range of services in
                        order to save money or develop new sources of
                        revenue.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1867">[17]</a> All together, these conditions suggest
                        that the academic library will have to shed some of its
                        historic identity and transition or transform into something
                        new. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1889">[18]</a></div>

                        Association of Research Libraries’ scenarios user’s guide:
                        “stories about the future... devices

                        academic library’s future identity, played out in practical
                        terms — including configurations of gender and technology that
                        might follow from that idea and its repercussions for the
                        digital humanities. In other words, they are scoped more
                        narrowly and with more internal consistency than would be
                        likely in reality.

                        slate — as if it did not evolve from specific histories, which
                        have created certain inherited patterns and commitments.
                        Discipline-specific questions are also mostly neglected in the
                        library scenarios literature; “research” is
                        often treated as if it were a uniform activity, for example,
                        without disciplinary variations in library and technological
                        needs, institutional support, relationship to teaching, and
                        social status.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1917">[20]</a> The scenarios literature
                        also does not address gender or other vectors of power within
                        the library workforce, in perceptions of the library, or in
                        academia as a whole. These absences undermine the utility of
                        the scenarios for the practical ends for which they are
                        designed, since they distort the picture of how libraries
                        might be needed, used, and staffed in the future. The models
                        below, although they are incomplete in other ways, can at
                        least help us consider the consequences of library

                        may be threatened by a funding environment in which signature
                        stand-alone projects are attractive to donors. Finally,
                        smaller and less wealthy institutions may not be able to
                        afford the investment in library centers that would drive
                        DH.

                        possibly also along research versus teaching fault-lines. The
                        funding required by technology-rich, innovative library
                        centers could deepen the inequality that already exists
                        between wealthy and less wealthy institutions. Finally, it is
                        not clear that librarian collaborators, with a status closer
                        to that of faculty, would be granted or would assume the kind
                        of authority within the library that would make them effective
                        collections advocates. In other words, librarians might still
                        feel financial and social pressures to regard faculty input as
                        the sine qua non of collection management data. They might
                        still say, as they do now, “If faculty

                        those librarians also work directly with students, conduct
                        research, contribute to DH projects, and develop technology

                        the 1960s, have focused on the low status of librarianship,
                        its fraught dynamic of professionalization, and role
                        segregation within the library.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e2189">[22]</a> These studies have
                        revealed certain patterns recognizable to feminist economists,
                        sociologists, historians, and cultural analysts of other
                        professional arenas — gendered divisions of labor and spheres
                        of influence; histories of exclusion, inequity, and
                        community-building. The picture that emerges when we view
                        gender alongside the history of technology in the library
                        suggests that information technology, broadly defined, has
                        helped to organize all of these gender patterns since the
                        beginning of the modern library era. Mostly it has served as a
                        way to demarcate masculine, higher-status positions within and
                        associations with the library from feminine, lower-status
                        positions and associations. Specifically, those who invent and
                        symbolically invest certain technologies with cultural meaning
                        are men, while those who use and manage technologies are
                        women. What is mystifying is how technology continues to serve
                        this function even as feminist efforts within libraries —
                        where most workers are women — have attempted to unmask and
                        redirect these historical gender patterns.

                        librarianship may be organized in part by technology, but they
                        are also united by their association with the modern library’s
                        service ethic, the professional signature of librarianship,
                        and the library’s claim to the domain of information services.
                        It was the service ethic that allowed women to enter the
                        profession in the first place in the guise of the
                        “genteel library hostess”; a lady
                        librarian “always ready to serve”
                        could assist and defer to masculine pursuits.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e2255">[23]</a> It emphasized a particular kind of human labor:
                        service is “self-effacing.”
                        <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e2271">[24]</a> As the gender of
                        librarianship came under feminist scrutiny, however, the ethic
                        of service migrated — instead of being abolished, it was
                        adopted as an essential component of librarianship as a
                        professional occupation. An “orientation towards
                        service” is a professional trait for those who
                        are effectively selling knowledge services.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e2279">[25]</a> But it
                        seems to be enacted differently in male- and female-dominated
                        professions. In its more recent historical guises,
                        librarianship has brought service into the realm of services;
                        an attitude of service has become, in effect, a distinguishing
                        feature of library services. Service has gendered services.
                        The relationship between service and services in the library
                        thus raises the question: is an attitude of service the price
                        you must pay for dispensing knowledge in a female-dominated
                        profession? Another way to put this is, if your services are
                        not for sale, and if your ethic of service dictates that you
                        under-sell yourself, where does that leave you as a
                        professional?

                        what we could call service(s) — coincided historically with
                        efforts to emphasize the human labor of librarianship, as
                        distinct from the library as collection. “Library
                        services” as a term of art became more prominent
                        as the service ethic was linked to a predominantly female
                        workforce: a Google n-gram analysis suggests that it began to
                        appear in the literature around 1920 and rose to a peak in the

                        its cognates like projects, programs, or enterprises. Even the
                        pedagogical work that librarians do is coded as instruction,
                        with its more practical and limited sense of ministering a
                        lesson — of serving it up, we might say — as opposed to
                        teaching, a philosophically inflected gerund whose agents make
                        a path to knowledge. “Library services” as
                        an output are obviously not identical to the ethic of service,
                        but they have been connected by feminized notions of
                        facilitation and assistance, through which the library is
                        positioned as subservient to what the library enables,
                        knowledge production.

                        shorthand for a particular idea of what libraries are for is
                        that, in contrast to the human valence the word carried fifty
                        years ago, it now erases the distinction between human labor
                        and technological capacity: the people who work in libraries
                        exist on a continuum with the technologies they supply. Both
                        workers and machines are there to deliver the goods, not to

                        more important. As libraries increasingly employ technology
                        specialists who collaborate with researchers or who themselves
                        work as researchers, in units that manage data or create
                        tools, the library has become a site of information technology
                        production as well as a site of use. But this new role is both
                        obscure and obscurantist when it comes to gender: it is still
                        hidden behind the feminized façade of library services; and,
                        paradoxically, it has contributed to the invisibility of
                        gender patterns. While technology needs have brought more men
                        with specialized and economically desirable skills into the
                        library workforce, these men have tended to earn more than

                        the overall status of libraries or librarianship, whether they
                        are perceived by the public as librarians or not.

                        self-effacing role. But we may have to, if we want libraries
                        to survive. It is time to detach service from services. It is
                        time to modernize what we mean by service, and it is time to
                        ditch the paradigm that we think defines us — the idea that
                        the library is just a vehicle for services.

                     gender troubles, especially in relation to technology, are
