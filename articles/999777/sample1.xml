Introduction and Overview</head><p>Increasingly, research policy-makers and funders are calling for inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to be applied in response to complex socio-scientific questions. Whilst the most exciting and ground-breaking innovations, to paraphrase Carlos Moedas, former European Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, may indeed be happening at the intersection of disciplines, this kind of cross-disciplinary collaboration poses many challenges, among which are the individual disciplinary values, concepts of proof and evidence, languages, technical cultures and methodologies employed by different domains <hi rend="dhq_citation">(Bruce et al., 2004; Lowe et al., 2009; Edmond et al., 2018)</hi>. It is perhaps unsurprising that overcoming the challenges associated with specialised terminology/vocabulary is often instrumental to the success of cooperative work involving individuals of different disciplinary backgrounds and expertise levels <hi rend="dhq_citation">(Robertson et al., 2003; Bruce et al., 2004)</hi>. This may be, in particular, the case when the goal of the cooperation is to build a software platform, within and behind which mutual misunderstandings can become encoded, creating dissonances in structure and function, and potentially leading to difficulties for future users. This paper contributes to the academic literature on how a specific kind of technical artifact – in this case, a taxonomy of uncertainty – was used to enhance the functionality of a technical team and their co-developed platform itself created for the purpose of supporting interdisciplinary cooperative work. More specifically, we discuss how the cross-disciplinary design of this taxonomy became not just an instrument to organise data, but also a tool to negotiate and build compromises between four different communities of practice, each of which came to the project with a very different epistemically ‘native’ approach to issues of uncertainty. In order to illustrate the many interlinked functions, the taxonomy was required to perform, we will briefly introduce the project, its aims, and the four diverse but complementary partners that came together to deliver it. We will then discuss the taxonomy itself, how it needed to be adapted from earlier, similar work, and some of the issues it allowed the project team to negotiate and discuss. In the final section, we will look at the application of the taxonomy and how it informs system function in a manner that is sensitive to the requirements of all of the disciplinary stakeholders in the project.</p></div><div><head>2.

The model avoids assuming a tightly integrated organization of work; rather, it represents an extension of the negotiated order approach to organizations.

In addition to the project coordination activities, USAL led both the development of user interfaces and evaluation and the research for the definition and management of uncertainty in DH. The second technical partner, the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC), brought extensive experience designing and building large-scale DH infrastructures, and led the development of the PROVIDEDH platform.

Complex environmental problem solving depends on cross-disciplinary collaboration among scientists. Collaborative research must be preceded by an exploratory phase of collective thinking that creates shared conceptual frameworks. Collective thinking, in a cross-disciplinary setting, depends on the facility with which collaborators are able to learn and understand each others’ perspectives. This paper applies three perspectives on learning to the problem of enabling cross-disciplinary collaboration: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, constructivism, and organizational learning. Application of learning frameworks to collaboration provides insights regarding receptive environments for collaboration, and processes that facilitate cross-disciplinary interactions. These environments and interactions need time to develop and require a long phase of idea generation preceding any focused research effort. The findings highlight that collaboration is itself a complex system of people, scientific theory, and tools that must be intentionally managed. Effective management of the system requires leaders who are facilitators and are capable of orchestrating effective environments and interactions.","container-title":"Ecology and Society","ISSN":"1708-3087","issue":"2","note":"publisher: Resilience Alliance Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration and Learning","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26267958","volume":"13","author":[{"family":"Pennington","given":"Deana D."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"citation-key":"pennington_cross-disciplinary_2008"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?><hi rend="dhq_citation">(Jeffrey, 2003; Pennington, 2008)</hi>.

The Humanities Perspective</head><p>As one of the intended groups of end users of any tool or resource PROVIDEDH might build, it was critical that the needs and expectations of humanists would be central to the development of the project’s platform. However, as a collective descriptor the term ‘(the) Digital Humanities’ (DH) captures a broad range of research and research-related activities, sectors and stakeholders. This often obscures important differences between individual disciplines that bear on the ways they position themselves in relation to digital technology and with other disciplines. This perspective was represented in the project by Trinity College Dublin’s Digital Humanities Centre, which brings together a team highly experienced in fostering the work of a range of traditional humanities disciplines, including history. This work focused on the experiences of historians and literary scholars with exposure to building and/or using digital research tools. The aim of this segmentation was first and foremost to establish the expectations of a specific intended user base, as only through such specificity could the questions of uncertainty be adequately broached.</p><p>Even within this context, there is great room for variation in interpretation and practices. As the user modelling work of the DH@TCD team showed, a historian may, on one level, question her ability to read a historic text or question the date attributed to a certain event within an earlier interpretation. She may also, however, question whether an event was understood at the time as it is generally described now, or indeed whether the records of a given event have become corrupted or biased over time. The novelty and complexity of DH research combined with the idiosyncratic challenges of working with cultural heritage data mean that uncertainty can hinder substantially in the use and reuse of digital cultural resources, which might make it more difficult for a user to probe the context or provenance of a given fact or interpretation. Throughout the DH analysis pipeline, many decisions have to be made which depend on managing uncertainty, pertaining to both the datasets and the models behind them. Traditional humanities tools for managing uncertainty, such as corroboration among multiple sources, or inclusion of footnotes or explications to note a point of uncertainty, are themselves built on the preservation of complexity and scrutability. This is an epistemic cultural bias that can lead to resistance to taxonomy-based approaches, as the reduction of parameters to fit a simplified model can be perceived as an opening to un- or misinformed conclusions.  Yet without such tools, these disciplines cannot benefit from purpose-built ancillary tools in the form of interactive visualisations or novel user interfaces in the digital research environment. The successful development of a fit-for-purpose digital research environment – defined here as the adoption of the tool by the intended user base – is therefore highly dependent on the correct categorisation of the different types of heterogenous phenomena, including uncertainty, within DH.</p></div><div><head>3.3. The Open Innovation Perspective</head><p>The PROVIDEDH project and its taxonomy were not intended to have an impact only in historical research but also more widely as a way to understand the complex, tacit, or compound forms of uncertainty. Under the paradigm of Open Innovation, inflows and outflows of knowledge are positioned with the purpose to advance and expand possibilities of external through stakeholders. Thus, the boundaries between sourcing and the utilisation of an organisation’s external environment become flexible with more opportunities for innovation. The application of inbound Open innovation in the Digital Humanities allows organisations to reframe knowledge behind activities that recombine, search and capture technologies in a prompt manner that on-board current and urgent issues. Open Innovation becomes a social process derived from key factors such as declining knowledge hegemony, mobility of workers and growing influence of start-ups in supporting information and communication technologies. In other words, Open innovation provides new channels to knowledge transfer and dissemination that ignite broader accessibility and diffusion of knowledge. The presence of Open Innovation practices creates new areas to stretch outreach that currently does not fit in existing subfields. As innovation is not a linear process, stakeholders feed into the development of work combining physical and digital engagements that centre people within new models that adapt to new bubbling markets.</p><p>Open Innovation goes across the boundaries of organisations touching into a wide set of fields, such as low-tech industries, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), or not-for-profit organisations. Thus, the linkage of policies with innovation and science could help close gaps of uneven growth in productivity and prosperity by opening datasets along with public/private partnerships to enhance universities’ relations with industries. Additionally, policies with an Open Innovation perspective embrace uncertainty not only by new funding schemes but by intersecting programmes for frontier science where complex problems are confronted.</p><p>The research reads, applies, and interacts with the apparatus that conforms system transitions in everyday life through a set of intersectional theories across a variety of points of design with the goal to demonstrate the complex interactions shaping and impacting our understanding of uncertainty within data and data collection practice. To answer these questions, the Austrian project team undertook a number of events and interventions to explore possible approaches that prioritise collaboration around uncertainty in data as a socialising experience challenging the current status quo.  </p><p>The taxonomy developed in the project supports the Open Innovation paradigm by making it possible to explicitly express information about data uncertainty using characteristics relevant to the Digital Humanities and similar fields. The expression of the information is not only theoretical but can be applied in practice using the well-known and accepted TEI guidelines, as described in the following section.  </p></div><div><head>3.4. The Standards Perspective (TEI)</head><p>To resolve the tensions raised by USAL in a manner able to meet the needs of both the professional historian and the citizen scientist, a particular development approach would be required. As with USAL, in recent years, researchers at PSNC had been involved as technical partners in a number of Digital Humanities projects. Through these projects in particular, they developed a sensitivity to the use of the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) standard as an accepted mechanism for providing a common structure to digital editions and other digital artefacts created by humanistic researchers. The TEI standard enables simple text processing, corpus linguistic queries and other quantitative approaches to the texts. As such, understanding how the TEI might contribute to an accepted and ultimately sustainable expression of uncertainty seemed an exceptionally fertile approach.</p><p>Although the TEI specification includes several mechanisms to express uncertainty or precision (e.g., the &lt;certainty&gt; element, the &lt;precision&gt; element, or the @cert attribute), using them is not a common practice. In an attempt to establish a baseline understanding of precisely how well used they were, project team members used their presentation slot at the TEI 2019 conference <?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"hiMzAOYh","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Kozak {\\i{}et al.}, 2021)","plainCitation":"(Kozak et al., 2021)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":29950,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/4711545/items/9TYR5QR2"],"itemData":{"id":29950,"type":"article-journal","abstract":"The underlying uncertainty in digital humanities research data affects decision-making and persists during a project’s lifecycle. This uncertainty is inevitable since most empirical claims cannot be assessed against an absolute truth (Drucker 2011; Binder et al. 2014). This situation has been previously recognized together with the need to report the degrees of uncertainty that accompany such claims (Blau 2011). Although TEI makes it possible to annotate text with notions of certainty or precision, examples of actual projects taking advantage of this are scarce. There are many possible explanations for uncertainty’s lack of visibility in computationally supported humanities research; among them, the need for tools specifically designed to address the goal of defining and managing uncertainty stands out. Thus, efforts to provide technical support for humanities research should focus on managing and making uncertainty more transparent, rather than removing it. Another challenge is the fact that there is no agreement on a generic taxonomy for the different types of uncertainty that researchers may face. Various researchers across disciplines, working on varying projects and data sets, can use different categories to classify the uncertainties present in a particular case.             In this paper, we introduce a collaborative platform for collective annotation of TEI data sets. We briefly present the flexible taxonomy of uncertainty used in the platform and describe two data sets used for its testing. Then we describe use cases of annotations available on the platform, and how they translate into TEI annotations.

To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality.

Participants infer which of two possible underlying trends is more likely to have produced a sample of time series data by referencing uncertainty visualizations which depict the two trends with variability due to sampling error. By modeling each participant's accuracy as a function of the level of evidence presented over many repeated judgments, we find that observers are able to correctly infer the underlying trend in samples conveying a lower level of evidence when using HOPs rather than static aggregate uncertainty visualizations as a decision aid. Modeling approaches like ours contribute theoretically grounded and richly descriptive accounts of user perceptions to visualization evaluation.","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864909","ISSN":"1077-2626","page":"1-1","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Hypothetical Outcome Plots Help Untrained Observers Judge Trends in Ambiguous Data","author":[{"family":"Kale","given":"A."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"F."},{"family":"Kay","given":"M."},{"family":"Hullman","given":"J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"citation-key":"kale_hypothetical_2018"}},{"id":23854,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/4711545/items/IQ3Y5D45"],"itemData":{"id":23854,"type":"article-journal","abstract":"Clear presentation of uncertainty is an exception rather than rule in media articles, data-driven reports, and consumer applications, despite proposed techniques for communicating sources of uncertainty in data.

To help explain this contradiction, I present a rhetorical model of uncertainty omission in visualization-based communication. I also adapt a formal statistical model of how viewers judge the strength of a signal in a visualization to visualization-based communication, to argue that uncertainty communication necessarily reduces degrees of freedom in viewers' statistical inferences. I conclude with recommendations for how visualization research on uncertainty communication could better serve practitioners' current needs and values while deepening understanding of assumptions that reinforce uncertainty omission.","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934287","ISSN":"2160-9306","issue":"1","page":"130-139","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Why Authors Don't Visualize Uncertainty","volume":"26","author":[{"family":"Hullman","given":"Jessica"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"citation-key":"hullman_why_2020"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?><hi rend="dhq_citation">(Kay et al., 2016; Hullman et al., 2018; Kale et al., 2018; Hullman, 2020)</hi>.

This is especially applicable to Digital Humanities research objects which may have been degraded or partially lost due to natural processes or the different transformations that may have been applied to the originals.

Design/methodology/approach The authors have analyzed the XML files from Aftonbladet 1830 to 1862. The most frequent newspaper words not matching a high-quality references corpus were selected to zoom in on the noisiest part of the paper. The variety of the interpretations generated by optical character recognition (OCR) was examined, as well as texts generated by auto-segmentation. The authors have made a limited ethnographic study of the digitization process. Findings The research shows that the digital collection of Aftonbladet contains extreme amounts of noise: millions of misinterpreted words generated by OCR, and millions of texts re-edited by the auto-segmentation tool. How the tools work is mostly unknown to the staff involved in the digitization process? Sticking to any idea of a provenance chain is hence impossible, since many steps have been outsourced to unknown factors affecting the source document. Originality/value The detail examination of digitally transformed newspapers is valuable to scholars depending on newspaper databases in their research. The paper also highlights the fact that libraries outsourcing digitization processes run the risk of losing control over the quality of their collections.","container-title":"Journal of Documentation","DOI":"10.1108/JD-09-2016-0106","ISSN":"0022-0418","issue":"6","note":"publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited","page":"1228-1243","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Cultural heritage as digital noise: nineteenth century newspapers in the digital archive","title-short":"Cultural heritage as digital noise","volume":"73","author":[{"family":"Jarlbrink","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Snickars","given":"Pelle"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"citation-key":"jarlbrink_cultural_2017"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?><hi rend="bold">(Jarlbrink and Snickars, 2017)</hi> and it is also of special importance to the aims of our project.

This challenges the idea that it is possible to create a single view of uncertainty. “While any group’s ontology is unlikely to match that of every individual within the group, the extent of mismatch tends to increase with the scale of the group and the differences between the purpose of individual and group ontologies” <?biblio ADDIN ZOTERO_TEMP?><hi rend="dhq_citation">(Wallack and Srinivasan, 2009, p.2)</hi><hi rend="dhq_citation">.</hi> The reality is that the development of a taxonomy, which must cater to the needs of a range of disciplines and stakeholders, may often lead to a result in which the specific requirements of not one subject area or stakeholder group are fully met, and yet which all can still use at some level of granularity.</p><p>Building on these insights, the group organised a series of shared workshops exploring the issue of conceptions of uncertainty and its relationship to decision-making in different contexts. These workshops commenced from existing taxonomies, such as Fisher’s (reproduced above), and sought to revise them so as to reach consensus, if not agreement, about how conceptions of uncertainty might be made concrete and actionable in a historical research system. The three workshops each approached a different aspect of the overall challenge, focusing first on the historian’s requirements for decision-making as compared to the system's needs for clarity and simplicity. The second continued this discussion with a wider and more diverse group of potential users, and the third looked at the same challenge from the perspective of open innovation. Robust discussions and negotiations about the taxonomy occurred at every one of these discussion points. For example, in the interaction designed to bridge what was perceived as a back-end processing ‘optimal’ with the perspective of the historian, nearly every term had to be renamed, glossed and refined, with, for example, the descriptor of ‘error’ being rejected as lacking sufficient precision. The domain experts also strongly advocated for the recognition of time-based element tracing the possible source of uncertainty from the original moment of a source’s creation through the many transformations over time (physical damage, cataloguing, transcribing, translating, digitisation, etc.) all the way through to the task of the researcher itself. Although later discussions continued to be active and important for the purpose of converging both understanding and usage patterns (in particular the meeting to discuss how to further extend the taxonomy’s use in the Open Innovation context), fewer changes were implemented over time.</p><p>Departing from the taxonomies proposed by <anchor type="commentRangeStart" n="1"/><anchor type="commentRangeStart" n="2"/>Fisher (1999) and Simon et al. <anchor type="commentRangeEnd" n="1"/><hi rend="annotation_reference"><note place="comment" resp="#Author" n="1"><date when=""/>which references?</note></hi><anchor type="commentRangeEnd" n="2"/><hi rend="annotation_reference"><note place="comment" resp="#Author" n="2"><date when=""/><hi style="font-size:12pt">Fisher, P. 1999. “Models of Uncertainty in spatial data”, Geographical Information Systems, John Wiley &amp; Sons.</hi>Simon, Christophe; Philippe Weber; and Mohamed Sallak (2018). <hi rend="italic">Data Uncertainty and Important Measures</hi>.

The PROVIDEDH Taxonomy.</p><p>Although it maintains the overall simplicity of having four categories of uncertainty (about which much negotiation of terminology was required) the final taxonomy also incorporates a number of other dimensions deemed important for the notation of uncertainty. First, on the y-axis, it incorporates a sensitivity to time and the possible actors that might have introduced uncertainty into a system. This is particularly important for historical research, as an uncertainty introduced by a more recent process (such as dirty OCR of historical texts) may be much easier to manage in a decision-making process than an original gap in what was seen or reported. Similarly, the matrix follows Fisher in applying the concepts of epistemic and aleatory uncertainty, with the former more likely to be a result of human lack of understanding, and the latter more likely to be one of imperfect sources and tools. Truly epistemic uncertainty is the hardest to address, but, as we can see in the taxonomy, there is only one of twelve possible states of uncertainty that is indeed fully epistemic, along with five others that are partially so. Knowing how uncertain a given uncertainty is, makes it much easier to build systems and annotation standards to accommodate it, but it also allows historians and citizen users to maintain their sense of uncertainty itself which is often a complex and potentially hybrid state. Through this instrument, we can see differences between those places that are likely to have wide agreement as to the nature of the uncertainty and what it would take to optimally resolve it (a gap in a primary source), and those areas where the questions are much more individualised, closer to the work of a single historian.</p></div><div><head>5. Implementing the Taxonomy</head><p>The final taxonomy was deployed as a fundamental element in the PROVIDEDH demonstrator platform for the investigation of uncertainty in historical texts. Its primary functionality was to structure the manner in which users could indicate the nature and level of uncertain passages in the text and to visualise patterns in these annotations. This enabled a like-with-like comparison of annotations across users and documents. The use of the taxonomy in the system (for example in the visual annotator, see Figure 5, is based upon a conceptualisation of uncertainty that has two well-defined sources: 1) tool-induced and 2) human-induced, which can be respectively mapped to the two main categories devised by <anchor type="commentRangeStart" n="3"/>Fisher <anchor type="commentRangeEnd" n="3"/><hi rend="annotation_reference"><note place="comment" resp="#Author" n="3"><date when=""/>reference indication needed?Fisher, P. 1999. “Models of Uncertainty in spatial data”, Geographical Information Systems, John Wiley &amp; Sons.</note></hi>(1999) that were introduced in previous sections of this paper.</p><figure xml:id="figure04"><graphic n="1005" width="16.398875cm" height="9.154583333333333cm" url="media/image5.jpg" rend="block"><desc>A screenshot of a computer

For example, a researcher could parametrise an algorithm with a fixed set of inputs and launch it a number of times, obtaining a range of mean values and deviations encoded in a document which, if correctly displayed, would allow her to get an idea of how the algorithm behaves. Analogously, the algorithm could be parametrised with a variable set of inputs created by the user running the computation or, as we will see next, by other past researchers. This operation mode would provide an answer to the question “What happens if I run the algorithm a million times using my assumptions?” or “What happens if I run the algorithm a million times using another person’s assumptions?”. As in the case of running the algorithm with the same parameters many times, the results of running the algorithm with different parameters many times could also be summarised in a continuous document allowing the said kind of what-if analysis. This would answer the question of “What happens if I use these other person’s assumptions?” or “What happens if I decide not to trust another actor’s assumptions?”.

In this paper, we explore task-centric topic model comparison, considering how we can both provide detail for a more nuanced understanding of differences and address the wealth of tasks for which topic models are used. We derive comparison tasks from single-model uses of topic models, which predominantly fall into the categories of understanding topics, understanding similarity, and understanding change. Finally, we provide several visualization techniques that facilitate these tasks, including buddy plots, which combine color and position encodings to allow analysts to readily view changes in document similarity.","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467618","ISSN":"1077-2626","issue":"1","note":"tex.ids= alexander_task-driven_2016","page":"320-329","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Task-Driven Comparison of Topic Models","volume":"22","author":[{"family":"Alexander","given":"E."},{"family":"Gleicher","given":"M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"citation-key":"alexander_task-driven_2016"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?><hi rend="dhq_citation">(Alexander and Gleicher, 2016)</hi>.</p><p>The other category, human-induced uncertainty (bottom), arises from 1) direct interpretations of the raw data (which in turn may be based on others’ previous interpretations and grounded expert knowledge of the user) and 2) interpretations of computational analyses performed on the data or 3) a combination of the two.

In a first stage, we modelled human-induced uncertainty according to the uncertainty taxonomy of Figure 4 in what was called the 4+1 uncertainty model. Later, and following a series of evaluation sessions and workshops, we evolved the model to support a variable number of human-induced categories. This change was introduced after a series of user-driven experiments and evaluations in which we asked the participants to annotate different types of historical texts (poetry and historical recipes).

Fuelled by critical voices among the DH community, DH scholars are becoming more aware of the intrinsic advantages that incorporating the notion of uncertainty into their workflows may bring. Additionally, the increasing availability of ubiquitous, web-based technologies has given rise to many collaborative tools that aim to support DH scholars in performing remote work alongside distant peers from other parts of the world. In this context, this paper describes two user studies seeking to evaluate a taxonomy of textual uncertainty aimed at enabling remote collaborations on digital humanities (DH) research objects in a digital medium. Our study focuses on the task of free annotation of uncertainty in texts in two different scenarios, seeking to establish the requirements of the underlying data and uncertainty models that would be needed to implement a hypothetical collaborative annotation system (CAS) that uses information visualisation and visual analytics techniques to leverage the cognitive effort implied by these tasks. To identify user needs and other requirements, we held two user-driven design experiences with DH experts and lay users, focusing on the annotation of uncertainty in historical recipes and literary texts. The lessons learned from these experiments are gathered in a series of insights and observations on how these different user groups collaborated to adapt an uncertainty taxonomy to solve the proposed exercises. Furthermore, we extract a series of recommendations and future lines of work that we share with the community in an attempt to establish a common agenda of DH research that focuses on collaboration around the idea of uncertainty.","container-title":"Information","DOI":"10.3390/info12110436","issue":"11","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"number: 11\npublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","page":"436","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Evaluating a Taxonomy of Textual Uncertainty for Collaborative Visualisation in the Digital Humanities","volume":"12","author":[{"family":"Benito-Santos","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Doran","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Rocha","given":"Aleyda"},{"family":"Wandl-Vogt","given":"Eveline"},{"family":"Edmond","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Therón","given":"Roberto"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"citation-key":"benito-santos_evaluating_2021"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?><hi rend="bold">(Benito-Santos et al., 2021)</hi>. From these experiences, we could check first-hand the latent need, as perceived by the participants, for a more nuanced and flexible way of communicating uncertainty in Digital Humanities projects, as well as the potential benefits that this could bring for collaborative work on Digital Humanities datasets. Specifically, we discovered that, sometimes, users could not pick one of the predefined categories when making annotations on the texts. Furthermore, we also detected that there almost never was a 100% consensus on the uncertainty type different users chose to annotate the same portion of text: e.g., whereas for some a linguistic variant of a word implied imprecision (e.g., they were more or less sure about a word’s meaning, but the word varied from a standard form), for others it meant ignorance (e.g., they did not know what the word meant). These differences, we argue, are often subtle and very much depend on the mental state, ground knowledge on the subject and other traits of the particular user making the annotation. Beyond that, some users showed preference for labelling uncertainty in a particular annotation as a combination of different types. For example, a user could be more or less sure that a word found in the text represents a dialectal variation but at the same time not be sure of the word’s meaning in a certain context. In this case, the user should be able to reflect her views using a combination of categories (e.g., imprecision + ignorance + 0/5 non-credibility + 0/5 gaps). This way of communicating uncertainty, we argue, allows a higher level of expressiveness and is able to capture the nuances of the user’s mental state that needs to be captured and presented to other users working in the same dataset. To allow for even better communication of uncertainty between actors, we allow users to dynamically create new categories as required, which are established on a per project-basis in what is called the n+1 uncertainty model. This departs from the observed effect in our experiments that a group of users working on the same data will naturally establish their own uncertainty taxonomy that covers the needs and particularities of the specific tasks to be performed on the data. As such, they will use it as a communication tool to collaborate in a distributed manner in time and space by appending their annotations to the dataset according to these ad-hoc categories, effectively fulfilling one of the project’s main objectives.</p></div><div><head>6.
