                  <p>Proverbs are an essential component of language and culture, and though much attention
                     has been paid to their history and currency, there has been comparatively little
                     quantitative work on changes in the frequency with which they are used over time.
                     With
                     wider availability of large corpora reflecting many diverse genres of documents, it
                     is
                     now possible to take a broad and dynamic view of the importance of the proverb. Here,
                     we
                     measure temporal changes in the relevance of proverbs within four corpora, differing
                     in
                     kind, scale, and time frame: Millions of books over centuries; thousands of books
                     over
                     centuries; millions of news articles over twenty years; and billions of tweets over
                     a
                     decade. While similar methodologies abound lately, they have not yet been performed
                     using comprehensive phraseological lexica (here, <cite class="title italic">The Dictionary of
                        American Proverbs</cite>). We show that beyond simple partitioning of texts into words,
                     searches for culturally significant phrases can yield distinct insights from the same
                     corpora. Comparative analysis between four commonly used corpora show that each reveals
                     its own relationship to the phenomena being studied. We also find that the frequency
                     with which proverbs appear in texts follows a similar distribution to that of individual
                     words.</p>

                     proverbs, and in general to examine the utility of frequency-based studies of common
                     phrases in large corpora. In particular, we hope to answer the following: Can a
                     computational study of proverbs in large corpora offer unique insight in the study
                     of
                     those proverbs? And is this novel kind of approach appropriate to corpus linguistics
                     and
                     studies using corpora broadly? We first build a quantitative foundation by searching
                     for
                     and counting instances of an ecology of proverbs, and estimating their frequency of
                     use
                     over time in several large corpora from different domains. We then characterize basic
                     temporal dynamics allowing us to address fundamental questions such as whether or
                     not
                     proverbs appear in texts according to a similar probability distribution to words

                     in
                     addition to the text being studied. Here, we use Mieder’s <cite class="title italic">Dictionary

                     fundamental components of texts risks flattening the complex interrelations between

                     de-emphasizing or omitting altogether culturally significant phrases. We show a case
                     (proverbs) in which established computational methods may be applied to a class of
                     culturally meaningful phrases, with results that paint a valid and substantially unique

                     in language and culture, and that they are immensely popular among the folk (the people
                     for whom these phrases are culturally relevant) [<a class="ref" href="#mieder2012">Mieder 2012</a>]. Proverbs are generally
                     metaphorical in their use, and map a generic situation described by the proverb to
                     an
                     immediate context. In light of challenges in developing reliable instruments for
                     measurement and quantification of figurative language, research would greatly benefit,
                     as it has with words, from a better understanding of the frequency and dynamics of
                     proverb use in texts. By applying new methodologies in measuring frequency and

                     Though there is still some debate, it is widely agreed that proverbs are popular sayings
                     that offer general advice or wisdom. Naturally, not all such sayings are proverbs.
                     Mieder’s definition is perhaps the most useful for our present purposes: “Proverbs [are]
                     concise traditional statements of apparent truths with currency among the folk. More
                     elaborately stated, proverbs are short, generally known sentences of the folk that
                     contain wisdom, truths, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and
                     memorizable form and that are handed down from generation to generation” [<a class="ref" href="#mieder2008">Mieder 2008</a>]. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Proverbs maintain a particular relationship with their context of use that provides
                     a
                     fruitful domain for frequency and probability analysis. An important part of the proverb
                     is the context in which it is used. The metaphorical property of a proverb need not
                     only
                     have to do with the proverb itself (as in the proverb/metaphor “war is hell,” in which
                     war is compared to hell within the proverb). In general, the use of a proverb is
                     metaphorical in context, meaning that the proverb offers wisdom about a current
                     situation via a metaphoric comparison to a proverbial one [<a class="ref" href="#mieder2008">Mieder 2008</a>]. For instance,
                     while the proverb “still waters run deep” might be used to caution someone against
                     taking a seeming calm for granted, as it may belie unseen dangers. As with many other
                     proverbs, it is hard to imagine anyone using the proverb “you can’t put lipstick on a
                     pig” in any literal or pragmatic context. Rather, these phrases offer wisdom embodied
                     in
                     the culture as opposed to that of the speaker. In this way proverbs may be used
                     generically without proffering personal expertise.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Proverbs are necessarily ambiguous enough to offer wisdom in any number of situations.
                     Michael Lieber argued that this ambiguity paradoxically gives proverbs the function
                     of
                     disambiguating situations in which they are used. In part due to their role as cultural
                     rather than individual wisdom, they can be invoked impersonally as a way of clarifying
                     a
                     complex reality [<a class="ref" href="#lieber1994">Lieber 1994</a>]. As such, part of Winick’s definition of the proverb is
                     that they “address recurrent social situations in a strategic way” [<a class="ref" href="#mieder2008">Mieder 2008</a>].</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">It is important to note the distinction between proverbs and idioms. An example of
                     an
                     idiom would be the phrase “red herring” denoting a mislead. The meanings of idioms, like
                     proverbs, often cannot be ascertained from the meanings of their component words.
                     But
                     unlike proverbs, idioms are often not complete sentences, require context, and need
                     not
                     reference a paradigmatic situation. Proverbs on the other hand represent a complete
                     situation and offer some sort of general wisdom. The boundary between the two is rather
                     fuzzy and contains many idioms and proverbial expressions. For instance, the proverb
                     “every cloud has its silver lining” is perhaps more well known by its idiomatic
                     reduction “silver lining.” In fact, people may use an idiom without any knowledge of its
                     proverbial context. Our intent here is to focus on expressions of full proverbs, and
                     not
                     their idiomatic uses. As previous work has shown, it is possible to investigate the
                     manipulations and idiomizations of individual proverbs [<a class="ref" href="#cermak2014">Čermák 2014</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#moon1998">Moon 1998</a>]. Our
                     approach has limitations, and further research into flexible searches or other
                     identification methods will be essential in future work.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Metaphor and idiom identification and comprehension are an open area of research in

                     American college students could recall on average between 25 and 27 distinct proverbs,

                     with the letter <em class="emph">f</em>, and used a relatively small text sample
                     [<a class="ref" href="#norrick1985">Norrick 1985</a>]. In the first serious computational analysis of proverb frequency, Lau

                     text. As such, in the case of proverbs (and phrasal idioms), one ought to “analyze a

                     first serious attempt to apply the new tools of computational linguistics to routine

                     instances of 6776 FEIs from the <cite class="title italic">Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary</cite>. It is worth
                     noting that at the time, there were few machine-readable English phraseological lexica.
                     Though proverbs consisted of only 3.5% of the searched phrases (240), 19% of the
                     expressions found in the corpus were proverbial expressions, the second most common
                     subtype behind “simple expressions” (70%). Of the proverbs found, 59% were deemed
                     metaphorical. Moon notes that exploitation of FEIs are easy to miss, and uses the

                     Should
                     proverb frequency in large corpora be considered when judging that minimum? Of course,
                     there are problems with this approach as well: proverbs rely heavily on oral tradition,
                     and are prone to frequent corruptions and purposeful exploitations. As such there
                     is no
                     guarantee that a search of a given phrasing of a proverb will capture all, if any,
                     of
                     its occurrences in a text. There are ways around this on an individual basis, but
                     it
                     depends on the proverb: some employ parallel structures (like “good X make good Y”), or
                     have popular idiomizations (like “silver lining”). Longer proverbs are more likely to
                     appear in more than one form, as words and clauses can be swapped rearranged, or omitted
                     without changing their overall meaning, which makes computational identification more
                     difficult. Shorter proverbs will more reliably appear in a consistent form because
                     there
                     are fewer words to manipulate, and any manipulation is likely to change their meaning.

                     on
                     the utility of some elements, and the specificity of others. A rank distribution

                     resulting rank among all words in the text. Zipf’s law shows that there is an inverse

                     scaling breaks down toward the tails of these empirical distributions, meaning that
                     the
                     lowest ranked words do not seem to follow Zipf’s law. Recent work by Williams et al.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#williams2015b">Williams 2015b</a>] showed that power law scaling holds over more orders of magnitude when
                     randomly partitioned phrases are used rather than individual words. That study also
                     suggested a refocusing of corpus linguistic attention from words to phrases as essential

                     offers a reliable representation of culture. For one, books are not indexed by
                     popularity, and each book appears only once. As a result, the linguistic contributions
                     of the most popular books are weighted equally with the least popular [<a class="ref" href="#pechenick2015a">Pechenick 2015a</a>].
                     Secondly, the increase in volume of scientific publications in the last century causes
                     the last century of English as a whole to be relatively skewed towards that genre.
                     For
                     instance, enormously influential books like <cite class="title italic">To Kill a

                     obscure books. In the last century, the rise in volume of scientific and academic
                     publication drastically increased the relative influence of this type of writing.

                        in
                        Twitter discourse suggests that in the wake of its initial rise, it was more frequently
                        adopted to general non-Bieber usage. (A similarly popular 3-gram, non-proverbial song

                        period called “Bieber fever” [<a class="ref" href="#tweedle2012">Tweedle 2012</a>]) certainly contributed to its popularity,
                        its continued use over a five-year period is compelling evidence that the proverb

                           has been the most popular proverb on Twitter since 2016, perhaps originating from
                           its
                           consistent use by Senator Bernie Sanders [<a class="ref" href="#mieder2019">Mieder 2019</a>]. It has since become associated
                           with growing protests against police brutality and gun violence. Annotations reflect

                        critical point of retaliation. The data from Twitter display a narrative of repeated
                        tragedy in spite of public outcry. The proverb was most popular during the 2018 US
                        midterm elections, during which gun control was a major issue.</div>

                     which taken each within the limits of their methods of collection, can offer piecemeal
                     insight into the relationship between phrases and the written record. Observing all
                     four
                     side by side, it should become clear that generalizing linguistic tendencies from
                     individual corpora may not be a good idea. Even among corpora with significant temporal
                     overlap the results differ due to both the scope of each corpus, and the way in which
                     data are collected from texts. The present approach of studying data from distinct
                     domains allows for both a more limited and more useful interpretation of the results:
                     We
                     can only claim that results are representative of proverb use on Twitter for instance,
                     rather than proverb use in English as a whole — an impossible achievement.</div>

                     that
                     warrant a closer look. In studies of common words, the concept the word represents
                     is
                     often dependent on its context, and evaluating context for each instance in a large

                     context, we show that proverbs allow us to perform a different kind of analysis that

                     of
                     text than traditional methods of humanities scholarship, that broader view often
                     necessarily obscures the context in which linguistic elements are used. A single word
                     or
                     short sequence of words may carry any number of meanings dependent on the words or
                     concepts around it. Proverbs carry their own paradigmatic context which makes their
                     meaning and use fairly consistent. While proverbs may be employed in many different
                     practical situations, the paradigmatic situation they represent remains the same.
                     In
                     searching for proverbs, we are able to see how a paradigmatic context is applied to
                     different practical contexts. The results of this search show not only the frequency
                     of

                     each phrase studied is meaningful. In an analysis of all 3-grams in a text, a very
                     common phrase without a fixed meaning, like “and this is” could obscure a far less
                     common meaningful phrase like “love is blind,” even though it is common among phrases
                     with fixed meanings. Our study of a specific cultural-linguistic phenomenon highlights

                     act as

                  <div class="ptext" id="p82">The data for proverbs in the Gutenberg corpus were used to construct a network with
                     documents as nodes, connected if a given proverb appears in both documents. When
                     betweenness centrality was calculated for nodes in the network, surprisingly James
                     Joyce's <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite> had the 14th highest centrality, close to several
                     dictionaries of proverbs and quotations, and the collected works of Mark Twain (Table
                     B-1). Creasy (2008) documented Joyce's use of proverbs in <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite>
                     from a critical perspective, noting that they are often altered, and blend high and
                     low
                     culture in the work. As Joyce uses many fewer proverbs than a comprehensive proverbial
                     dictionary, the book's centrality in this network implies that Joyce's use of proverbs
                     is far from arbitrary, and that his choice of proverbs is purposefully situated in
                     the
                     broader context of English proverbial knowledge. </div>
