                  <p>This article sheds an empirical light on interdisciplinary collaboration within the
                     Digital Humanities by investigating the daily research practice of the Dutch Digital
                     Humanities-project BRIDGE. The project developed and tested methods for automatically
                     creating meaningful links and expanding archival television data. In the project,
                     a
                     high level of collaboration was required between scholars from two different
                     disciplines: computer sciences and media studies. The majority of the epistemological
                     encounters between the two disciplines took place in the design of the developed
                     tools and the user studies to test the tools. The article is based on structured
                     conversations between the two central staff members in the project, i.e. the computer
                     science PhD-student and the media studies postdoctoral researcher. By unravelling
                     the
                     research project as a process of confrontation, identification and acknowledgement
                     of
                     situated knowledges, the article shows when and how the boundaries between the two
                     disciplines have been maintained, crossed and blurred. The authors point to the
                     benefits and challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration in the Digital Humanities,
                     and formulate some best practices for future Digital Humanities-projects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Computer sciences and humanities are rightly considered different scholarly
                     disciplines and they use different languages, approaches and paradigms. It comes as
                     no surprise, therefore, that mutual misunderstandings, unbalanced expertise levels,
                     and lack of interest in the other discipline are issues that regularly occur within
                     Digital Humanities-projects that typically work on a new technology and
                     humanities-based research question. In their anthology, [<a class="ref" href="#bartscherer2011">Bartscherer and Coover 2011</a>, 2] define this core challenge for Digital
                     Humanities research as follows: “Mutual incomprehension persists.
                     Generally speaking, scholars and artists understand little about the technologies
                     that are so radically transforming their fields, while IT-specialists often have
                     scant or no training in the humanities and traditional arts”. Insight into
                     collaborative research practices, and interdisciplinary collaborative research
                     practices in particular, can shed light on the quickly evolving field of Digital
                     Humanities. What does it mean to “do” Digital Humanities? In this
                     article, we look at the <em class="emph">practice</em> of interdisciplinary collaborative
                     research between computer sciences and humanities based media studies.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">A case in point is the Dutch television archive project BRIDGE (Building Rich Links
                     to Enable Television History), a collaboration of the Information and Language
                     Processing Group of University of Amsterdam, the media studies group Centre for
                     Television in Transition of Utrecht University, and the national radio and television
                     archive The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. The project showcases the
                     synergy of the two academic disciplines involved, computer sciences and media
                     studies, which collaboratively developed and tested digital tools for exploration
                     of
                     archival television data. Collaboration in DH is often, as [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2012">Flanders 2012</a>, 67] states, “aimed at building
                     something that works — a tool, a resource, an online collection”. The focus
                     of the research in the BRIDGE-project, however, was not solely on building digital
                     tools for the humanities, but also on the scientific evaluation of tools and
                     algorithms, as part of computer sciences, and a study on how such tools and
                     algorithms may advance insights in the field of Media Studies. The main output of
                     BRIDGE is a PhD dissertation in computer science, publications in both humanities
                     and
                     computer science conferences and journals, and prototypes of tools (which are
                     eventually developed into sustainable tools in follow-up projects<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e213">[1]</a>. This very interdisciplinary and evaluation-driven set-up
                     makes the project different from many other DH-projects in which the tools, the
                     technological infrastructures and the humanities research seem to be central.

                     technology and software production. [<a class="ref" href="#barry2008">Barry et al 2008</a>], for instance,
                     conducted a large-scale critical comparative study of interdisciplinary institutions
                     based on ethnographic fieldwork and an Internet-based survey. [<a class="ref" href="#lin2012">Lin 2012</a>] bases her article on an autoethnography of one team member during the development
                     of software. Most studies use qualitative research methods (notably social
                     science-based methods such as ethnography and interviews) to produce case studies
                     that focus on how members of a project that involves more than one discipline
                     (struggle to) communicate, negotiate, and cooperate. In this article we also report
                     on an auto-ethnography, not by one humanities or social science researcher who
                     observes scientists and engineers, but by a humanities scholar <em class="emph">and</em> a
                     computer scientist who observe themselves, “the other”, and their

                     article, we revisit these research processes. The main focus of the research process
                     was on conducting user studies. The technical results of these user studies are
                     already published in computer science outlets ([<a class="ref" href="#bron2011">Bron et al 2011</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#bron2012a">Bron et al 2012a</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#bron2012b">Bron et al 2012b</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#bron2013">Bron et al 2013</a>]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e243">[2]</a></div>

                     maintained, crossed and blurred, and to what extent transdisciplinarity emerged. By
                     making the research process more transparent, this paper aims to demystify
                     disciplinary boundaries, to reflect on the production of interdisciplinary knowledge,
                     and to provide a future look into Digital Humanities research by providing

                     <em class="term">discipline</em>. Defining a discipline requires caution as it has
                     different interpretations. We follow [<a class="ref" href="#menken2016">Menken and Keestra 2016</a>, 27] who
                     pragmatically define a discipline as “a field of inquiry with a

                     specialist <em class="emph">knowledge</em>” (italics by authors). Simply put,
                     academic disciplines are created by groups of scholars as a form of organization of
                     their knowledge about a certain object. The very boundaries and definitions of
                     disciplines vary over time.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Over the course of the past four decades, interdisciplinarity has been widely
                     discussed in academic literature. Terms such as multi-, cross- and
                     transdisciplinarity are used to describe different interactions between disciplines.
                     All terms can be situated on a <em class="emph">continuum</em>: while multi-disciplinary means
                     that there is just communication, but not so much mutual exchange, “cross-”
                     already means some more exchange, while “trans-” means that there is a creation
                     of something new that surpasses the boundaries of disciplines. According to [<a class="ref" href="#hessels2008">Hessels and van Lente 2008</a>, 741], transdisciplinarity goes beyond
                     interdisciplinarity as the first is much more dynamic. In other words,
                     transdisciplinarity can be defined as the radicalization of “existing disciplinary norms and practices”, “allowing researchers to go beyond their parent disciplines,
                     using a shared conceptual framework that draws together concepts, theories, and
                     approaches from disciplines into something new that transcends them all”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#roseneld1992">Roseneld 1992</a>, 1351]. Similar to multi- and cross-disciplinarity, transdisciplinarity is not a
                     given, but a process, something that is created and constructed over time.

                     boundaries can be theorized as “power moves, not moves toward truth”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#haraway1988">Haraway 1988</a>, 576]. In a constructionist view, knowledge claims are a continuous struggle for
                     meaning, which makes it meaningless outside its own context. Yet, we approach the
                     collaboration between two disciplines and interdisciplinary knowledge production as
                     an Actor-Network, as coined by [<a class="ref" href="#latour2005">Latour 2005</a>]. Actor-Network Theory
                     (ANT) addresses the construction and transformation of human values and knowledge
                     and
                     the notion of the actor as agent [<a class="ref" href="#giddens1991">Giddens 1991</a>]. According to [<a class="ref" href="#latour2005">Latour 2005</a>], agents are individual entities that assert force while
                     interacting with other entities. They form what Latour calls actor-networks. Agents
                     can be both actors, which are human entities, but they can also be actants
                     delineating not only humans, but also non-human entities, such as interfaces. Agents
                     are always bound to other agents acting together and therefore the output of the
                     entire actor-network cannot be predicted by any agent separately. When investigating
                     interdisciplinary collaboration, then, there is an interaction between two
                     disciplines in terms of knowledge negotiation between agents.

                     To

                     for improving the production of knowledge. Situated knowledge, then, means that all
                     subjects have embedded positions: they are part of and actively co-construct a
                     disciplinary-bound knowledge. In this context, [<a class="ref" href="#haraway1988">Haraway 1988</a>, 188]
                     launched the “greased poles dilemma”: it is hard to climb
                     a pole when you are holding onto both ends of the pole. The pole is a metaphor for
                     the epistemological question (i.c. what is regarded as acceptable knowledge within
                     a
                     discipline): the duality between positivism and empiricism on the one hand and social
                     constructivism on the other hand. She argues that a way to overcome these dualities
                     is to articulate “partial visions”, and thus “situated knowledge”. Therefore, these scholars are advocates
                     of multi-method approaches [<a class="ref" href="#naples2013">Naples and Gurr 2013</a>].

                     related to the knowledge building of the computer scientist? How can both
                     “situated” scholars collaborate, if they can? In our article,
                     we will show that doing Digital Humanities research is a process in which holding
                     on
                     to each end of the pole is the intrinsic position at the beginning of the climb, but
                     that the key to collaboration lies within identifying, acknowledging and learning
                     about the situatedness of the knowledge of the self/own discipline and that of the
                     other researcher and discipline. Doing Digital Humanities, therefore, is not only
                     about using tools to produce papers or developing tools/interfaces per se, it is also
                     (and perhaps chiefly) about <em class="emph">the process (and attempts)</em> of making
                     research and tools transparent by making one's own and the other’s discipline’s
                     assumptions explicit. In other words, it is a matter of building a bridge between
                     both discipline-specific ends of the pole, walking on the bridge and (trying to) look
                     at one's own and the other discipline-specific end from another perspective, as to
                     acknowledge their differences and similarities.

                     between postdoc and PhD student in the form of semi-structured interviews. This was
                     done three times: halfway through the project (year 2), at the end of the project

                     Latour, as [<a class="ref" href="#couldry2008">Couldry 2008</a>] notes, does not provide a way in which the
                     agents interpret their networks. To interpret the networks and the researchers’
                     discourses, we rely on the theories of Stuart Hall (1992) on identity as discursive
                     construction. He approaches identity formation as a process of “becoming” rather
                     than “being”, a process of identication that is constructed on the basis of
                     recognizing certain characteristics shared with another person, group or an idea.
                     “Othering”, then, is a form of defining the self: when making differences
                     with the out-group explicit, the in-group defines itself. This implies that words
                     such as “we” versus “them”, or “I” versus “you” are important
                     markers of identity construction. Therefore, we specifically look at the use of these
                     pronouns to see how the researchers’ disciplinary identities are being constructed
                     and how knowledge is being formed.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">The process of othering, however, puts constraints on the writing of an article
                     across disciplines. It is a true challenge to write an article from two different
                     viewpoints and paradigms. Therefore, we needed a new way to cope with this. Following
                     Bartscherer and Coover’s book “Switching codes: thinking through
                     digital technology in the humanities and arts”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bartscherer2011">Bartscherer and Coover 2011</a>], we believe that a conversation structure of the
                     empirical sections enhances and highlights not only the collaboration in the project
                     but also the very act of writing this article. While the interviews are quoted as
                     “I” and “you”, the article itself is written as “we”. The “we”
                     are both authors, but as this is a humanities journal with (largely) a humanities
                     readership, we take humanities discourse and concepts as leading. For the description
                     of the research process, we use the third person (he/she/the researcher/they) in
                     order to identify ourselves as research objects for the sake of this article. As
                     such, the article is an expression of standpoints (in plural) of which the
                     situatedness is made semantically explicit by quoting ourselves and using the third
                     person. In the conversations, the quotes by the Computer Science PhD student will
                     be
                     indicated by “CS” (while in fact it is Marc Bron). The Media Studies postdoc
                     researcher’s quotes are indicated by “MS” (while in fact it is Jasmijn Van
                     Gorp). The article is written from a multi-disciplinary standpoint, by means of the
                     collaborative software WriteLatex, in itself a way of doing collaborative research.
                     Therefore, the article is in itself, to quote [<a class="ref" href="#latour1987">Latour 1987</a>], “science in the making”.

                     to
                     misunderstandings but also to interdisciplinary knowledge production. We divided our
                     analysis into four chapters which (humanities-wise) correspond with the classic
                     narrative structure of Hollywood films: establishing shot, encounter, conflict and
                     reconciliation. In section 4, we set the scene by elaborating on the basic
                     characteristics of the two disciplines computer sciences and media studies. In
                     section 5, 6, and 7 we follow a chronological order, corresponding with the
                     identified three research phases in the project: the encounter, the struggle and
                     reconciliation. For each phase, we first outline all research steps, then we discuss
                     the challenges encountered and collaboration strategies per research step in a

                     main subdisciplines. Information retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually
                     documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information
                     need from within large collections (usually stored on computers) [<a class="ref" href="#manning2009">Manning et al 2009</a>, 1]. A related discipline is Information Studies,
                     which is concerned with how people interact with systems and how those systems can
                     be
                     improved [<a class="ref" href="#bakhshi2009">Bakhshi et al 2009</a>, 6]. This discipline is closer to the
                     Humanities, as it also involves qualitative methods such as observation. Although
                     media studies can be situated both in humanities and social sciences, the majority
                     of
                     television research (still) takes place in humanities departments. Media studies has
                     the media as object of analysis, either in a centralised or decentralised way [<a class="ref" href="#couldry2005">Couldry 2005</a>]. Media studies researchers use a variety of data: textual
                     data such as newspapers, Twitter feeds and magazines, and audiovisual data such as
                     films, radio, games and television programs [<a class="ref" href="#bron2016">Bron et al 2016</a>]. Evidently, the
                     sciences are also slipping into Media Studies (and vice versa), which is most clearly
                     seen in New Media Studies, which concern the study of Social Media, computers and
                     information systems such as mobile communication. They often use quantitative
                     “big data” analysis, but are often adding a critical
                     interpretative layer to it.

                     computer-led experiments are the core, as well as creating new algorithms. Computer
                     sciences measure and use (solely) quantitative methods. The basic skills a computer
                     scientist should master are: good understanding of theory, algorithms, computer
                     design and programming languages. For the humanities-based Media Studies, the
                     individual researcher is much more central. The researcher’s own interpretation is
                     key. Qualitative methods are better suited for the humanistic stance in the
                     humanities [<a class="ref" href="#creswell2014">Creswell 2014</a>]. Some skills a humanities researcher should
                     master are: critical reflection, interpretation and theoretical

                     Computer science is a quickly evolving field that wants to publish results at least
                     every six months in order to be first. First, they write a conference paper of
                     usually 10 pages, which is peer-reviewed and, if accepted, published in proceedings.
                     A common follow-up is to write a journal article on those aspects of the conference
                     paper that need more in-depth analysis. Given these factors, the scientific output
                     of
                     computer sciences, as in other “hard” sciences, is high in

                     physically alone when at work because writing tends to be by nature a solitary
                     activity. In the humanities, the research often takes place during the writing. The
                     argument of an individual (or duo-) based (humanities) versus a team-based research
                     (sciences) tradition can be easily made by looking at random issues of Media Studies
                     journals as <cite class="title italic">Cinema Journal</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Television and New Media</cite>, and monographs in the field of film, television

                     of <cite class="title italic">Society for Cinema and Media Studies</cite>, i.e. the major
                     American conference in the field of film and media studies, has a majority of single
                     authored papers and does not give the opportunity to include more than two authors

                     papers. For research assessment, some Humanities departments do not take publications
                     with more than x number of authors into account, while other Humanities departments
                     encourage co-authored articles by giving them more weight than a single-authored
                     article. Furthermore, for humanities-based media studies, the single-authored
                     monograph is an important outlet of scholarly work which partly explains the slow
                     publication pace of the discipline in comparison with computer sciences.

                     transdisciplinarity may arise. The very research direction in which both disciplines

                        researchers use their current main tool to acquire research material, i.e., the
                        existing tool (catalogue) of the national radio and television archive, called
                        “iMMix” (<a href="http://zoeken.beeldengeluid.nl/internet/index.aspx" onclick="window.open('http://zoeken.beeldengeluid.nl/internet/index.aspx'); return false" class="ref">zoeken.beeldengeluid.nl</a>). For the first study within BRIDGE, the team

                        compile a list of features that would be desirable for a new search system. iMMix
                        formed the “baseline”, a concept which is common in computer
                        sciences but not at all in the humanities. Baseline means that it is the set that

                        television and radio programmes of Dutch public broadcasters, provided by
                        professional annotators. It has a simple and an advanced search option that allows
                        users to search on specific fields. After the search results have been displayed,
                        they can be refined by a filter system. However, the search system is developed
                        for an experienced group of users: the broadcast professionals. Broadcast
                        professionals, in their need to reuse material, often know what they are looking

                        considered as a “known item search system”. Media researchers, however, would
                        benefit from an “exploratory search system”, a system that supports them in
                        browsing, learning about the representation of their research topic in the

                        knowledge of the archival content in the archive, so s/he would have to rely

                        studies who had never worked with the Dutch iMMix before. The team set up a small
                        experiment, in which the postdoc had to do a search on a self-selected topic.

                        22 media studies students (freshmen). They had to find five television programs
                        for three tasks in a limited period of time, by using the iMMix search system. The
                        tasks for the users have been designed, by varying the difficulty in terms of
                        prior knowledge. The three tasks were defined in such a way that the students

                        and had to extensively explore the archive in order to do so. The first two
                        questions were situated in contemporary times, while the latter was a historical
                        one: (i) find 5 television programs with comedians from a non-western country;
                        (ii) find 5 episodes of drama series in which location plays an important role;
                        and (iii) find 5 game shows with a female host broadcast during the 1950s, 1960s
                        or 1970s. For the first task for example, students first had to find names of
                        comedians of a non-western country, while not being allowed to use any other tool
                        or search engine besides iMMix, before being able to find correct
                        answers/television programs. After completion of the three tasks (or when the
                        maximum 10-minute time limit per task was over), students completed a survey that
                        also contained open questions. They also conducted four in-depth interviews with
                        students after the computer experiment. The study showed that the search system
                        iMMix did not provide the necessary support for exploratory search by

                        computer science research, the arrival of the humanities postdoc in the project
                        changed the scene.

                        work:

                           did before, making lists of entities, is not that relevant for the search
                           process of media researchers.”

                        observation was so helpful for her computer science colleague. Two years later,
                        she started to see what was so illuminating about her very first search when she
                        took the videotapes from the shelves and started to analyse her own search. By
                        retrospectively observing her own search behavior, she understood that the
                        relation between (re)search object, research question and search behavior of
                        humanities scholars is quite particular. It resulted, amongst others, in a
                        reflective article on her very first search in the archive [<a class="ref" href="#vangorp2013">Van Gorp 2013</a>]. In the end, therefore, the observational study of the
                        postdoc using a think aloud procedure turned out to be quite a “ground
                        breaking”, thus effective, way to get to know each other’s
                        specificities and to get introduced to each other’s discipline.

                        computer science paper. Therefore, the PhD-student wanted to conduct a user study
                        with a high number of participants to have a “baseline” measurement, in order
                        to be able to measure the improvement of the future (to be developed)

                        it was this very semantic gap that provided inspiration for the humanities scholar
                        to give a “humanities” touch to the user study. The humanities
                        postdoc eventually wanted to do an empirical study of the concept of cultural
                        memory by conducting qualitative interviews with students.

                           studies research design. Of course, now I do know. But back then I really

                        The result of the study gave some insight in the search behavior of students, but
                        the scholars both realized that the quantitative measurements as well as the four
                        interviews with students were not sufficient to fully grasp the particularities of
                        search and search systems of media researchers. They needed a different approach
                        for their next user studies. However, they did not realize back then that the
                        “seed” (or “solution”) for a better set-up of a user
                        study was exactly the combination of quantitive measurements with qualitative
                        interviews, as shown in the next sections of this article.

                        progress. There was a lack of semantic interoperability. For example, as
                        preparation for the user study, the postdoc had to create tasks for the students,
                        formulate “queries” for the interface.

                           But “key word” to you meant something totally different, so we had the

                        realized that they needed a different approach to deal with humanities scholars.

                        build a bridge, let alone walking on it. The “other” discipline
                        was still looking “alien” to her in her first six months of the

                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">After one year of the “joint” project, the researchers
                        gradually started to really collaborate. The main aim was the development and
                        testing of the exploratory search system MeRDES (Media Researchers’ Data
                        Exploration Suite). It is in this phase that the two disciplines started to be
                        transcended.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p42">First of all, the idea for MeRDES emerged when the two staff members were both
                        attending a talk of one of the creators of Google’s N-gram Viewer. Within 30
                        minutes the researchers realized that it would be really good to have such an
                        n-gram viewer for the television archive as an “exploratory search system”.
                        And so, they started to develop a kind of N-gram viewer for the television
                        archive, which they called Media Researchers’ Exploration Suite, abbreviated to
                        MeRDES<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e930">[5]</a> (see <a href="#figure01">image

                     <div class="ptext" id="p43">MeRDES is specically developed for media studies research and has two goals.
                        First, it provides users with support for exploration, i.e., support in
                        formulating key words and exploring various aspects of a topic (i.e., a tool for
                        retrieval). A second aim is to provide support for discovering patterns in the
                        data (i.e., a tool for analysis). As data for the search engine, we used the same
                        large metadata set as is used in iMMix. They incorporated two side-by-side
                        versions of a standard exploratory search tool that contains cloud filters. Based
                        on Google’s N-gram Viewer, the researchers added a timeline visualization, and a
                        term statistics visualization in which the characteristics of the result sets
                        obtained with each side of the tool are shown and can be compared.

                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p44">In order to develop MeRDES, two focus group discussions with media researchers
                        were conducted at two different media studies institutes. The team showed them a
                        mock-up of MeRDES and asked for feedback. Once the new tool was developed, they
                        tested a first version by means of a usability study with and tested by 30
                        computer science students (freshmen). The feedback was given to the software
                        developer, who improved the system. With the improved system, they were able to
                        conduct a remote online user study with 39 media studies scholars from the
                        Netherlands and the Dutch speaking part of Belgium. After having viewed a tutorial
                        video and having practiced with the tool, the media researchers were given the
                        following search task in this third study: “Imagine that you have to write a
                        research paper on the portrayal of migrants on Dutch television. Try to find
                        relevant programs in the television archive. The goal of exploring the archive
                        is formulating the initial research question for your paper”. After the
                        search session, the users were asked to provide a research question and also
                        feedback in a post-test survey, both by means of check boxes and open questions.
                        The study showed that the double (“subjunctive”) interface supported a wider
                        variety of research questions. For an elaboration on the methodology and the
                        results of the user studies, see [<a class="ref" href="#bron2012b">Bron et al 2012b</a>].

                        and full professors. They asked them to pick one of their own research projects
                        and reconstruct their research process. This part of the research was
                        “purely” qualitative, and resulted in a peer-reviewed
                        article about the research process of media researchers and the position of the
                        research question in this process (see [<a class="ref" href="#bron2016">Bron et al 2016</a>]).

                        a tool would operate, which impeded the development of the tool. Retrospectively,
                        it was really a struggle; one of the most difficult episodes in the project.

                           development went so fast. There was no time for me to really read literature
                           and theorize the tool. But we had planned a user study, so we had no other
                           choice than speeding up. The worst thing that could have happened is that we
                           had 39 scholars available to test, but no tool. It really felt as a high
                           speed train. I was not used to do things “now”. If I had
                           deadlines when I was still doing humanities research, I had at least two
                           weeks, and most likely one month. I also remember you were always asking me
                           “what is the time line”? At first, I thought you were referring to
                           the timeline graph in the interface, but then I realized you meant planning
                           with it. And now I really know why it was so important to have a strict

                     <div class="ptext" id="p49">Most difficulties were situated — again — at the level of a lack of semantic
                        interoperability. Another good example to illustrate the mutual misunderstanding
                        is the different take on television genres. The problem was that the iMMix
                        catalogue listed about 300 genres ranging from “game show”, “quiz show”,
                        “quiz”, “amusement”, “Amusement” (with capital) and so on. These
                        television genres contained subgenres, sub-subgenres and also labels media studies
                        scholars do not use. The media researcher, therefore, wanted to make a new
                        division of genres which better matched the needs of media researchers. She knew
                        that media researchers really want to select and mix and match their own
                        television genres. The computer scientist in the project perceived “genre”
                        just as one of the many metadata fields of the television archive, just a facet,
                        similar to “producer” or “channel”. This view really conflicted with
                        that of the media researcher who considered genre as one of the backbones in film
                        and television studies research. They had a long, persistent discussion about how
                        the genres should be implemented in MeRDES.

                           field genre, not in a separate visualization but as tab of the word

                        in the interface. Result snippets are the short summaries of a document, designed
                        to allow users to decide its relevance. Typically, a snippet consists of the

                        fact that the media researcher moved cities and now lived in the same city as the
                        computer scientist’s university campus. They met more regularly, in person, at the

                        At the computer science campus, the media studies scholar also observed how the

                        individual research than humanities researchers are. It made her realize that the
                        individualistic take of humanities is typical for the humanities, and is not
                        necessarily the only way to go about research. She started to see her own
                        situatedness.

                           sine qua</span> for a good, constructive collaboration. In addition, they
                        got acquainted with - for their discipline - rather “exotic”
                        methods: the computer scientist was enthusiastic about the focus group discussions
                        for the tool development and the interviews to grasp the field of Media Studies.
                        The media studies scholar started to see the value of computer sciences for the
                        humanities. She was impressed by the efficiency of computer scientists, e.g. how
                        they communicate and plan, and what they could achieve with technologies and
                        programming. Both researchers started to learn new concepts, to understand the
                        benefits and particularities of the other’s disciplines, and they both firmly
                        believed in their joint project to build new tools for Media Studies researchers.
                        One of the strategies which helped to increase collaboration was meeting more
                        regularly and spending full working days in the same office, which makes it easier
                        to ask questions and consult each other.

                        interface, but this time more qualitative methods were used for testing it. While
                        MeRDES is really suitable for exploration within a single archive, in the last
                        phase, we wanted to develop an interface for contextual research that links
                        several heterogeneous audiovisual collections. We named the interface CoMeRDa
                        (Contextualizing Media Researchers’ Data) (<a href="#figure02">figure 2</a>),
                        and conducted two user studies to test it: a lab study with 44 students and a

                        television program collection (metadatarecords for 700.000 programs, a selection
                        of iMMix); (ii) a photo collection of television programmes; (iii) a wiki

                        collection from 1995 to 2005. The interface has three different tabs: basic search
                        (search in one collection); combined search (search in six collections) and
                        similarity search (search for similar documents across different collections). To
                        test the interface two user studies have been conducted, i.e., one longitudinal

                        information about celebrity X. Collect at least 5 items deemed to be relevant for

                           to point at the true challenge for BRIDGE, in hindsight, it is the fact that
                           as the humanities researcher of the project you have that double function.
                           You have to be so self-reflexive: on the one hand you have to monitor that
                           you are representing a large, diverse group of researchers, while at the
                           same time you have to give feedback on a daily basis and do the research
                           yourself. It was key that we conducted focus group discussions and so many

                        to do to make the tools sustainable (see [<a class="ref" href="#martinezortiz2017">Martinez-Ortiz et al 2017</a>]). But
                        in general, the research conducted in this phase was considered as satisfying for

                        appreciated and understood important aspects of the other discipline. The computer
                        scientist could finish his PhD on time. The media studies scholar did not write a
                        monograph, nor she could conduct research with the tools, as they were only ready
                        when the project was finished. However, she learnt so much about interface
                        development and computer sciences that she included many of the assets of computer
                        sciences in her future humanities work.

                        completion of the project, the media studies researcher started to work on a new
                        project and interface, but from then on based at a computer science department.
                        The computer scientist went in the opposite direction and started to work in a
                        joint history-computer science project, based at a humanities department. The once
                        so “other” discipline was from then on “us”.
                        The researchers did not only meet each other in the middle of the bridge; they
                        even crossed the bridge in institutional terms. Admittedly not for long, as both
                        researchers got career opportunities in the “original”
                        discipline, and at the moment of publication work again in their

                     our
                     research project. We viewed those challenges from two perspectives, by using a
                     conversation structure between the two central staff members of the project. The
                     conversation structure enabled us to write an article from two standpoints, and also
                     to show how our standpoints shifted during the course of the project. As such, we
                     embodied two disciplines, and showed how knowledge claims can be negotiated in the
                     practice of a Digital Humanities research project. The researchers of two disciplines
                     gradually gained mutual understanding.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p79">After setting the scene of both disciplines, we identied three phases in the project.
                     Similar to the common narrative of Hollywood films, there was first an encounter,
                     then a struggle and conflict, and finally appeasement and a
                     “happy” ending. Other research on interdisciplinary projects
                     also found that the first phase of research is considered as “frustrating”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#bartscherer2011">Bartscherer and Coover 2011</a>]. Semantic interoperability, for instance, was a key problem in the first two
                     stages of the project. We showed the frustrations, but also looked at the flipside
                     of
                     them: the semantic gap between the disciplines and the epistemological differences
                     between disciplines often provided inspiration as they were key in lifting the veil
                     of our own situatedness. In other words, we would like to acknowledge frustration
                     as
                     a facilitator of communication and transdisciplinarity.
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p80">80</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p80">The interaction and power relations continuously changed during the course of the
                     project as knowledge at all levels increased. The researchers got more insight in
                     the
                     particularities of the other discipline’s field, thus developing a shared language
                     and increasing semantic interoperability between the members of the production team.
                     The computer scientist said that the slow pace of the humanities research was
                     something they had to adjust to and changed their observation of media studies
                     scholars along the way. The humanities scholar learnt to work with a (more) strict
                     planning and also adopted technical language. In the project, it turned out that both
                     disciplines learned the language of the other’s discipline, e.g. by reading
                     literature, by discussing the disciplinary boundaries on a daily basis, by
                     conversations and (ethnographic-style) observations.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p81">Transdisciplinarity especially arose in the set-up of the user studies. It is in the
                     user studies where epistemological encounters took place between the two disciplines.
                     The user studies are, in other words, the space of negotiation where computer
                     sciences and media studies really crossed. In BRIDGE, the computer scientist took
                     care of the experimental set-up of the user studies, while the media studies scholar
                     supervised the “humanities-stake” of the set-up, the assignments
                     and the questionnaires for the humanities users. Moreover, the team conducted focus
                     groups and interviews with prospective users, bringing qualitative, ethnographic
                     methods into the common quantitative practice of computer scientists. It not only
                     helped to learn about the other’s discipline, but also added an interpretative layer
                     to the quantitative results. Especially in the user study with CoMeRDa, in which the
                     team used a laboratory study next to a qualitative study, the merits of a
                     triangulation of methods came to the fore. Vice versa, the media studies researcher
                     gained insight in the development of a tool and learn about the specificities of
                     developing digital tools for media studies.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p82">The most important facilitators of the interface development, too, were the regular
                     contact and interviews with the users, the group of media researchers. During the
                     development of the tool, the users could direct the developers to desirable
                     functionalities and the use of understandable labels. The interfaces MeRDES and
                     CoMeRDa could not have been made without the encounter of the two disciplines, and
                     the continuous negotiation between both. BRIDGE proved not only to build bridges
                     between nodes of a television archive, but also between researchers and disciplines:
                     a true actor-network in a Latourian sense. Extending the network from two researchers
                     who collaborate (i.c. a computer scientist and a media studies scholar) to many
                     scholars was one of the key success factors of the project.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p83">The project required both the computer science researcher and the humanities
                     researcher to learn about the tools, techniques, and methodological practices of the
                     other discipline and find a common research direction in which the strengths of both
                     disciplines could be utilized. This required not only effort in becoming adept at
                     another discipline’s practices but also overcoming a psychological barrier, i.e.,
                     abandoning something you are good at to become an apprentice in another field. These,
                     together with the misunderstandings and frustrations that accompany co-operating with
                     someone with a different background, are obstacles which should not be
                     underestimated, especially with regards to the (anxieties about) careers of the
                     researchers involved. Institutions, therefore, play a vital role in the enhancement
                     of Digital Humanities and should carefully look at the assessment procedures for
                     tenure, and specifically the assessment of digital publications such as tools and
                     databases.

                     least being able to move in between the different spaces so as to support an
                     understanding of each other’s discourses. As [<a class="ref" href="#bakhshi2009">Bakhshi et al 2009</a>, 2]
                     point out, this is of vital importance for effective interaction and a condition for
                     innovation, no matter how complex the network of actors for such innovative
                     performance is. [<a class="ref" href="#bartscherer2011">Bartscherer and Coover 2011</a>] state that there is an increasing
                     number of individuals who have real competence in both domains, but that these are
                     rare. What we want to stress is that there is still a lot of scholarship needed on
                     user-centred tool development and on methods for digital tool-education such as the
                     training of Digital Tool Criticism within the humanities.

                     initially distanced in terms of paradigms and distanced in terms of physical
                     presence. E-mail conversations were bound to end up in conflicts. Working in the same
                     space, or at least having regular meetings or conversations, is essential for a good
                     progress of the project. This is simple advice, but highly effective.

                     outlets are centered in one or the other field, it remains a true challenge to write
                     for a journal of which the format, language and paradigms are not yours. Even with
                     this article it is admittedly the humanities scholar who chose the constructionist
                     theoretical framework and approach. The conversation structure was used as it allowed
                     us to cope with the different paradigms and the different voices of the authors.
                     Still, it was quite a challenge to write this article from two perspectives in terms
                     of words and style.

                     be necessary to conduct individuel interviews or focus groups with all participants
                     throughout the project and document these carefully. For long-term projects, the
                     problem might be that participants leave the project or (re)join which makes it
                     difficult to write a joint article and to keep track of all different voices in the
                     article. In any case, we advise DH-projects to document their collaboration and have
                     (at least) annual meta-discussions about each other and the project.

                     difficult but even impossible to write this article during the course of the project.
                     By that time, we were pre-occupied with reaching our goals, developing the tools on
                     time, setting up the user studies and writing up the papers. Only now can we look
                     back at BRIDGE and reflect on the persons we were in the beginning of the project.
                     We
                     are aware of the fact that in this article we are open about our own
                     “selves” and attitudes during the project. However, we firmly
                     believe that transparency is not only key to research methods and digital tools but
                     also to scholarship as such. Disciplinary-defined clouds keep on mystifying poles.
                     We
                     have built a bridge, walked on it, but are still attracted to the end of the pole
                     we
                     were educated in. So, the happy end of the project is rather an open ending. Digital
                     Humanities, therefore, is not so much about the results (“how does the movie
                     end?”) but about acknowledging that it is a process of which all elements — the
                     researchers, the interfaces, the methods and the semantics — are interconnected and
                     can view and be viewed from multiple perspectives.
