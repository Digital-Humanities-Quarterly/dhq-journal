        <p>The ANTRACT project is a cross-disciplinary apparatus dedicated to the analysis of the
          French newsreel company <title rend="italic">Les Actualités Françaises</title> (1945-1969)
          and its film productions. Founded during the liberation of France, this state-owned
          company filmed more than 20,000 news reports shown in French cinemas and throughout the
          world over its 24 years of activity. The project brings together research organizations
          with a dual historical and technological perspective. ANTRACT's goal is to study the
          production process, the film content, the way historical events are represented and the
          audience reception of <title rend="italic">Les Actualités Françaises</title> newsreels
          using innovative AI-based data processing tools developed by partners specialized in
          image, audio, and text analysis. This article focuses on the data processing apparatus and
          tools of the project. Automatic content analysis is used to select data, to segment video
          units and typescript images, and to align them with their archival description. Automatic
          speech recognition provides a textual representation and natural language processing can
          extract named entities from the voice-over recording; automatic visual analysis is applied
          to detect and recognize faces of well-known characters in videos. These multifaceted data
          can then be queried and explored with the TXM text-mining platform. The results of these
          automatic analysis processes are feeding the Okapi platform, a client-server software that
          integrates documentation, information retrieval, and hypermedia capabilities within a
          single environment based on the Semantic Web standards. The complete corpus of <title
            rend="italic">Les Actualités Françaises</title>, enriched with data and metadata, will
          be made available to the scientific community by the end of the project.</p>

        <head>1. Implementing a Transdisciplinary Research Apparatus on a Film Archive Collection:
          Opportunities and Challenges</head>
        <p>The ANTRACT<note>ANTRACT: ANalyse TRansdisciplinaire des ACTualités filmées
            (1945-1969).</note> project brings together research organizations with a dual
          historical and technological perspective, hence the reference to the transdisciplinary in
          the project's name. It applies to a collection of 1262 newsreels (mostly black and white
          footage) shown in French movie theaters between 1945 and 1969. These programs were
          produced by <title rend="italic">Les Actualités Françaises</title> newsreel company during
          the French <title rend="italic">Trente Glorieuses</title> era. The project develops
          automated tools well suited to analyze these documents: automatic speech recognition,
          image classification, facial recognition, natural language processing, and text mining.
          This software is used to produce metadata and to help organize media files and
          documentation resources (i.e. titles, summaries, keywords, participants, etc.) into a
          manageable and coherent corpus usable within a dedicated online platform.</p>
        <p>Working together on these newsreels divided into 20,232 news reports, ANTRACT historians
          and computer scientists collaborate to optimize the research on large audiovisual corpora
          through the following questions:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
          <item>What is the best technological approach to the systematic and exhaustive study of a
            multimedia archive collection?</item>
          <item>What instruments can compile, analyze and crosscheck the data extracted from such
            documents?</item>
          <item>Can these extracted data be combined and integrated into versatile user
            interfaces?</item>
          <item>Can they provide new opportunities to humanities research projects through their
            assistance in the processing of numerous multi-format sources?</item>
        </list>
        <p>In order to implement a strong cooperation between AI experts and history scholars <ptr
            target="#deegan2012"/>, the key objective of the project is to provide scholars and
          media professionals working on extensive collections of film archives with an innovative
          research methodology fit to address the technological and historical questions raised by
          this particular corpus.</p>
        <p><strong>From a technological perspective</strong>, the goal is to adapt automatic
          analysis tools to the specificity of the <title rend="italic">Actualités
            Françaises</title> corpus, i.e. its historical context, vocabulary, image type. Adapting
          the language models used by the automatic transcription tools with the help of the
          typescripts of voice overs underlines this orientation. As a film collection including
          footage, sound and text produced more than half a century ago, <title rend="italic">Les
            Actualités Françaises</title> corpus presents an unprecedented challenge to instruments
          specialized in audiovisual content extraction and identification. Far from separately
          considering a social and cultural history of cinema on the one hand, and the use of
          automatic analysis tools on the other hand, the project aims to link the two. Thus, a good
          understanding of the technical conditions for recording the audio leads to improved audio
          recognition. Shot in black and white with limited equipment and often under difficult
          filming conditions, these old newsreels do not meet the quality standards set by the high
          definition video and audio recordings feeding today's image and speech recognition
          algorithms. Moreover, several film reels of the collection digitized under high
          compression formats show pixelated images that cannot be processed by analysis programs
          and some of the commentary typescripts display printing defects caused by the typewriters
          used for their production.</p>
        <p>Along with these material obstacles comes the problem raised by the transfiguration of
          film content over time. This is the case for leading figures regularly filmed by the
          company's cameramen throughout its 24 years of activity. It is also the case for the
          recurring topographical data caught on their film. The automatic identification of these
          ever-changing elements recorded on monochromatic footage requires a considerable amount of
          resources. As part of this process, ANTRACT historians have selected a sample of the most
          distinctive representations of notable characters present in <title rend="italic">Les
            Actualités Françaises</title> newsreels in order to build a series of extraction
          models.</p>
        <p><strong>From an historical perspective</strong>, ANTRACT aims to approach topics beyond
          the notion of newsreels as a wartime media subjected to state censorship and political
          ambitions <ptr target="#atkinson2011"/>
          <ptr target="#bartels2004"/>
          <ptr target="#pozner2008"/>
          <ptr target="#veray1995"/>. In the wake of existing studies, one of its primary objectives
          is to extend the historical scope of the cinematographic press to question its role as a
          vector of social, political and cultural history shaping the opinion of the public during
          the second half of the 20th century <ptr target="#fein2004"/>
          <ptr target="#fein2008"/>
          <ptr target="#althaus2018"/>
          <ptr target="#chambers2018"/>
          <ptr target="#imesch2016"/>
          <ptr target="#lindeperg2000"/>
          <ptr target="#lindeperg2008"/>. This series of cinematographic documents is not the only
          legacy left by a newsreel company which witnessed world history from the liberation of
          France to the late 1960's. The dope sheets filled out by its cameramen, the written
          commentaries of its journalists and the records left by its management give us rare
          insight into the content of a film collection as well as its production process. Despite
          its historical value, <title rend="italic">Les Actualités Françaises</title> corpus has
          eluded a thorough examination of its entire content. Scattered across different
          inventories, the numerous films, audio records and typescripts produced by the newsreel
          company have forestalled such a project. In this regard, the challenge presented by an
          exhaustive study of <title rend="italic">Les Actualités Françaises</title> is similar to
          those of other abundant multi-format collections and inspires a recurring question
          regarding their approach: how can one identify and index thousands of hours of film
          archives associated with hundreds of text files produced over an extended period of time?
          The tools developed by the consortium partners working on the project are intended to cast
          a new light on the French company newsreels through the combined treatment of data
          extracted from its whole collection and correlatively studied on the Okapi and TXM
          platforms. This apparatus should open new semantic fields previously overlooked by the
          fragmentary research conducted on specific inventories of the company records. Focused on
          film content, the project is also committed to scrutinize the production process and the
          different trades involved in the making of <title rend="italic">Les Actualités
            Françaises</title> newsreels emphasizing the political and economic background of a

          events <ptr target="#goetschel2011"/>, this dual analysis - both technological and
          historical - will be completed with the study of the public reception of these weekly
          journals in light of its request patterns, i.e. audience expectation for sensational and

        <p>Through audio and video analysis tools dedicated to corpus building and enrichment
          (section 2) and platforms for historical interactive analysis (section 3), this article
          presents the results from the first phase of the project, which sets the focus on the
          technological side of the research, specifically its data processing apparatus and tools.
          Nevertheless, historians are involved in most of these computational preliminary steps, by
          contributing to the implementation and testing tasks. At the same time, we explore
          temporary results of historical investigations, while the full potential for historical
          studies will be developed in the forthcoming second phase of the project that will be
          addressed in a follow-up article.</p>

        <head>2.1 Organization of the video corpus with automatic content analysis
          technologies</head>
        <p>Automatic content analysis technologies are used to obtain the most consistent, complete
          and homogeneous corpus as possible, allowing historians to easily search and navigate
          through the documents (digitized films, documentation notes and typescripts). When
          considering that the whole archive would not be relevant, a preliminary step was to
          realize that for some tasks, we had to define how our corpus would be composed and
          structured. One cannot just input the data into the computer and see what happens. For
          instance, textometric analysis would be hindered if all the available videos were kept,
          because of numerous duplicates which would artificially inflate word frequencies.
          Duplicates could be due to either multiple copies of a single news report, or to the use
          of the same report in several regional editions. As a collaborative decision involving
          newsreel experts, corpus analysis researchers, and historians, ANTRACT's main corpus was
          restricted to the collection of all national issues of <title rend="italic">Les Actualités
            Françaises</title> newsreels, each issue being composed of topical report sub-units.
          Then, the next goal was:</p>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>to get a corpus made of exactly one digital video file by edition (which was a
            requisite condition for TXM data import, see Section 3.1),</item>
          <item>to get archival descriptions of the reports temporally linked to these files, as an
            edition is made of a succession of reports.</item>
        </list>
        <p>This led us to take the following actions:</p>
        <list type="ordered">
          <item>physically segment video files initially coming from the digitization of film reels,
            so that each file contains exactly one edition, starting at timecode 0.</item>
          <item>keep only archival descriptions linked to either one edition or one report included
            in one of the editions, namely <soCalled>summary</soCalled> and
              <soCalled>report</soCalled> archival descriptions. Thus, archival descriptions
            corresponding to other content, such as rushes or unused material, called
              <soCalled>isolated</soCalled> archival descriptions were discarded. Around 10,700
            archival descriptions have thus been kept in this first version of the corpus.</item>
        </list>
        <p>The remaining of this section explains how automatic analysis has been used to temporally
          synchronize archival descriptions with digital video files.</p>
        <p><strong>Segmentation of reports</strong>. Each one of the 1,200 editions of the newsreels
          corresponds to more than one digital video file, either because several digitized copies
          of one given edition exist in the collection, or because the film has been digitized
          several times, for quality reasons for instance. When they exist, timecodes of archival
          descriptions may refer to one or the other digital video file. One objective is to get all
          archival descriptions of one edition referring to the same video file, with timecodes.
          About 9,500 out of 10,700 archival descriptions have timecodes referring to the video file
          of the whole edition, which left around 1,200 archival descriptions to manage. A report
          with timecode is called <soCalled>segmented</soCalled>. One important step is to segment
          each edition into its constitutive reports, by detecting report boundaries. In most cases,
          reports are separated by black images, easily detected by simple image analysis methods
          (the <emph>ffmpeg</emph> video library offers an efficient
            <soCalled>blackdetect</soCalled> option for instance). Reports may also be separated by
          sequences of a few frames to a few seconds of a motion blur shot by a camera, used as a
          syntactic punctuation. In some cases, when these sequences are long enough, they can be
          detected as a simple threshold on the horizontal dimension of the optical flow, computed
          with existing algorithms such as OpenCV <ptr target="#bradski2000"/>. A more robust
          detection method is still under development using machine learning algorithms.</p>
        <p><strong>Transfer of timecodes.</strong> When timecodes refer to a video file different
          from the main video file, timecodes on the main file may be computed using copy detection
          techniques. The principle is illustrated by <ref target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>. In the
          figure, reports on <soCalled>Rugby</soCalled> and <soCalled>Kennedy's visit</soCalled>
          (from the edition of May 31st, 1961) refer to two video files, both distinct from the
          video file corresponding to the whole edition. To identify the location of the reports
          within the main video file, we used the audio and video copy detection method based on
          fingerprinting methods developed at INA <ptr target="#chenot2014"/>, eventually allowing
          the transfer of timecodes for more than 800 reports.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head>Transfer of archival description timecodes.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Timecoding reports using transcripts.</strong> We tried to identify the temporal
          boundaries of the remaining 400 <emph>unsegmented</emph> remaining reports by comparing
          the text coming from corresponding archival descriptions (title + summary + keywords for
          instance), with the automatic speech transcription (ASR) of segments of the video file not
          already corresponding to one report (see Section 2.3). Simple similarity text measures
          such as the Jaccard distance, or <emph>ratio</emph> metrics in the Fuzzywuzzy Python
          package give encouraging but not entirely satisfying results. We plan to use a
          corpus-specific <emph>TF-IDF</emph> measure, or embedding methods such as word2vec or BERT
          in the future.</p>

      <div>
        <head>2.2 Typescripts: from page scans to structured textual data</head>
        <p>Typescripts of the voice-overs have been linked to books and typescripts of each edition
          and separated with pages giving the summary of the edition (see <ref target="#figure02"
            >Figure 2</ref>). This represents around 9,000 pages. At the beginning of the project,
          these documents were scanned in a good quality format (TIFF, color, 400 dpi). An optical
          character recognition (OCR) tool has thus been applied (Google Vision API in
            <soCalled>Document</soCalled> mode), giving spatially-located digital texts.</p>
        <p>Once digitized, typescripts have to be separated from summaries. In order to achieve
          that, an automatic classifier has been trained by specializing the state-of-the-art
          Inception V3 classifier <ptr target="#szegedy2016"/> with a few manually chosen examples.
          This gave about 2<strong>,</strong>600 pages of summaries and 6,400 pages of
          voice-overs.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure02">
          <head>Typescripts of voice-overs and summaries.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>Spatial and temporal alignment of transcripts</strong>. The objective of this
          alignment is to associate each report with the corresponding section of the typescripts.
          The available metadata allows processing this alignment year by year. This operation is
          done in two stages, by using on the one hand the result of the automatic speech
          transcription of the voice-over from the video files, and by using on the other hand the
          result of the OCR of the typescripts. The first step is done by minimizing a comparison
          measure between strings in order to find for each subject the corresponding typescripts
          page. The <emph>partial ratio</emph> method of the Fuzzywuzzy Python package allows
          looking for a partial inclusion of the speech-to-text into the OCR. Since topics and pages
          are approximately chronological, exhaustive searching is not required. The second step
          consists in spatially locating the text of the voice-over in the corresponding typescript
          page. For that, we use the alignment given by the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW),
          slightly modified to overcome the anchoring at the ends of the found path. The typescript
          area thus identified in the output of the OCR makes it possible to obtain the spatial
          coordinates of the commentary in the typewritten page. However, the method used does not
          allow locating transcripts overlapping over two pages. Additional treatment should be
          considered, for instance in order to get aligned text units for textometric analysis (see
          section 3.1).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>2.3 Automatic audio analysis</head>
        <p>The work on the audio part consists in detecting the speakers, transcribing speech into
          words (ASR) and detecting named entities (NE) using the systems we have developed for
          contemporary radio and television news.</p>
        <p>Audio analysis of an old data set is an interesting challenge for automatic analysis
          systems. The recording devices used between 1945 and 1969 are very different from today's
          analog or digital devices. 35-mm films, which contain both sound and image, deteriorated
          before being digitized in the 2000s. Moreover, the acoustic and language models are
          generally trained on data produced between 1998 and 2012. This 50-year time gap has
          consequences on the system's performance.</p>
        <p>Technically, acoustic models for ASR and speakers were trained on about 300 hours drawn
          from several sources of French TV and radiophonic broadcast news<note>ESTER 1 &amp; 2,
            EPAC, ETAPE, and REPERE corpus available in ELRA catalogues (<ref
              target="http://www.elra.info/">http://www.elra.info/</ref>)</note> with manual
          transcripts. The ASR language models were trained on these manual transcripts, French
          newspapers, news websites, Google news and the French GigaWord corpus, for a total of 1.6
          billion words. The vocabulary of the language model contains the 160k most frequent words.
          The NE models were trained only on a subset of manual transcripts<note>ETAPE, and QUAERO
            corpus available in ELRA catalogues (<ref target="http://www.elra.info/"
              >http://www.elra.info/</ref>).</note>.</p>
        <p>Prior to the transcription process, the signal is cut into homogeneous speech segments
          and grouped by speakers. We refer to this process as the Speaker Diarization task. Speaker
          Diarization is first applied at the edition level, where each video record is separately
          processed. Then, the process is applied at the collection level, over all the 1,200
          editions, in order to link the recurrent speakers. The system is based on the LIUM S4D
          toolkit <ptr target="#broux2018"/>, which has been developed to provide homogeneous speech
          segments and accurate segment boundaries. Purity and coverage of the speaker clusters are
          also one of the main objectives. The system is composed of acoustic metric-based
          segmentation and clustering followed by an i-vector-based clustering applied to both
          edition and collection levels.</p>
        <p>The ASR system is developed using the Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit <ptr
            target="#povey2011"/>. Acoustic models are trained using a Deep Neural Network which can
          effectively deal with long temporal contexts with training times comparable to standard
          feed-forward DNNs (chain-TDNN <ptr target="#povey2016"/>). Generic 3 and 4-gram language
          models, which allow users to compute the probability of emitting one word knowing a
          history of 2 or 3 words, were also trained and used during decoding. To help the reading,
          two sequence labeling systems (Conditional Random Field models) have been trained over
          manual transcripts to add punctuation and upper-case letters respectively.</p>
        <p>The NE system, based on the <ref target="https://github.com/XuezheMax/NeuroNLP2"
            >NeuroNLP</ref> toolkit, helps the text analysis. The manually annotated transcripts are
          used to train a text-to-text sequence labeling system. The system detects eight main
          entity types: amount, event, function, location, organization, person, product and
          time.</p>
        <p>ASR was performed on the full collection of 1,200 national editions in order to feed
          Okapi and TXM platforms for historians' analyses (see Section 3): about 300 hours of
          video, resulting in more than 1.5 million words. A subset of 12 editions from 1945 to 1969
          were manually transcribed to evaluate the audio analysis systems. Due to the 50-year time
          gap, human annotators had some difficulties with the spelling of NE, especially regarding
          people and foreign NE. Thanks to Wikipedia and INA thesaurus, most of NEs have been
          checked. However, speakers are very hard to identify. Most of them are male voice-overs.
          Their faces are never seen and their names are rarely spoken, nor displayed on the images.
          Only journalists performing interviews and well-known people, such as politicians,
          athletes and celebrities, can be accurately identified and named.</p>
        <p>The quality of an ASR system is evaluated using the so-called Word Error Rate (WER). This
          metric consists of counting the number of insertions, deletions and substitutions of words
          between the transcripts automatically generated by the ASR and the human transcripts
          considered as an oracle. The WER is 24.27% on ANTRACT data using the generic ASR system
          trained on modern data. The same system evaluated on 2010 data<note>Challenge REPERE, test
            data.</note> achieves 13.46%. It is known that ASR systems are sensitive to acoustic and
          language variations between train corpus and test corpus. Here, the WER is almost double.
          It is generally difficult to exploit transcripts in a robust way when WER is above 30%.
          Most of the errors come from unknown words (which are not listed in the 160k vocabulary).
          These out of vocabulary words (OOV) are confused with acoustically close words, which have
          a negative impact on neighboring words. The system always selects the most likely word
          sequence containing the word replacing the OOV.</p>
        <p>Additional contemporary data, such as archival descriptions and typescripts, would be
          useful to adapt the language model. Therefore, abstracts, titles and descriptions have
          been extracted from the archival descriptions. OCR sentences (see Section 2.2) have been
          kept when at least 95% of the words belong to the ASR vocabulary. An <soCalled>in
            domain</soCalled> training corpus composed of 1.3 million words from archival
          descriptions and 4.7 million words from typescripts was built. The 4,000 most frequent
          words were selected to train the new ANTRACT language model, which reduces the error rate
          by half: from 24.27% to 12.06% WER. <ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> shows a sample
          of automatic transcription of the July 14, 1955 edition. The gain is significant thanks to
          the typescripts which are very similar to manual transcriptions. This <soCalled>in
            domain</soCalled> training corpus is contrary to the rules usually set during the
          well-known ASR system evaluations: a test data set should never be used to build a
          training corpus. However, in our case, the main goal is to provide the best transcripts to
          historians.</p>
        <p>Future work will focus on ASR acoustic models improvement. We plan to use an alignment of
          typescripts with the editions, as well as historian users' feedback providing some
          manually revised transcriptions. The objective is to select zones of confidence to be
          added to the learning data. Evaluation of the Named Entities is the next step in the
          roadmap. The speaker evaluation will be more difficult because of their identities, which
          are not available. We plan to evaluate both the detection of voice-overs and interviewers.
          Furthermore, some famous persons, selected in collaboration with historians for their
          relevance in historical analyses, will also be identified, with the possible help of
          crossing results with image analysis as described in Section 2.4.</p>

        <p>Identifying the people appearing in a video is undoubtedly an important cue for its
          understanding. Knowing who appears in a video, when and where, can also lead to learning
          interesting patterns of relationships among characters for historical research. Such
          person-related annotations could provide ground for value added content. An historical
          archive such as the <title rend="italic">Actualités Françaises</title> corpus contains
          numerous examples of celebrities appearing in the same news segment as De Gaulle and
          Adenauer (see <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>). However, the annotations produced
          manually by archivists do not always identify with precision those individuals in the
          videos. On the other side, the web offers an important number of pictures of those
          persons, easily accessible through Search Engines using their full name as search terms.
          In ANTRACT, we aim to leverage these pictures for identifying faces of celebrities in
          video archives.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure04">
          <head>De Gaulle and Adenauer together in a video from 1959.</head>

        </figure>
        <p>There has been much progress in the last decade regarding the process of automatic
          recognition of people. It generally includes two steps: first, the faces need to be
          detected (i.e. which region of the frame may contain a person face) and then recognized
          (i.e. to which person this face belongs to).</p>
        <p>The Viola-Jones algorithm <ptr target="#viola2004"/> for face detection and Local Binary
          Pattern (LBP) features <ptr target="#ahonen2006"/> for the clustering and recognition of
          faces were the most famous techniques used until the advent of deep learning and
          convolutional neural networks (CNN). Nowadays, two main approaches are in use to detect
          faces in video and both are using CNNs. The Dlib library <ptr target="#king2009"/>
          provides good performance for frontal images but it requires an additional alignment step
          (which can also be performed using the Dlib library) before face recognition can be
          performed. The recent Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) approach provides
          even better performance using an image-pyramid approach and integrates the detection of
          face landmarks in order to re-align detected faces to the frontal position <ptr
            target="#zhang2016"/>.</p>
        <p>Having located the position and orientation of the faces in the video images, the
          recognition process can be performed in good conditions. Several strategies have been
          detailed in the literature to achieve recognition. Currently, the most practical approach
          is to perform face comparison using a transformation space in which similar faces are
          close together, and to use this representation to identify the right person. Such
          embeddings, computed on a large collection of faces, are often available to the research
          community <ptr target="#schroff2015"/>.</p>
        <p>Within ANTRACT, we developed an open source Face Celebrity Recognition system. This
          application is made of the following modules:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
          <item>A web crawler which, given a person's name, automatically downloads from Google a
            set of k photos that will be used for training a particular face model. In our
            experiments, we generally use k = 50. Among the results, the images not containing any
            face or containing more than one face are discarded. In addition, end users (e.g. domain
            experts) can manually exclude wrong results, for example, corresponding to pictures that
            do not represent the searched person.</item>
          <item>A training module where the retrieved photos can be converted to black-and-white,
            cropped and resized in order to obtain images only containing a face, using the MTCNN
            algorithm <ptr target="#zhang2016"/>. A pre-trained Facenet <ptr target="#schroff2015"/>
            model with Inception ResNet v1 architecture trained on VGGFace2dataset <ptr
              target="#cao2018"/> is applied in order to extract visual features of the faces. The
            embeddings are used to train an SVM classifier.</item>
          <item>A recognition module where a newsreel video is received as input and from which all
            frames are extracted at a given skipping distance <emph>d</emph> (in our experiments, we
            generally set <emph>d</emph> = 25, namely 1 sample frame per second). For each frame,
            the faces are detected (using the MTCNN algorithm) and the embeddings computed
            (Facenet). The SVM classifier decides if the face matches the ones among the training
            images.</item>
          <item>Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) is an object tracking algorithm, which
            can track multiple objects in real-time <ptr target="#bewley2016"/>. Its implementation
            is inspired by the suggestion code from <ref
              target="https://github.com/Linzaer/Face-Track-Detect-Extract">Linzaer</ref>. The
            algorithm uses the MTCNN bounding box detection and tracks it across frames. We
            introduced this module to increase the robustness of the library. By introducing this
            module, while making the assumption that faces do not swap coordinates across
            consecutive frames, we aim to get a more consistent prediction.</item>
          <item>Finally, the last module groups together the results coming from the classifier and
            the tracking modules. We observe that even though the face to recognize remains the same
            over consecutive frames, the face prediction sometimes changes. For this reason, we
            select for each tracking the most frequently occurring prediction, taking also into
            account the confidence score given by the classifier. In this way, the system provides a
            common prediction for all the frames involved in a tracking, together with an aggregated
            confidence score. A threshold <emph>t</emph> can be applied to this score in order to
            discard the low-confidence prediction. According to our experiments, t = 0.6 gives a
            good balance between precision and recall.</item>
        </list>
        <p>In order to make the software available as a service, we wrapped it into a RESTful web
          API, available at <ref target="http://facerec.eurecom.fr/"
            >http://facerec.eurecom.fr/</ref>. The service receives as input the URI of a video
          resource, as it appears in Okapi, from which it retrieves the media object encoded in
          MPEG-4. Two output formats are supported: a custom JSON format and a serialization format
          in RDF using the Turtle syntax and the Media Fragment URI syntax <ptr target="#troncy2012"
          />, with normal play time (<emph>npt</emph>) expressed in seconds to identify temporal
          fragments and <emph>xywh</emph> coordinates to identify the bounding box rectangle
          encompassing the face in the frame. A third format, again following the Turtle syntax,
          will be soon implemented so that the results can be directly integrated in the Okapi
          Knowledge Graph. A light cache system is also provided in order to enable serving
          pre-computed results, unless the no cache parameter is set which is triggering a new
          analysis process.</p>
        <p>We run experiments using the face model of Dwight D. Eisenhower on a selection of video
          segments extracted from Okapi, among the ones that have been annotated with the presence
          of the American president using the <soCalled>ina:imageContient</soCalled> and
            <soCalled>ina:aPourParticipant</soCalled> properties in the knowledge graph. In the
          absence of a ground truth, we performed a qualitative analysis of our system on three
          videos. For each detected person, we manually assessed whether the correct person was
          found or not. Out of the 90 selected segments, the system correctly identified Eisenhower
          in 33 of them. However, we are not sure that Eisenhower is effectively visually present in
          all 90 segments. We are currently working on extracting from the ANTRACT corpus a set of
          annotated segments to be used as ground truth so that it is possible to measure the
          precision and recall of the system.</p>
        <p>In addition, we made the following observations:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
          <item>The library generally fails in detecting people when they are in the background, or
            when the face is occluded.</item>
          <item>When faces are perfectly aligned, they are easier to detect. Improvements on the
            alignment algorithm are foreseen as future work.</item>
          <item>When setting a high confidence threshold, we do not encounter cases where we confuse
            one celebrity by another one. Most errors are about confusing an unknown face with a
            celebrity in the dataset.</item>
        </list>
        <p>In order to easily visualize the results and to facilitate history scholars' feedback, we
          developed a web application that shows the results directly on the video, leveraging on
          HTML5 features. The application also provides a summary of the different predictions,
          enabling the user to directly jump to the relative part of the video where the celebrity
          appears. A slider allows changing the confidence threshold value, in order to better
          investigate the low-confidence results.</p>
        <p>The application is publicly available at <ref

        <p>The corpus built with automatic tools in section 2 is explored interactively by
          historians using two platforms:</p>
        <list type="unordered">
          <item>the TXM platform for analysis of text corpora based on quantitative and qualitative
            exploration tools, and augmented during the ANTRACT project to facilitate the link
            between textual data and audio and video data;</item>
          <item>the Okapi knowledge-driven platform for the management and annotation of video

        <div>
          <head>3.1 The TXM platform for interactive textometric analysis</head>
          <p>Text analysis is achieved through a textometric approach <ptr target="#lebart1998"/>.
            Textometry combines both quantitative statistical tools and qualitative text searching,
            reading and annotating. On the one hand, statistical functionalities include keyword
            analysis, collocations, clustering and correspondence analysis. This makes a significant
            analytical power addition in comparison with usual annotation and search &amp; count
            features in audiovisual transcription software such as CLAN <ptr
              target="#macwhinney2000"/> or ELAN <ptr target="#elan2018"/>. On the other hand, yet
            again in the textometric approach, qualitative analysis is carried out by advanced KWIC
            concordancing, by placing an emphasis on easy-access to high quality of layout rendering
            of source documents and by providing annotation tools. Such a qualitative side is
            marginal if not absent in conventional text mining applications <ptr target="#hotho2005"/>
            <ptr target="#feinerer2008"/>
            <ptr target="#weiss2015"/>: most of them process plain text, getting rid of text body
            markup, if any, and aim at synthetic visualization displacing close text reading.</p>
          <p>Textometry is implemented by the TXM software platform <ptr target="#heiden2010"/>. TXM
            is produced as an open-source software, which integrates several specialized components:
            R <ptr target="#r2014"/> for statistical modeling, CQP for full text search engine <ptr
              target="#christ1994"/>, TreeTagger <ptr target="#schmid1994"/> for Natural Language
            Processing (morphosyntactic tagging and lemmatization). TXM is committed to data and
            software standardization and sharing efforts, and has notably be designed to manage
            richly-encoded corpora, such as XML data and TEI<note>Text Encoding Initiative, <ref
                target="https://tei-c.org">https://tei-c.org</ref></note> encoded texts; for ANTRACT
            textual data, TXM imports tabulated data (Excel format export of tables from INA
            documentary databases) and files in the Transcriber XML format provided by
            speech-to-text software (see Section 2.3). TXM is dedicated to text analysis, but also
            helps to manage multimedia representations associated with the texts, whether it is
            scanned images of source material, audio or video recordings: actually, these
            representations participate in the interpretation of TXM common tools results in their
            full semiotic context.</p>
          <p>In 2018, we began to build the AFNOTICES TXM corpus by importing the INA archival
            descriptions: each news report is represented by several textual fields (title,
            abstract, sequence description) and several lexical fields (keyword lists of different
            types such as topics, people, or places, and credits with names of people shown or
            cameramen) and labeled by a dozen metadata (identifier, broadcast date, film producer,
            film genre, etc.) which are useful to contextualize or categorize reports.</p>
          <p>In 2019, we began the production of the AFVOIXOFFV02 TXM corpus which makes the
            voice-over transcripts (see Section 2.3) searchable and available for statistical
            analysis, synchronized at the word level for video playback and labeled by INA
            documentary fields.</p>
          <p>These corpora may still be augmented by aligning new textual modalities: texts from
            narration typescripts (OCR text and corresponding regions in the page images) (see
            Section 2.2), annotations on videos (manual annotations added by historians through the
            Okapi platform) (see Section 3.2), as well as automatic annotations generated by image
            recognition software (see Section 2.4), named entities, etc.</p>
          <p>One of the technical innovations achieved for the project has been the consolidation of
            TXM back-to-media component <ptr target="#pincemin2020"/>, so that any word or text
            passage found in the result of a textometric tool can be played with its original video;
            we have also implemented authenticated streamed access to video content from the Okapi
            media server, which happened to be a key development for video access given the total
            physical size and the security constraints of such film archive data.</p>
          <p>The following screenshots illustrate typical textometric analysis moments of current
            studies within the ANTRACT project.</p>
          <p>In <ref target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref> and <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref>,
            we study the context of use for the word <soCalled>foule</soCalled> (crowd), through a
            KWIC concordance. A double-click on a concordance line opens up a new window (on the
            right-hand side) which displays the complete transcript in which the word occurs. Then,
            we click on the music note symbol at the beginning of the paragraph to play the
            corresponding video. A dialog box prompts for credentials before accessing the video on
            the Okapi online server. This opportunity to confront textual analysis with the
            audiovisual source is all the more important here because textual data were generated by
            the speech-to-text automatic component, whose output could not be fully revised.
            Moreover, the video may add significant context that is not rendered in plain text
            transcription.</p>

          <p>Our second example is about the place of agriculture and farmers in the <title
              rend="italic">Actualités françaises</title>, and how the topic is presented. It shows
            how one can investigate if a given word has the same meaning in documentation and in
            commentary, or if different words are used when dealing with the same subject. We first
            get (<ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>) a comparative overview of the quantitative
            evolution of occurrences from two word families, derived from the stems of
              <soCalled>paysan</soCalled>and <soCalled>agricole</soCalled>/
              <soCalled>agriculture</soCalled> (see detailed list of words in <ref
              target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>, left hand side window). We complete the analysis
            with contextual analysis through KWIC concordance views (see <ref target="#figure08"
              >Figure 8</ref>, lower window) and cooccurrences computing (see <ref
              target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref>). We notice that <soCalled>paysan</soCalled> becomes
            less used from 1952 onwards, and that it is preferred to
              <soCalled>agriculteur</soCalled> when speaking of the individuals present in the
            newsreels extracts; conversely,
              <soCalled>agricole</soCalled>/<soCalled>agriculture</soCalled> are used in a more
            abstract way, to deal with new farm equipment and socio-economic transformation of this
            line of business.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Combining word lists (INDEX) and morphosyntactic information is very effective to
            summarize phrasal contexts. For instance, in <ref target="#figure08">Figure 8</ref>, we
            can compare which adjectives qualify <soCalled>foule</soCalled> in the archival
            descriptions, and which ones qualify <soCalled>foule</soCalled> in the voice-over
            speeches. For a given phrase (<soCalled>foule immense</soCalled>, huge crowd) in the
            voice-over, we compute its cooccurrences in order to identify in which kind of
            circumstances the phrase is preferred (funerals, religious meetings). In TXM, full-text
            search is powered by the extensive CQP search engine <ptr target="#christ1994"/>, which
            allows very fine-tuned and contextualized queries.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>For chronological investigations, we can divide the corpus into time periods in a very
            flexible way, such as years or groups of years. Any encoded information may be used to
            build corpus subdivisions. Then the SPECIFICITY command －that implements a Fisher's
            Exact Test, known as one of the best calculations to find keywords <ptr
              target="#mcenery2012"/>－ statistically measures the steady use, or the singular
            overuse or underuse of any word. The function can also be used to bring to light the
            specific terms for a given period, or for any given part of the corpus. For example,
              <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref> focuses on the word <soCalled>foule</soCalled>
            over the years. Peak years reveal important political events (e.g. the liberation of
            France after WW2, the advent of the Fifth Republic), which match the high exposure of
            Général de Gaulle. However, the most frequent occurrences do not necessarily correspond
            to political upheavals.</p>

            When a crowd is shown (as indicated by the archival description), what are the most
            characteristic words said by the voice-over? <soCalled>Président</soCalled> and
              <soCalled>[le général De] Gaulle</soCalled> represent the main context (<ref
              target="#figure01">Figure 12</ref>, upper window). In a second step, we remove all the
            reports containing one of these two words and focus on the remaining reports to bring
            out new kinds of contexts associated with the view of a crowd (<ref target="#figure12"
              >Figure 12</ref>, lower window), such as sports, commemorative events, demonstrations,
            festive events, etc. The recurring term <title rend="quotes">foule</title> (crowd) in
            the voice-overs promotes a sense of belonging to a community of fate. From a
            methodological perspective, this kind of cross-querying combined with statistical
            comparison between textual newsreel archival descriptions and commentary transcripts
            helps investigate correlations or discrepancies between what is shown in the newsreels
            and what is said in their commentaries. Such a combination of statistics across media is
            rarely provided by applications.</p>

          <head>3.2 Okapi platform for interactive semantic analysis</head>
          <p>Okapi (Open Knowledge Annotation and Publication Interface) <ptr target="#beloued2017"
            /> is a knowledge-based online platform for semantic management of content. It is at the
            intersection of three scientific domains: Indexing and description of multimedia
            content, knowledge management systems and Web content management systems. It takes full
            advantage of semantic web languages and standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL <ptr
              target="#motik2012"/>) to represent content as graphs of knowledge; it applies
            semantic inferences on these graphs and transforms them to generate new hypermedia
            content like web portals.</p>
          <p>Okapi provides a set of tools for analyzing multimedia content (video, image, sound)
            and managing corpora of annotated video and sound excerpts as well as image sections.
            Analysis tools allow the semantic indexing and description of content using domain
            ontology. The corpus management tools provide services for the constitution and
            visualization of thematic corpora as well as their annotation and enrichment in order to
            generate mini-portals or thematic publications of their contents.</p>
          <p>The Okapi's knowledge management system stores knowledge as graphs of named entities
            and provides services to retrieve, share and present them as linked open data. These
            entities can be aligned with other entities in existing knowledge bases like dbpedia and
            wikidata and so makes Okapi interoperable with the Linked Open Data ecosystem <ptr
              target="#bizer2009"/>. The named entities can be of different types and categories and
            vary according to the studied domain. For instance, for audiovisual archives, entities
            may concern persons, geographical places and concepts.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Okapi's Content Management System (Okapi's CMS) considers the
            characteristics of the studied domain and user preferences to generate web interfaces
            and tools for Okapi as well as content portals adapted to the domain. This publishing
            framework allows also authors to focus on their authoring work and to create thematic
            portals without any technical skills. The author can specify his thematic publication as
            a set of interconnected multimedia elements (video, image, sound, editorial texts). The
            framework applies thereafter a set of publishing rules on these elements and generates a
            web site.</p>
          <p>The Okapi platform is used by historians to constitute thematic corpora and to publish
            their portals as explained in the above paragraphs. Okapi can also be used by
            researchers in computer science and data scientists to show and improve the results of
            their automatic algorithms (face detection and recognition, automatic speech
            recognition, etc.). The following sections show some examples of how the Okapi platform
            can be used on the collection <title rend="quotes">Les Actualités Françaises</title>
            (AF) in the context of the ANTRACT project.</p>
          <p>The media analysis can be carried out manually by annotators or automatically by
            algorithms on several axes as shown in <ref target="#figure14">Figure 14</ref>. In this
            example, thematic analysis (the layer entitled <title rend="quotes">strate
              sujets</title>) of the AF program <title rend="quotes">Journal Les Actualités
              Françaises : émission du 10 juillet 1968</title> consists in identifying the topics

          <p>The other analysis layers (transcription, music detection, etc.) are provided by

            created manually by users and can be used by the Okapi platform to generate a rich
            portal that brings value to the content and provides several access and navigation
            possibilities in the content as shown in <ref target="#figure16">Figure 16</ref>.</p>

            tools, especially the TXM platform, to query the knowledge base and to update the stored
            metadata. For instance, TXM tools could retrieve metadata through the Okapi's endpoint
            in order to constitute a corpus. This corpus will then be stored in the knowledge base
            through the API and used by Okapi to provide thematic publications. Additional semantic
            descriptors produced by TXM could also be integrated into the Okapi knowledge base.</p>

        <head>4. Conclusion</head>
        <p>Presented throughout this article, the ANTRACT project's challenge is to familiarize
          scholars with the automated research of large audiovisual corpora. Gathering instruments
          specialized in image, audio and text analysis into a single multimodal apparatus designed
          to correlate their results, the project intends to develop a transdisciplinary research
          model suitable to open new perspectives in the study of single or multi-format
          sources.</p>
        <p>At this point of the project, most of the work is dedicated to the development and tuning
          of the automatic content analysis tools as well as the application of their results to the
          organization and improvement of the corpus data in connection with research provided by
          ANTRACT historians <ptr target="#goetschel2011"/>. Their case studies were explored using
          the TXM textometry platform and the Okapi annotation and publication platform that allows
          its users to exploit all the data produced by the instruments developed for the
          project.</p>
        <p>From a technological perspective, ANTRACT's goal is now to further adapt automatic
          content analysis tools to the specificity of the corpus such as its historical context,
          its vocabulary, its image format and quality, as it has been done, for instance, by
          improving the language models used by the automatic transcription tools with the help of
          the typescripts of voice-overs. Interactive analysis platforms should also benefit from
          history scholars feedback in order to improve their user interface and to develop new
          analytical paths.</p>
        <p>At the end of the project, a comprehensive <title rend="italic">Les Actualités
            Françaises</title> corpus completed with its metadata as well as the results of the
          research supported by automatic content analysis tools and manual annotations will be made
          available to the scientific community via the online Okapi platform. To this end, Okapi
          tutorials will be provided to the public and TXM will continue to be available as an open
          source software to help the analysis of corpora used in new case studies. Okapi source
          code will be turned to open source so that other developers can contribute to its
          enhancement.</p>
        <p>Regarding humanities, ANTRACT tools and methodology can be adapted to various types of
          corpora providing historians as well as specialists from other disciplines such as
          sociology, anthropology and political science a renewed access to their documents
          supported by an exhaustive examination of their content.</p>
