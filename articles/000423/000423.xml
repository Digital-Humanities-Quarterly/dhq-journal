                <p>Using DIAS and DENDRON, computer applications designed for the study of
                    infectious fungi and cancer cells, we forge a connection in color, composition,
                    and theme between Paolo Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de
                        Cana</title> and Paul Cézanne’s <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout,
                        s’essuyant les cheveux.</title> From this connection, we bring to light a
                        <quote rend="inline">hidden</quote> compositional structure, heretofore
                    unidentified, in Cézanne’s Bathers as a series. Using computer-assisted systems
                    such as DIAS and DENDRON allowed us to detect relatedness in these paintings not
                    necessarily visible to the human eye. With DIAS and DENDRON, we generated
                    dendrograms that clustered paintings related in brightness, saturation,
                    complexity, and color. After studying color, we applied DIAS to the study of
                    Cézanne’s composition. Because Cézanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding
                    paintings in his conversations and letters, we programmed DIAS to compute axial
                    lines and <soCalled>golden sections</soCalled> according to the dimensions of
                    the square or rectangular painting under scrutiny. Using DIAS we identified the
                    golden rectangle for Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>,
                    Cézanne’s <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title>
                    and Ingres’ <title rend="italic">La Source</title> (another likely model for
                        <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title>). From
                    the similarities and differences between the three paintings we identified,
                    regarding their use of axial symmetry and the golden section, we have formulated
                    a new approach to <soCalled>seeing</soCalled> Cézanne’s composition in his
                    Bather series.   Cézanne’s noumenal bodies, formerly perceived as
                        <soCalled>awkward</soCalled> and composed with <quote rend="inline">baffling
                        imbalance,</quote> we can now see as <quote rend="inline"

                        Collection. A computer-assisted comparison using the newly developed
                        DIAS/DENDRON ART (DDA) software of fifty-five oil paintings by Paul Cézanne,
                        exhibited at the Galerie Vollard, Paris, in 1895, suggests that Cézanne’s
                            <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title>,
                        is highly related to Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de

                        2-4). Further computer-assisted analysis using DDA suggests that Cézanne
                        drew from Veronese a <soCalled>hidden</soCalled> compositional structure to
                        organize his Bather paintings</head>

                                History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns
                                from Antiquity to the Present</title> (Oxford: Oxford University
                            Press, 2013), Rens Bod maps art history’s trajectory in the western
                            world. For Bod, the formal study of art history begins with Vitruvius’s
                            theory of harmonious proportion in <title rend="italic">On
                                Architecture</title> (15 BCE) and continues with Pliny’s discussions
                            of illusionism in <title rend="italic">Natural History</title> (77 CE).
                            Though China had a thriving field of art historical scholarship in the
                            Middle Ages, the western world produced few written discussions of art
                            between Pliny and Alberti’s works. Bod cites Alberti’s <title
                                rend="italic">On Painting</title> (1435) as the first theoretical
                            treatise on art, followed by Piero della Francesca’s <title
                                rend="quotes">On the Perspective for Painting</title> (1435), A
                            Treatise on Painting, attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and compiled by
                            Francesco Melzi (1540), then Vasari’s <title rend="italic">Lives of the
                                Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects</title> (1550).
                            Bod views the advent of the digital humanities as a natural extension of
                            the general search for principles and patterns that directs humanistic
                            inquiry. 311-325.</note> Formally established in 1834 at the University
                        of Berlin with the appointment of Franz Kugler (1808-1858) as the first
                        professor of art history, Kugler and his successors Jacob Burkhardt
                        (1818-1897), and Heinrich Wölfflin (1864-1945) instituted methods for the
                        formal analysis of art and specified many categories used today for
                        classifying art <ptr target="#bod2013" loc="316"/>. <note>Kugler divided art
                            history into pre-Greek, classical, romantic and modern periods.
                            Burkhardt identified the features of Renaissance art. Wölfflin
                            distinguished Baroque from Renaissance art through the relations of
                            differences principle employed in structural linguistics. In
                            analytically comparing paintings, Wölfflin showed that Renaissance art
                            is <q>linear, flat, and closed,</q> while Baroque art is <q>painterly,
                                deep, and open.</q></note> Wölfflin is noted for <quote

                        collaboration with museum curators have applied computational methods to art
                        for conservation, reconstruction, and restoration. X-ray imaging, infrared
                        reflectography, UV-induced fluorescent imaging, and photo-induced
                        luminescence photography can reveal the under-layers of paintings, identify
                        the properties of pigments and binders, authenticate artworks, detect
                        forgeries, and gauge optimal designs for museum and digital displays.
                        Computer algorithms are used to measure and count brushstrokes, sort and
                        classify artworks by style, identify the salient features of an artist’s
                        style, and produce three-dimensional models that illustrate an artist’s

                        make creating interesting comparisons challenging.</p>
                    <p> Dendrography has enormously productive applications for the comparison of
                        formal and iconographic elements in paintings. Since formal analysis is
                        often viewed as outdated in today’s art history, its potential as a subject
                        for computational analysis has been overlooked (except for the few
                        curatorial forays in this direction). As such, our approach not only
                        attempts to see the value of the computational method, but also what DENDRON
                        and DIAS may do to open up in surprising new ways what has been considered a
                        finished part of the field. This may be the first study in digital art
                        history that uses dendrography to cluster similar paintings and that employs
                        computer programs to calculate golden rectangles in paintings for
                        comparative purposes. The ever-growing raft of digitized paintings online,
                        and the continual improvement of digital photography, calls for
                        computer-assisted methods as long as these programs are reliable, the
                        questions posed are appropriate for computer-assisted investigation, and the
                        final interpretations are considered just that, namely interpretations.</p>

                            >Les Noces de Cana</title> is enormous in scale, more than twenty-two
                        feet by thirty-two feet in height and length, while the <title rend="italic"
                            >baigneuse</title> is tiny, only eleven inches in height and five inches
                        in width. <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>’s subject matter is
                        biblical, Christ transforming water into wine at the marriage feast, while
                        Cézanne’s work is prosaic, a woman drying her hair after a bath. A
                        traditional art historian, guided by genre expectations, might conclude that
                        scale and theme obviate potential connections between the works, but using
                        DDA, which normalizes scale, we can grasp surprising connections. Now, using
                        DDA analysis, we can see how Cézanne capitalizes on Veronese’s color scheme
                        in his first female <title rend="italic">baigneuse</title>. We may also use
                        DDA to suggest new approaches to old problems. For example, Cézanne painted
                        over eighty bathers in his lifetime, but these paintings continue to mystify
                        scholars. To date, they are mostly interpreted in psychanalytic terms as
                        representing Cézanne’s repressed sexuality and/or aggression.<note>J.T.

                        potential similarities in composition. In Part 2, using DDA analysis, we
                        discovered that the composition of <title rend="italic">Les Noces de
                            Cana</title> is based on axial symmetry and the golden ratio (phi). When
                        we apply DDA to identify axial symmetry and the golden ratio to <title
                            rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> and the
                        rest of Cézanne’s bathers, we find that Cézanne imitates the composition of
                            <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> in virtually every bather
                        painting. Based on axial symmetry and the golden section, then, we have

                            electronically or in print, and that demand first-person viewing, such

                            <soCalled>trajectory</soCalled> as an image. What Cézanne saw between
                        1861, his first trip to Paris, until his death in 1906 is not the <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> that we see now in the Louvre,
                        as conservationist efforts have modified the painting. Currently <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> exists in its
                            <soCalled>original</soCalled> (though repainted) version at the Louvre,
                        and it exists in a fully <soCalled>restored</soCalled> version, based on
                        digitization, housed in its <soCalled>original</soCalled> context, in a
                        Benedictine refectory in Venice. The Louvre <title rend="italic">Les Noces
                            de Cana</title> is considerably darker than the Benedictine digital
                        facsimile. The coat of the server depicted in the foreground of the Louvre
                            <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> was originally red but
                        was changed to green in 1989. Thus, no version today is exactly what Cézanne
                        saw. For our purposes here, we use a digitized image of the pre-1989 <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, with the tabard in his
                            <soCalled>original</soCalled> red coat. This, perhaps begrimed with more
                        dust, is the closest <soCalled>approximation</soCalled> to what Cézanne
                        would have seen. However, we demonstrate that DDA grouped <title
                            rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> in the
                        same cluster with both renditions of <title rend="italic">Le Noces de

                    <p>Choosing Cézanne’s paintings for computer-assisted analysis is also
                        complicated. Cézanne left many works unfinished, therefore, we selected for
                        this study paintings exhibited during his lifetime. The paintings exhibited
                        in the 1895 Vollard exhibition is an exemplary dataset for computation, as
                        it was Cézanne’s first one-man show, with examples of paintings from every
                        stage of his development. Most important, we can presume Ambroise Vollard,
                        Cézanne’s friend and patron exhibited the works as
                            <soCalled>finished</soCalled> with the artist’s support. For information
                        about Cézanne’s paintings, and for digital facsimiles, we relied on John
                        Rewald’s printed <title rend="italic">Catalogue Raisonné</title> and Walter
                        Feichenfeldt, Jayne Warman and David Nash’s <title rend="italic">The

                        research and educational use. When there were multiple versions of digitized

                        that housed the work. In many cases, we checked digital facsimiles against
                        original paintings on site in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit,
                        not only for accuracy in color, brightness, and saturation, but also for
                        correct margin between figure and frame for our geometric partitioning.</p>

                    <head>Generating dendrograms</head>
                    <p>The software program we have developed to compare digitized paintings is a
                        composite of two patented programs DIAS (US patent #5,655,028 1997) and
                        DENDRON (US patent #5,400,249 1995). The customized program DDA, allows the
                        user to store and sort digitized images of pictures in a data file, measure
                        parameters for comparison and then generate dendrograms, visual phylogenies
                        of relatedness based on one or any combination of parameters. Both DIAS and
                        DENDRON began development in the late 1980’s. DIAS was developed to analyze
                        cell morphology, shape, cell movement and the dynamics of populations of
                        cells, and has recently been used to study tumorigenesis in 2D and 3D.
                        Dendron was developed to analyze and compare DNA fingerprints of infectious
                        organisms and has been used to follow the progression of diseases in human
                        populations. In <title rend="quotes">The Ins and Outs of DNA Fingerprinting
                            the Infectious Fungi,</title> DENDRON is described in terms that we
                        apply here for the comparison of paintings between the same or different
                        painters. The combined programs, including the parameters we have measured
                        and compared, and the generation of dendrograms, are described in Appendix I
                        in more detail, with relevant references. In brief, images of a collection
                        of pictures were scanned into a DDA data file. The DIAS portion of the
                        program then automatically computed nine parameters, which included
                        brightness, saturation, complexity, redness, orangeness, yellowness,
                        greenness, blueness and purpleness. These parameters are described in
                        Appendix I. To assess a similarity coefficient between two pictures for any
                        one of these parameters or amongst any combination of these parameters, each
                        parameter is assessed in a range of 0.00 to 1.00, 0.00 representing no
                        relatedness and 0.01 to 1.00 representing progressively increasing values.
                        The similarity coefficient (S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>) for one or any
                        combination of parameters is then computed between all pairs of paintings in
                        a collection, generating a matrix of S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>’s as
                        demonstrated in Appendix I, Table A. Based on the matrix of S<hi
                            rend="subscript">AB</hi>’s, a dendrogram (i.e., a phylogenetic tree of
                        relatedness) is then generated by the unweighted pairgroup method based upon
                        the arithmetic averages (UPGMA), originally used by Rohlf <ptr
                            target="#rohlf1963"/>, discussed in detail by Sneath and Sokal <ptr
                            target="#sneath1973"/> and developed for DENDRON by Schmid et al. <ptr
                            target="#schmid1990"/>. The accuracy of the program was validated by
                        Pujol et al <ptr target="#lockhart1997"/>, with more than 410 citations in
                        the literature reported by Google Scholar just for the methods paper <title

                        <ptr target="#soll2000"/>. In the generated dendrogram (e.g., in Figures 2
                        and 3), the nodes (i.e., vertical connections) approximate the hierarchy of
                        similarity. An arbitrary threshold is drawn as a black vertical line through
                        the dendrogram simply is a tool for visualizing the refutation of similarity

                    <p>Using DDA, we compared Cézanne’s fifty-five oil paintings presented at the
                        Galerie Vollard in 1895 and Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de
                            Cana</title>. The S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>’s for all DIAS
                        parameters were used in generating the dendrogram in Figure 2. The
                        dendrogram generated in this case could be separated into seven clades, a
                        through f, using an S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi> threshold of 0.83. Both
                        Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, <title
                            rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> and six
                        additional Cézanne paintings were included in clade f (Figure 2).
                        Interestingly, of the three paintings painted in the 1860s by Cézanne after
                        first viewing <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, two of them,
                            <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title>
                        (1869) and <title rend="italic">L’orgie de Nabuchodonosor</title> (1967),
                        resided in clade f, and were highly related. Since it was obvious that the
                        one color assessed by DIAS in the unrestored <title rend="italic">Les Noces
                            de Cana</title> that appeared disproportionally faded was <quote
                            rend="inline">green</quote>, (and since the painting lacks the heavy
                        green coat of the tabard as in post-1989 retouched versions), we generated a
                        dendrogram in which the composite S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi> was computed
                        for all parameters but green (see table in the right lower corner of Figure
                        3). Using a high threshold, 14 clades were distinguished (Figure 3). One
                        clade, b, clustered six pictures, which included <title rend="italic"
                            >Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> and <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> in a subclade with a node of
                        0.92 and a subcluster of four paintings, three of which (<title
                            rend="italic">Les Begonias</title>, <title rend="italic">La
                            Baignade</title>, <title rend="italic">Nature Morte</title>) also
                        resided in the clade b, containing <title rend="italic">Les Noces de

                        widely accessable on the web, we generated a dendrogram using the complete

                            (<ref target="#appendix2">Appendix II</ref>). Again, Cézanne’s <title
                            rend="italic">L’Orgie de Nabuchodonosor</title> clustered with
                        Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> and Cézanne’s
                            <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title>.
                        The two Cézanne paintings were painted in 1867 and 1869, respectively, so
                        both reflect early works potentially highly related to <title rend="italic"
                            >Le Noce de Cana</title>. We also analyzed the restored <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> facsimile and the Cézanne
                        collection using all parameters but green, and found that the restored
                        facsimile was in a cluster containing Cézanne’s <title rend="italic"
                            >Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> and the other
                        clustered paintings (<ref target="#appendix2">Appendix II</ref>). We
                        generated a dendrogram of the Cézanne collection that included, both the
                        unrestored and restored <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>. The

                        and both unrestored and restored <title rend="italic">Les Noces de
                            Cana</title> paintings clustered, and the cluster contained the same
                        additional paintings in the clusters of the dendrograms generated with
                        either the unrestored <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> alone
                        or the restored <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> (<ref

                        the similarity assessed by DDA in the collection in Figure 2, we generated a
                        dendrogram that included Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de
                            Cana</title>, Cézanne’s <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout,

                        including Delacroix, Rubens and Tintoretto, all of which were shown in the
                        Louvre between 1861 and 1906 (<ref target="#appendix3">Appendix III</ref>,

                        indicating not only the similarity between Veronese’s <title rend="italic"

                            >Baigneuse</title> paintings, but also the accuracy of the DDA

                    <p>Just like Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, Paul
                        Cézanne’s paintings continue to inspire wonder in his admirers. His
                        contemporaries, Renoir and Matisse, spoke of his deployment of color and
                        composition in godlike terms, while scholars today <soCalled>struggle to
                            know</soCalled> his secret. Cézanne’s last words in 1904 to the young
                        painter Emile Bernard heighten the sense of mystery and unknowability that
                        surround the painter’s process. Richard Shiff’s 2004 Introduction to
                        <title rend="italic">Conversations with Cézanne</title> illustrates this mystery: <cit>
                            <quote rend="block">
                                <quote rend="inline">He takes his secret to the grave,</quote>
                                remarked Bernard to his wife, upon receiving word of Cézanne’s
                                death: <quote rend="inline">he wrote that he wanted to tell me
                                    everything, and I don’t know what he meant by that.</quote>
                                Regretting his failure to visit Aix in 1906 as planned, Bernard knew
                                that Cézanne, only a month before, had suggested that both men would
                                better <quote rend="inline">explain themselves</quote> whenever they
                                finally met again in person. Even more poignantly, Bernard could
                                recall the cryptic promise Cézanne included in a letter of the
                                previous year: <quote rend="inline">I owe you the truth in painting
                                    [en peinture], and I will tell it to you</quote></quote>
                            <ptr target="#doran2001" loc="xxxiv"/>.</cit></p>

                    <p>Shiff concludes, <quote rend="inline">Like Bernard-like Cézanne himself-we
                            struggle to know</quote> (my italics). We propose Cézanne worked from a
                        plan, and that his comments to Bernard indicate guardedness about sharing
                        his process. As he advised the fellow painter Maurice Denis: <quote
                            rend="inline">You have to have a method. My father [said], <q>People
                                have to play games.</q> That’s what I search for in
                            painting...theories, sensations and theories...I wanted to copy nature
                            but I never could do it</quote>
                        <ptr target="#doran2001" loc="93–94"/>. In this second part of our analysis
                        we identified parameters for DDA which we believed would allow us to begin
                        to assess similarities based on composition. We tested whether <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> and <title rend="italic"
                            >Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> shared potential
                        compositional similarities, and we sought parameters related to composition
                        that could be quantified. Because of Cézanne’s frequent references to <quote
                            rend="inline">harmony</quote> in his conversations and letters, and his
                        documented love for classical Greek and Roman culture, we turned to
                        Classical conceptions of harmony, based on numbers and geometry, for
                        parameters that we could quantify.</p>

                    <p>In this section, we compare only the relationship between axial lines and
                        golden rectangles as determined by the picture’s frame in <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> and <title rend="italic"
                            >Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title>. We decided to
                        automate identification of the center and central axis of a painting,
                        because of their technical importance to an artist, and because of their
                        semantic weight. For Rudolf Arnheim, the dead center of a painting is not
                        dead but <quote rend="inline">alive with tension</quote>
                        <ptr target="#arnheim1974" loc="11, 16"/>. The vertical and horizontal
                        bisecting lines emanating from the center establish a <quote rend="inline"
                            >solid spatial trellis in the brain.</quote> An artist must master the
                        axis first, according to Arnheim, as it <quote rend="inline">remains the
                            base of reference that alone make obliqueness possible. Obliqueness is
                            always perceived as a deviation [from the axis] hence its strongly
                            dynamic character.</quote> Computer-assisted methods for identifying
                        centers and axial lines are helpful as these can be mis-apprehended by a
                        viewer. For example, upon first glance, many people see Christ as the center
                        of <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, as opposed to the men
                        carving meat on the balustrade above him. Once we used DDA to identify the
                        center and the horizontal and vertical bisecting lines of <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, we chose to automate the
                        identification of golden sections in a painting as determined by the square
                        picture plane. In Appendix IV, we present the steps in the DDA program
                        employed to automatically identify a number of geometric landmarks including
                        what we have defined as the <soCalled>golden window,</soCalled> in a
                        painting. This involves identifying the <soCalled>golden
                            rectangle</soCalled> and the axial lines bisecting both vertically and
                        horizontally the picture plane.</p>

                    <p>Many scholars have attempted to find hidden patterns in art works based on
                        numbers. Most recently, Robert Bork’s studies of golden sections in medieval
                        cathedral ground plans show that for centuries, artists and architects have
                        used the mysterious divine proportion or golden ratio (1.618...) in their
                        designs <ptr target="#bork2012"/>. For Arnheim, the golden ratio is
                        satisfying <quote rend="inline">because of its combination of unity and
                            dynamic variety, whole and parts are nicely adjusted in strength so that
                            the whole prevails without being threatened by a split, but at the same
                            time, the parts retain some self-sufficiency</quote>
                        <ptr target="#arnheim1974"/>. Veronese and Cézanne would have been familiar
                        with Luca Pacioli’s handbook for artists, <title rend="italic">De Divina
                            Proportione</title>, published in 1509. Seventy-one chapters are
                        dedicated to demonstrating the <q>golden</q> section, a mathematical
                        proportion based on an equation that produces <q>phi</q> or the never-ending
                        value of 1.618... in artworks <ptr target="#pacioli2014"/>. Cézanne’s
                        contemporary Symbolists, Odilon Redon and Paul Serusier, considered Platonic
                        geometry, holy, or mystical, because it appeared in nature as repeated
                        numbers and patterns. Cézanne and Veronese absorbed the concept of divine
                        proportion in their training, and when they had the problem of creating a
                        two-dimensional structure that expressed <quote rend="inline">witnessing the
                            holy,</quote> they found a rule or <quote rend="inline">game</quote> in
                        the golden section that suited their purposes. Using DDA, as a tool to
                        section a painting geometrically, we show that the golden section may have a
                        formal and thematic purpose for Veronese in <title rend="italic">Les Noces
                            de Cana</title> (<ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>) and that
                        Cézanne might have elaborated on this compositional structure in his Bather
                        paintings.</p>


                    <p>While we could have discovered this hidden composition by applying a ruler
                        and compass to reproductions from books, the advantage of DDA in studying
                        composition is the mechanization of the geometer’s tools, and the quantity
                        of digital reproductions we can quickly, and more precisely, <q>rule</q>
                        than with human hands. It also allows for the quantification of parameters
                        from the digitized image for further comparison using DDA software. DDA
                        determines and saves golden ratio rectangles from any point on a painting,
                        drawing up to nine symmetrical vertical or horizontal staves across a
                        painting, and imposing and saving geometrical shapes on digital paintings.
                        Since these parameters are associated with Neoplatonic ideals and classical
                        harmony, we feel these might have bearing on Cézanne’s painterly concerns in
                        his <title rend="italic">Bathers</title> series. <title rend="italic"
                            >Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> achieves its
                        uniqueness not only from a masterful deployment of color modelled on
                        Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, but also from its
                        invisible scaffolding, based on Platonic geometry. We believe that Cézanne
                        hides this <q>game</q> in plain sight.</p>

                    <p>Cézanne left eighty <title rend="italic">Bather</title> paintings in various
                        states of completion after his death in 1906 at the age of 68. He repeats
                        this, heretofore unidentified, compositional structure throughout his Bather
                        series. Since Cézanne appears to have modeled his first female bather on
                            <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, as our dendrograms
                        imply, it is likely that Cézanne is linking <title rend="italic">Les Noces

                            les cheveux</title> semantically. The subject of <title rend="italic"
                            >Les Noces de Cana</title> is a wedding feast at Canaan where Christ
                        performs the miracle of turning water into wine, a potent metaphor for the
                        artist translating raw materials into representations. Christ transmutes
                        water, something common, into something holy, strange, and magical;
                        likewise, Cézanne divinizes his bathers; he makes them noumenal, by way of
                        his predecessor Veronese — through color harmonies and divine geometry.</p>

                    <p>Cézanne viewed geometry as a divine architecture, and he understood the
                        center of a bounded four-sided square to be its axial eye. The center of a
                        painting represents the <quote rend="inline">truth</quote> or the <quote
                            rend="inline">eye of god</quote>
                        <ptr target="#hendrix2004"/>. In its aggressively axial construction <ref
                            target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>, Veronese appears to take account of
                        the square frame, its center, the golden rectangle, and the golden window in
                        organizing his composition for thematic effect (<ref target="#appendix4"
                            >Appendix IV</ref>). The sacrificial meat above Christ’s head is at the
                        exact center of <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>. Like a
                        blade, the vertical and horizontal axes divide the meat. The axis signifies
                        that the focus of the painting is sacrifice, and its cognates, Christ,
                        directly below the sacrificial meat, and the dog at the bottom of the
                        painting. The vertical axis bisecting the painting runs directly through
                        Christ’s right eye and the left eye of the dog. As a dog signifies loyalty
                        in medieval/renaissance Christian iconography, the implied vertical line
                        uniting sacrifice/Christ’s eye/loyalty appears to emphasize Veronese’s aim
                        of producing a sensually enlightening painting. To make the painting’s
                        purpose legible, he provides a strong horizontal balcony across the middle
                        of the painting above Christ’s head. The top of the balcony passes through
                        the exact center of the painting.</p>

                        <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>, just as axial intersection
                        emphasizes theme, so too does the golden section. The golden section
                        intersects Christ’s eyes, and the eyes or mouths of the witnesses flanking
                        Christ. The <soCalled>golden window</soCalled> we have identified frames a
                        quarter of Christ’s face, partial faces of three witnesses to his left
                        (specifically through the mouth and eyes). Then, above and behind them,
                        three convex columns supporting the balustrade where butchers are preparing
                        sacrificial meat. Technically, the benefit of a <soCalled>golden
                            window</soCalled> for Veronese is that it allows him to represent depth
                        by mediating the distance between flat wall and blue sky with a band of
                        recessing modulations. In the golden window of Figure 4, we glimpse the
                        tablecloth behind the columns of the balustrade above Christ’s head, as well
                        as the robes of the butcher, and a building in the distance. In Figure 4,
                        the golden window underscores theme and creates a sense of depth or of
                            <soCalled>descended</soCalled> figures within the composition of the
                        painting. As Christ has <soCalled>descended</soCalled> from his godlike
                        nature to be among humans, the golden ratio becomes the line along which
                        Veronese arranges Christ and his witnesses at the feast. In Figure 5, we see
                        the lowering effect afforded by the golden window. Through the golden
                        window, we see Cézanne’s central bather (whose right knee and shoulder are
                        aligned with the vertical axis of the picture frame), descending into a pool
                        of water. We can now say that, in addition to discovering surprising
                        connections in color, saturation, complexity and brightness in paintings,
                        there are landmarks in paintings that DDA automatically computes. These are
                        the center of the painting, the horizontal and vertical bisecting lines
                        (axis), the golden rectangle, the golden strips (the space between the
                        vertical and horizontal bisecting lines and the golden sections of the upper
                        right and lower left sides of the picture plane), and the golden window
                        (located at the right base of the golden rectangle).</p>

                    <p>Like Leonardo da Vinci, Cézanne thought paintings were superior to poems

                        <ptr target="#doran2001" loc="17"/>. He wanted to create in paintings a

                        <ptr target="#doran2001" loc="39"/>. Cézanne stated his commitment to the

                        in nature, throughout his letters and conversations. He stated: <quote

                            interpretation as colored patches succeeding one another according to a

                            modulations</quote>” <ptr target="#doran2001" loc="38"/>.</p>

                    <p>By harmony, Cézanne means harmonia in a Platonic sense of <quote

                        <ptr target="#schneider1994" loc="236"/>. Cézanne synthesized contrasts: he

                        He saw the task of reconciling opposites as a magician’s task. He stated:

                        Cézanne finds a way to represent infinity in his paintings, which for him,
                        like the Symbolists, was the essence of nature. In the synthesis of

                        Cézanne’s ambivalence toward French Neo-Classicism, and its
                        arch-representative Dominique Ingres is well-documented. Cézanne would have
                        seen <title rend="italic">La Source</title> at the Louvre (<ref
                            target="#figure06">Figure 6</ref>).<note>The Louvre did not acquisition

                                cheveux</title> was painted. Nevertheless, the painting was
                            exhibited in the official Paris Salon in 1856 and was famous when
                            Cézanne was a young student in 1861.</note>
                        <title rend="italic">La Source</title>, begun by Ingres in 1820, and
                        completed in 1856, when Ingres was 76-years-old, was infamous to
                        impressionist painters as its graceful lines and classicism represented the
                        highest standard in Fine Art at the time. Cézanne did not care for the
                        painting. He called it <quote rend="inline">system and false spirit</quote>

                        Cézanne. Instead, Cézanne drew a pattern from Veronese and subjected another
                        model, Ingres’ <title rend="italic">La Source</title> to the pattern, then
                        dilated upon the results to suit his aims, the <quote rend="inline"
                            >harmonizing</quote> of the youthful nude body. First, we notice that
                        model and copy are mirror images. With arms raised, they form S shaped
                        figures in classical contrapposto. They are symmetrical only in that, when a
                        golden rectangle is formed over the rectangular plane of the canvasses, both
                        figures’ left breasts are framed by the middle vertical line and the golden
                        ratio vertical lines formed by the golden rectangle. The middle vertical
                        axis also runs through both figures’ left eyes. The golden window in Ingres’
                        work frames the girl’s left thigh. In Cézanne, the golden window alludes to
                        the girl’s thigh and hip by partially representing (yet with more convexity)
                        her right hip through tonal modulation. Pointedly, Cézanne uses the
                        subordinate horizontal line of the picture plane’s golden rectangle to
                            <quote rend="inline">lower</quote> his figure. In <title rend="italic"
                            >La Source</title> the axial eye (picture center) is the sex of the
                        young girl emptying the urn of water. The golden section runs across her
                        legs above her knees. Clearly, in <title rend="italic">La Source</title>,
                        the picture center, as the <soCalled>eye</soCalled> of
                            <soCalled>god,</soCalled> is Ingres’ visual pun on the source, water,
                        and female genitalia. In Cézanne’s work, the exact center is the nude
                        female’s hip swiveled in classical contrapposto, perhaps indicating that his

                        of the painting. In the middle painting (7.M.) he centers or aligns the left
                        male breast between the golden rectangle and the vertical bisecting line of
                        the painting. In the right painting (7.R), the bather’s left breast aligns
                        with the vertical bisecting line, while the bather’s left elbow aligns with
                        the golden rectangle. In all three works, the golden window captures thigh
                        and background. The navel aligns with the horizontal bisecting line and sex
                        aligns with phi (the bottom side of the golden rectangle determined by the
                        dimensions of the painting).</p>

                    <p>Adjacent to the <q>golden window</q> (<ref target="#appendix4">Appendix
                            IV</ref>) are the <soCalled>golden strips</soCalled> which elaborate on
                        the point emphasized by the window. The <soCalled>golden strip</soCalled> in
                        a bather painting is between the axial and golden ratio horizontal lines or
                        vertical lines of the picture plane (<ref target="#appendix4">Appendix
                            IV</ref>). The golden strips allow for an alternation of frontal and
                        rear nude forms with their sexes aligned with the golden section. As with
                        Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, Cézanne aligns
                        the heads of the <q>descended</q> figures beneath the middle horizontal line
                        bisecting the picture. For Andre Lohte, Cézanne’s genius is in his
                        alternation of foreground and background figures. (What we call Cézanne’s
                            <quote rend="inline">game,</quote> he calls Cézanne’s <quote
                            rend="inline">ruse</quote>). Lohte stated of Cézanne: <quote

                            find the horizon, the distance, without being excited by the successive
                            oppositions which retard its quest for space, and procure for it a

                        into a third <quote rend="inline">noumenal</quote> alliance. He aligns the
                        attentive and communicative heads, hearts, and sexes of his descended and/or

                    <head>Beyond the Church</head>
                    <p>Cézanne presents an affirmative and benedictory vision of youth and beauty in
                        his Bathers. In <title rend="italic">Les Grandes Baigneuses</title>, a 1906
                        painting left incomplete when he died, the church in the distance shows that
                        his bathers exist in an intermediate space between the viewer outside the
                        picture plane and the church (<ref target="#figure10">Figure 10</ref>). The
                        bathers are in a space of their own, determined by the geometry that unites
                        them. When we apply the geometric analysis of DDA to the painting, we see
                        that the golden window frames a reality beyond the church. We feel this
                        illustrates Cézanne’s Neoplatonic leanings, and fuels his concept of art as
                        a religion. In his serial use of golden sections to structure his bather
                        series, we see an interest in the infinite, and an understanding of the
                        golden window as affording a glimpse of it.</p>

                    <p>Cézanne also uses sacred geometry to structure the imagined space of the
                        image. In <title rend="italic">Baigneurs en Plein Air</title> (<ref
                            target="#figure11">Figure 11</ref>), an unfinished painting from
                        1890-1891, the ground of the five figures forms a Pentagon, below the

                    <p>As stated in Appendix IV, DDA will discriminate a variety of geometric shapes
                        within a picture. The figure emerging in the golden window represents it
                        triangular point. This implied pentagonal shape illustrates Cézanne’s advice
                        to artists throughout his letters and conversations: <quote rend="inline"
                            >Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put
                            everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, a plane,
                            recedes toward a central point</quote>” <ptr target="#doran2001"
                            loc="29"/>. In addition to an implied pentagon, these bathers form an
                        imaginary cone, a large triangle parallel to the surface plane whose tip
                        coincides with the middle vertical axis of the paintings. This triangle
                        provides vertical armature for the five bodies, linking them together in one
                        unit with the armpits aligned at the diagonal lines. This compositional
                        triangle both dynamically lifts the figures, and stabilizes the
                        composition.</p>

                    <p>Cézanne suggests with a few blue and red strokes the figure whose breast is
                        framed in the golden window of Figure 11. Cézanne repeated this particular
                        composition in his search for a realization commensurate with his ideal. We
                        can now think of a man lowering himself into a body of water as a
                        compositional <soCalled>problem</soCalled> Cézanne was trying to solve in
                        his Bather series. Painted in four-sided constructive strokes, and in
                        Veronesian, <soCalled>noumenal</soCalled> blue and red color patches that
                        resemble a harlequin’s costume, the figure is in motion, and not fully
                        formed. He is an intermediate being, not yet concretized, nor fully
                        translated between here and there within the noumenal square of the
                        painting. Cézanne is clearly attuned to magical conceptions of the number
                        four as representing the fourth element of earth in Platonic doctrine and
                        inherent in the squares of the harlequin’s costume. He was also aware of the
                        five-sided figure of the pentagon as representing the regenerative aspects
                        of creation. The Harlequin’s checkerboard costume has been described as
                        symbolizing <quote rend="inline">a chthonic force</quote>
                        <ptr target="#schneider1994"/>. If so, this chthonic force’s heart is framed
                        in the golden window, a highly significant spot, charged with meaning, as we
                        now see in Cézanne’s Bathers, and particularly in this painting (Figure 11)
                        depicting five men in geometrical relationship to each other. In addition to
                        a sacred understanding of numbers and shapes, three (triangle: divinity),
                        four (square: earth) and five (pentagon: creation and regeneration), a means
                        to create a harmony <quote rend="inline">parallel</quote> to nature, this
                        painting’s composition is Cézanne’s special homage to the pastoral poetry of
                        Theocritus and Virgil, the classical literature he loved. It is well- known
                        that Cézanne translated Theocritus and Virgil as a pastime in his youth <ptr
                            target="#doran2001" loc="181"/>. The left side of Figure 11 appears to
                        represent the sympotic aspects of male fraternity with the seated figure
                        under the pine tree discoursing with the standing figure seen from behind.
                        The right side of the painting pays homage to the erotic aspects of
                        homo-sociality implied by Theocritus and developed in the bucolic poems of
                        Virgil. In the poems, herdsmen gather to sing songs about

                    <head>Conclusion</head>
                    <p>In this paper, using the automated tools afforded by DDA, we have forged a
                        connection in color, composition, geometry, and theme between <title
                            rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> and <title rend="italic"
                            >Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title>, and from this
                        connection, we have brought to light unifying characteristics in Cézanne’s
                        Bathers heretofore unidentified. We have identified the connection between
                            <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title> and <title rend="italic"
                            >Baigneuse debout s’essuyant le cheveux</title> by producing dendrograms
                        of Cézanne’s fifty- five 1895 Galerie Vollard Exhibition oil paintings
                        compared to Veronese’s <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, a
                        painting we know Cézanne admired at the Louvre during his formative years as
                        a painter and throughout his life. Using computer-assisted methods we
                        generated dendrograms that clustered paintings related in color, saturation,
                        brightness and complexity. After studying these parameters, we applied the
                        geometric program of DDA to the study of Cézanne’s composition. Because
                        Cézanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding paintings in his
                        conversations and letters, we programmed DDA to compute axial lines and
                        golden rectangles according to the dimensions of the square, rectangle, and
                        other geometric parameters to the painting under scrutiny. Using DDA we
                        identified the golden rectangle for <title rend="italic">Les Noces de
                            Cana</title>, <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les
                            cheveux</title> and Ingres’ <title rend="italic">La Source</title>
                        (another likely model for <title rend="italic">Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant
                            les cheveux</title>). From the similarities and differences between the
                        three paintings identified, based on axial symmetry and the golden section,
                        we have formulated an approach to <soCalled>seeing</soCalled> Cézanne’s
                        composition in his Bather series. Cézanne’s noumenal bodies, formerly
                        perceived as <soCalled>awkward</soCalled> and composed with <quote
                            rend="inline">baffling imbalance,</quote> can now be viewed as <quote
                            rend="inline">golden</quote>
                        <ptr target="#danchev2013"/>. These are only the first parameters,
                        customized to the study of paintings that we have introduced to DDA. As we
                        continue to expand and use this computer program to compare influence
                        between painters, we will add new parameters such as measurements for
                        convexity, concavity, texture and composition, based on edge detection
                        technology in the original DIAS program. These tools will assist us in
                        investigating a variety of questions basic to art history.</p>

                    P.332-370. The programs originally written in C++ have been converted to JAVA
                    (Graphics Programming With Java, Second Edition. 2001. Steven’s Scott/Jones,
                    Inc.). Images of paintings are scanned into a DDA folder, with borders equal to
                    the inner edges of the frame and normalized for size. If a painting is faded,
                    hue will not be significantly affected since DDA employs HSB (hue, saturation,
                    brightness) color space (Oracle Java 7 documentation, online for <title
                        rend="quotes">Class Color</title>), as opposed to RGB (red, green, blue).
                    DDA then automatically computes nine parameters that include brightness,
                    saturation, complexity, redness, orangeness, yellowness, greenness, blueness and
                    purpleness. Additional parameters based on DIAS edge detection programs are now
                    under development and will be incrementally added. The
                        <soCalled>brightness</soCalled> parameter is computed by converting the
                    pixels of the entire image to HSB. A value of 0% is black and 100% is white. The
                    average % for the entire picture is computed and the value converted to a range
                    of 0.00 to 1.00. The <soCalled>saturation</soCalled> parameter is treated in a
                    similar fashion. It represents the average richness of all colors assessed, is
                    computed from 0 to 100%, then normalized to a value in the range of 0.00 to
                    1.00. For the <soCalled>complexity</soCalled> parameter, the image is first
                    converted to grays with pixel intensities ranging from 0 to 255. The average
                    value is then normalized to 0.00 to 1.00. The final parameters are six hues. On
                    the color or <soCalled>hue</soCalled> wheel, they vary from 0 to 360°. The
                    number of pixels with redness at 0° ± 5°, orange at 20 ± 5°, yellowness at 60 ±
                    5°, greenness at 120 ± 5°, blueness at 240 ± 5° and purpleness at 270 ± 5°, are
                    computed and divided by the total number of pixels in the image. These
                    individual pixel proportions are then converted to 0.00 to 1.00. The values of
                    each parameter, all converted to a range of 0.00 to 1.00, were then used to
                    generate a similarity coefficient (S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>) between every
                    pair of paintings in a collection, using the following formula: <figure>
                        <figDesc>The equation for the similarity coefficient.</figDesc>
                        <graphic url="resources/images/figure12.jpg"/>
                    </figure> where a<hi rend="subscript">i</hi> and b<hi rend="subscript">i</hi>
                    are the values of a parameter I for paintings A and B respectively, and k is the
                    number of parameters. This formula was derived from that developed by Schmid,
                    J., Voss, E. and Soll, D.R. 1990. (J. Clin Microbiol. 28, 1236-1243) for banding
                    patterns of DNA fingerprints in which each band is a restrictive fragment length
                    polymorphism (RFLP) pattern representing a parameter (Soll et. al. 1997 US
                    Patent #5, 655, 028). An S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi> of 0.00 represents
                    complete dissimilarity, an S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi> of 1.00 identicalness,
                    and S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>s of 0.01 to 0.99, increasing levels of
                    similarity. For this study the average of the parameters of paintings are used
                    to generate the S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>s between all paintings in a
                    collection, which are logged into a matrix, as presented for 18 pictures in

                <p>The matrix is then used to generate a dendrogram using the unweighted pair group
                    method based on arithmetic averages (UPGMA), first employed by Rohlf ,1963
                    Classification of <title rend="italic">Aedes</title> by numerical taxonomic
                    methods [Diptera, Culcidae]. (Ann. Entomal. Soc. Am. 56, 798-804) and discussed
                    in more detail for application by Snesth and Sokel (1973. Numerical Taxonomy
                    W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA). In generating a dendrogram,
                    connections are identified in descending values. The matrix is first scanned for
                    the S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi> with the highest value. The first two are
                    joined by a vertical node at that S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>. If two or more
                    pairs have the same highest S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>, one is picked
                    randomly to initiate the process of generating a tree. The system then grows the
                    tree of relatedness, connecting pairs, individual paintings and groups of two or
                    more, or groups. The node involving more than two paintings is computed as the
                    arithmetic mean of the S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>s between the pictures
                    connected. This process continues until all pictures are connected to form a
                    relatedness tree (dendrogram). The accuracy of the dendrogram has been assessed
                    by goodness of fit (i.e., whether the distance in the dendrogram approximates
                    the S<hi rend="subscript">AB</hi>s in the matrix (Avis, J.C. 1994. Molecular
                    numbers, natural history and evolution. Chapraon and Hull, New York, NY). By
                    using completely different methods to assess genetic relatedness between the
                    same collection of strains of an infectious fungus, the accuracy of the DENDRON
                    program was previously verified (Pujol, C., joly, S., Lockhart, S.R., Sebastian,
                    N., Tibayrenc, M., and Soll, D.R. 1977. J. Clin Microbiol, 2348-2358; Soll D.R.
                    2000. Clin Microbiol Rev 13, 332-370). The robustness of DIAS/DENDRON ART (DDA)
                    in clustering was also verified by the addition of the restored <title

                    unrestored <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, as described in

                    Greenness was removed because in the restored version, a man’s cloak, which was
                    red, was converted by restoration to green. Both Cézanne’s <title rend="italic"
                        >Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</title> and Veronese’s <title

                    restored and unrestored <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>. It
                    should be noted that the alternative clusters in the three dendrograms share a

                    paintings in the alternative clusters, presented in Appendix II D. These results
                    also demonstrate the accuracy of the clustering method of DIAS/Dendron, given
                    that the addition of different versions, in this case the unrestored and
                    restored <title rend="italic">Les Noces de Cana</title>, or the addition of
                    both, does not disrupt relationships, even though each dendrogram is generated
                    independently, using the unweighted pair-group method employing arithmetic
