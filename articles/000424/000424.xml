           <p>This article unpacks the archival, textual, and encoded layers that comprise the <title rend="italic">Maria Edgeworth Letters Project</title> 
              (<title rend="italic">MELP</title>), an open-access digital archive containing the correspondence of the Anglo-Irish Regency author 
              <name>Maria Edgeworth</name> and her circle. These layers reveal the impossibility of flattening or standardizing our work and instead 
              advocate for a more inclusive and collaborative digital humanities model that accommodates both institutional and volunteer labor. Just as 
              different methods were used to approach each archive and manage our project across multiple institutions, each transcription requires a 
              different level of care, especially as various notes and collaborators are cited in the final project. Through the use of TEI, we can 
              flexibly represent diverse aspects of each letter while still maintaining a database-readable structure. We endeavor to connect each person, 
              place, or work identified in <name>Edgeworth</name>'s letters and our database to a larger network of linked data in order to place our 
              project in conversation with other archival resources. For entities that are unidentified or unknown, we create new name authority files 
              or produce internal data files that can be viewed by our collaborators and users. <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s flexible structure 
              thus allows it to strive for interoperability while refusing to efface the individual traces of its collaborators, entities, and material 
              artifacts.

            <p>Our article describes how we are building the <title rend="italic">Maria Edgeworth Letters Project</title>, an open-access archive 
               containing <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence, tracing our steps including image retrieval and processing, metadata generation, 
               transcription, linked open data, and TEI encoding.

          <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>The Anglo-Irish Regency author <name>Maria Edgeworth</name> (1768-1859) was <quote rend="inline">the most commercially successful novelist 
               of her age</quote> <ptr target="#mccormack_2004"/>, yet her important, sprawling correspondence has only been published in excerpts and 
               partial editions up to this point.<note>Some letters have previously been published in <ptr target="#butler_1972"/>, 
               <ptr target="#colvin_1971"/>, <ptr target="#colvin_1979"/>, <ptr target="#edgeworth_1867"/>, and <ptr target="#pakenham_2017"/>.</note> The 
               primary goal of the <title rend="italic">Maria Edgeworth Letters Project</title> (<title rend="italic">MELP</title>) is to produce a 
               searchable corpus of <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence, which contains over ten thousand sheets spread across more than forty 
               institutions. In addition to the infrastructural obstacles to accessing and collating <name>Edgeworth</name>'s letters is the reality that 
               a physical edition would be unwieldy as a research tool and unlikely to be completed.  <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s choice to produce 
               a digital archive was also influenced by changing institutional funding structures. Researchers continue to face difficult choices when 
               doing archival research, whether as a result of budget cuts, climate conscious travel decisions, or lack of time 
               <ptr target="#wright_2023"/>. Thus, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> has developed a hybrid and sustainable digital workflow incorporating 
               both institutional and volunteer collaborators that flexibly supports an increasing corpus over multiple stages of transcription and 
               participation.
            </p>
            <p>By <word>hybrid</word>, <word>flexible</word>, and <word>sustainable</word>, we mean to gesture to the uneasy balance between physical 
               archives and digital databases and between individual contributions and <q>cleaned</q> large-scale data. These tensions underpin 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s digital workflow, as it transforms <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s large and dispersed physical archive 
               into a searchable database. <name>Ed Folsom</name>, one of the directors of the open-access <title rend="italic">Walt Whitman 
               Archive</title>, notes, <quote rend="inline">Often we will hear <word>archive</word> and <word>database</word> conflated, as if the two 
               terms signified the same imagined or idealized fullness of evidence</quote> <ptr target="#folsom_2007" loc="1575"/>. However, despite the 
               shared <quote rend="inline">desire for completeness</quote> in both archives and databases, archival attention to physical preservation does 
               not automatically dovetail with the detail and information that databases categorize. Even if <name>Edgeworth</name>'s letters were stored 
               in a single physical institution, users would access and use those physical letters in ways different from how those same letters would be 
               structured and presented in a database. <name>Folsom</name>'s metaphor of database as <quote rend="inline">rhizome</quote> is apt: 
               <quote rend="inline">the subterranean stem that grows every which way and represents the nomadic multiplicity of identity — no central root 
               but an intertwined web of roots</quote> <ptr target="#folsom_2007" loc="1573"/>. The iterative XML tagging process that 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> uses to create entities contributes to the larger <quote rend="inline">web</quote> of tagged persons, 
               places, and works within the archive, rather than focusing on the <quote rend="inline">central</quote> or chronological effort of quickly 
               uploading digital reproductions of the letters themselves.
            </p>
            <p><name>Folsom</name>'s metaphor that values the <quote rend="inline">intertwined web</quote> over the <quote rend="inline">central 
               root</quote> can also be translated to <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s data processing workflows. <title rend="italic">MELP</title> 
               approaches collecting, transcribing, and encoding through a lens that prioritizes editorial choices to retain as much of 
               <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence <q>as-is</q> rather than organizing or transforming that data into a <q>cleaned</q> version. By 
               <word>as-is</word>, we mean creating a digital corpus that represents <name>Edgeworth</name>'s original letters in a form as close to the 
               originals as possible, even if that means leaving in unclear word choices, unknown subject entities, and confusing or contradictory text. 
               The transcription checking and encoding process involves encoders making editorial choices rather than encoders functioning as data 
               <q>cleaners</q> who have to fix or correct data and then submit it to <name>Edgeworth</name> subject experts. Moreover, these encoders use a 
               flexible tagging structure that either links to or creates authority files for persons, places, and works, depending on whether those 
               entities appear in external authority services like VIAF, GeoNames, or Wikidata. Our process, then, views <q>cleaning</q> data not as a 
               singular process, but rather, as a complex, labor-intensive set of practices that align with the argument <name>Katie Rawson</name> and 
               <name>Trevor Muñoz</name> make in <title rend="quotes">Against Cleaning</title>. <ptr target="#rawson_munoz_2019" loc="280"/>. 
               <name>Rawson</name> and <name>Muñoz</name> challenge the assumption of an underlying order to data that renders human connection as 
               depressingly two-dimensional, which can be extrapolated to the complicated relationship connecting digital humanities and long 
               eighteenth-century studies with data in archives.
            </p>
            <p><title rend="italic">MELP</title> thus prioritizes data and its importance for archival study over narratorial unity. Viewing the humanist 
               goals of a digital humanities research project as separate from its data collection methodologies is a mistake that some humanist 
               researchers have made that ultimately undermines the <quote rend="inline">powerful critiques of the existing systems of data 
               analysis</quote> <ptr target="#rawson_munoz_2019" loc="281"/>. In eighteenth-century studies, there have been many critiques against 
               adopting digital methodologies without critically understanding those methods. For example, <name>Cassidy Holahan</name> positions 
               <title rend="italic">Eighteenth Century Collections Online</title> (<title rend="italic">ECCO</title>), the largest digital database 
               containing searchable facsimiles of eighteenth-century texts, as an <quote rend="inline">opaque archive</quote> 
               <ptr target="#holahan_2021" loc="804"/>. Holahan defines <quote rend="inline">opaqueness</quote> through the way scholars have approached 
               <title rend="italic">ECCO</title> as a natural resource without interrogating its <quote rend="inline">scope, biases, and [the] limitations 
               of its contents</quote> <ptr target="#holahan_2021" loc="804"/>. Tracking and making visible the forces, whether physical or ideological, 
               that shaped <title rend="italic">ECCO</title> helps dispel the <quote rend="inline">sense of comprehensiveness, authority, and neutrality 
               that hide the underlying history and decisions that have shaped the collection</quote> <ptr target="#holahan_2021" loc="824"/>. In a similar 
               fashion, our approach to <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence recognizes that our editorial voice might obscure the relationships 
               and networks in the corpus and seeks to address those implicit biases by giving a transparent account of our process and choices in this 
               essay. <title rend="italic">MELP</title> views each step of the corpora building process as an opportunity to reconceptualize how data can 
               be described and organized to embrace the <q>messiness</q> of the corpus itself. Our approach to <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence is 
               to capture, organize, and encode data without placing it into a larger narrative. In digitizing each letter, uploading it for crowdsourced 
               transcription, and then checking and encoding that transcription, the data's messiness is treated as inseparable from its meaning.
            </p>
            <p>The three different layers of our project — archive, transcription, and encoding — reveal the challenges inherent in uniting texts, people, 
               and institutions from different sources. While other archives seek to efface the distinctions between the disparate entities that comprise 
               them, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> embraces a transcription and encoding structure that promotes exchange with other sources while 
               preserving unique aspects of our data: while we do reformat images and some metadata from the more than thirty archives represented in 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>, we are still able to preserve unique archival and transcription aspects through the flexibility inherent 
               in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) schema and eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as data format. As <word>extensible</word> suggests, XML 
               was created with the intention of the data format being stretched to meet new use cases despite some limitations due to its hierarchical 
               nature. TEI, as a schema that is manifested in XML and that was created to deal with the intricacies of text, also supports 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s aims. Similarly, in the lists of people, places, and works that undergird our project, we have 
               prioritized linking to a series of named authorities to place our project in conversation with others, leaving room for lesser-known 
               entities that we establish ourselves — either through our own creation of name authorities or internal project documentation. There is also 
               an unwieldiness in the combination of institutional and volunteer labor that powers our project: the project is managed and coordinated 
               across four institutions located in four different states; the transcriptions have been largely supplied by volunteers through the 
               Zooniverse platform; and though institutionally-funded research assistants have standardized the transcriptions, the Talk boards and planned 
               annotations allow individual contributors to preserve their own voices. Through our descriptions of the different layers of 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>, we hope to model the ways in which a digital archive can flexibly embrace the diverse array of 
               contributions and contributors without flattening its data.<note>Our long-term goal is to create linked data for other entities, such as 
               keywords or subjects, but we identified the person, place, and works as the best starting point to intervene and transform 
               <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence archives into a useful database.</note>

            <p><title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s attention to <name>Maria Edgeworth</name> is part of a digital humanities lineage of projects that seek 
               to compile and publish manuscript correspondence of a single author or literary circle, which often reveals unknown, undertheorized, or 
               misunderstood aspects of the authors' lives and the world in which they lived. The <title rend="italic">Shelley-Godwin Archive</title>, the  
               <title rend="italic">Carlyle Letters Online</title>, <title rend="italic">The Walt Whitman Archive</title>, and 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title> exemplify the kind of work already done in this area of digital humanities, and each project 
               contributes to the broader understanding of how text encoding might be used to re-shape the canonical and historical understanding of their 
               central figures.<note><title rend="italic">Digital Dinah Craik</title> has also influenced our project. Their transcriptions and TEI letters 
               available through TAPAS (<ref target="https://tapasproject.org/node/443">https://tapasproject.org/node/443</ref>).</note> These 
               previous projects have provided a template for <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s sustainable process suitable for encoding over ten 
               thousand pages of correspondence while recognizing institutional collaborators (paid from the institutions hosting the project) and 
               volunteer collaborators (unpaid, often virtual, and external to the institutions). <title rend="italic">MELP</title> builds upon the 
               accomplishments of its predecessors by inviting the larger public to participate in the project and by ensuring the interoperability of its 
               letters and database while also prioritizing a non-hierarchical view of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s letters.
            </p>
            <p>Traditional standard and scholarly editions of correspondence have generally been published in print by university presses, though the 
               increasing turn to the digital has heralded the arrival of authoritative digital editions. Gone are the days when presses would greenlight 
               dozens of volumes dedicated to a single correspondence, such as <name>W.S. Lewis</name>'s 48-volume scholarly edition of 
               <name>Horace Walpole</name>'s correspondence published with Yale University Press. While the material heft of the print editions is 
               attractive, their cost — usually at least $100 a volume — is generally prohibitive to those unaffiliated with a large university library. 
               The accessibility and reach of digital editions is connected to a shift towards a greater democratization of knowledge and open access. 
               Moreover, traditional print editions prioritize a chronological presentation of correspondence, which can flatten the connections between 
               letters written at different times. A primary aim of <title rend="italic">MELP</title> is to create a digital database capable of capturing 
               the inherent complexity and <q>messiness</q> of a network as large as <name>Edgeworth</name>'s across a wide range of dates and recipients. 
               On a related note, one of the great strengths of digital editions of correspondence is that the text can easily be searching using the  
               original letter images and digital encoding is occassionally available in parallel. There are several projects, such as the 
               <title rend="italic">Carlyle Letters Online</title>, <title rend="italic">The Walt Whitman Archive</title>, and the 
               <title rend="italic">Shelley-Godwin Archive</title> that unite letter photographs, transcriptions, and encodings in a pop-up or diplomatic 
               presentation that is available to the public.<note>The <title rend="italic">Carlyle Letters</title> similarly uses Texas A&amp;M's corpora 
               database to structure its data. See 
               <ref target="https://carlyleletters.dukeupress.edu/about-editorial-methods/">https://carlyleletters.dukeupress.edu/about-editorial-methods/</ref>.</note> 
               By encoding the transcriptions, these archives signal their interoperability — the ability of these archives to exchange information with 
               other resources and each other, especially if sustainable file formats are used <ptr target="#munoz_viglianti_2015"/>.<note> File format, as 
               <name>Desmond Schmidt</name> has argued, can contribute to interoperability — for example, by providing separate txt and xml files in a 
               digital edition because markup standards vary by project <ptr target="#schmidt_2014" loc="14–15"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Much of the labor for these digital archives is funded and completed by institutions, though there is a turn towards pedagogy and 
               volunteerism that has influenced <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s structure and workflows. The 
               <title rend="italic">Carlyle Letters</title>, for instance, outsourced their encoding to DNC Data Systems of Mumbai, India, which was then 
               checked by a team of copyeditors. The <title rend="italic">Shelley-Godwin Archive</title>'s encoding has largely been performed by its 
               editorial team, though they signal their desire for the archive to become a collaborative project. The project that has served as a 
               collaboratively encoded model for <title rend="italic">MELP</title> since its inception and that has influenced our coding guidelines is 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title>.<note>See the <q>About</q> pages and documentation for each of these projects:

               (<title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title>).</note> <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title> is similarly concerned with 
               interoperability through its use of TEI and through its recruiting and training of volunteer coders.<note> The two goals of 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title> are <quote rend="inline">to produce the first comprehensive scholarly edition of the 
               works and letters of <name>Mary Russell Mitford</name>, and to share knowledge of TEI XML and other related humanities computing 
               practices with all serious scholars interested in contributing to the project</quote>. See 
               <ref target="https://digitalmitford.org/index.html">https://digitalmitford.org/index.html</ref>.</note> To these ends, the editors offer 
               a regular summer coding school that trains researchers in TEI through collaborating with their project. There is also an application process 
               to join the project as a scholarly editor. This project is more open to volunteers than most and contains excellent documentation: in their 
               description of <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title>, <name>Elisa Beshero-Bondar</name> and <name>Kellie Donovan-Condron</name> 
               highlight exactly how information between their project and others will be exchanged within the <quote rend="inline">network of linked data, 
               a digital database from which we can extract and study information we are collecting about people and texts of the nineteenth 
               century</quote> <ptr target="#beshero-bondar_donovan-condron_2017" loc="140"/>. They highlight the <quote rend="inline">systematic and 
               transferrable methods of editing and text encoding</quote> that they teach as well as careful forms of documentation as ways of making their 
               project both a collaborative and pedagogical enterprise <ptr target="#beshero-bondar_donovan-condron_2017" loc="192"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Learning TEI encoding, even with the help of a coding school, is a substantial investment that is also a barrier to participation, which is 
               why <title rend="italic">MELP</title> instead has invited volunteers to assist with initial letter transcription through the Zooniverse 
               platform. Zooniverse is <quote rend="inline">the world's largest and most popular platform for people-powered research…made possible by 
               volunteers…who come together to assist professional researchers</quote>.<note>See 
               <ref target="https://www.zooniverse.org/about">https://www.zooniverse.org/about</ref>.</note> Zooniverse is a crowdsourcing platform that 
               enables contributions to academic research without requiring specialized expertise. There is a wide range of projects: many of them are in 
               the sciences, and some of the most popular projects are related to identifying astronomical features and classifying nature. Volunteers are 
               able to contribute to these research projects through Zooniverse's user-friendly interface by answering straightforward questions, taking an 
               image survey, drawing shapes and figures, and transcribing text, the latter of which is central to <title rend="italic">MELP</title>. 
               Through our work with the <name>NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities</name>, <quote rend="inline">Building Capable 
               Communities for Crowdsourced Transcription</quote>, we spent an eighteen-month period building and establishing 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s Zooniverse website<note>See 
               <ref target="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mariaedgeworthletters/maria-edgeworth-letters">https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mariaedgeworthletters/maria-edgeworth-letters</ref>.</note>, 
               which was launched in spring 2022 and is in continuous use as we add more letters from archives to be transcribed.
            </p>
            <p>There have been numerous other scholarly editing projects similarly reliant on volunteer labor that are hosted through the Zooniverse 
               platform. The <title rend="italic">Davy Notebooks Project</title>, which aims to transcribe all 75 notebooks of 
               <name>Sir Humphry Davy</name> (1778-1829), arguably the most famous nineteenth-century chemist, will eventually be published online in 
               Lancaster Digital Collections. The 29 volumes in <title rend="italic">The Diaries of Michael Field</title> were also transcribed, at least 
               in part, by Zooniverse volunteers, and the eventual goal is to encode the letters in TEI <quote rend="inline">within a network of linked 
               resources</quote> to support interoperability. <title rend="italic">MELP</title> is most similar to <title rend="italic">The Diaries of 
               Michael Field</title>, as both projects combine volunteer transcription work with institutionally-funded encoding; the interconnectedness of 
               volunteer and institutional labor is manifested across <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s multiple layers and the flexible structure of the 
               project management, metadata, transcriptions, and encoding.

          <head>Data Organization and Project Management</head>
            <p>The central and initial challenges that <title rend="italic">MELP</title> and comparable digital archives have faced can be addressed with 
               strong project management: finding, securing, organizing, and getting permissions for the material that comprises the foundation of the 
               archive, as well as constructing the project team. Even though project management is <quote rend="inline">primarily used in business</quote>, 
               according to <name>Lynne Siemens</name>, for large-scale projects like <title rend="italic">MELP</title>, there is a 
               <quote rend="inline">growing need for public accountability by funding agencies and others which requires, even demands, successful project 
               completion facilitated by detailed and realistic planning</quote>, connected to the <quote rend="inline">coordination of people, financial 
               resources, and tasks</quote> <ptr target="#siemens_2021"/>.<note>The <name>NEH</name>, for example, requires that grant recipients complete 
               performance and, often, financial reports. See 
               <ref target="https://www.neh.gov/grants/manage/performance-reporting-requirement">https://www.neh.gov/grants/manage/performance-reporting-requirement</ref>.</note> 
               Collaborative digital work often goes underappreciated in the humanities because many college promotion and tenure guidelines prioritize 
               traditional publications, though they should, as <name>Kathleen Fitzpatrick</name> argues, <quote rend="inline">rethink the ways that we 
               give credit for such projects</quote> <ptr target="#fitzpatrick_2011"/>.<note>Fitzpatrick continues, <quote rend="inline">scholars have 
               frequently encountered obstacles to having non-print work given appropriate credit, and many scholars in the humanities also report 
               difficulty having their coauthored publications taken seriously as part of their record of production</quote> 
               <ptr target="#fitzpatrick_2011" loc="73"/>.</note> Because collaborative work incorporates the efforts of more individuals, the scope, 
               speed, and quality of such projects generally exceed the capabilities of a single individual, with the work and administrative burdens 
               shared <ptr target="#siemens_2015" loc="358"/>. Large-scale collaborative projects, however, need a project manager in order to be 
               successful: according to <name>Erik Ernø-Kjølhede</name>, <quote rend="inline">The central task of any project manager regardless of her 
               field is to navigate between the conflicting demands of time, cost and performance. The project manager constantly has to weigh these 
               demands against each other and trade off one against the other</quote> <ptr target="#erno-kjolhede_1999" loc="13"/>. Project management 
               makes it possible to negotiate the rhizomatic structure of <title rend="italic">MELP</title>, including project deliverables and deadlines, 
               personnel tasks and training, and the system of workflows developed generally by the librarians who have worked on 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>.<note>Copies of <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s workflows can be found in the 
               <title rend="quotes">Documentation</title> folder of our GitHub repository:

               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s workflows contain an <quote rend="inline"><q>authoritative</q> record of roles, tasks, outcomes and 
               relationships</quote> so that our work can be understood and reproduced by others <ptr target="#siemens_2015" loc="358"/>. Furthermore, good 
               project management benefits our student assistants: we aim, as <name>Siemens</name> does, for our students to see 
               <quote rend="inline">themselves as collaborators with few barriers between themselves and their supervisors</quote> and learn important 
               skills in project management and collaboration by working on interdisciplinary teams <ptr target="#siemens_2015" loc="357, 362"/>. Above 
               all, we agree with <name>Jason Boyd</name>, who views project management as <quote rend="inline">a key scholarly practice in the digital 
               humanities and in the humanities more broadly</quote> that makes <quote rend="inline">open to scrutiny many tacitly understood 
               practices</quote> <ptr target="#boyd_2022"/>.<note> The <quote rend="inline">four key foci</quote> <name>Boyd</name> identifies are 
               <quote rend="inline">defining the bargain with team members; translating between team members; facilitating perpetual peer review; and 
               researching scholarly exchange. Far from being an interloper into the digital humanities, project management and the project manager can be 
               a key practice and role in realising a more fulfilling ecosystem of scholarly exchange</quote> <ptr target="#boyd_2022"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Due to the dispersal of our project team — across five institutions in four states — project management has played an important role in 
               communication and in negotiation with archives regarding their <name>Edgeworth</name> holdings. <title rend="italic">MELP</title> began in 
               2017, but it was only in 2020, with the improvement of digital meeting technologies like Zoom and the more widespread digitization of 
               library manuscript holdings that project team meetings and <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s virtual archive became, respectively, more 
               regular and larger. Like the <title rend="italic">Walt Whitman Archive</title> and <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title><note>The 
               <title rend="italic">Walt Whitman Archive</title> brings together material from more than 50 repositories

               and there are 28 separate collections listed in <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title> 
               (<ref target="https://digitalmitford.org/lettersData.html">https://digitalmitford.org/lettersData.html</ref>).</note>, 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> has compiled and united material from over 30 archives and universities in <name>North America</name> and 
               <name>Europe</name> that was previously dispersed and, in some cases, unknown.<note>The project is currently supported by 31 institutions,

               <name>University of Virginia</name>, and <name>Vassar College</name>.</note> The hitherto gradual shift to digital resource sharing 
               accelerated during the pandemic, which meant that, to improve accessibility and promote scholarship under lockdown conditions, many of the 
               institutions that held pieces of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence were not only willing to digitize their materials, but also 
               provided them for free and occasionally published them on their own collections' websites<note>For other examples of increased resource 
               digitization during the pandemic, see <ptr target="#marek_2022"/> and <ptr target="#gross_2022"/>.</note>, especially the libraries located 
               at large North American universities (such as <name>Harvard University</name>'s <name>Houghton Library</name> and <name>Yale 
               University</name>'s <name>Beinecke Library</name>) and libraries that were large research institutions in and of themselves (the 
               <name>Huntington Library</name> and the <name>New York Public Library</name>). Bringing this correspondence together digitally is a 
               challenge, even after the pandemic, and requires the core workflow of the project to be agile in proportion to the responsiveness of each 
               institution. Communication with these institutions was the primary difficulty, especially early in the pandemic when many other scholars 
               were also requesting digitized material. The large amount of digitized manuscript material we were able to secure from these libraries has 
               been an important contribution to open-access scholarship, though the open, free, and collaborative resource sharing that marked the early 
               months of the pandemic is reverting in some cases to pre-2020 standards.<note>Questions about the future of the expanded access brought on 
               by the pandemic are addressed in the August 2021 webinar <title rend="quotes">Resource Sharing: What Will We Keep from the

               and the present copyright owner is unknown to the publisher. <name>Edgeworth</name> died in 1849, and after so much time, the present 
               copyright owner is unknown and unknowable. By this reasoning, we were able to convince English institutions to grant us access. Similarly, we 
               had protracted negotiations with the <name>Bibliothèque de Genève</name> about access and copyright, which were conducted in French. 
               The <name>Bibliothèque de Genève</name> holds <name>Edgeworth</name>'s interesting correspondence with the philosopher 
               <name>Etienne Dumont</name>, and after purchasing and receiving the images, we had to send a physical letter in French to request exemption 
               from the several thousand dollar publication fees to display the images since our archive is non-profit and will be open-access. Our 
               negotiations with the various libraries are a testament to the necessity of having a flexible approach when interacting with other 
               institutions.
            </p>
            <p>We also needed to be flexible in our use of metadata and our image processing decisions, which corresponded with the uneven levels of labor 
               in preparing letters for transcription and encoding. Different institutions provided different amounts of metadata about their letters: 
               sometimes we received no information besides <name>Edgeworth</name>'s authorship, while in other cases, dates, locations, and people 
               (connected with their name authorities) were provided. In all cases, we had to review and confirm or generate metadata associated with these 
               letters. It was rare for holding institutions to provide information beyond the author, recipient, and date. Occasionally the date was 
               incorrect because of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s difficult handwriting, or the author or recipient was unidentified or misidentified. These 
               details are important because one of the major contributions of <title rend="italic">MELP</title> is to provide a comprehensive global list 
               of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence. Metadata is necessary to provide an accurate accounting of letter location, author, recipient, 
               date, and permissions. We have tracked all of this information in a large spreadsheet (Figure 1), which will be available on our beta 
               website by spring 2024.

            <p>By compiling and gathering this data, it will be possible to attribute and acknowledge our letters correctly, and it will also be possible 
               for users to locate the physical letters themselves. Images correspondingly have been delivered in various file formats and sizes in line 
               with the internal guidelines of our partner institutions. While we have retained the original files and will display them on our archive, 
               before they can be transcribed, they need to be reduced to 1 MB to be uploaded on the Zooniverse platform. Handling image processing and 
               metadata from different institutions while preserving the original library content and reformatting it are other balancing acts our project 
               performs in order to prepare letter images for transcription on the Zooniverse interface.
            </p>
            <p>Besides Zooniverse, the applications the <title rend="italic">MELP</title> team uses most frequently to coordinate the project's work are 
               Google Drive, GitHub, and Zoom. Given the ubiquity of Google Drive, it has proved to be an effective tool for 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s inter-institutional collaboration. <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s Google Drive currently holds data 
               (e.g., transcribed letters and image files), documentation on processes, and completed scholarship on the project. While Google Drive has 
               many strengths, the <title rend="italic">MELP</title> team decided that some content, particularly XML documents, would be more effectively 
               shared, edited, and reviewed in a GitHub repository. The <title rend="italic">MELP</title> GitHub and its associated repositories were 
               created to meet this need. This decision did increase the barrier to participation, as few contributors had previously used GitHub, but the 
               benefits were worth the effort. In particular, the <title rend="italic">MELP</title> team found that it was hard to keep track of the 
               authoritative version of XML files, like the TEI template, on Google Drive. It also was difficult to suggest edits to particular lines of 
               code. By using GitHub, the project team was able to address these issues. We conducted two training sessions, one simply introducing the 
               platform and another hands-on workshop for committing and pushing content, to help institutional contributors gain familiarity with GitHub. 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> uses GitHub exclusively for XML documents and processes since Google Drive is sufficient for storing text 
               files and tabular metadata. And while Google Drive and GitHub effectively support asynchronous work, Zoom meetings have been essential to 
               collaboratively planning, managing, and working on <title rend="italic">MELP</title>. Given the inter-institutional nature of the project and 
               physical separation of the project team, having reliable video conferencing software like Zoom has allowed <title rend="italic">MELP</title> 
               to build momentum over the past three years through monthly meetings.

          <head>Transcription</head>
            <p><title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s commitment to a collaborative, inter-institutional approach is essential to the project beyond the 
               initial data management and project organization stage. Once the archival data has been gathered and organized, transcription begins, which 
               can take many forms depending on a project's desired outcomes. Other digital humanities archives have employed a variety of different labor 
               practices; these are largely institutional labor practices that rely on labor outsourced to computers, underpaid digital laborers, and 
               students. Using computers to do the majority of the transcription work would have been a feasible alternative to crowdsourcing. Handwritten 
               Text Recognition (HTR) engines have benefited from the recent and substantial developments in AI technology, and the appearance of HTR 
               technology in published research is <quote rend="inline">international and rapidly growing</quote> 
               <ptr target="#nockels_et_al_2022" loc="367"/>. Transkribus, in particular, is <quote rend="inline">the most commonly used HTR tool in the 
               cultural heritage space</quote>, with approximately 1700 monthly users. Yet an HTR engine like Transkribus would be in opposition to 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s collaborative goals, and relying on AI to transcribe letters moves us away from the most important 
               dimension of the humanities: the human. Involving volunteers and the public in larger research-based projects promotes 
               <quote rend="inline">citizen science</quote>, as <title rend="italic">MELP</title> is built on <quote rend="inline">researchers 
               interact[ing] with the public to achieve a collective goal</quote> that furthers the humanities 
               <ptr target="#nockels_et_al_2022" loc="377"/>. These <quote rend="inline">citizen scholars</quote> are essential to how we define 
               <q>collaboration</q> in the digital humanities, and they can more easily access and engage with digital humanities projects through online 
               crowdsourcing than through more <q>traditional</q>, or offline approaches <ptr target="#arbuckle_2019" loc="293–294"/>. 
               <ptr target="#brown_2016" loc="49"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Since <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s commitments to open-access and collaboration with the public are antithetical to using machine 
               labor for transcription, other alternatives include student labor or other outsourced, cheap labor. This <quote rend="inline">effacement of 
               student labor</quote>, whether student or outsourced, frequently occurs in digital projects, as <name>Spencer Keralis</name> argues 
               <ptr target="#keralis_2018" loc="278"/>. Students are institutionally used for labor through unpaid student internships, minimum wage 
               student employee positions, or faculty who integrate digital humanities (DH) project work into their syllabi under the auspices of gaining 
               translatable and collaborative skills. <name>Keralis</name> states that this practice is <quote rend="inline">naturalized into the fabric of 
               digital pedagogy</quote>, yet <quote rend="inline">student labor in the classroom is never not coerced</quote> since 
               <quote rend="inline">students will feel coerced to participate in the professor's project [...] even if an alternative assignment is 
               offered</quote> <ptr target="#keralis_2018" loc="278, 286"/>. In response to these labor practices, <name>Haley Di Pressi</name> et al. 
               argue that students earn the right to appear as project collaborators on any project to which they have made <quote rend="inline">substantive 
               contributions</quote> <ptr target="#di-pressi_et_al_2015"/>. <title rend="italic">MELP</title> has consistently followed the labor practices 
               outlined in the <title rend="quotes">Student Collaborator's Bill of Rights</title> by Di Pressi et al., which provides guidelines to prevent 
               the exploitation of students in any DH work setting, asserting that <quote rend="inline">[s]tudents should not perform mechanical labor 
               [...] without pay</quote> <ptr target="#di-pressi_et_al_2015" loc="¶5"/>. These forms of <quote rend="inline">mechanical labor</quote> and 
               detailed, single-action tasks are the same piecemeal assignments that DH project editors can alternately outsource using low-cost labor 
               platforms, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and this is a frequent practice. <name>Christlein</name> et al. outsourced labor for a 
               transcription project to <quote rend="inline">naïve transcribers</quote> in <name>Vietnam</name> and described this labor choice as 
               <quote rend="inline">cost-effective</quote> and <quote rend="inline">powerful</quote> <ptr target="#christlein_et_al_2018" loc="7"/>. 
               However, Mechanical Turk presents an ethically questionable solution in its frequent outsourcing of labor to developing countries as well as 
               to workers located in the <name>United States</name>. <name>Cushing</name> reported that Mechanical Turk workers were making an average of 
               $1.50 per hour; seven years later, <name>Hara</name> et al. reported this average as $2 per hour <ptr target="#cushing_2012" loc="¶22"/> 
               <ptr target="#hara_et_al_2018" loc="11"/>. <name>Fred Benenson</name>'s <title rend="italic">Emoji Dick</title> (2019) is one such digital 
               project 
               that was finished through the outsourced labor of hundreds of anonymous workers employed by Mechanical Turk. Workers were paid five cents 
               for every sentence of <name>Herman Melville</name>'s <title rend="italic">Moby-Dick</title> (1851) that they translated into emoji; they 
               were also paid two cents for each vote on the best translation for each sentence <ptr target="#benenson_2010" loc="vii"/>. Although the 
               Mechanical Turk employees who worked on <title rend="italic">Emoji Dick</title> made creative decisions, both by translating sentences into 
               emoji and by voting for the best translation, no one who participated in the creation of the text is not individually credited, except for 
               <name>Benenson</name>.<note><title rend="italic">Emoji Dick</title> asserts that the text has been <quote rend="inline">edited and compiled 
               by <name>Fred Benenson</name></quote>, with <quote rend="inline">Translation by Amazon Mechanical Turk</quote>. The text's front matter 
               discloses that <quote rend="inline">over eight hundred people spent approximately 3,795,980 seconds working to create this book</quote>

            </p>
            <p>Instead of relying on cheaply outsourced or unpaid student labor, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> employs a flexible, hybrid model of 
               volunteer labor and institutional labor.<note>We do not use unpaid student labor in our project. Any graduate and undergraduate student 
               contributions have been supported through funded research assistantships.</note> Over the course of <title rend="italic">MELP</title>, 
               undergraduate and graduate student workers have been employed by the four host institutions, and these students have all been paid hourly wages 
               and are recognized as collaborators. As for all of the Zooniverse volunteers, they are individually credited for their transcriptions and 
               annotations on the Zooniverse project page, and their usernames (and real names if they chose to share them) will also appear in the completed 
               digital archive. Crowdsourcing through volunteer-based platforms like Zooniverse, where labor is voluntary and non-coercive, provides an 
               ethical alternative to questionable labor practices. While many of the digital archives that have served as models for ours do not have an open 
               mechanism for accepting volunteer contributions, one of the strengths of <title rend="italic">MELP</title> is its large volunteer presence, 
               which is evidenced by our work using the Zooniverse platform. The importance of <quote rend="inline">collective intelligence</quote> is the 
               throughline of <name>James Surowiecki</name>'s <title rend="italic">The Wisdom of Crowds</title>, in which he argues that 
               <quote rend="inline">[i]f you put together a big enough and diverse enough group of people and ask them to <quote rend="inline">make decisions 
               affecting matters of general interest</quote>, that group's decisions will, over time, be <quote rend="inline">intellectually [superior] to the 
               isolated individual</quote>, no matter how smart or well-informed he is</quote> <ptr target="#surowiecki_2004" loc="xvii"/>. Such 
               <quote rend="inline">collective intelligence</quote> can be harnessed through digital platforms such as Zooniverse. More than a million 
               volunteers come together <quote rend="inline">to enable research that would not be possible, or practical, otherwise</quote>.<note>More

               Through the Zooniverse platform, volunteers are able to transcribe letters simultaneously to achieve consensus with multiple others. The 
               transcription task interface is logical and contains instructions, as is shown in Figure 2.

            <p>Zooniverse projects are required to conform to set templates that permit a limited amount of information directly in the interface, so we also 
               included a Field Guide and Tutorial (visible in Figure 2) to share additional information. In fact, many of the entries in the Field Guide were 
               suggested by volunteers, who had questions about the ampersand, the <name>Edgeworth</name> family, how to handle numbers and tables, common but 
               difficult to read names within the correspondence, and how to approach stray pink underline marks. Some of the volunteers even generated 
               language for the Field Guide, including the entry on the different colors of underline marks.<note>The Field Guide can be viewed as a pull-out 
               menu on the right edge of <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s Talk boards on Zooniverse:

            </p>
            <p>The Talk boards on Zooniverse are another way for volunteers to interact directly with researchers by posting a comment related to a letter 
               after finishing a transcription or on the general message boards. There have been hundreds of posts on these message boards, which is a 
               testament to the dedication of our volunteers, who tend to be, as <name>Melissa Terras</name> writes about crowdsourcing volunteers, 
               <quote rend="inline">highly motivated and skilled individuals</quote> who are <quote rend="inline">committed to the project for the long term,

               One of the earliest contributions to <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s Talk boards is a handwriting guide called <quote rend="inline">Tips 
               for Transcribing <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s Handwriting</quote> that began as an undergraduate research assistantship project to advise 
               transcribers on reading Romantic era handwriting and tricky letters. The guide now has substantial contributions from volunteers, including 
               entries addressing particular words, letters, and names, as well as connections to other Zooniverse projects.<note><name>Ivy Kiernan</name>'s

               The interactions between volunteers and researchers on the Talk boards also serve a pedagogical function, as researchers share information on 
               <name>Edgeworth</name> and the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which she lived. Recent discussions have touched on women's rights 
               during the Regency period and plays from the Romantic period by <name>Sir Walter Scott</name> and <name>Joanna Baillie</name>.<note>Respectively,

               We are currently compiling and aggregating volunteer comments so that their work can be cited within our digital archive<note>We cite 
               volunteers by their usernames unless they have agreed to share their actual names with us. See:

               which will incorporate annotation functionality so that later viewers can also contribute comments. The various formats and contributors of 
               these annotations comprise another layer of <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s messiness, but they allow contributors to engage and be 
               recognized for their work in the humanities, in turn encouraging more engagement on our project <ptr target="#terras_2015" loc="435"/>.

            <p>While the volunteer collaborators provide initial manuscript transcriptions and notes, as well as, eventually, annotations, the institutional 
               collaborators generally check the transcriptions and encode them in TEI. Once a letter has been completed on Zooniverse, research assistants on 
               the <title rend="italic">MELP</title> project team can view the transcription marks through Zooniverse's Aggregate Line Inspector/Collaborative 
               Editor (ALI/CE), which aggregates all volunteer transcriptions of each line and statistically chooses the most likely correct transcription, in 
               order to correct and process the transcription of the entire letter. Although one transcription is ultimately selected or composed by research 
               assistants, Figure 3 provides an example of the multiple contributions we receive for a single line within a letter.

            </figure>
            <p>This process of reviewing and reconciling volunteer transcriptions through ALI/CE is a large part of the transcription workflow, or the process 
               by which a transcription is reviewed and processed in preparation for TEI encoding, the standard for the representation of texts in digital 
               form. Line breaks, page breaks, and tags for underlined, superscript, added, and deleted text, all noted by volunteers during transcriptions, 
               are preserved in this process. However, before texts can be encoded, the people, places, and works mentioned in the letters need to be 
               accounted for so that they can be reconciled with existing name authorities (i.e., files that establish standardized spellings and forms for  
               each entity) and made discoverable in our database. From checking the transcription to amending the <q>ography</q> files, the process of 
               selecting which files to work on often happens in back-and-forth stages. This process can lead to unexpected connections, corrections, and 
               editorial decisions. For example, research assistants working on the letters may be unfamiliar with aspects of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s life 
               that are well known to the project editors, who are <name>Edgeworth</name> scholars. Working together over Zoom or exchanging emails allows 
               the process to be collaborative, opening up opportunities to revise a given letter and then apply the new information to other letters. The 
               final part of our workflow extends this flexible and interoperable process by transforming the corrected transcriptions and associated entities 
               into digitally encoded TEI files.

          <head>Encoding</head>
            <p>After letters have been transcribed and converted to plain text, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> researchers encode the files in TEI 
               (Text Encoding Initiative), an application of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and a standard of representation that has been used by humanists 
               since 1994 to create machine-readable digital texts. Many museums, archives, and digital projects like ours use TEI because of its 
               interoperability with other projects and because it is flexible enough to grow with the corpus as more materials are added regardless of the 
               type of database chosen. <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s use of TEI is most visible in the creation of two types of documents: 1) encoded 
               letters, and 2) indices of named entities (<q>ography</q> files).<note>Examples of both types of documents are present on the project's 
               GitHub repository: 
               <ref target="https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/tree/main">https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/tree/main</ref>.</note> 
               The suffix <q>ography</q> is typically associated with the <quote rend="inline">names of descriptive sciences</quote>, such as research that 
               involves classifying and categorizing <ptr target="#ography_n._2023"/>. We thus use the term <q>ography</q>, which derives from the standard 
               TEI <term>prosopography</term>, to refer to our entity naming and encoding processes for people (<term>personography</term>), places 
               (<term>placeography</term>), and textual works (<term>workography</term>). In selecting controlled names for entities within the <q>ography</q> 
               files (where matches were possible), three authorities were privileged: the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) for persons, GeoNames 
               for places, and Wikidata for works.<note> The locations of these authorities are: <ref target="https://viaf.org/">https://viaf.org/</ref> (VIAF), 
               <ref target="https://www.geonames.org/">https://www.geonames.org/</ref> (GeoNames), and 
               <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page</ref> (Wikidata).</note> These 
               authorities were chosen because they are widely used, match the expected domains of knowledge, can be edited by team members, and support URIs 
               (Uniform Resource Identifiers) that are dereferenceable and content negotiable. Wikidata and GeoNames are completely open to public editing 
               while additions to VIAF, an aggregator of authorities, can be made through the <name>Library of Congress Name Authority Cooperative</name> 
               (<name>NACO</name>). Using these authorities allows <title rend="italic">MELP</title> to create a searchable structure without imposing a 
               definitive hierarchy or interpretation of the materials that is predicated on a specific narrative of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s life. Each 
               person, place, and title is given the same weight in the linked open data, which translates in the database as a <q>choose your own 
               adventure</q>; users can look for specific terms rather than through a traditional linear arrangement of the correspondence. Additionally, by 
               dividing the encoding workflow into the expansion of <q>ography</q> files, which can be completed on a spreadsheet, and iterative TEI creation, 
               which requires XML editing software, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> enables a diverse labor structure in which non-TEI experts can 
               contribute and cross-institutional collaboration is streamlined, as our encoding and linked data practices encourage information sharing with 
               other institutions and entities.

            <p>Many other projects construct their data internally without consideration of external name authorities or integration with other digital 
               projects. When citing data, most projects have custom mechanisms for authoring biographies and creating annotations. In the 
               <title rend="italic">Willa Cather Archive</title>, for example, the entry for <name>Jane Austen</name> reads: <quote rend="block">Born in 
               <name>Steventon Parish</name>, <name>Hampshire</name>, <name>England</name>, <name>Jane Austen</name> began writing at an early age, and much of 
               her precociously satiric juvenilia has been preserved. By the mid-1790s she had written early versions of <title rend="italic">Sense and 
               Sensibility</title> (1811) and <title rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</title> (1813). These were followed by <title rend="italic">Mansfield 
               Park</title> (1814) and <title rend="italic">Emma</title> (1815), all published anonymously. <title rend="italic">Northanger Abbey</title> and 
               <title rend="italic">Persuasion</title> were published after her death. <name>Austen</name>'s reputation increased during the nineteenth century 
               as she became a part of the canon of the English novel. <name>Willa Cather</name> acknowledged <name>Austen</name>'s importance but does not 
               discuss her.</quote><note>A link to <name>Jane Austen</name>'s prosopography from the <title rend="italic"><name>Willa Cather</name> 
               Archive</title> can be found in <name>Willa Cather</name>'s letter to <name>Carrie Miner Sherwood</name> on 28 June 1939:

            <p>It's a detailed prosopography, or description of <name>Austen</name>'s life and works within the context of the larger project, here 
               <name>Cather</name>'s letters. Most of the entry is a biography that replicates biographical information that could be found elsewhere on the 
               web (though these are more useful for figures who are not easily discoverable), with one sentence connecting her to the <name>Cather</name> 
               archive. This practice of creating prosopographies is a central task of many digital archives, including <title rend="italic">The Letters of 
               <name>Charlotte Mary Yong</name>e</title>, <title rend="italic">The <name>Olive Schreiner</name> Letters Online</title>, and the

               data</quote> by combining <quote rend="inline">scholarly tools such as the TEI with para-scholarly genealogical databases and recently digitized

               <ptr target="#fukushima_bourrier_parker_2022" loc="¶3"/>.</note> These entries can be detailed and time-consuming due to the

               academic information resources</quote> <ptr target="#fukushima_bourrier_parker_2022" loc="¶29"/>.<note> As the <title rend="italic">Syriac 
               Persons, Events, and Relations</title> (<title rend="italic">SPEAR</title>) project notes, new approaches to prosopography might focus more on 
               the relationship editors create through <quote rend="inline">the scholar's interpretation of what a historical source asserts about a 
               person</quote> instead of a readily identifiable <q>fact</q> in an external authority file or database. Given the emphasis on broad network 
               relationships in <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> chose to focus less on deep prosopography, 
               even though the case <title rend="italic">SPEAR</title> makes for <quote rend="inline">factoid prosopography</quote> is compelling 
               <ptr target="#schwartz_gibson_torabi_2022" loc="5"/>.</note> While <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence is rich in potentially 
               prosopographical subjects, prosopography is rarely accessible or reviewable beyond the constraints of the project, which works directly against 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s goals.
            </p>
            <p>Instead of following the prosopography model of these other projects, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> has focused on links between it and 
               other authorities as a way of contributing to open linked data. For example, <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s entry for <name>Jane 
               Austen</name> merely consists of the title of her name authority file (Austen, Jane, 1775-1817) and the link to her Virtual International 
               Authority File (<ref target="http://viaf.org/viaf/102333412">http://viaf.org/viaf/102333412</ref>), which contains related names and works in a 
               series of links instead of a prose paragraph. <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s use of open linked data is modeled by 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Mitford</title>, which uses <quote rend="inline">a growing network of linked data, a digital database from which we 
               can extract and study information we are collecting about people and texts of the nineteenth century</quote> 
               <ptr target="#beshero-bondar_donovan-condron_2017" loc="141"/>. Such a network <quote rend="inline">make[s] available hitherto unknown data 
               about publishers of periodicals, theatre managers and actors, poets, artists, as well as politicians and educators — an extensive network bonded 
               by mutual influence and support</quote> <ptr target="#beshero-bondar_donovan-condron_2017" loc="141"/>. Following in this tradition of linked 
               data, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> uses the <q>ography</q> files to create an iterative tagging process that draws upon the full titles of 
               personography, placeography, and workography. We identified people, places, and works as the three most important elements to our current 
               project, allowing us to track the individuals within <name>Edgeworth</name>'s community of correspondence, the places she traveled to or 
               mentioned, and the works she read and discussed. These three categories, we felt, would address some of the most pressing research questions 
               that future database users would have. Each entity is defined through a unique <code>@xml:id</code> value, which is used to link mentions within 
               letters to the project's authoritative textual form of the name as well as external authority URIs where applicable.<note>For more information 
               on <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s <code>@xml:id</code> conventions, see our documentation on GitHub: 
               <ref target="https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/blob/main/Documentation/XML_ID_Conventions.pdf">https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/blob/main/Documentation/XML_ID_Conventions.pdf</ref>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Personographies and placeographies, like <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s, are common in the TEI landscape<note>Some examples of projects 
               with placeographies that influenced our own include the <title rend="italic">Map of Early Modern <name>London</name></title> 
               (<ref target="https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/encode_persons.htm">https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/encode_persons.htm</ref>) and the 
               <title rend="italic"><name>Michael Leary</name> Letters</title>

               though project-specific decisions needed to be made. For example, the team decided not to include some attributes like gender or sex attributes 
               in the personography, in alignment with the <name>Program for Cooperative Cataloging</name>'s practice for <name>Library of Congress</name> 
               authority records <ptr target="#billey_et_al_2022"/>.<note>The report states: <quote rend="inline">Do not record the RDA gender element (MARC 
               375) in personal name authority records. Delete existing 375 fields when editing a record for any other reason.</quote> Other library sources, 
               such as the <name>Trans Metadata Collective</name>'s <title rend="quotes">Metadata Best Practices for Trans and Gender Diverse Resources</title> 
               also recommend not specifying gender unless it is essential and the individuals being described have self-identified their gender. Given that 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> deals exclusively with historical figures, self-identification is not possible, and attempts to interpret 
               gender identity from other sources can easily be biased.</note> Rather than using all of the elements and attributes present in TEI to help 
               describe a person, such as birth, nationality, and occupation, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> instead has focused on finding existing 
               authority URIs for these individuals that typically include this information externally. Because the URIs for the authorities 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> selected are content negotiable, this specific information can be theoretically retrieved as RDF (Resource 
               Description Framework) simply by using the URI. For instance, the URI associated with the place <q><name>Edgeworthstown</name></q> 
               (<ref target="http://sws.geonames.org/2964434">http://sws.geonames.org/2964434</ref>) returns information on alternate names, population, 
               latitude, and longitude (Figure 4).

            <figure>

               <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>This information is communicated in semantic triples, or sets of three entities, which include a subject, predicate, and object. Because of 
               this, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> did not create exhaustive entries for the persons and places it lists in the personography and 
               placeography. For entities that do not have established name authorities, we explore newspaper, scholarly, and genealogical databases for 
               information, similar to the creators of <title rend="italic">Digital Dinah Craik</title>. Thus, within our personography, we either embed key 
               entities within a larger network of linked data or, when necessary, create them ourselves, making our project a flexible resource in dialogue 
               with other networks of projects and individuals that allows those with content expertise to participate without additional barriers. 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s third <q>ography</q> file, the workography, is — to our knowledge — unique in its content and scope since 
               there are no existing workography examples, though it resembles the personography and placeography files. <name>Edgeworth</name>'s letters 
               include numerous references to her own novels and short stories as well as to the works of her contemporaries, such as 
               <name>Walter Scott</name> and <name>Frances Burney</name>, so documenting these connections in a separate workography file is essential for 
               researchers. Because of this, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> needed to devise the XML structure of the file to meet the project's needs. The 
               project team contacted the TEI listserv on 4 November 2022 to get input on this dilemma. None of the responses we received directly addressed 
               our use case. The elements <code>listBibl</code> and <code>bibl</code> form the backbone of this <q>ography</q> file. The TEI was flexible 
               enough to also allow <title rend="italic">MELP</title> to model works within works, which is especially important for referencing 
               <name>Edgeworth</name>'s short stories (see Figure 5).
            </p>
            <figure>
               <head>Works within works present in the workography. <code>@corresp</code> is used to link short stories, essays, etc. to their parent 
                  works.</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>We adapted <code>@corresp</code> to indicate how works within the workography are related to one another, which is particularly helpful for 
               tracking works within other works, such as <name>Edgeworth</name>'s individual short fictions in her larger collections of tales. This 
               <q>ography</q> file will allow scholars to track allusions to literary and non-literary texts across <name>Edgeworth</name>'s entire 
               correspondence. Instead of charting loose affinities based on similar publishing periods or identifying one instance of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s 
               direct commentary, users will be able to see all appearances of a text within the archive, creating new critical pathways. Thus, by creating 
               the three <q>ography</q> files, <title rend="italic">MELP</title> has been able to generate its own linked data system that can be represented 
               in standardized TEI tags within the letters and in the entities listed in our Corpora-based searchable database.
            </p>
            <p>The <q>ography</q> files, alongside other typographical features, provide the basis for encoding transcribed letters in 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> into a template following the <title rend="italic">TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and 
               Interchange</title>.<note> Our TEI template is available in the <title rend="italic">MELP</title> GitHub repository: 
               <ref target="https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/blob/main/TEItemplate.xml">https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/blob/main/TEItemplate.xml</ref>.</note> 
               After a letter has been transcribed on Zooniverse, there is a multi-step process that we have developed for encoding the letter and defining 
               entities in the appropriate <q>ography</q> file.<note>For further information about our TEI encoding practices, please see the 
               <title rend="quotes">Edgeworth TEI Workflow</title> document in <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s GitHub repository: 
               <ref target="https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/blob/main/Documentation/Edgeworth%20TEI%20Workflow.pdf">https://github.com/Maria-Edgeworth-Letters-Project/me-tei/blob/main/Documentation/Edgeworth%20TEI%20Workflow.pdf</ref>.</note> 
               Using metadata either directly from the institution the letter is held in or metadata gathered after examining the letter itself, the encoder 
               records in the TEI header the author, the recipient, their locations, the date on which the letter was sent, and the institution in which it is 
               housed. The component parts of each letter (opener, salute, body, closer, postscript, and address) are encoded according to the correspondence 
               structure from the TEI guidelines, retaining line breaks, paragraph breaks, and page breaks. During this encoding process, which follows 
               standard TEI guidelines, researchers tag each <code>persName</code>, <code>placeName</code>, and <code>title</code> with a corresponding 
               <code>@ref</code>, linking back to the local name authority files created through the <q>ography</q> process. Step-by-step instructions are 
               available on <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s Google Drive. Given the detailed TEI workflow that all members of the project team can access, 
               the process of encoding each letter does not require extensive coding experience. By separating the processes for tracking down named entities 
               and encoding the letters, <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s approach allows a wider variety of collaborators to participate in the project, 
               from tenured faculty and librarians to graduate and undergraduate researchers, including a recent group of the latter who were paid to learn 
               TEI in a summer 2023 undergraduate institute co-hosted by <name>Wake Forest University</name> and <name>Xavier University of Louisiana</name>.
            </p>
            <p>The wide variety of contributors to the project necessitates detailed instructions, both for creating encoded letters and <q>ography</q> files, 
               so that contributors can complete the work consistently and ensure that future contributors can be onboarded in a timely fashion. Starting from 
               step one through the final step, if a person has a basic working knowledge of TEI, they can encode for <title rend="italic">MELP</title>. 
               We believe that ecentralizing the knowledge required to contribute to <title rend="italic">MELP</title> and specifically tailoring our TEI 
               template and <q>ography</q> files to be replicable without long-term training are key to producing a project that has long-term sustainability. 
               As people leave and join the project, this relatively low barrier to entry minimizes the risk that the project will not be completed or 
               maintained; distributing the knowledge and creating the <q>ography</q> files has helped <title rend="italic">MELP</title> grow quickly and 
               deeply. The <q>ography</q> files, which establish <code>xml:id</code> values for entities mentioned in the letters are a good example of this 
               as they require limited technical knowledge. Each <q>ography</q> file is built in a spreadsheet that creates associations between the internal 
               <code>xml:id</code> for each person, place, or work and how that person, place, or work will appear in our Corpora database. 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> decided to use spreadsheets as the foundation for the <q>ography</q> files so that any person who can input 
               data into a spreadsheet will be able to contribute to the project's growing dataset.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>The flat spreadsheet data is then transformed into TEI using an export template written in the Google Refine Expression Language (GREL) within 
               OpenRefine (Figure 6). As data is continually added to the spreadsheets, TEI can be regenerated using the existing export template. 
               Instructions have been written to ensure the sustainability of the project and remove barriers to others contributing. Distributing this labor 
               has allowed <title rend="italic">MELP</title> to reconcile the divide Brown, Clements, and Grundy describe as the choice between

               model</quote> <ptr target="#brown_clements_grundy_2006" loc="324"/>. Our approach to <name>Maria Edgeworth</name>'s vast correspondence offers 
               a model that invites greater complexity and intentional work amongst a small group of scholars (institutional collaborators) as well as 
               pursuing an open collaborative model through using Zooniverse to transcribe <name>Edgeworth</name>'s letters (volunteer collaborators). A broad 
               overview of how the different processes covered in this article work together to create a digital archive appears in Figure 7. By defining 
               these steps, from letter acquisition to encoding, we can visually demonstrate how our labor is distributed and provide guidance for similar 
               projects.

          <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>The undergraduate encoders and Zooniverse volunteers demonstrate <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s public scope beyond the institutionally 
               employed professors, librarians, and graduate research assistants. Their contributions will appear within a full-text and entity-searchable 
               database that will be available on <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s public website by spring 2024. The database will unite all of the 
               various types of labor within <title rend="italic">MELP</title>: the metadata collection, the crowdsourced transcription, the <q>ography</q> 
               files, and the text encoding. <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s database has been built in Corpora, a no-SQL database, or a database that 
               stores data in a format other than relational tables.<note>Documentation for Corpora can be found here: 
               <ref target="https://gitlab.dh.tamu.edu/bptarpley/corpora">https://gitlab.dh.tamu.edu/bptarpley/corpora</ref>.</note> No-SQL databases are 
               ideal for projects like <title rend="italic">MELP</title> that have a constantly changing number of entities and thus require structural 
               flexibility. To maintain the larger <q>web</q> of tagged persons, places, and works within the archive and transfer it to a database structure, 
               a No-SQL structure is essential. Corpora has successfully supported a number of digital humanities projects, including 
               <title rend="italic"><name>Carlyle</name> Letters Online</title> and the <title rend="italic">New Variorum <name>Shakespeare</name></title>. 
               Within the database, people, places, and works are tagged within each letter and linked to all other letters that mention those entities 
               (Figure 8).

               <graphic url="resources/images/figure08.png"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The output from Corpora will soon be connected to <hi rend="italic">MELP</hi>'s public WordPress website so that other researchers and members 
               of the general public can use the database to search and explore the <name>Edgeworth</name> correspondence, assembled through various 
               methodologies and by numerous contributors.
            </p>
            <p>Critical to this user experience, Corpora enables the retention of messy data yet capitalizes upon existing linked data structures, like 
               controlled vocabularies, when appropriate. It maps the <q>messiness</q> of <hi rend="italic">MELP</hi>'s corpus to established terms and URIs 
               for people, places, and works. Corpora allows us to both show the original, sometimes familiar, references to these entities in the letters and 
               link out to regularized names and authoritative data. Clicking on a given entity allows the user to see other letters associated with that 
               entity along with the variety of ways it has been referred to in those sources, with external links to established vocabularies, if identified. 
               When present, external URIs share valuable information, like birth dates for people and coordinates for places. Nevertheless, these external 
               links are optional and only associated with an entity when this application can be done with certainty. In this way, Corpora supports two 
               different webs users can traverse: an internal web of entities mentioned within the letters and an external web of linked data sources. Having 
               both webs available to users allows <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence to retain the messiness inherent to a correspondence network this 
               wide in scope, varied in content, and written over decades across the beginning and end of two centuries. Ultimately, 
               <title rend="italic">MELP</title> privileges the letters, with their inclusion of incomplete names, misspellings, and sometimes unclear text, 
               as our final authority and the source with which most users should primarily interact.
            </p>
            <p>Although the project output on Corpora and WordPress will be the project's primarily public interfaces, we want to close by noting that while 
               database and website technologies may change, the building blocks of our project — the plain text (.txt) and extensible markup (.xml) documents 
               — are purposefully written in file formats known for their simplicity, longevity, and usability. This is the last and, perhaps, the most 
               important aspect of <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s flexibility. The .txt and .xml files that populate our Google Drive and GitHub 
               repositories are key in facing <title rend="italic">MELP</title>'s largest challenge: preservation. Choosing to create a digital archive is 
               itself an act of preservation in that a <quote rend="inline">suite of tools, operations, standards, and policies</quote> are necessary to 
               <quote rend="inline">help ensure that this investment is not squandered</quote> <ptr target="#conway_2010" loc="65"/>. Yet 
               <name>Drew VandeCreek</name>'s study clocks the longevity of most NEH-funded digital humanities projects at between eleven and sixteen 
               years.<note>For example, funding lapsed for our sister project that is based in <name>Oxford</name> and <name>Ireland</name>, the 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Edgeworth Network</title> 
               (<ref target="https://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/people/digital-edgeworth-network">https://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/people/digital-edgeworth-network</ref>) 
               at the end of November 2021. <name>Barone</name>, <name>Zeitlyn</name>, and <name>Mayer-Schonberger</name> have suggested that 
               <quote rend="inline">a sort of fatal creeping obsolescence can occur that is caused by a mix of under-funding, lack of investment in technical 
               updating and neglect</quote> <ptr target="#barone_zeitlyn_mayer-schonberger_2015" loc="‘creeping’"/>. <name>Lucky</name> and <name>Harkema</name> 
               have noted that <quote rend="inline">the products of grant funded digital projects have the tendency to be left to bit rot on the open Web, or 
               disappear entirely, not long after the money runs out</quote> <ptr target="#lucky_harkema_2018" loc="191"/>. See also 
               <ptr target="#cummings_2023"/>.</note> Funding issues and obsolete file formats or programs are often the cause of this obsolescence. Our final 
               act of collaborative project management has been to select plain text files and eXtensible Markup Language documents, which can be edited with 
               a variety of applications, as means to promote the longevity and interoperability of the project amidst the inevitable shifts in website and 
               database technologies. Even if, when we reach the end of our project, we are unable to acquire, transcribe, and encode all ten thousand sheets 
               of <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence, the material that we do assemble in our open-access digital archive should resist obsolescence and 
               remain the authoritative source for <name>Edgeworth</name>'s correspondence for years to come.
