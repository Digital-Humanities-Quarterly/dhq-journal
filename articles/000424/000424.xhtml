                  <p>This article unpacks the archival, textual, and encoded layers that comprise the <cite class="title italic">Maria Edgeworth Letters Project</cite> 
                     (<cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>), an open-access digital archive containing the correspondence of the Anglo-Irish
                     Regency author 
                     Maria Edgeworth and her circle. These layers reveal the impossibility of flattening or standardizing
                     our work and instead 
                     advocate for a more inclusive and collaborative digital humanities model that accommodates
                     both institutional and volunteer labor. Just as 
                     different methods were used to approach each archive and manage our project across
                     multiple institutions, each transcription requires a 
                     different level of care, especially as various notes and collaborators are cited in
                     the final project. Through the use of TEI, we can 
                     flexibly represent diverse aspects of each letter while still maintaining a database-readable
                     structure. We endeavor to connect each person, 
                     place, or work identified in Edgeworth's letters and our database to a larger network of linked data in order to place our
                     
                     project in conversation with other archival resources. For entities that are unidentified
                     or unknown, we create new name authority files 
                     or produce internal data files that can be viewed by our collaborators and users.
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s flexible structure 
                     thus allows it to strive for interoperability while refusing to efface the individual
                     traces of its collaborators, entities, and material 
                     artifacts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">The Anglo-Irish Regency author Maria Edgeworth (1768-1859) was “the most commercially successful novelist 
                     of her age” [<a class="ref" href="#mccormack_2004">McCormack 2004</a>], yet her important, sprawling correspondence has only been published in excerpts
                     and 
                     partial editions up to this point.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e318">[1]</a> The 
                     primary goal of the <cite class="title italic">Maria Edgeworth Letters Project</cite> (<cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>) is to produce a 
                     searchable corpus of Maria Edgeworth's correspondence, which contains over ten thousand sheets spread across more than
                     forty 
                     institutions. In addition to the infrastructural obstacles to accessing and collating
                     Edgeworth's letters is the reality that 
                     a physical edition would be unwieldy as a research tool and unlikely to be completed.
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s choice to produce 
                     a digital archive was also influenced by changing institutional funding structures.
                     Researchers continue to face difficult choices when 
                     doing archival research, whether as a result of budget cuts, climate-conscious travel
                     decisions, or lack of time 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wright_2023">Wright 2023</a>]. Thus, <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> has developed a hybrid and sustainable digital workflow incorporating 
                     both institutional and volunteer collaborators that flexibly supports an increasing
                     corpus over multiple stages of transcription and 
                     participation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">By <em class="word">hybrid</em>, <em class="word">flexible</em>, and <em class="word">sustainable</em>, we mean to gesture to the uneasy balance between physical 
                     archives and digital databases and between individual contributions and “cleaned” large-scale data. These tensions underpin 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s digital workflow, as it transforms Maria Edgeworth's large and dispersed physical archive 
                     into a searchable database. Ed Folsom, one of the directors of the open-access <cite class="title italic">Walt Whitman 
                        Archive</cite>, notes, “Often we will hear <em class="word">archive</em> and <em class="word">database</em> conflated, as if the two 
                     terms signified the same imagined or idealized fullness of evidence” [<a class="ref" href="#folsom_2007">Folsom 2007</a>, 1575]. However, despite the 
                     shared “desire for completeness” in both archives and databases, archival attention to physical preservation does
                     
                     not automatically dovetail with the detail and information that databases categorize.
                     Even if Edgeworth's letters were stored 
                     in a single physical institution, users would access and use those physical letters
                     in ways different from how those same letters would be 
                     structured and presented in a database. Folsom's metaphor of database as “rhizome” is apt: 
                     “the subterranean stem that grows every which way and represents the nomadic multiplicity
                     of identity — no central root 
                     but an intertwined web of roots” [<a class="ref" href="#folsom_2007">Folsom 2007</a>, 1573]. The iterative XML tagging process that 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> uses to create entities contributes to the larger “web” of tagged persons, 
                     places, and works within the archive, rather than focusing on the “central” or chronological effort of quickly 
                     uploading digital reproductions of the letters themselves.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Folsom's metaphor that values the “intertwined web” over the “central 
                     root” can also be translated to <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s data processing workflows. <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> 
                     approaches collecting, transcribing, and encoding through a lens that prioritizes
                     editorial choices to retain as much of 
                     Edgeworth's correspondence “as-is” rather than organizing or transforming that data into a “cleaned” version. By 
                     “as-is”, we mean creating a digital corpus that represents Edgeworth's original letters in a form as close to the 
                     originals as possible, even if that means leaving in unclear word choices, unknown
                     subject entities, and confusing or contradictory text. 
                     The transcription checking and encoding process involves encoders making editorial
                     choices rather than encoders functioning as data 
                     “cleaners” who have to fix or correct data and then submit it to Edgeworth subject experts. Moreover, these encoders use a 
                     flexible tagging structure that either links to or creates authority files for persons,
                     places, and works, depending on whether those 
                     entities appear in external authority services like VIAF, GeoNames, or Wikidata. Our
                     process, then, views “cleaning” data not as a 
                     singular process, but rather, as a complex, labor-intensive set of practices that
                     align with the argument Katie Rawson and 
                     Trevor Muñoz make in “Against Cleaning” [<a class="ref" href="#rawson_munoz_2019">Rawson and Muñoz 2019</a>, 280]. 
                     Rawson and Muñoz challenge the assumption of an underlying order to data that renders human connection
                     as 
                     depressingly two-dimensional, which can be extrapolated to the complicated relationship
                     connecting digital humanities and long 
                     eighteenth-century studies with data in archives.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"><cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> thus prioritizes data and its importance for archival study over narratorial unity.
                     Viewing the humanist 
                     goals of a digital humanities research project as separate from its data collection
                     methodologies is a mistake that some humanist 
                     researchers have made that ultimately undermines the “powerful critiques of the existing systems of data 
                     analysis” [<a class="ref" href="#rawson_munoz_2019">Rawson and Muñoz 2019</a>, 281]. In eighteenth-century studies, there have been many critiques against 
                     adopting digital methodologies without critically understanding those methods. For
                     example, Cassidy Holahan positions 
                     <cite class="title italic">Eighteenth Century Collections Online</cite> (<cite class="title italic">ECCO</cite>), the largest digital database 
                     containing searchable facsimiles of eighteenth-century texts, as an “opaque archive” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#holahan_2021">Holahan 2021</a>, 804]. Holahan defines “opaqueness” through the way scholars have approached 
                     <cite class="title italic">ECCO</cite> as a natural resource without interrogating its “scope, biases, and [the] limitations 
                     of its contents” [<a class="ref" href="#holahan_2021">Holahan 2021</a>, 804]. Tracking and making visible the forces, whether physical or ideological, 
                     that shaped <cite class="title italic">ECCO</cite> helps dispel the “sense of comprehensiveness, authority, and neutrality 
                     that hide the underlying history and decisions that have shaped the collection” [<a class="ref" href="#holahan_2021">Holahan 2021</a>, 824]. In a similar 
                     fashion, our approach to Maria Edgeworth's correspondence recognizes that our editorial voice might obscure the relationships
                     
                     and networks in the corpus and seeks to address those implicit biases by giving a
                     transparent account of our process and choices in this 
                     essay. <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> views each step of the corpora building process as an opportunity to reconceptualize
                     how data can 
                     be described and organized to embrace the “messiness” of the corpus itself. Our approach to Edgeworth's correspondence is 
                     to capture, organize, and encode data without placing it into a larger narrative.
                     In digitizing each letter, uploading it for crowdsourced 
                     transcription, and then checking and encoding that transcription, the data's messiness
                     is treated as inseparable from its meaning.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The three different layers of our project — archive, transcription, and encoding —
                     reveal the challenges inherent in uniting texts, people, 
                     and institutions from different sources. While other archives seek to efface the distinctions
                     between the disparate entities that comprise 
                     them, <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> embraces a transcription and encoding structure that promotes exchange with other
                     sources while 
                     preserving unique aspects of our data: while we do reformat images and some metadata
                     from the more than thirty archives represented in 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>, we are still able to preserve unique archival and transcription aspects through
                     the flexibility inherent 
                     in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) schema and eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
                     as data format. As “extensible” suggests, XML 
                     was created with the intention of the data format being stretched to meet new use
                     cases despite some limitations due to its hierarchical 
                     nature. TEI, as a schema that is manifested in XML and that was created to deal with
                     the intricacies of text, also supports 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s aims. Similarly, in the lists of people, places, and works that undergird our project,
                     we have 
                     prioritized linking to a series of named authorities to place our project in conversation
                     with others, leaving room for lesser-known 
                     entities that we establish ourselves — either through our own creation of name authorities
                     or internal project documentation. There is also 
                     an unwieldiness in the combination of institutional and volunteer labor that powers
                     our project: the project is managed and coordinated 
                     across five institutions located in four different states; the transcriptions have
                     been largely supplied by volunteers through the 
                     Zooniverse platform; and though institutionally-funded research assistants have standardized
                     the transcriptions, the Talk boards and planned 
                     annotations allow individual contributors to preserve their own voices. Through our
                     descriptions of the different layers of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"><cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s attention to Maria Edgeworth is part of a digital humanities lineage of projects that seek 
                     to compile and publish manuscript correspondence of a single author or literary circle,
                     which often reveals unknown, undertheorized, or 
                     misunderstood aspects of the authors' lives and the world in which they lived. The
                     <cite class="title italic">Shelley-Godwin Archive</cite>, the  
                     <cite class="title italic">Carlyle Letters Online</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Walt Whitman Archive</cite>, and 
                     <cite class="title italic">Digital Mitford</cite> exemplify the kind of work already done in this area of digital humanities, and each
                     project 
                     contributes to the broader understanding of how text encoding might be used to re-shape
                     the canonical and historical understanding of their 
                     central figures.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e563">[3]</a> These 
                     previous projects have provided a template for <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s sustainable process suitable for encoding over ten 
                     thousand pages of correspondence while recognizing institutional collaborators (paid
                     from the institutions hosting the project) and 
                     volunteer collaborators (unpaid, often virtual, and external to the institutions).
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> builds upon the 
                     accomplishments of its predecessors by inviting the larger public to participate in
                     the project and by ensuring the interoperability of its 
                     letters and database while also prioritizing a non-hierarchical view of Edgeworth's letters.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Traditional standard and scholarly editions of correspondence have generally been
                     published in print by university presses, though the 
                     increasing turn to the digital has heralded the arrival of authoritative digital editions.
                     Gone are the days when presses would greenlight 
                     dozens of volumes dedicated to a single correspondence, such as W.S. Lewis's 48-volume scholarly edition of 
                     Horace Walpole's correspondence published with Yale University Press. While the material heft of
                     the print editions is 
                     attractive, their cost — usually at least $100 a volume — is generally prohibitive
                     to those unaffiliated with a large university library. 
                     The accessibility and reach of digital editions is connected to a shift towards a
                     greater democratization of knowledge and open access. 
                     Moreover, traditional print editions prioritize a chronological presentation of correspondence,
                     which can flatten the connections between 
                     letters written at different times. A primary aim of <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> is to create a digital database capable of capturing 
                     the inherent complexity and “messiness” of a network as large as Edgeworth's across a wide range of dates and recipients. 
                     On a related note, one of the great strengths of digital editions of correspondence
                     is that the text can easily be searched using the  
                     original letter images, and digital encoding is occasionally available in parallel.
                     There are several projects, such as the 
                     <cite class="title italic">Carlyle Letters Online</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Walt Whitman Archive</cite>, and the 
                     <cite class="title italic">Shelley-Godwin Archive</cite> that unite letter photographs, transcriptions, and encodings in a pop-up or diplomatic
                     
                     presentation that is available to the public.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e603">[4]</a> 
                     By encoding the transcriptions, these archives signal their interoperability — the
                     ability of these archives to exchange information with 
                     other resources and each other, especially if sustainable file formats are used [<a class="ref" href="#munoz_viglianti_2015">Muñoz and Viglianti 2015</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e614">[5]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Much of the labor for these digital archives is funded and completed by institutions,
                     though there is a turn towards pedagogy and 
                     volunteerism that has influenced <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s structure and workflows. The 
                     <cite class="title italic">Carlyle Letters</cite>, for instance, outsourced their encoding to DNC Data Systems of Mumbai, India, which
                     was then 
                     checked by a team of copyeditors. The <cite class="title italic">Shelley-Godwin Archive</cite>'s encoding has largely been performed by its 
                     editorial team, though they signal their desire for the archive to become a collaborative
                     project. The project that has served as a 
                     collaboratively encoded model for <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> since its inception and that has influenced our coding guidelines is 
                     <cite class="title italic">Digital Mitford</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e640">[6]</a> <cite class="title italic">Digital Mitford</cite> is similarly concerned with 
                     interoperability through its use of TEI and through its recruiting and training of
                     volunteer coders.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e667">[7]</a> To these ends, the editors offer 
                     a regular summer coding school that trains researchers in TEI through collaborating

                     to join the project as a scholarly editor. This project is more open to volunteers
                     than most and contains excellent documentation: in their 
                     description of <cite class="title italic">Digital Mitford</cite>, Elisa Beshero-Bondar and Kellie Donovan-Condron 
                     detail exactly how information between their project and others will be exchanged
                     within the “network of linked data, 
                     a digital database from which we can extract and study information we are collecting
                     about people and texts of the nineteenth

                     transferrable methods of editing and text encoding” that they teach as well as careful forms of documentation as ways of making their

                     the Zooniverse 
                     platform. Zooniverse is “the world's largest and most popular platform for people-powered research…made possible
                     by 
                     volunteers…who come together to assist professional researchers”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e708">[8]</a> Zooniverse is a crowdsourcing platform that 
                     enables contributions to academic research without requiring specialized expertise.
                     There is a wide range of projects: many of them are in 
                     the sciences, and some of the most popular projects are related to identifying astronomical
                     features and classifying nature. Volunteers are 
                     able to contribute to these research projects through Zooniverse's user-friendly interface
                     by answering straightforward questions, taking an 
                     image survey, drawing shapes and figures, and transcribing text, the latter of which
                     is central to <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>. 
                     Through our work with the NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities, “Building Capable 
                     Communities for Crowdsourced Transcription”, we spent an eighteen-month period building and establishing 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s Zooniverse website<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e726">[9]</a>, 
                     which was launched in spring 2022 and is in continuous use as we add more letters
                     from archives to be transcribed.

                     labor that are hosted through the Zooniverse 
                     platform. The <cite class="title italic">Davy Notebooks Project</cite>, which aims to transcribe all 75 notebooks of 
                     Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829), arguably the most famous nineteenth-century chemist, will eventually
                     be published online in 
                     Lancaster Digital Collections. The 29 volumes in <cite class="title italic">The Diaries of Michael Field</cite> were also transcribed, at least 
                     in part, by Zooniverse volunteers, and the eventual goal is to encode the letters
                     in TEI “within a network of linked 
                     resources” to support interoperability. <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> is most similar to <cite class="title italic">The Diaries of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">The central and initial challenges that <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> and comparable digital archives have faced can be addressed with 
                     strong project management: finding, securing, organizing, and getting permissions
                     for the material that comprises the foundation of the 
                     archive, as well as constructing the project team. Even though project management
                     is “primarily used in business”, 
                     according to Lynne Siemens, for large-scale projects like <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>, there is a 
                     “growing need for public accountability by funding agencies and others which requires,
                     even demands, successful project 
                     completion facilitated by detailed and realistic planning”, connected to the “coordination of people, financial 
                     resources, and tasks” [<a class="ref" href="#siemens_2021">Siemens 2021</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e785">[10]</a> 
                     Collaborative digital work often goes underappreciated in the humanities because many
                     college promotion and tenure guidelines prioritize 
                     traditional publications, though they should, as Kathleen Fitzpatrick argues, “rethink the ways that we 
                     give credit for such projects” [<a class="ref" href="#fitzpatrick_2011">Fitzpatrick 2011</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e801">[11]</a> Because collaborative work incorporates the efforts of more individuals, the scope,
                     
                     speed, and quality of such projects generally exceed the capabilities of a single
                     individual, with the work and administrative burdens 
                     shared [<a class="ref" href="#siemens_2015">Siemens 2015</a>, 358]. Large-scale collaborative projects, however, need a project manager in order to
                     be 
                     successful: according to Erik Ernø-Kjølhede, “The central task of any project manager regardless of her 
                     field is to navigate between the conflicting demands of time, cost and performance.
                     The project manager constantly has to weigh these 
                     demands against each other and trade off one against the other” [<a class="ref" href="#erno-kjolhede_1999">Ernø-Kjølhede 1999</a>, 13]. Project management 
                     makes it possible to negotiate the rhizomatic structure of <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>, including project deliverables and deadlines, 
                     personnel tasks and training, and the system of workflows developed generally by the
                     librarians who have worked on 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e825">[12]</a> 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s workflows contain an “‘authoritative’ record of roles, tasks, outcomes and 
                     relationships” so that our work can be understood and reproduced by others [<a class="ref" href="#siemens_2015">Siemens 2015</a>, 358]. Furthermore, good 
                     project management benefits our student assistants: we aim, as Siemens does, for our students to see 
                     “themselves as collaborators with few barriers between themselves and their supervisors” and learn important 
                     skills in project management and collaboration by working on interdisciplinary teams
                     [<a class="ref" href="#siemens_2015">Siemens 2015</a>, 357, 362]. Above 
                     all, we agree with Jason Boyd, who views project management as “a key scholarly practice in the digital 
                     humanities and in the humanities more broadly” that makes “open to scrutiny many tacitly understood 
                     practices” [<a class="ref" href="#boyd_2022">Boyd 2022</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e865">[13]</a>

                     — project management has played an important role in

                     2017, but it was only in 2020, with the improvement of digital meeting technologies

                     library manuscript holdings that project team meetings and <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s virtual archive became, respectively, more

                     accelerated during the pandemic, which meant that, to improve accessibility and promote
                     scholarship under lockdown conditions, many of the 
                     institutions that held pieces of Edgeworth's correspondence were not only willing to digitize their materials, but also 
                     provided them for free and occasionally published them on their own collections' websites<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e997">[16]</a>, especially the libraries located 
                     at large North American universities (such as Harvard University's Houghton Library and Yale 
                     University's Beinecke Library) and libraries that were large research institutions in and of themselves (the 
                     Huntington Library and the New York Public Library). Bringing this correspondence together digitally is a 
                     challenge, even after the pandemic, and requires the core workflow of the project
                     to be agile in proportion to the responsiveness of each 
                     institution. Communication with these institutions was the primary difficulty, especially
                     early in the pandemic when many other scholars 
                     were also requesting digitized material. The large amount of digitized manuscript
                     material we were able to secure from these libraries has 
                     been an important contribution to open-access scholarship, though the open, free,
                     and collaborative resource sharing that marked the early

                     University) and Peter Hirtle (Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University) 
                     — who determined that British archives do have the right under a copyright exemption
                     to share Maria Edgeworth's letters for 
                     publication<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1045">[18]</a>, which applies when the work is available to 
                     the public in an archive or similar institution, the work is at least 100 years old,
                     the work's author has been dead for at least 50 years, 
                     and the present copyright owner is unknown to the publisher. Edgeworth died in 1849, and after so much time, the present 
                     copyright owner is unknown and unknowable. By this reasoning, we were able to convince
                     English institutions to grant us access. Similarly, we 
                     had protracted negotiations with the Bibliothèque de Genève about access and copyright, which were conducted in French. 
                     The Bibliothèque de Genève holds Edgeworth's interesting correspondence with the philosopher 
                     Etienne Dumont, and after purchasing and receiving the images, we had to send a physical letter
                     in French to request exemption 
                     from the several thousand dollar publication fees to display the images since our
                     archive is non-profit and will be open-access. Our 
                     negotiations with the various libraries are a testament to the necessity of having
                     a flexible approach when interacting with other 
                     institutions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">We also needed to be flexible in our use of metadata and our image processing decisions,
                     which corresponded with the uneven levels of labor 
                     in preparing letters for transcription and encoding. Different institutions provided
                     different amounts of metadata about their letters: 
                     sometimes we received no information besides Edgeworth's authorship, while in other cases, dates, locations, and people 
                     (connected with their name authorities) were provided. In all cases, we had to review
                     and confirm or generate metadata associated with these 
                     letters. It was rare for holding institutions to provide information beyond the author,
                     recipient, and date. Occasionally the date was 
                     incorrect because of Edgeworth's difficult handwriting, or the author or recipient was unidentified or misidentified.
                     These 
                     details are important because one of the major contributions of <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> is to provide a comprehensive global list 
                     of Edgeworth's correspondence. Metadata is necessary to provide an accurate accounting of letter
                     location, author, recipient, 
                     date, and permissions. We have tracked all of this information in a large spreadsheet
                     (Figure 1), which will be available on our beta 
                     website by spring 2024.

                     Google Drive, GitHub, and Zoom. Given the ubiquity of Google Drive, it has proved
                     to be an effective tool for 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s inter-institutional collaboration. <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s Google Drive currently holds data 
                     (e.g., transcribed letters and image files), documentation on processes, and completed
                     scholarship on the project. While Google Drive has 
                     many strengths, the <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> team decided that some content, particularly XML documents, would be more effectively
                     
                     shared, edited, and reviewed in a GitHub repository. The <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> GitHub and its associated repositories were 
                     created to meet this need. This decision did increase the barrier to participation,
                     as few contributors had previously used GitHub, but the 
                     benefits were worth the effort. In particular, the <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> team found that it was hard to keep track of the 
                     authoritative version of XML files, like the TEI template, on Google Drive. It also
                     was difficult to suggest edits to particular lines of 
                     code. By using GitHub, the project team was able to address these issues. We conducted
                     two training sessions, one simply introducing the 
                     platform and another hands-on workshop for committing and pushing content, to help
                     institutional contributors gain familiarity with GitHub. 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> uses GitHub exclusively for XML documents and processes since Google Drive is sufficient
                     for storing text 
                     files and tabular metadata. And while Google Drive and GitHub effectively support
                     asynchronous work, Zoom meetings have been essential to 
                     collaboratively planning, managing, and working on <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>. Given the inter-institutional nature of the project and 
                     physical separation of the project team, having reliable video conferencing software

                     project beyond the 
                     initial data management and project organization stage. Once the archival data has
                     been gathered and organized, transcription begins, which 
                     can take many forms depending on a project's desired outcomes. Other digital humanities
                     archives have employed a variety of different labor 
                     practices; these are largely institutional labor practices that rely on labor outsourced
                     to computers, underpaid digital laborers, and 
                     students. Using computers to do the majority of the transcription work would have
                     been a feasible alternative to crowdsourcing. Handwritten 
                     Text Recognition (HTR) engines have benefited from the recent and substantial developments
                     in AI technology, and the appearance of HTR 
                     technology in published research is “international and rapidly growing” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#nockels_et_al_2022">Nockels et al. 2022</a>, 367]. Transkribus, in particular, is “the most commonly used HTR tool in the 
                     cultural heritage space”, with approximately 1700 monthly users. Yet an HTR engine like Transkribus would
                     be in opposition to 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s collaborative goals, and relying on AI to transcribe letters moves us away from
                     the most important 
                     dimension of the humanities: the human. Involving volunteers and the public in larger
                     research-based projects promotes 
                     “citizen science”, as <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> is built on “researchers 
                     interact[ing] with the public to achieve a collective goal” that furthers the humanities 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#nockels_et_al_2022">Nockels et al. 2022</a>, 377]. These “citizen scholars” are essential to how we define 
                     “collaboration” in the digital humanities, and they can more easily access and engage with digital
                     humanities projects through online 
                     crowdsourcing than through more “traditional”, or offline approaches [<a class="ref" href="#arbuckle_2019">Arbuckle 2019</a>, 293–294].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">Since <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s commitments to open-access and collaboration with the public are antithetical to
                     using machine 
                     labor for transcription, other alternatives include student labor or other outsourced,
                     cheap labor. This “effacement of 
                     student labor”, whether student or outsourced, frequently occurs in digital projects, as Spencer Keralis argues 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#keralis_2018">Keralis 2018</a>, 278]. Students are institutionally used for labor through unpaid student internships,
                     minimum wage 
                     student employee positions, or faculty who integrate digital humanities (DH) project
                     work into their syllabi under the auspices of gaining 
                     translatable and collaborative skills. Keralis states that this practice is “naturalized into the fabric of 
                     digital pedagogy”, yet “student labor in the classroom is never not coerced” since 
                     “students will feel coerced to participate in the professor's project ... even if an
                     alternative assignment is 
                     offered” [<a class="ref" href="#keralis_2018">Keralis 2018</a>, 278, 286]. In response to these labor practices, Haley Di Pressi et al. 
                     argue that students earn the right to appear as project collaborators on any project
                     to which they have made “substantive 
                     contributions” [<a class="ref" href="#di-pressi_et_al_2015">Di Pressi et al. 2015</a>]. <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> has consistently followed the labor practices 
                     outlined in the “Student Collaborator's Bill of Rights” by Di Pressi et al., which provides guidelines to prevent 
                     the exploitation of students in any DH work setting, asserting that “[s]tudents should not perform mechanical labor 
                     ... without pay” [<a class="ref" href="#di-pressi_et_al_2015">Di Pressi et al. 2015</a>, ¶5]. These forms of “mechanical labor” and 
                     detailed, single-action tasks are the same piecemeal assignments that DH project editors
                     can alternately outsource using low-cost labor 
                     platforms, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and this is a frequent practice. Christlein et al. outsourced labor for a 
                     transcription project to “naïve transcribers” in Vietnam and described this labor choice as 
                     “cost-effective” and “powerful” [<a class="ref" href="#christlein_et_al_2018">Christlein et al. 2018</a>, 7]. 
                     However, Mechanical Turk presents an ethically questionable solution in its frequent
                     outsourcing of labor to developing countries as well as 
                     to workers located in the United States. Cushing reported that Mechanical Turk workers were making an average of 
                     $1.50 per hour; seven years later, Hara et al. reported this average as $2 per hour [<a class="ref" href="#cushing_2012">Cushing 2012</a>, ¶22] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hara_et_al_2018">Hara et al. 2018</a>, 11]. Fred Benenson's <cite class="title italic">Emoji Dick</cite> (2019) is one such digital 
                     project 
                     that was finished through the outsourced labor of hundreds of anonymous workers employed
                     by Mechanical Turk. Workers were paid five cents 
                     for every sentence of Herman Melville's <cite class="title italic">Moby-Dick</cite> (1851) that they translated into emoji; they 
                     were also paid two cents for each vote on the best translation for each sentence [<a class="ref" href="#benenson_2010">Benenson 2010</a>, vii]. Although the 
                     Mechanical Turk employees who worked on <cite class="title italic">Emoji Dick</cite> made creative decisions, both by translating sentences into 
                     emoji and by voting for the best translation, no one who participated in the creation
                     of the text is individually credited, except for

                     undergraduate and graduate student workers have been employed by Texas A&amp;M, Tennessee,
                     Wake Forest, and Xavier, and these students have 
                     all been paid hourly wages and are recognized as collaborators. As for all of the
                     Zooniverse volunteers, they are individually credited for 
                     their transcriptions and annotations on the Zooniverse project page, and their usernames
                     (and real names if they chose to share them) will 
                     also appear in the completed digital archive. Crowdsourcing through volunteer-based
                     platforms like Zooniverse, where labor is voluntary and 
                     non-coercive, provides an ethical alternative to questionable labor practices. While
                     many of the digital archives that have served as models 
                     for ours do not have an open mechanism for accepting volunteer contributions, one
                     of the strengths of <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> is its 
                     large volunteer presence, which is evidenced by our work using the Zooniverse platform.
                     The importance of “collective 
                     intelligence” is the throughline of James Surowiecki's <cite class="title italic">The Wisdom of Crowds</cite>, in which he argues 
                     that “[i]f you put together a big enough and diverse enough group of people and ask them
                     to ‘make 
                     decisions affecting matters of general interest’, that group's decisions will, over
                     time, be ‘intellectually 
                     [superior] to the isolated individual’, no matter how smart or well-informed he is” [<a class="ref" href="#surowiecki_2004">Surowiecki 2004</a>, xvii]. 
                     Such “collective intelligence” can be harnessed through digital platforms such as Zooniverse. More than a million
                     
                     volunteers come together “to enable research that would not be possible, or practical, otherwise”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1320">[21]</a> 
                     Through the Zooniverse platform, volunteers are able to transcribe letters simultaneously
                     to achieve consensus with multiple others. The 
                     transcription task interface is logical and contains instructions, as is shown in
                     Figure 2.

                     The interactions between volunteers and researchers on the Talk boards also serve
                     a pedagogical function, as researchers share information on 
                     Edgeworth and the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which she lived. Recent discussions
                     have touched on women's rights

                     by which a transcription is reviewed and processed in preparation for TEI encoding,
                     the standard for the representation of texts in digital 
                     form. Line breaks, page breaks, and tags for underlined, superscript, added, and deleted
                     text, all noted by volunteers during transcriptions, 
                     are preserved in this process. However, before texts can be encoded, the people, places,
                     and works mentioned in the letters need to be 
                     accounted for so that they can be reconciled with existing name authorities (i.e.,
                     files that establish standardized spellings and forms for  
                     each entity) and made discoverable in our database. From checking the transcription
                     to amending the “ography” files, the process of 
                     selecting which files to work on often happens in back-and-forth stages. This process
                     can lead to unexpected connections, corrections, and 
                     editorial decisions. For example, research assistants working on the letters may be
                     unfamiliar with aspects of Edgeworth's life 
                     that are well known to the project editors, who are Edgeworth scholars. Working together over Zoom or exchanging emails allows 
                     the process to be collaborative, opening up opportunities to revise a given letter
                     and then apply the new information to other letters. The 
                     final part of our workflow extends this flexible and interoperable process by transforming
                     the corrected transcriptions and associated entities 
                     into digitally encoded TEI files.

                     (Text Encoding Initiative), an application of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and
                     a standard of representation that has been used by humanists 
                     since 1994 to create machine-readable digital texts. Many museums, archives, and digital
                     projects like ours use TEI because of its 
                     interoperability with other projects and because it is flexible enough to grow with
                     the corpus as more materials are added regardless of the 
                     type of database chosen. <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s use of TEI is most visible in the creation of two types of documents: 1) encoded
                     
                     letters, and 2) indices of named entities (“ography” files).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1471">[28]</a> 
                     The suffix “ography” is typically associated with the “names of descriptive sciences”, such as research that 
                     involves classifying and categorizing [<a class="ref" href="#ography_n._2023">Ography, n. 2023</a>]. We thus use the term “ography”, which derives from the standard 
                     TEI <em class="term">prosopography</em>, to refer to our entity naming and encoding processes for people (<em class="term">personography</em>), places 
                     (<em class="term">placeography</em>), and textual works (<em class="term">workography</em>). In selecting controlled names for entities within the “ography” 
                     files (where matches were possible), three authorities were privileged: the Virtual
                     International Authority File (VIAF) for persons, GeoNames 
                     for places, and Wikidata for works.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1498">[29]</a> These 
                     authorities were chosen because they are widely used, match the expected domains of
                     knowledge, can be edited by team members, and support URIs 
                     (Uniform Resource Identifiers) that are dereferenceable and content negotiable. Wikidata
                     and GeoNames are completely open to public editing 
                     while additions to VIAF, an aggregator of authorities, can be made through the Library of Congress Name Authority Cooperative 
                     (NACO). Using these authorities allows <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> to create a searchable structure without imposing a 
                     definitive hierarchy or interpretation of the materials that is predicated on a specific
                     narrative of Edgeworth's life. Each 
                     person, place, and title is given the same weight in the linked open data, which translates
                     in the database as a “choose your own 
                     adventure”; users can look for specific terms rather than through a traditional linear arrangement
                     of the correspondence. Additionally, by 
                     dividing the encoding workflow into the expansion of “ography” files, which can be completed on a spreadsheet, and iterative TEI creation, 
                     which requires XML editing software, <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> enables a diverse labor structure in which non-TEI experts can 
                     contribute and cross-institutional collaboration is streamlined, as our encoding and
                     linked data practices encourage information sharing with 
                     other institutions and entities.

                           her precociously satiric juvenilia has been preserved. By the mid-1790s she had written

                     authority URIs for these individuals that typically include this information externally.
                     Because the URIs for the authorities

                     as RDF (Resource 
                     Description Framework) simply by using the URI. For instance, the URI associated with
                     the place “Edgeworthstown” 
                     (<a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2964434" onclick="window.open('http://sws.geonames.org/2964434'); return false" class="ref">http://sws.geonames.org/2964434</a>) returns information on alternate names, population,

                     and 
                     placeography. For entities that do not have established name authorities, we explore
                     newspaper, scholarly, and genealogical databases for 
                     information, similar to the creators of <cite class="title italic">Digital Dinah Craik</cite>. Thus, within our personography, we either embed key 
                     entities within a larger network of linked data or, when necessary, create them ourselves,
                     making our project a flexible resource in dialogue 
                     with other networks of projects and individuals that allows those with content expertise
                     to participate without additional barriers. 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s third “ography” file, the workography, is — to our knowledge — unique in its content and scope since
                     
                     there are no existing workography examples, though it resembles the personography
                     and placeography files. Edgeworth's letters 
                     include numerous references to her own novels and short stories as well as to the
                     works of her contemporaries, such as 
                     Walter Scott and Frances Burney, so documenting these connections in a separate workography file is essential for
                     
                     researchers. Because of this, <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> needed to devise the XML structure of the file to meet the project's needs. The 
                     project team contacted the TEI listserv on 4 November 2022 to get input on this dilemma.
                     None of the responses we received directly addressed 
                     our use case. The elements <span class="monospace">listBibl</span> and <span class="monospace">bibl</span> form the backbone of this “ography” file. The TEI was flexible 
                     enough to also allow <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> to model works within works, which is especially important for referencing 
                     Edgeworth's short stories (see Figure 5).

                     particularly helpful for 
                     tracking works within other works, such as Edgeworth's individual short fictions in her larger collections of tales. This 
                     “ography” file will allow scholars to track allusions to literary and non-literary texts across
                     Edgeworth's entire 
                     correspondence. Instead of charting loose affinities based on similar publishing periods
                     or identifying one instance of Edgeworth's

                     in standardized TEI tags within the letters and in the entities listed in our Corpora-based

                     After a letter has been transcribed on Zooniverse, there is a multi-step process that
                     we have developed for encoding the letter and defining 
                     entities in the appropriate “ography” file.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1884">[37]</a> 
                     Using metadata either directly from the institution the letter is held in or metadata
                     gathered after examining the letter itself, the encoder 
                     records in the TEI header the author, the recipient, their locations, the date on
                     which the letter was sent, and the institution in which it is 
                     housed. The component parts of each letter (opener, salute, body, closer, postscript,
                     and address) are encoded according to the correspondence 
                     structure from the TEI guidelines, retaining line breaks, paragraph breaks, and page
                     breaks. During this encoding process, which follows 
                     standard TEI guidelines, researchers tag each <span class="monospace">persName</span>, <span class="monospace">placeName</span>, and <span class="monospace">title</span> with a corresponding 
                     <span class="monospace">@ref</span>, linking back to the local name authority files created through the “ography” process. Step-by-step instructions are 
                     available on <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s Google Drive. Given the detailed TEI workflow that all members of the project team
                     can access, 
                     the process of encoding each letter does not require extensive coding experience.
                     By separating the processes for tracking down named entities 
                     and encoding the letters, <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s approach allows a wider variety of collaborators to participate in the project,
                     
                     from tenured faculty and librarians to graduate and undergraduate researchers, including
                     a recent group of the latter who were paid to learn 
                     TEI in a summer 2023 undergraduate institute co-hosted by Wake Forest University and Xavier University of Louisiana.

                     both for creating encoded letters and “ography” files, 
                     so that contributors can complete the work consistently and ensure that future contributors
                     can be onboarded in a timely fashion. Starting from 
                     step one through the final step, if a person has a basic working knowledge of TEI,
                     they can encode for <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>. 
                     We believe that ecentralizing the knowledge required to contribute to <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> and specifically tailoring our TEI 
                     template and “ography” files to be replicable without long-term training are key to producing a project
                     that has long-term sustainability. 
                     As people leave and join the project, this relatively low barrier to entry minimizes
                     the risk that the project will not be completed or 
                     maintained; distributing the knowledge and creating the “ography” files has helped <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> grow quickly and 
                     deeply. The “ography” files, which establish <span class="monospace">xml:id</span> values for entities mentioned in the letters are a good example of this 
                     as they require limited technical knowledge. Each “ography” file is built in a spreadsheet that creates associations between the internal 
                     <span class="monospace">xml:id</span> for each person, place, or work and how that person, place, or work will appear in
                     our Corpora database. 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> decided to use spreadsheets as the foundation for the “ography” files so that any person who can input 
                     data into a spreadsheet will be able to contribute to the project's growing dataset.

                     has allowed <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> to reconcile the divide Brown, Clements, and Grundy describe as the choice between
                     
                     “greater complexity and a fairly tight-knit group of collaborators, and lesser complexity
                     and a more open collaborative 
                     model” [<a class="ref" href="#brown_clements_grundy_2006">Brown, Clements, and Grundy 2006</a>, 324]. Our approach to Maria Edgeworth's vast correspondence offers 
                     a model that invites greater complexity and intentional work amongst a small group
                     of scholars (institutional collaborators) as well as 
                     pursuing an open collaborative model through using Zooniverse to transcribe Edgeworth's letters (volunteer collaborators). A broad 
                     overview of how the different processes covered in this article work together to create
                     a digital archive appears in Figure 7. By defining 
                     these steps, from letter acquisition to encoding, we can visually demonstrate how

                     done with certainty. In this way, Corpora supports two 
                     different webs users can traverse: an internal web of entities mentioned within the
                     letters and an external web of linked data sources. Having 
                     both webs available to users allows Edgeworth's correspondence to retain the messiness inherent to a correspondence network this
                     
                     wide in scope, varied in content, and written over decades across the beginning and
                     end of two centuries. Ultimately, 
                     <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite> privileges the letters, with their inclusion of incomplete names, misspellings, and
                     sometimes unclear text, 
                     as our final authority and the source with which most users should primarily interact.

                     public interfaces, we want to close by noting that while 
                     database and website technologies may change, the building blocks of our project —
                     the plain text (.txt) and extensible markup (.xml) documents 
                     — are purposefully written in file formats known for their simplicity, longevity,
                     and usability. This is the last and, perhaps, the most 
                     important aspect of <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s flexibility. The .txt and .xml files that populate our Google Drive and GitHub
                     
                     repositories are key in facing <cite class="title italic">MELP</cite>'s largest challenge: preservation. Choosing to create a digital archive is 
                     itself an act of preservation in that a “suite of tools, operations, standards, and policies” are necessary to 
                     “help ensure that this investment is not squandered” [<a class="ref" href="#conway_2010">Conway 2010</a>, 65]. Yet 
                     Drew VandeCreek's study clocks the longevity of most NEH-funded digital humanities projects at between
                     eleven and sixteen 
                     years.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e2080">[39]</a> Funding issues and obsolete file formats or programs are often the cause of this
                     obsolescence. Our final 
                     act of collaborative project management has been to select plain text files and eXtensible
                     Markup Language documents, which can be edited with 
                     a variety of applications, as means to promote the longevity and interoperability
                     of the project amidst the inevitable shifts in website and 
                     database technologies. Even if, when we reach the end of our project, we are unable
                     to acquire, transcribe, and encode all ten thousand sheets 
                     of Edgeworth's correspondence, the material that we do assemble in our open-access digital archive
                     should resist obsolescence and 
                     remain the authoritative source for Edgeworth's correspondence for years to come.
