                    studies, both from a theoretical and a computational point of view. In the first

                    discussed, highlighting the gaps between literary theories and computational
                    models, and suggesting possible solutions to fill them. In the second section, a
                    stratified taxonomy of SA tools is proposed, which distinguishes: (1) the
                    emotion theory adopted by the tool; (2) the method used to build the emotion
                    resources; (3) the technique adopted to accomplish the analysis. A critical
                    survey of six representative SA tools for literary studies (Syuzhet, Vader,

                <head>1. Introduction</head>

                <p>After years of disinterest and neglect, Sentiment Analysis (SA) has recently
                    become one of the most discussed topics in computational literary studies.
                    Generally known as the field of study that analyzes <quote rend="inline"
                        >people's opinions, sentiments, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions towards
                        entities and their attributes</quote>
                    <ptr target="#liu2015" loc="1"/>, SA aims at accomplishing an automated
                    extraction of the emotional content of text by converting it into
                    machine-readable information, such as numbers and discrete labels (e.g.,
                        <q>positive</q> vs. <q>negative</q>), which can be then analyzed
                    statistically or visualized via plots and graphs. It is precisely after June
                    2014, when Matthew Jockers published a series of though-provoking posts on his
                    personal blog <ptr target="#jockers2014"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2015a"/>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2015b"/>, that this computational technique started to
                    acquire a growing relevance in DH research. To date, SA has been used in
                    multiple studies, ranging from the identification of the <q>basic shapes</q> of
                    stories cf. <ptr target="#jockers2015b"/>
                    <ptr target="#reagan2016"/>, to the large-scale investigation of children's
                    literature <ptr target="#jacobs2020"/> and online reading communities <ptr
                        target="#pianzola2020"/>, with applications on both contemporary and
                    historical languages <ptr target="#sprugnoli2020"/>. This success is paralleled
                    — even if without a causal relation — by the so-called <term>affective
                        turn</term>
                    <ptr target="#cloughandhalley2007"/> in literary studies <ptr target="#keen2011"
                    />, through which emotions regained a key role in narrative theory and reader
                    response studies, after the neglect — and even the patent opposition — of both
                    structuralist and post-structuralist studies.</p>
                <p>However, as it happens with all vanguards and new trends, SA is currently
                    experiencing its peak of theoretical and methodological instability as well.
                    While research in a field like stylometry (the computational analysis of style)
                    has already reached some of the highest levels in terms of scientificity and
                    theoretical awareness,<note><p>As for the scientific validation of stylometric
                            methods in DH, see for example the extensive body of research produced
                            by Maciej Eder (e.g., see <ptr target="#eder2012"/>
                            <ptr target="#eder2013"/>
                            <ptr target="#eder2017"/> or the detailed inquiry by <ptr
                                target="#evert2017"/>. As for theoretical awareness, see for example
                                <ptr target="#kestemont2014"/> and <ptr target="#herrmann2015"/>. A
                            full bibliography on stylometry can be consulted on Zotero.</p></note>
                    the same cannot be said with SA, where most tools and methods still lack a
                    validation, connections with literary theory are frail or disputable, and an
                    organizational effort of the research community (such as that of the Special
                    Interest Group <title rend="quotes">Digital Literary Stylistics</title>, or of
                    the Federation of Stylometry Labs) is still lacking.</p>
                <p>A first, extensive survey of SA for computational literary studies was proposed
                    by <ptr target="#kim-klinger2018b"/>, who distinguished five main areas of
                    application: <list type="ordered">
                        <item>Classification of literary texts in terms of the emotions they
                            convey</item>
                        <item>Genre and story-type classification</item>
                        <item>Modeling sentiments and emotions in texts from previous
                            centuries</item>
                        <item>Character network analysis based on emotional relations</item>
                        <item>Miscellaneous and more general applications</item>
                    </list>
                </p>
                <p>However, at the end of their survey, Kim and Klinger notice how <quote
                        rend="inline">the methods of sentiment analysis used by some of the DH
                        scholars nowadays have gone or are almost extinct among computational
                        linguists</quote>
                    <ptr target="#kim-klinger2018b" loc="33"/>. There is a clear gap in terms of
                    methodology that needs to be filled (or, at least, directly addressed), if
                    research wants to move further. This necessity is also accompanied by a more
                    general need to understand the internal logics of tools that are frequently used
                    in a purely goal-oriented research. In other terms, a criticism of the tools and
                    methods currently adopted in SA is as necessary as a free exploration of its
                    potential. Without denying the usefulness of exploratory — or even <quote
                        rend="inline">deformative</quote>
                    <ptr target="#buurma-gold2018"/> — research, a critical awareness of shortfalls
                    and limitations in distant reading should constitute the necessary groundwork
                    for its fruitful application.</p>
                <p>With this article, I will attempt a comprehensive criticism of SA tools in
                    literary criticism by combining two approaches. First, as already done by <ptr
                        target="#herrmann2015"/> for stylometry and by <ptr target="#ciotti2017b"/>
                    for topic modeling, I will conduct a theoretical inquiry on the possible
                    correspondences and inconsistencies between the concepts of literary theory and
                    the computational techniques of SA. This, in order to provide a solution to a
                    basic question of modeling (cf. <ptr target="#flanders-jannidis2019"/>
                    <ptr target="#underwood2019b"/>
                    <ptr target="#piper2018"/>): to what extent can SA model literary phenomena and
                    thus make possible an <term>operationalization</term> (cf. <ptr
                        target="#moretti2013"/>
                    <ptr target="#salgaro2018"/>) of the fundamental questions of literary studies?
                    Main distinction will be in where the emotions reside: if in the text itself (a
                    perspective generally preferred by narratological approaches) or in its readers
                    (main focus of reader-response studies). Second, by narrowing the perspective on
                    some of the most widely used SA tools in DH, this article will perform an
                    analysis of the technical limitations of such tools, in order to heighten
                    awareness of the risks implicit in any research that bases itself uncritically
                    on their outcomes.</p>

                    <head>2.1 Towards an affective narratology</head>

                    <p>Examining the taxonomy by <ptr target="#kim-klinger2018b"/>, it becomes
                        immediately evident that the strongest connection between literary theory
                        and SA takes place in the field of narratology. The classification of genres
                        and story types (application 2), in particular, depends primarily on the
                        structure of narratives. <ptr target="#moretti2011"/> has also demonstrated
                        how network analysis (application 4) can prove a powerful approach for the
                        study of plot, while <ptr target="#zehe2016"/> have chosen the
                        narratological device of the <q>happy ending</q> to classify their selection
                        of literary texts (application 1). While this does not exclude that SA can
                        also be fruitfully applied to the study of different subjects with different
                        approaches (such as poetry in a neurocognitive perspective, as done by <ptr
                            target="#papp-zipernovszky2021"/>, the field of narratology and the
                        subject of the novel are clearly the most dominant,<note>See for example the
                            approach chosen by the most recent monograph on the subject, <ptr
                                target="#elkins2022"/>.</note> with a distinctive interest towards
                        the classification of literary texts (shared by both applications 1 and 2).
                        It is not by chance, then, that Jockers decided to call his SA tool <title
                            rend="italic">Syuzhet</title>
                        <ptr target="#jockers2015a"/>, with a direct reference to the distinction
                        made by Russian formalists between the <term>fabula</term> and the plot
                        (also known as <term>syuzhet,</term>
                        <term>récit,</term> or <term>intreccio</term>).</p>

                    <p>However, when looking for the actual location where this connection takes
                        place, the model reveals itself as apparently faulty. Both <ptr
                            target="#jockers2015b"/> and <ptr target="#reagan2016"/> used SA for
                        demonstrating that the story arcs of the entire (Western) literary
                        production are dominated by six basic shapes.<note><p>Note that the number
                                of shapes is the same, but they do not correspond perfectly. All the
                                plots generated by <ptr target="#reagan2016"/> can be explored
                                interactively through an online Hedonometer.</p></note> This
                        conclusion sparkled a lively debate — and not a few criticisms (see <ptr
                            target="#hammond2017"/>) — , but it was based on a very problematic
                        assumption. In fact, these basic shapes were obtained by tracking the
                        evolution of positive vs. negative emotions throughout thousands of stories.
                        A precedent for such an approach was found in a lecture by Kurt Vonnegut,
                        based on a (rejected) Master's thesis and circulated in the form of a

                            target="#bringsjord-ferrucci2000"/> — , or in the structuralist
                        assumption that all stories can be reconducted to a universal model <ptr
                            target="#bremond1973"/> — but just when focusing on the fabula.
                        Antecedents of the concept of <term>story arc</term> can even be found in
                        Gustav Freytag's pyramid of the dramatic action <ptr target="#freytag1863"/>
                        and in Northrop Frye's <quote rend="inline">U</quote> and an <quote

                        representing the archetypical structures of comedy and tragedy. However,
                        when we look into the most established theorizations of narrative form, such
                        as the still-fundamental proposal by <ptr target="#genette1972"/> or the
                        most recent reformulations by <ptr target="#bal2017"/>, almost no trace of
                        emotions can be found. Aspects like focalization, space, time, and
                        characters constitute a story through their manipulation and interaction,
                        while affect is nothing but a device used to engage the reader, with just
                        secondary and indirect consequences on the structure of the narrative. In
                        conclusion, the question becomes unavoidable: is the SA approach actually
                        able to develop a formal model of the phenomenon which, traditionally, has
                        been known by literary scholars as <q>the plot</q>?</p>
                    <p>A series of recent studies, produced in the wake of the already-mentioned
                            <term>affective turn</term>, help mitigating a straightforwardly
                        negative answer. Patrick Colm Hogan was the first to introduce the concept
                        of <quote rend="inline">affective narratology</quote>
                        <ptr target="#hogan2011"/>. His goal was clear and apparently in line with
                        the approaches by Jockers and Reagan: starting from the acknowledgement that
                            <quote rend="inline">narratological treatments of emotion have on the
                            whole been relatively undeveloped</quote>
                        <ptr target="#hogan2011" loc="1"/>, he aimed at highlighting how <quote
                            rend="inline">emotion systems define the standard features of all
                            stories, as well as cross-culturally recurring clusters of features in
                            universal genres</quote>
                        <ptr target="#hogan2011" loc="2"/>. This statement could easily be adopted
                        as an epigraph for many SA literary studies. However, when reaching the core
                        of Hogan's proposal, the correspondences become much more problematic. In
                        particular, Hogan defines a nested system, where works are composed by
                        stories (i.e., by many stories intertwined together), stories by episodes,
                        and episodes by events and incidents, all governed by emotional principles.
                        One of the most important principles in this system is normalcy: in fact,
                            <quote rend="inline">an episode begins with a shift away from normalcy
                            [and] ends when there is a return to normalcy. […] If normalcy is
                            restored in a more enduring way, we have not just an episode, but a
                            story</quote>
                        <ptr target="#hogan2011" loc="65"/>. This poses a fundamental problem for
                        computational modeling, because the basic unit of measurement is not uniform
                        (the pages of a book or the words in a sentence, generally taken as
                        reference points by SA tools), but depends on the development of the story
                        itself (episodes can be closed in a few sentences, or develop through
                        multiple pages). In addition, normalcy is not determined by a simple
                        positive vs. negative emotional status, but by more complex emotion systems
                        (e.g., attachment and sexual desire in the romantic genre), which take shape
                        not in the more general context of the story, but with reference to the
                        goals of single characters. The combination of these elements alone makes
                        the emotional analysis of stories much more complex and sophisticated than a
                        simple tracking of the emotional levels through the pages of a book,
                        involving for example the issues of focalization (as the nature of a
                        sentiment inevitably depends on the chosen perspective), style (if we follow
                        its affective-aesthetic interpretation, cf. <ptr target="#herrmann2015"
                            loc="42"/>), symbolism, and many others.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted, however, that research in computational literary studies
                        is currently paving the way for solving most of these problems. For example,
                        the identification of scenes in narratives (and thus of Hogan’s episodes) is
                        at the center of the effort by <ptr target="#gius2019"/>, who already
                        highlighted its relevance for narratological studies. <ptr target="#kim2017"
                        /> produced their story arcs by distinguishing Plutchik's eight basic
                        emotions (joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, anticipation, anger, and
                        disgust) and thus moved beyond the flattening distinction between positive
                        and negative sentiments. Finally, all the studies collected by <ptr

                            network analysis</quote> label focus on the emotions of characters. What
                        is currently missing, is a fruitful integration of all these approaches in a
                        coherent framework.</p>
                    <p>In her recent contribution on the subject, <ptr target="#elkins2022"/>
                        compares the results of more than thirty-six different computational methods

                        usefulness in literary studies, Elkins consciously decides not to face the
                        more complex narratological issues described here, thus still leaving
                        unrealized a true <term>operationalization</term> of Hogan's narrative
                        theory.</p>

                    <head>2.2 From narratology to reader response</head>

                    <p>Hogan's is not the only proposal for an inclusion of affect into narrative
                        science. In her sophisticated contribution, <ptr target="#breger2017"/>
                        takes a distance from Hogan, by distinguishing affect from emotions.
                        Following the Deleuzian interpretation, affect can be intended as an <quote
                            rend="inline">(asubjective, asymbolic) <q>intensity</q></quote>
                        <ptr target="#breger2017" loc="229"/>, which resists any formalization or
                        reduction to universal features. The interesting aspect of Breger's proposal
                        is that the narratological function of affect is consequently limited to the
                        process of <term>worldmaking</term> (the mental creation of fictional
                        worlds), which happens only through an active collaboration between author,
                        text, and readers. While Hogan tried to ground his model uniquely in the
                        inherent features of narratives, excluding — or at least putting aside — the
                        readers, Breger seems to follow a growing tendency in literary studies,
                        which gives a new relevance to readers (be they real or implied).
                                <note><p>The concept of the <term>implied reader</term>, derived
                                from reception theory and intended as <quote rend="inline">a textual

                                <ptr target="#iser1978" loc="34"/> has been criticized for its
                                excessive abstraction, through which we risk losing contact with
                                real readers <ptr target="#salgaro2011"/>. However, Hogan notices
                                how <quote rend="inline">there are many cases in which we might wish
                                    to say that a given reader’s emotional response is misguided

                                <ptr target="#hogan2016"/>. Thus, it seems that only a combination
                                between the two (abstract modeling and empirical observation) might
                                actually provide us with a reliable description of the phenomenon of
                                reading.</p></note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Such a tendency is also evident in <ptr target="#oatley2012"/>, who devises a

                        shows how such emotional systems sustain all narratives. A powerful support
                        is found in the Sanskrit theory of <term>rasas</term>, intended as <quote

                    <p>These contributions are just a sample of a currently growing trend in
                        literary studies. The widest body of research on reader's affects and
                        emotions, in fact, can be found in the field of reader response theory,
                        whose origins can be traced back to Aristotle's concept of catharsis <ptr
                            target="#miall2018"/>, but which distinguished itself more recently for
                        its <q>scientific</q> approach to the study of reading. Through the adoption
                        of empirical methods <ptr target="#peer2012"/>, in fact, reader's
                        experiences are analyzed and <q>measured</q> via questionnaires and
                        interviews, but also using technologies like eye tracking and fMRI scans. In
                        a recent series of papers, SA also has been introduced in the field.</p>
                    <p><ptr target="#jacobs2017"/> adopted SA on Shakespeare's sonnets not to
                        visualize their (frequently improbable) plot arcs, but to measure the <quote
                            rend="inline">emotion potential</quote> of their verses, with the goal
                        of predicting possible readers' reactions and thus devising new experiments
                        on selected texts. <ptr target="#pianzola2020"/>, then, used SA on a social
                        reading platform <ptr target="#cordon-garcia2013"/>, Wattpad, with a goal
                        that connects even more strongly narratology and reader response theory.
                        Given that on Wattpad readers can write comments for each paragraph in a
                        novel (reaching even millions of comments), Jocker's technique was adapted
                        to compare two emotional arcs: that of the text and that of readers'
                        reactions. Results were used to isolate the passages that showed the highest
                        levels of harmony or discrepancy (i.e., where the correlations between the
                        two emotional arcs were the highest or lowest), thus identifying the textual
                        features that support or hinder narrativization.</p>
                    <p>These studies prove how fruitful the integration between SA tools and
                        literary studies can be. And if, on the one hand, they risk moving too
                        deeply into the realm of social science thus losing contact with literature
                            <term>stricto sensu</term>, on the other hand, they confirm how such a
                        tendency is inscribed in the very practice of distant reading <ptr
                            target="#underwood2017"/>. However, extensive work and reasonable
                        carefulness are still required: main risk is that of an oversimplification
                        of phenomena that necessarily escape any reductionism, while the current
                        results of computational analyses are just scraping their surface. In any
                        case, it seems more and more evident that, while a <q>theory</q> for distant
                        reading is still lacking <ptr target="#ciotti2018"/>, it is precisely
                        through theoretical reasoning that SA (and other computational methods with
                        it) can actually meet the needs of literary scholars. The possibility of
                        testing proposals like those by Hogan and Oatley can prove extremely
                        valuable for the development of literary studies, whatever the result (a
                        confirmation or a denial) will be. And to the skeptics who — sometimes with
                        good reasons — fear the imposition of quantitative methods over the
                        irreducible subjectivity of literary criticism, it can be answered with <ptr
                            target="#mccarty2005"/> that the process of modeling in computational
                        literary studies is never the simple reduction of the phenomenon to a
                        formula, but rather a continuous dynamics between the construction of a
                        model and the confrontation with a reality that always escapes it — the same
                        dynamics that, in the end, sustains any theorization about literature.</p>

                <p>A direct confrontation with literary theory proves fundamental when setting up a
                    criticism of SA tools. However, it is not sufficient when trying to reach a full
                    awareness of the potential and limitations in their use for literary studies.
                    Once the context in which a tool can be employed has been identified, an equal
                    attention should be dedicated to the specific method it adopts. Indeed, each
                    method implies a model — and thus it also implies a theory. SA, in fact, can be
                    performed by selecting or combining an ample variety of approaches, ranging from
                    simple wordcount to the most complex deep learning techniques, and connecting
                    with multiple psycholinguistics theories. Choosing one approach over the other
                    means also defining the very nature of the object under examination.</p>

                        distinctions should be made, based on three interconnected aspects: (1) the
                        emotion theory adopted by the tool (T); (2) the technique used to build the
                        emotion resources (ER); (3) the method adopted to accomplish the analysis
                        (M). </p>
                    <div>
                        <head>3.1.1. Emotion theories</head>
                        <p>As for the emotion theory, an ample selection of competing frameworks is
                            currently available, with their advantages/disadvantages and a lively
                            dispute on which one is the best. However, they can be divided into two
                            main families: <list type="unordered">
                                <item>T1. Dimensional representations of emotions </item>
                                <item>T2. Discrete (or systemic) representations of emotions</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Dimensional representations are generally connected to <ptr
                                target="#russell1980"/>, who proposed a bi-dimensional system able
                            to chart all emotional states. By combining the two dimensions of
                            valence (positive vs. negative, e.g., <q>good</q> vs. <q>bad</q>) and
                            arousal (calm vs. intense, e.g., <q>pleasurable</q> vs. <q>exciting</q>)
                            any human emotion could be logically represented. Many SA tools adopt
                            this theory by simplifying it further, i.e., by reducing it to valence
                            alone, on a continuous scale that ranges between two extremes (e.g., -1
                            and +1). This solution, chosen in studies such as <ptr
                                target="#jockers2014"/>, <ptr target="#reagan2016"/>, and <ptr
                                target="#elkins2022"/>, offers an efficient simplification for the
                            analysis, but it also implies the loss of relevant information, when for
                            example aesthetic appreciation (e.g., beautifulness or ugliness) needs
                            to be distinguished from embodied response (e.g., pleasure or pain). It
                            should be noted, incidentally, that this interpretation is also at the
                            basis of the very idea of SA. Especially in its commercial applications,
                            SA aims at mining opinions (by stressing this specific meaning of the
                            word <term>sentiment</term>), thus a distinction in terms of
                            positive/negative valence becomes sufficient for accomplishing the
                            task.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, discrete representations multiply the number of
                            dimensions, while at the same time distinguishing them more strictly
                            into a series of discrete categories (or <q>basic emotions</q>). Two
                            main theories dominate this context: <ptr target="#plutchik1991"/>, who
                            proposed eight basic emotions (joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness,
                            anticipation, anger, and disgust) based on differences in human
                            behavior; and <ptr target="#ekman1993"/>, who reduced the categories to
                            seven (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, surprise, and sadness),
                            based mainly on differences in facial expressions. However, theories are
                            much more numerous <ptr target="#tracy-randles2011"/>, and many SA
                            approaches even combine them or reduce them to a simple dichotomy (all
                            positive vs. all negative emotions). A unique framework is still far
                            from being defined, while the results of any SA analysis depend heavily
                            on the system that is chosen as a reference.</p>
                        <p>The biggest issue in the applicability of SA for literary studies,
                            however, concerns the very possibility of a unique framework. <ptr
                                target="#sprugnoli2016"/> demonstrated how the simple distinction
                            between positive and negative sentiment in historical texts is an almost
                            impossible task for human annotators. By evaluating inter-annotator
                            agreement scores on a series of excerpts from historical political
                            speeches, <ptr target="#sprugnoli2016"/> noted that, if the performance
                            of humans is below the threshold of acceptability, delegating this task
                            to a computer might make no sense at all. This warrants an extreme
                            carefulness when applying SA to literary texts. However, <ptr
                                target="#rebora2020"/> has also demonstrated how, while
                            inter-annotator agreement remains low, SA is still able to catch
                            significant correlations, especially when comparing the emotional
                            valence of a text with its connected readers' responses.</p>

                    <div>
                        <head>3.1.2. Emotion resources</head>
                        <p>Once the theoretical framework has been decided upon, a second,
                            fundamental decision concerns the choice of the emotion resources. In
                            fact, the measurement of the overall emotion or sentiment expressed by a
                            text depends primarily on the emotional values assigned to the smaller
                            units that compose it, be they words, clauses, or sentences. Based on
                            categorizations such as <ptr target="#taboada2011"/> and <ptr
                                target="#seyeditabari2018"/>, three main approaches can be
                            distinguished: <list type="unordered">
                                <item>ER1. Word lists</item>
                                <item>ER2. Vector space models</item>
                                <item>ER3. Labeled texts</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first two approaches pertain to the more general category of emotion
                            dictionaries, where lists of words are associated to a series of (basic)
                            emotions. Overall, emotion dictionaries are still the most used SA
                            resource in DH, even if the interest towards labeled texts increased in
                            recent years.</p>
                        <p>Word lists are the simplest approach, but they also require extensive
                            preparatory work and frequently prove too rigid for an adaptation to
                            different contexts. For example, the NRC Emotion Lexicon — also known as
                            EmoLex <ptr target="#mohammad-turney2013"/> — was developed through
                            crowdsourcing: by using the online service , its developers asked users
                            to annotate a series of words both in terms of sentiment and
                            (Plutchik's) basic emotions. Final values were then assigned via
                            majority consent. Issues were many, however, starting from the limited
                            trustworthiness of Amazon Turk annotators (even if the developers
                            devised methods to avoid errors or cheating) and culminating in the
                            system of values unavoidably inscribed in the annotations. In the end,
                            Emolex might prove to be a good representative of the emotions
                            experienced by present-time Internet users (where e.g., the verb <q>to
                                cry</q> clearly expresses negative sentiment), but not of the system
                            of values that sustains a play by Shakespeare or a novel by Austen
                            (where the same verb <q>to cry</q> can simply mean <q>to say out
                                loud</q>).</p>
                        <p>For this reason, vector space models are frequently used to adapt the
                            dictionary to a specific linguistic and cultural context, through
                            distributional semantics <ptr target="#harris1954"/> and the
                            computational technique more generally known as word embeddings <ptr
                                target="#mikolov2013"/>. Based on co-occurrences in selected
                            corpora, words are transformed (or modeled) into multi-dimensional
                            vectors, which encode information on semantic similarity. Starting from
                            a selection of <q>seed words</q> (such as <q>good</q> vs. <q>bad</q>; or
                            words indisputably related to basic emotions), it becomes thus possible
                            to automatically assign a value to all words in a dictionary. This
                            technique offers the advantage of tailoring the dictionary to a specific
                            context, depending on the corpus that is used to generate the vectors.
                            In this case, limitations depend primarily on the technical issues of
                            word embeddings: for example, large corpora are required for their
                            creation (but they are not always available, especially for historical
                            languages) and the information encoded in the vectors does not
                            necessarily model semantic similarity (e.g., it happens that the vectors
                            of words such as <q>good</q> and <q>bad</q> are similar because the two
                            words tend to appear frequently together).</p>
                        <p><ptr target="#taboada2011"/> noted how word lists and vector space models
                            can be combined into hybrid emotion dictionaries, which try to reach an
                            ideal compromise between advantages and shortfalls of the two
                            approaches.</p>
                        <p>However, a more general issue seems at stake with emotion dictionaries.
                            As already noted, in fact, some kinds of emotions (such as the Deleuzian
                            affects) escape linguistic formalization, thus they may be undetectable
                            through SA approaches. This is one of the reasons why <ptr
                                target="#seyeditabari2018"/> foster the use of labeled texts, where
                            the basic unit of the emotion resource are not just words, but clauses
                            and sentences. Ideally, in fact, even the least formalizable affects can
                            be identified when focusing on a text span. Main issue for these kinds
                            of emotion resources is their scarce availability for literary studies.
                            While such material is readily available for e.g., product reviews and
                            social media content, where the text of a review is generally
                            accompanied by a simple rating (e.g., a number of <q>stars</q>) and a
                            Tweet is supported by hashtags and emoticons (which frequently
                            synthetize and disambiguate the emotions expressed), extensive
                            annotation work is required for literary texts, with the above-mentioned
                            issues of inter-annotator agreement. In any case, research in this field
                            is rapidly moving forward, and annotated corpora such as <ptr
                                target="#kim-klinger2018a"/> have been recently made available.</p>
                        <p>It is worth noticing how this issue is widely discussed also in literary
                            studies, where the proposals in favor of a detectability of emotions
                            through lexical cues are numerous: in the field of Medieval studies, for
                            example, <ptr target="#rosenwein2008"/> bases her analysis of ancient
                            emotional systems on words alone, while <ptr
                                target="#rikhardsdottir2017"/> looks at the stylistics features that
                            mark such aspects; the theory of <term>emotives</term> by <ptr
                                target="#reddy2010"/>, then, leans on the concept of translation
                            (intended in its wider meaning, as a process of connection between
                            separated contexts) to build a virtuous cycle between language and
                            feelings. Numerous original solutions have been developed also in the
                            context of computational literary studies. <ptr target="#cavender2016"/>
                            developed their own emotion dictionary to study affect in <title
                                rend="italic">Ulysses</title>: to correctly operationalize Jameson's
                            theory of affect, they used it not to identify the passages dominated by
                            such words, but those where such words did not appear. The dominance in
                            these passages of words that pertain to the body, thus signaled the
                            presence of (unexpressed) affects.</p>

                        <p>The final distinction in a taxonomy of SA tools pertains to the method
                            adopted to accomplish the analysis. Here too, three main distinctions
                            have been proposed <ptr target="#liu2015"/>: <list type="unordered">
                                <item>M1. Simple (or advanced) wordcounts</item>
                                <item>M2. Syntactic structure analyses</item>
                                <item>M3. Machine learning techniques</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wordcount is evidently the easiest approach, which ignores sentence
                            structure and word order to accomplish the most basic <term>bag of
                                words</term> analysis. Given a text and an emotion dictionary, the
                            words that appear in both are counted and their values summed to
                            generate a final score. Such approach proves quite ineffective when
                            dealing with short sentences or complex rhetorical structures but shows
                            a surprising efficiency when the dimensions of the analyzed text
                            increase. Unfortunately, no research on determining the minimum length
                            for a reliable SA of literary texts — as done by <ptr target="#eder2013"
                            /> for stylometry — exists yet. Simple wordcount can then also rely on
                            statistics to better balance the relevance of single words (as done
                            e.g., by <ptr target="#reagan2016"/>): for example, if a positive word
                            tends to appear homogeneously in multiple texts, its emotional valence
                            might be relatively lower than that of words which appear just in a few
                            passages. Statistics can support wordcount in even more complex ways,
                            but when the analysis aims at fine-grained results, other approaches
                            need to be employed.</p>
                        <p>A further step is the analysis of the syntactic structure of sentences to
                            extract their overall meaning. This can be performed through different
                            levels of complexity, which range from the simple identification of
                            emotion shifters (e.g., negations, in sentences such as <q>he was not a
                                bad person</q>, or <q>it was neither sad nor boring</q>), to a full
                            parsing of sentences, which reconstruct their dependency trees (thus
                            distinguishing principal from subordinate clauses, coordinating from
                            adversative conjunctions, and so on). In theory, this approach should
                            prove the best when aiming at high levels of precision. However, it has
                            to deal with the multiple issues and limitations in natural language
                            processing (NLP), especially when applied to historical languages. One
                            of the most widely used NLP algorithms in DH, UDPipe <ptr
                                target="#straka2018"/>, still commits a substantial number of errors
                            in parsing languages like Latin and Ancient Greek. </p>
                        <p>Machine learning (ML) places itself at the highest level of the taxonomy.
                            It has recently established itself as the most effective approach to
                            artificial intelligence, which adopts a bottom-up strategy to build a
                            model of knowledge through a trial-and-error process <ptr
                                target="#buduma-locascio2017"/>, where examples provided by humans
                            (e.g., the recognition of emotions in texts) constitute the basis for a
                            sophisticated imitation game. Some of its most advanced applications in
                            SA (which even imitate the functioning of the human brain through
                            artificial neural networks, also known as <term>deep learning</term>)
                            are presented by <ptr target="#rojas-barahona2016"/>, <ptr
                                target="#yadav-vishwakarma2020"/> and <ptr target="#pipalia2020"/>.
                            Even the most complex issues in SA, such as the identification of irony
                                <ptr target="#vanhee2018"/> and sarcasm <ptr target="#digangi2019"
                            />, can be approached through ML. However, also ML has some fundamental
                            limitations when applied to literary studies: main issue is that ML
                            algorithms need human-annotated material to <q>learn</q> their tasks,
                            thus they primarily depend on labeled texts (ER3), with all the related
                            issues that were discussed above. </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, it can be stated that ML has become the dominant approach
                            in SA. In a recent <title rend="italic">SemEval</title> task, a total of
                            89 teams competed for the best SA approach in analyzing multilingual
                            Tweets. ML approaches were the most common and successful among the
                            participants <ptr target="#patwa2020"/>.</p>

                    <head>3.2 SA tools in literary studies</head>
                    <p>As noted at the beginning, SA approaches in literary studies are frequently
                        many steps behind the most recent advancements in computational linguistics.
                        This depends on the aforementioned intrinsic issues (e.g., the complexity of
                        literary language and the unavailability of annotated corpora), but also on
                        the tendency to adopt already-developed tools, which do not require the
                        expertise of a computer scientist. While, on the one hand, this is a
                        necessity in DH research (which cannot be reduced to a sub-field of
                        computational linguistics), it may also lead to errors and
                        misinterpretations. More subtly, as all tools bring about their implicit
                        theories and biases, any analysis that looks just at the external outcomes
                        without delving into the inner functioning logics, risks unintentionally
                        supporting ideals that are not its own. This is why a critical analysis of
                        SA tools becomes fundamental, focusing at least on the ones that are more
                        extensively used in DH.</p>

                        <head>3.2.1 Syuzhet</head>
                        <p>Matthew Jocker's <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title> is the software
                            that originated the most recent wave of interest towards SA in literary
                            studies. <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title>is probably one of the
                            least advanced software for SA, but it efficiently combines speed and
                            visualization power to produce effective results. When referring to the
                            taxonomy described above, it can be labeled as: <list type="unordered">
                                <item>T1, as its default dictionary simply assigns valence to each
                                    word (even if it includes also an implementation of the NRC
                                    emotion lexicon) </item>
                                <item>ER1, because the default dictionary was built through
                                    crowdsourcing (or <q>wisdom-of-the-crowd</q>) </item>
                                <item>M1, because the analysis is run via simple wordcount</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Additional feature in <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title> is a series of
                            visualization algorithms, which apply multiple smoothing functions to
                            generate elegant <term>plot arcs</term>. Generally, <title rend="italic"
                                >Syuzhet</title> works as follows: (1) the analyzed text is split
                            into sentences, (2) a series of sentiment values is produced for each
                            sentence, and (3) the raw values are processed by the smoothing
                            functions to generate plots. <ptr target="#swafford2015"/> has already
                            shown the main issues related to passages (2) and (3), (2) and (3), such
                            as the inability to detect negation and irony, and the distortions
                            generated by smoothing functions like the Fourier transform. In
                            addition, it should be noted that the speed of the algorithm is also
                            determined by the fact that it does not count words in sentences, so the
                            sentiment of the sentence <q>He had a good hearth and a good mind</q>
                            (+1.35) is the same of the sentence <q>He had a good hearth</q>. Main
                            advantage of <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title> is its transparency
                            and adaptability: developed as a package for the R programming language,
                            all its functions and resources are freely available and easily
                            modifiable (but basic programming skills are required). It should be
                            noted, however, that more advanced packages, such as <title
                                rend="italic">Rsentiment</title> and <title rend="italic"
                                >Sentimentr</title> (the latter, developed as an expansion of <title

                            <ptr target="#hutto-gilbert2014"/> is a slightly more advanced SA tool,
                            as it moves beyond the simple word counts carried out by <title
                                rend="italic">Syuzhet</title>. After its first definition, it has
                            been implemented in multiple programming languages, but one of the most
                            used implementations is that in Python. Here, <title rend="italic"
                                >Vader</title> has been integrated into the <title rend="italic"
                                >nltk</title> library, which provides multiple NLP functions. <list
                                type="unordered">

                                <item>ER1, with a dictionary developed through crowdsourcing </item>
                                <item>M2, because it identifies valence shifters, intensifiers, et

                        </p>

                        <p><title rend="italic">Vader</title> works on a sentence level and produces
                            a numerical output (composed by four values: <q>positive</q>,
                                <q>neutral</q>, <q>negative</q>, and <q>compound</q>, which is a
                            normalized sum of the first three). The identification of valence
                            shifters happens through a series of basic rules, which modify the
                            sentiment values assigned to single words if they are preceded or
                            followed by specific particles. For example, the sentence <q>He had a
                                good hearth</q> scores a compound value of +0.44 (on a range between
                            -1 and +1), while <q>He had a good hearth!</q> scores +0.49 and <q>He
                                had not a good hearth</q> scores -0.34. The rules that generate
                            these values are purely mathematical and were defined through an
                            empirical approach. In a series of experiments with multiple annotators
                            (e.g., asking them to evaluate the sentiment of <q>good</q> vs.
                                <q>good!</q> and <q>not good</q>), numerical modifiers were assigned
                            to single particles (e.g., 0.11 for exclamation marks and -0.69 for
                            negations). Such a procedure determines a good balance between accuracy
                            and computing requirements (the software is fast and quite reliable),
                            but it also causes a relative rigidity of the model. It should be noted,
                            in fact, that <title rend="italic">Vader</title> was developed for the
                            analysis of text produced in social media, thus the values of both
                            emotion dictionary and modifiers were tailored for this specific
                            context. In addition, it shows particular issues when dealing with irony
                            and complex syntactic constructions: the sentence <q>Well, he was like a
                                potato</q>, cited by <ptr target="#swafford2015"/> when criticizing
                                <title rend="italic">Syuzhet</title>, deceives <title rend="italic"
                                >Vader</title> too, with a compound score of +0.55. In literary
                            studies, Vader was recently adopted by <ptr target="#reed2018"/> to
                            explore the poetry of the Black Arts Movement and by <ptr

                            generating visual summaries of narratives. However, the second study
                            shows how better results are obtained by adopting a machine learning
                            approach. </p>

                            by adopting vector space models to generate its dictionary. In theory,
                                <title rend="italic">SentiArt</title> can be adapted to all contexts
                            and languages (if enough training material is available). In the current
                            taxonomy, it can be classified as: </p>
                        <list type="unordered">
                            <item>T1, with a focus on both valence and arousal </item>
                            <item>ER2, with a dictionary developed through word embeddings </item>
                            <item>M1, because it processes texts through simple wordcount</item>
                        </list>
                        <p> The creation of <title rend="italic">SentiArt</title> emotion
                            dictionaries works as follows: given a list of prototypical positive and
                            negative words, a vector space model is used to expand it, by
                            calculating the distance between these words and the entire dictionary.
                            The model can be generated based on a selection of texts (taken from a
                            specific author, genre, or period), or it can be simply downloaded from
                            a repository of pre-trained models — e.g., <title rend="italic"
                                >FastText</title>
                            <ptr target="#joulin2017"/>. The first option is advised because it
                            offers the possibility to tailor the dictionary to a specific context;
                            however, it can become problematic when the training material is not
                            enough to produce reliable vectors. Therefore, in the absence of
                            alternatives and when working on contemporary texts, the second option
                            constitutes a valid alternative. <title rend="italic">SentiArt</title>
                            has been developed in Python language, but it can also be used through
                            the graphical interface of <title rend="italic">Orange</title> (by
                            installing the <q>text</q> add-on), which offers an easy access to its
                            functionalities (with a limited set of pre-compiled dictionaries). The
                            main advantage of <title rend="italic">SentiArt</title> is that its hit
                            rate reaches almost 100%, thus all the words in a text are given a value
                            (while, in general, sentiment dictionaries cover just 10-20% of a text).
                            This can constitute an issue when also function words (like articles and
                            conjunctions) get a sentiment score: indeed, also such particles might
                            have an impact in terms in valence/arousal (see for example the
                            preposition <q>Of</q> at the beginning of <title rend="italic">Paradise
                                Lost</title>); however, both semantic variance (e.g., multiple word

                            there is a significant overlap in these dimensions, as many of them

                        <p><title rend="italic">Stanford SA</title> is written in the Java
                            programming language and is part of <title rend="italic">Stanford
                                CoreNLP</title>, one of the most advanced NLP software suites. It
                            can be used through command line (i.e., by typing a series of
                            pre-formulated commands) and tested on a visually-efficient online demo.
                            In simplified terms, <title rend="italic">Stanford SA</title> works as
                            follows: in a first phase, called <q>training,</q> the algorithm is
                            given a series of sentences annotated by human raters. Based on these
                            annotations, the algorithm <q>learns</q> how to distinguish five
                            possible sentiments: <q>very negative</q>, <q>negative</q>,
                                <q>neutral</q>, <q>positive</q>, and <q>very positive</q>. In ML
                            terms, the output of this procedure is also called a <term>model</term>,
                            intended as a formal representation of the analyzed phenomenon. At this
                            point, the analysis of new sentences begins: for each sentence, (1) a
                            full dependency tree is automatically built; (2) given that also ML
                            algorithms can be structured as trees, the dependency tree is adapted to
                            provide the structure for the ML algorithm; (3) the algorithm analyses
                            the sentence. As evident, the success of the whole process depends
                            heavily on the quality of the training phase. Here the possible issues
                            are many, because annotation demands a significant amount of time and
                            resources, and <title rend="italic">Stanford SA</title> requires a
                            complex annotation format, which focuses not on single words or
                            sentences, but on all nodes in a dependency tree. When taken out-of-the
                            box, <title rend="italic">Stanford SA</title> performed poorly on
                            nineteenth-century English texts, showing errors also in the
                            reconstruction of dependency trees <ptr target="#rebora2018" loc="232"
                            />. This depends on the fact that <title rend="italic">Stanford
                                SA</title> default algorithm is trained on contemporary movie
                            reviews, thus it has substantial issues in adapting to different
                            domains. In conclusion, while <title rend="italic">Stanford SA</title>
                            presents itself as one of the most sophisticated SA algorithms, its
                            complexity in usage and requirements in training have kept digital
                            humanists at a distance. In recent times, however, the interest of
                            digital humanists towards ML approaches for SA — starting from isolated
                            studies such as <ptr target="#zehe2017"/> — has increased substantially.

                <head>4. Conclusion</head>
                <p> This short survey showed how the gap between state-of-the-art tools and current
                    research in computational literary studies, while still present, seems to be
                    gradually closing itself. And while a community-driven effort like the one in
                    computational linguistics (embodied by phenomena such as the <title
                        rend="italic">SemEval</title> tasks) is still largely absent in DH, the
                    recently growing interest (and criticisms) towards methods like SA suggests that
                    it might be a natural outcome of the current evolution. In fact, among the most
                    relevant acquisitions derived from the debate around <ptr target="#da2019"/>, is
                    the importance of validation and reproducibility <ptr target="#piper2019"/>,
                    i.e., the construction of a community of practice. </p>
                <p>Still another, more theoretical issue seems to derive from a matter of modeling.
                    When introducing bleeding edge technology in SA (as well as in all DH tools), a
                    simple, direct connection between the phenomenon and its model seems to get
                    lost: as shown by <ptr target="#jannidis-flanders2019" loc="93"/> for vector
                    space models and by <ptr target="#underwood2019a"/> for unsupervised ML, any
                    possible theoretical reasoning risks becoming empty or misleading when we do not
                    know anymore the internal logic of the modeling process, or which phenomenon we
                    are actually modeling. This is especially true for advanced ML approaches, which
                    have been frequently criticized for their lack of transparency. SA adds a
                    further complication to this, because of the ineluctable subjectivity that is
                    inscribed in human emotions. A possible solution to this double conundrum can
                    derive from the practice of annotation. In fact, as ML teaches us, the
                    computational analysis (and prediction) of a phenomenon becomes possible only
                    when humans have found an agreement in identifying it. By asking researchers,
                    students, and literature lovers to annotate texts, testing existing theories and
                    letting more general trends emerge, the dream of building a shared,
                    community-driven <q>hermeneutic machine</q>
                    <ptr target="#ciotti2017a" loc="11"/> might not be that impossible to reach.</p>
                <p>For the moment, nothing advises against an — informed and critically aware — use
                    of the tools that are currently available, starting perhaps from — but not
                    limiting ourselves to — the tools presented here. Limitations are still many,
                    starting from the fact that resources for the English language substantially
                    outnumber those available for all other languages. However, advantages are
                    equally significant, as in the recognition that all the tools presented here are
                    available in the form of free, open-source, and easily modifiable software. And
                    probably still, in the end, literary studies will continue without the need to
