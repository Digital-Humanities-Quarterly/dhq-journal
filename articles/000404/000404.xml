                <p>For many years, digital humanists have responded to Alan Liu’s call for critical
                    digital humanities. Projects such as #TornApart/Seperados and
                    #PuertoRicoMapathon and pieces like <title rend="quotes">Where is Cultural
                        Criticism in the Digital Humanities?</title>
                    <ptr target="#liu2013"/>, <title rend="quotes">All the Digital Humanists Are
                        White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave</title>
                    <ptr target="#bailey2011"/>, and <title rend="quotes">Beyond the Margins:
                        Intersectionality and the Digital Humanities</title>
                    <ptr target="#risam2015"/> have paved the way for socially conscious
                    developments in the field. At the same time, pressures from administrators,
                    institutions, and funding agencies often discourage critical engagement in favor
                    of tool development and/or <soCalled>high tech</soCalled> projects <ptr
                        target="#boyles2018"/>. As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded
                    tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social
                    justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we
                    do ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together. So, how should
                    teacher-scholars implement an intersectional digital humanities framework in the
                    classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I assert that one effective
                    strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate topics such as
                    race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status through the
                    careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing so teaches
                    students to think more critically about the act of curation, by encouraging them
                    to participate in knowledge construction as well as the dismantling of harmful
                    narratives and power structures. While this approach differs from the tool-based
                    pedagogy often utilized in the field, its emphasis on knowledge production,
                    critical thinking, digital literacy, and social justice gives students
                    proficiency in socially conscious methodologies that can be applied to any
                    project. Linking curation to making and breaking, two digital humanities
                    approaches to meaning-making, provides a method for interrogating <quote

                <p>A few days ago, I was in Puerto Rico conducting interviews with citizens who
                    agreed to share their stories about Hurricane María. Knowing that I would only
                    be able to chat with a handful of individuals, I sought out people from vastly
                    different demographic groups, including those from a variety of geographic
                    locations, ages, educational backgrounds, and socioeconomic circumstances to try
                    to capture the broadest range of experiences possible. Curation, however, is an
                    inherently problematic process. No matter how many interviews I conducted, I
                    knew that I could not fully capture the trauma and pain caused by the hurricane.
                    I also knew that the narratives my research highlighted could shape, for better
                    or worse, public perceptions of the hurricane’s aftereffects. As Michelle
                    Caswell observes, <quote rend="inline" source="#caswell2014">memory work is a
                        tool for political liberation</quote>, but it is also a tool for social
                    oppression <ptr target="#caswell2014"/>. Government entities have been making
                    information inaccessible to the public — like the Environmental Protection
                    Agency, which has removed all research pertaining to climate change from its
                    websites, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is planning to destroy
                    all records pertaining to immigrant abuse — and others are presumed to follow,
                    dramatically shifting the boundaries of what counts as public knowledge. Such
                    decisions demonstrate the responsibility borne by those who shape public
                    knowledge: journalists, archivists, technologists, scholars, and citizens. In
                    many ways, public memory is like an algorithm: both promote biased narratives
                    using a decision process that is not transparent to the public. As Safiya Noble
                    notes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#noble2018">We are only beginning to understand
                            the long-term consequences of these decision-making tools in both

                        <ptr target="#noble2018"/>
                    </cit>. To teach our students about the structures underpinning our information
                    systems, we need to ensure they possess information literacy skills to assess,
                    critique, and respond to societal narratives and injustices. One of the best
                    ways to explore the consequences of meaning-making is to teach our students
                    about the processes that go into developing our archives, databases, and
                    information resources.</p>
                <p>Although the phrase <q>history is written by the victors</q> is cliché, at its
                    core it reveals a deep truth about those in power: they shape what becomes
                    public memory through both the development of both mainstream media and cultural
                    memory. Scholars like Michelle Caswell, Ricky Punzalan, and Marika Cifor have
                    noted the ways in which archives tend to reify white supremacy through the
                    processes of description, appraisal, use, and dissemination. For this reason,
                    Caswell advocates for students and faculty members to <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#caswell207">think critically about white
                            supremacy, with white people acknowledging their own roles in

                            concrete action</quote>
                        <ptr target="#caswell2017"/>
                    </cit>. Ellen Cushman echoes this call, encouraging scholars to familiarize
                    themselves with the problematic legacy of archives because <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#cushman2013">digital archives are beginning to
                            define the disciplinary work we do. As knowledge making increasingly
                            relies on digital archives, scholars need to understand the troubled and
                            troubling roots of archives if they’re to understand the instrumental,
                            historical, and cultural significance for the pieces therein</quote>
                        <ptr target="#cushman2013"/>
                    </cit>. For this reason, it is crucial to develop approaches to archiving and
                    meaning-making that are grounded in social justice. <q>Making and breaking</q>
                    are two such methodologies. Not only do they build upon two key digital
                    humanities practices, but also they teach students to interrogate the <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#sadler2015">archives of humanity</quote> in socially
                    conscious ways <ptr target="#sadler2015"/>.</p>
                <p>Given the prevalence of digital archives in producing and communicating meaning,
                    it is crucial to train our students to understand the ways in which
                    organizations — corporations, government entities, and community groups — often
                    use the processes of selection, preservation, and publication to reinforce
                    Euro-capitalist views of the world, or what Malea Powell terms <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#powell2008">the project of the imperial
                            archive in the Americas</quote>
                        <ptr target="#powell2008"/>
                    </cit>. Having students practice the skills of collection, curation, and
                    publication highlights the types of choices that archivists and information
                    systems make every day. Furthermore, students have the opportunity to both
                    critique and intervene in these systems through their own processes of
                    collection development. These skills are particularly crucial for members of
                    marginalized communities who are often the target of misinformation and bias. As
                    Moya Bailey aptly observes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#bailey2015">marginalized groups have often
                            used media production to challenge dominant scripts within mainstream
                            outlets, and the rise of digital platforms makes this task even
                            easier</quote>
                        <ptr target="#bailey2015"/>
                    </cit>. She goes on to describe the incredible work of black trans women on
                    Twitter who participate in a <quote source="#bailey2015" rend="inline">curation
                        process that also works to enrich the lives of those participating</quote>
                    in order to make their community, as well as members of the public, more
                    knowledgeable about the lived experiences of trans individuals <ptr
                        target="#bailey2015" loc="par. 3"/>. These women developed their own
                    strategies for controlling and disseminating narratives about the black trans
                    community.</p>
                <p>Some scholars also have developed models for promoting social justice in the
                    archives. For example, Michelle Caswell advocates for community-based human
                    rights archives that enable citizens to have a voice in what is preserved, how
                    it is disseminated, and who has rights to the information. La’el Hughes-Watkins
                    similarly promotes a model of reparative archives, which <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#hughes-watkins2018">repair past injuries […]
                            by normalizing acquisitions of the oppressed, advocating, and utilizing
                            primary resources that reflect society and that provide a means to
                            disengage with and prevent recordkeeping that systematically removes or
                            intercepts the voices of the <soCalled>other</soCalled></quote>
                        <ptr target="#hughes-watkins2018"/>
                    </cit>. Each of these models places marginalized individuals and groups in
                    control of their own narratives to counteract the inaccuracies and biases of
                    mainstream culture. Communities such as these have lasting implications for
                    their participants; Jessica Marie Johnson notes that <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#johnson2016">DH has offered people the means

                            those who have been marginalized or discriminated against or bullied —
                            have used digital tools to survive and live. That’s not academic. If
                            there isn’t a place for this type of work within what we are talking
                            about as digital humanities, then I think we are having a faulty

                    we as scholars, technologists, and citizens can help shape public knowledge by

                        Humanities</title> course discussed these varying definitions to gain a
                    richer understanding of the institutions and organizations that shape our
                    cultural memory. We spent much of our time examining the ethics of collecting,
                    curating, and disseminating resources, with a particular focus on the risks
                    inherent to such work. As Purdom Lindblad notes,<cit>

                            vocabularies, and description, as well as hiding/devaluing the labor

                            archival violence, to build an anti-violent, anti-racist, woman-ist,
                            practice instead?</quote>

                    </cit> To address these questions, the class brainstormed strategies for
                    interacting with materials pertaining to potentially vulnerable communities.
                    Rather than develop archives of their own, students curated resources around the
                    social movements we had been studying in class, including #BlackLivesMatter,
                    #SayHerName, and #ProtectPlannedParenthood. This created opportunities for
                    students to ask key questions surrounding information maintenance and management
                    like <q>What should be preserved?</q>, <q>How should this information be
                        presented to the public?</q>, and <q>Who has control over this
                        information?</q> At the same time, curation encouraged students to become
                    experts on their subject, by asking them to review and critique a variety of
                    sources about their particular topic. Amelia Jones argues that <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#jones2016">curating <emph>constructs</emph>
                            certain kinds of historical narratives, or in some cases intervenes in
                            existing narratives. As such […] <emph>curatorial practice</emph> is one
                            of the most important sites for the constitution of both historical

                    </cit>. While Jones’ work focuses on feminist art, her argument applies to the
                    broader power of curation — the promotion of new, or previously undervalued,
                    narratives and the deconstruction of outdated, and potentially harmful,
                    stereotypes. These acts of construction, or making, encourage students to take
                    ownership of their projects, not only by curating materials but also by gaining
                    a richer understanding of them.</p>
                <p>Digital humanities similarly values the processes of making and breaking.

                <p>To encourage students to engage in the processes of making and breaking, I
                    designed the course around prevalent social movements in the United States.
                    Course readings paired the work of feminist activists like Gloria Anzaldúa, Ana
                    Castillo, and Roxane Gay with the works of critical digital humanities scholars
                    such as Alan Liu, Roopika Risam, and Moya Bailey. Students were asked to draw
                    connections between these readings and an existing social movement of their
                    choice with groups forming around issues such as reproductive rights, civil
                    rights, and contemporary feminist politics. Using these topics as a foundation,
                    these groups developed four digital projects throughout the semester, each of
                    which was designed with the goal of both creating new models of knowledge and
                    dismantling narratives of oppression: <list type="ordered">

                            topic for the week. They provided context for their pop culture artifact

                            discussion about the issues raised by the media and its connection to

                            or projects to do so, including the development of Twitter bots, Tumblr

                <p><hi rend="bold">Case Studies:</hi> The course began with low-stakes projects that
                    asked students to construct narratives surrounding the readings and/or their
                    social movement. The first project was the case study, in which students used a
                    pop culture artifact to spark class discussion on a particular text or theme. On
                    a basic level, the case studies helped students gain a deeper understanding of
                    course content. One student commented, <q>I enjoy the case studies because I am
                        able to apply the readings to popular media and media that I'm familiar with
                        when in some cases, I have no idea what the examples in the readings
                        actually are.</q> On a more advanced level, the case studies asked students
                    to reflect on course readings and construct a narrative on how those topics play
                    out in the United States’ contemporary culture.</p>
                <p>For example, one student played FCKH8’s video <title rend="quotes"><ref
                            target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqHYzYn3WZw">Potty-Mouthed
                            Princesses Drop F-Bombs for Feminism</ref></title>, which asks viewers
                    to choose if they are more uncomfortable with young girls swearing or with the
                    endemic of sexual assault in the United States. She then tied the video to
                    Roxane Gay’s <title rend="italic">Bad Feminist</title>, which discusses the
                    challenges of living by feminist ideals in a world full of anti-feminist media.
                    As both texts use discomfort as a means of garnering readers’ attention, the
                    majority of the class period was spent debating the effectiveness of this
                    rhetorical strategy in garnering support for feminist causes. Since the class
                    discussion was largely theoretical, students focused on the structural and
                    technical elements of the two pieces rather than content.</p>

                            Down</ref></title>, which depicts the singer as a victim of sexual
                    assault who copes with the trauma by killing her attacker. As in the previous
                    example, this video was played in conjunction with <title rend="italic">Bad
                        Feminist</title>. Both texts emphasize the horrors of sexual assault, as
                    well as its gendered and racialized components, and assert that existing legal
                    and social structures protect the aggressor over the victim. Rather than
                    focusing on the structural elements of the texts, this conversation revolved
                    around the everyday realities of harassment, stalking, and assault.</p>
                <p>Although both students completed case studies on <title rend="italic">Bad
                        Feminist</title>, the resulting class discussions differed greatly. Since
                    students curated their own pop culture artifacts, they were able to select
                    materials that aligned with the themes and topics they found most valuable in
                    the source text. In doing so, they shaped and structured class discussions in
                    the ways they found to be most meaningful. By engaging with topics that students
                    found most pertinent, the case studies encouraged them to become deeply invested
                    in course content.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Annotated Bibliography:</hi> As the semester developed, students
                    were asked to develop an annotated bibliography on their social movement. To
                    ensure that students would have a rich and nuanced understanding of these
                    movements, they were asked to read and analyze a variety of sources, including
                    scholarly sources, popular publications, and new media materials. These
                    annotated bibliographies served as the foundation for their advocacy projects,
                    giving them a depth of knowledge on their social movement. Inherent in this
                    assignment was the act of meaning-making, as students gained a new awareness of
                    their topic by reading and curating materials. As such, the annotated
                    bibliography provided them with the foundation needed to
                        <soCalled>break</soCalled> oppressive cultural narratives surrounding their
                    advocacy topics.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">Timelines:</hi> After students had developed a rich understanding
                    of their social movements, they were able to continue the process of
                    deconstruction, which gives them the opportunity to disprove and dismantle false
                    narratives surrounding their topic. The group studying reproductive rights, for
                    instance, created a timeline to depict and address the series of videos claiming
                    that Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue to researchers. To debunk this claim,
                    they listed each accusation against Planned Parenthood regarding the sale of
                    fetal tissue (2000-present) alongside the findings from each subsequent
                    investigation. In each case, they were able to show that investigators were
                    unable to find evidence of wrongdoing. This project, therefore,
                        <soCalled>broke</soCalled> the narratives surrounding Planned Parenthood and
                    replaced them with new, more ethical accounts.</p>
                <p>Similarly, a group focusing on civil rights modeled their project after
                    #SayHerName, a group that protests the disproportionate amount of police
                    violence experienced by black women. These students built upon existing
                    #SayHerName resources by developing a timeline to bring attention to women of
                    color who have been victims of police violence. To <soCalled>break</soCalled>
                    media narratives that claimed these individuals were
                        <soCalled>criminals</soCalled> who <soCalled>deserved</soCalled>
                    mistreatment, this group provided a detailed description of each individual,
                    incident, and police activity. Doing so humanized each of the women and
                    disproved claims that they were engaged in criminal behavior. Thus, this project
                    helped students deconstruct myths surrounding police violence in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>By allowing students to participate in making and breaking, the timeline project
                    not only allowed students to curate resources but also showed them how they
                    could be used to interrupt harmful narratives. Since this project utilized both
                    making and breaking, it was easily the most powerful and effective pedagogical
                    tool in the seminar. Students in the course confirmed this assertion, noting
                    that the timeline project was their favorite in course evaluations.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">Text Analysis:</hi> Although each of the assignments in this
                    course were designed to develop students’ understanding of and engagement with
                    curatorial practices, the text analysis assignment failed to do so in a
                    meaningful way. One reason may be that this project did not encourage the
                    students to either <soCalled>make</soCalled> or <soCalled>break</soCalled>
                    information about their topic. Another reason may be that pressures from other
                    scholars, administrators, institutions, and funding agencies often discourage
                    critical practices in favor of <soCalled>high tech</soCalled> projects <ptr
                        target="#boyles2018"/>. As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded
                    tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social
                    justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we
                    do our students and ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together.
                    Such was the case with this project. </p>
                <p>For this assignment, students were asked to gather a number of posts from popular
                    media sites on the topic of their social movement. Students were then asked to
                    enter these sources en masse to Voyant Tools so that they could search for
                    trends in the data that were not evident during a preliminary reading. Although
                    students completed these tasks without issue, many of them demonstrated a sense
                    of frustration with the exercise. Rather than helping them gain a new
                    understanding of the intersectional issues, the assignment reconfirmed their
                    existing analyses of the texts. One reason may be that popular publications
                    heavily rely upon buzzwords and hot debate topics for their material. As such,
                    the group working on reproductive rights saw trends surrounding the terms
                        <q>fetal tissue</q>, <q>sale</q>, and <q>fake</q>. Likewise, the group
                    focusing on police brutality to black women noted the frequency of terms such as
                        <q>say her name</q>, <q>black lives matter</q>, <q>violence</q>, and
                        <q>criminal.</q> As such, both groups felt that the data reconfirmed their
                    understanding of their individual topics rather than giving them a strategy for
                    making new forms of knowledge or breaking down oppressive narratives.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">Final Projects:</hi> For the final projects, students were asked
                    to create a piece of digital advocacy pertaining to their group topic. Leaving
                    the requirements intentionally vague, I was surprised to see students gravitate
                    toward curation projects. While selected tools varied — Tumblr, Instagram,
                    Wordpress — each of the final projects compiled fact-checked resources and made
                    them accessible to audiences outside of academia. When I asked the students
                    about these choices, they unanimously cited their interest in producing and
                    sharing information that would both redress existing disinformation campaigns
                    and reach broad public audiences. </p>
                <p>Students gravitated towards social media, believing that their contributions to
                    public knowledge could help alleviate the widespread dissemination of
                    misinformation. While the effectiveness of this strategy is complicated by
                    algorithms — the automated processes that determine what we see online —
                    students believed that promoting and amassing more ethical information had the
                    potential to shift the ways our technologies determine the value of information. </p>
                <p>Moreover, students’ own systems of knowledge were shifted. Rather than merely
                    summarizing or analyzing a topic, they developed work that combined the
                    processes of making and breaking — carefully selecting resources that would
                    break down harmful social biases about their topic and constructing new, more
                    ethical narratives. Students cited their previous work, particularly the case
                    studies and timelines, as moments where they developed an understanding of how
                    curation can be used in service of social justice projects. More importantly,
                    they found effective strategies for carrying this work into the future,
                    including applying for library school, volunteering at local community
                    organizations, and developing digital campaigns around issues like campus sexual
                    assault and racial bias. Their engagement suggests that making and breaking
                    provide an effective means of teaching information ethics and social justice.

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>So, how should teacher-scholars implement an intersectional digital humanities
                    framework in the classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I found that
                    one effective strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate
                    topics such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status
                    through the careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing
                    so teaches students to think more critically about the act of curation by
                    encouraging them to participate in the making and breaking of knowledge. While
                    this approach differs from the tool-based pedagogy often utilized in the field,
                    its emphasis on knowledge production, critical thinking, digital literacy, and
                    social justice gives students proficiency in socially conscious methodologies
                    that can be applied to any project. It also gives one possible answer to Sadler
                    and Bourg, who note that <cit>
