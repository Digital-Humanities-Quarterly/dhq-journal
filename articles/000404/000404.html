                  <p>For many years, digital humanists have responded to Alan Liu’s call for critical
                     digital humanities. Projects such as #TornApart/Seperados and
                     #PuertoRicoMapathon and pieces like “Where is Cultural
                     Criticism in the Digital Humanities?”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#liu2013">Liu 2013</a>], “All the Digital Humanists Are
                     White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2011">Bailey 2011</a>], and “Beyond the Margins:
                     Intersectionality and the Digital Humanities”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#risam2015">Risam 2015</a>] have paved the way for socially conscious
                     developments in the field. At the same time, pressures from administrators,
                     institutions, and funding agencies often discourage critical engagement in favor
                     of tool development and/or “high tech” projects [<a class="ref" href="#boyles2018">Boyles 2018</a>]. As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded
                     tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social
                     justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we
                     do ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together. So, how should
                     teacher-scholars implement an intersectional digital humanities framework in the
                     classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I assert that one effective
                     strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate topics such as
                     race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status through the
                     careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing so teaches
                     students to think more critically about the act of curation, by encouraging them
                     to participate in knowledge construction as well as the dismantling of harmful
                     narratives and power structures. While this approach differs from the tool-based
                     pedagogy often utilized in the field, its emphasis on knowledge production,
                     critical thinking, digital literacy, and social justice gives students
                     proficiency in socially conscious methodologies that can be applied to any
                     project. Linking curation to making and breaking, two digital humanities
                     approaches to meaning-making, provides a method for interrogating “archives of humanity” and
                     developing a pedagogy grounded in cultural critique and social justice [<a class="ref" href="#sadler2015">Sadler and Bourg 2015</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">A few days ago, I was in Puerto Rico conducting interviews with citizens who
                     agreed to share their stories about Hurricane María. Knowing that I would only
                     be able to chat with a handful of individuals, I sought out people from vastly
                     different demographic groups, including those from a variety of geographic
                     locations, ages, educational backgrounds, and socioeconomic circumstances to try
                     to capture the broadest range of experiences possible. Curation, however, is an
                     inherently problematic process. No matter how many interviews I conducted, I
                     knew that I could not fully capture the trauma and pain caused by the hurricane.
                     I also knew that the narratives my research highlighted could shape, for better
                     or worse, public perceptions of the hurricane’s aftereffects. As Michelle
                     Caswell observes, “memory work is a
                     tool for political liberation”, but it is also a tool for social
                     oppression [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2014">Caswell 2014</a>]. Government entities have been making
                     information inaccessible to the public — like the Environmental Protection
                     Agency, which has removed all research pertaining to climate change from its
                     websites, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is planning to destroy
                     all records pertaining to immigrant abuse — and others are presumed to follow,
                     dramatically shifting the boundaries of what counts as public knowledge. Such
                     decisions demonstrate the responsibility borne by those who shape public
                     knowledge: journalists, archivists, technologists, scholars, and citizens. In
                     many ways, public memory is like an algorithm: both promote biased narratives
                     using a decision process that is not transparent to the public. As Safiya Noble
                     notes, “We are only beginning to understand
                     the long-term consequences of these decision-making tools in both
                     masking and deepening social inequality”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#noble2018">Noble 2018</a>]. To teach our students about the structures underpinning our information
                     systems, we need to ensure they possess information literacy skills to assess,
                     critique, and respond to societal narratives and injustices. One of the best
                     ways to explore the consequences of meaning-making is to teach our students
                     about the processes that go into developing our archives, databases, and
                     information resources.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Although the phrase “history is written by the victors” is cliché, at its
                     core it reveals a deep truth about those in power: they shape what becomes
                     public memory through both the development of both mainstream media and cultural
                     memory. Scholars like Michelle Caswell, Ricky Punzalan, and Marika Cifor have
                     noted the ways in which archives tend to reify white supremacy through the
                     processes of description, appraisal, use, and dissemination. For this reason,
                     Caswell advocates for students and faculty members to “think critically about white
                     supremacy, with white people acknowledging their own roles in
                     promulgating it, and with all of us imagining ways out of it through
                     concrete action”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2017">Caswell 2017</a>]. Ellen Cushman echoes this call, encouraging scholars to familiarize
                     themselves with the problematic legacy of archives because “digital archives are beginning to
                     define the disciplinary work we do. As knowledge making increasingly
                     relies on digital archives, scholars need to understand the troubled and
                     troubling roots of archives if they’re to understand the instrumental,
                     historical, and cultural significance for the pieces therein”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#cushman2013">Cushman 2013</a>]. For this reason, it is crucial to develop approaches to archiving and
                     meaning-making that are grounded in social justice. “Making and breaking”
                     are two such methodologies. Not only do they build upon two key digital
                     humanities practices, but also they teach students to interrogate the “archives of humanity” in socially
                     conscious ways [<a class="ref" href="#sadler2015">Sadler and Bourg 2015</a>].

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Given the prevalence of digital archives in producing and communicating meaning,
                     it is crucial to train our students to understand the ways in which
                     organizations — corporations, government entities, and community groups — often
                     use the processes of selection, preservation, and publication to reinforce
                     Euro-capitalist views of the world, or what Malea Powell terms “the project of the imperial
                     archive in the Americas”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#powell2008">Powell 2008</a>]. Having students practice the skills of collection, curation, and
                     publication highlights the types of choices that archivists and information
                     systems make every day. Furthermore, students have the opportunity to both
                     critique and intervene in these systems through their own processes of
                     collection development. These skills are particularly crucial for members of
                     marginalized communities who are often the target of misinformation and bias. As
                     Moya Bailey aptly observes, “marginalized groups have often
                     used media production to challenge dominant scripts within mainstream
                     outlets, and the rise of digital platforms makes this task even
                     easier”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2015">Bailey 2015</a>]. She goes on to describe the incredible work of black trans women on
                     Twitter who participate in a “curation
                     process that also works to enrich the lives of those participating”
                     in order to make their community, as well as members of the public, more
                     knowledgeable about the lived experiences of trans individuals [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2015">Bailey 2015</a>, par. 3]. These women developed their own
                     strategies for controlling and disseminating narratives about the black trans
                     community.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Some scholars also have developed models for promoting social justice in the
                     archives. For example, Michelle Caswell advocates for community-based human
                     rights archives that enable citizens to have a voice in what is preserved, how
                     it is disseminated, and who has rights to the information. La’el Hughes-Watkins
                     similarly promotes a model of reparative archives, which “repair past injuries […]
                     by normalizing acquisitions of the oppressed, advocating, and utilizing
                     primary resources that reflect society and that provide a means to
                     disengage with and prevent recordkeeping that systematically removes or
                     intercepts the voices of the ‘other’”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#hughes-watkins2018">Hughes-Watkins 2018</a>]. Each of these models places marginalized individuals and groups in
                     control of their own narratives to counteract the inaccuracies and biases of
                     mainstream culture. Communities such as these have lasting implications for
                     their participants; Jessica Marie Johnson notes that 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           DH has offered people the means
                           and opportunity to create new communities. And this type of community
                           building should not be overlooked; it has literally saved lives as far
                           as I’m concerned. People – those who have felt alone or maligned or
                           those who have been marginalized or discriminated against or bullied —
                           have used digital tools to survive and live. That’s not academic. If
                           there isn’t a place for this type of work within what we are talking
                           about as digital humanities, then I think we are having a faulty
                           conversation.
                            [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2016">Johnson 2016</a>]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> Echoing the call for public digital humanities, scholars like Johnson,
                     Noble, Risam, and Gil, note the need for socially conscious approaches to social
                     issues. Recent projects, such as Torn Apart/Separados<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e329">[1]</a>, BlackWomenToo<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e334">[2]</a>, the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e339">[3]</a>, and the Internet Archive<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e345">[4]</a>, demonstrate the ways that
                     we as scholars, technologists, and citizens can help shape public knowledge by
                     pushing against inaccurate or harmful narratives. Partnering with librarians,
                     archivists, and technologists — the keepers of our information — is crucial to
                     these aims. As such, “it is important for archival
                     education to implement concrete steps that include recruitment of
                     students from diverse, historically marginalized communities;
                     encouragement of culturally sensitive classroom environments; pluralist
                     approaches to diverse ontologies and epistemologies; and an ongoing
                     analysis of power both inside and outside the classroom”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#caswell2012">Caswell et al. 2012</a>]. The problem goes far beyond archival education; many of the systems that
                     provide information to the public are grounded in racist and sexist ideologies
                     that reinforce the values of white supremacy. Since “only about 2 percent of open source software developers
                     are women”, the current state of technology development “is incompatible with the idea of a
                     feminist future for library discovery software” and for the
                     technological landscape at large [<a class="ref" href="#nafus2006">Nafus, Kreiger, and Leach 2006</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sadler2015">Sadler and Bourg 2015</a>]. For these reasons, it is vital to introduce
                     students, particularly those in programs like women’s and gender studies,
                     African American, Latinx, and/or Indigenous studies, and sexuality studies, to
                     humanistic approaches to information ethics. One such approach is through
                     curatorial and archival practice.

                     humanists. While archivists are concerned primarily with the principles of
                     provenance and original order, digital humanists often view archives as “online groupings of digital
                     copies of non-digital original materials [...] purposefully selected and
                     arranged in order to support a scholarly goal. Some prominent examples
                     of this kind of usage are the Shakespeare Quartos Archive<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e375">[5]</a>,
                     the Rossetti Archive<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e380">[6]</a> and the William

                     richer understanding of the institutions and organizations that shape our
                     cultural memory. We spent much of our time examining the ethics of collecting,
                     curating, and disseminating resources, with a particular focus on the risks
                     inherent to such work. As Purdom Lindblad notes,
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           There is an inherent violence in
                           archival work — silencing and obscuring of people and sources, creating
                           and sustaining hierarchies through collection practices that value some
                           voices and experiences over others, through naming practices, controlled
                           vocabularies, and description, as well as hiding/devaluing the labor
                           involved in this work […] How can we deconstruct this silencing and
                           archival violence, to build an anti-violent, anti-racist, woman-ist,
                           practice instead?

                     </blockquote> To address these questions, the class brainstormed strategies for
                     interacting with materials pertaining to potentially vulnerable communities.
                     Rather than develop archives of their own, students curated resources around the
                     social movements we had been studying in class, including #BlackLivesMatter,
                     #SayHerName, and #ProtectPlannedParenthood. This created opportunities for
                     students to ask key questions surrounding information maintenance and management
                     like “What should be preserved?”, “How should this information be
                     presented to the public?”, and “Who has control over this
                     information?” At the same time, curation encouraged students to become
                     experts on their subject, by asking them to review and critique a variety of
                     sources about their particular topic. Amelia Jones argues that “curating <em class="emph">constructs</em>
                     certain kinds of historical narratives, or in some cases intervenes in
                     existing narratives. As such […] <em class="emph">curatorial practice</em> is one
                     of the most important sites for the constitution of both historical
                     narratives […] and feminist theories of curating”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#jones2016">Jones 2016</a>]. While Jones’ work focuses on feminist art, her argument applies to the
                     broader power of curation — the promotion of new, or previously undervalued,
                     narratives and the deconstruction of outdated, and potentially harmful,
                     stereotypes. These acts of construction, or making, encourage students to take
                     ownership of their projects, not only by curating materials but also by gaining
                     a richer understanding of them.

                     Notably, Roopika Risam advocates for a digital humanities that “brings together the ethos of
                     making, building, and creating of the digital humanities with critiques
                     of imperialism in regimes of knowledge and power that emerge from

                      [<a class="ref" href="#risam2016">Risam 2016</a>]. Doing so in the classroom allows students to critique unethical power
                     structures and to produce narratives focused on social justice. Making, however,
                     is not simply a tool for digital humanists. In <cite class="title italic">Teaching to
                        Transgress</cite>, bell hooks asserts that “transformative pedagogy involves
                     student-centered, holistic, and praxis-oriented approaches that allow
                     students to create their own knowledge. Transformative pedagogy involves
                     a ‘revolution of values’”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#hooks1994">hooks 1994</a>]. In other words, construction can be a pedagogical process that ties
                     digital humanists’ love of “making” to activists’ drive for
                     social justice.

                     importance of critique via “breaking” or
                     “deforming.” Risam notes, “knowledge is produced by the act of
                     dismantling. We might view the results as radical, emancipatory acts
                     that free new forms of knowledge from the persistent forms in which they
                     are trapped, just as the ideal of decolonization offers hope of how a

                     highlights the intersection of digital humanities scholarship with activism by
                     encouraging a dismantling of both tangible and intangible expressions of

                     a basic level, the case studies helped students gain a deeper understanding of

                     actually are.” On a more advanced level, the case studies asked students
                     to reflect on course readings and construct a narrative on how those topics play
                     out in the United States’ contemporary culture.

                     the source text. In doing so, they shaped and structured class discussions in
                     the ways they found to be most meaningful. By engaging with topics that students
                     found most pertinent, the case studies encouraged them to become deeply invested
                     in course content.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13"><span class="hi bold">Annotated Bibliography:</span> As the semester developed, students
                     were asked to develop an annotated bibliography on their social movement. To
                     ensure that students would have a rich and nuanced understanding of these
                     movements, they were asked to read and analyze a variety of sources, including
                     scholarly sources, popular publications, and new media materials. These
                     annotated bibliographies served as the foundation for their advocacy projects,
                     giving them a depth of knowledge on their social movement. Inherent in this
                     assignment was the act of meaning-making, as students gained a new awareness of
                     their topic by reading and curating materials. As such, the annotated
                     bibliography provided them with the foundation needed to
                     “break” oppressive cultural narratives surrounding their
                     advocacy topics.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14"><span class="hi bold">Timelines:</span> After students had developed a rich understanding
                     of their social movements, they were able to continue the process of
                     deconstruction, which gives them the opportunity to disprove and dismantle false
                     narratives surrounding their topic. The group studying reproductive rights, for
                     instance, created a timeline to depict and address the series of videos claiming
                     that Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue to researchers. To debunk this claim,
                     they listed each accusation against Planned Parenthood regarding the sale of
                     fetal tissue (2000-present) alongside the findings from each subsequent
                     investigation. In each case, they were able to show that investigators were
                     unable to find evidence of wrongdoing. This project, therefore,
                     “broke” the narratives surrounding Planned Parenthood and
                     replaced them with new, more ethical accounts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Similarly, a group focusing on civil rights modeled their project after
                     #SayHerName, a group that protests the disproportionate amount of police
                     violence experienced by black women. These students built upon existing
                     #SayHerName resources by developing a timeline to bring attention to women of
                     color who have been victims of police violence. To “break”
                     media narratives that claimed these individuals were
                     “criminals” who “deserved”
                     mistreatment, this group provided a detailed description of each individual,
                     incident, and police activity. Doing so humanized each of the women and
                     disproved claims that they were engaged in criminal behavior. Thus, this project
                     helped students deconstruct myths surrounding police violence in the United
                     States.

                     not only allowed students to curate resources but also showed them how they
                     could be used to interrupt harmful narratives. Since this project utilized both
                     making and breaking, it was easily the most powerful and effective pedagogical
                     tool in the seminar. Students in the course confirmed this assertion, noting
                     that the timeline project was their favorite in course evaluations.

                     course were designed to develop students’ understanding of and engagement with
                     curatorial practices, the text analysis assignment failed to do so in a
                     meaningful way. One reason may be that this project did not encourage the
                     students to either “make” or “break”
                     information about their topic. Another reason may be that pressures from other
                     scholars, administrators, institutions, and funding agencies often discourage
                     critical practices in favor of “high tech” projects [<a class="ref" href="#boyles2018">Boyles 2018</a>]. As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded
                     tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social
                     justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we
                     do our students and ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together.
                     Such was the case with this project.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">For this assignment, students were asked to gather a number of posts from popular
                     media sites on the topic of their social movement. Students were then asked to
                     enter these sources en masse to Voyant Tools so that they could search for
                     trends in the data that were not evident during a preliminary reading. Although
                     students completed these tasks without issue, many of them demonstrated a sense
                     of frustration with the exercise. Rather than helping them gain a new
                     understanding of the intersectional issues, the assignment reconfirmed their
                     existing analyses of the texts. One reason may be that popular publications
                     heavily rely upon buzzwords and hot debate topics for their material. As such,
                     the group working on reproductive rights saw trends surrounding the terms
                     “fetal tissue”, “sale”, and “fake”. Likewise, the group
                     focusing on police brutality to black women noted the frequency of terms such as
                     “say her name”, “black lives matter”, “violence”, and
                     “criminal.” As such, both groups felt that the data reconfirmed their
                     understanding of their individual topics rather than giving them a strategy for
                     making new forms of knowledge or breaking down oppressive narratives.

                     the requirements intentionally vague, I was surprised to see students gravitate
                     toward curation projects. While selected tools varied — Tumblr, Instagram,
                     Wordpress — each of the final projects compiled fact-checked resources and made
                     them accessible to audiences outside of academia. When I asked the students
                     about these choices, they unanimously cited their interest in producing and
                     sharing information that would both redress existing disinformation campaigns
                     and reach broad public audiences.

                     algorithms — the automated processes that determine what we see online —
                     students believed that promoting and amassing more ethical information had the
                     potential to shift the ways our technologies determine the value of information.

                     summarizing or analyzing a topic, they developed work that combined the
                     processes of making and breaking — carefully selecting resources that would
                     break down harmful social biases about their topic and constructing new, more
                     ethical narratives. Students cited their previous work, particularly the case
                     studies and timelines, as moments where they developed an understanding of how
                     curation can be used in service of social justice projects. More importantly,
                     they found effective strategies for carrying this work into the future,
                     including applying for library school, volunteering at local community
                     organizations, and developing digital campaigns around issues like campus sexual
                     assault and racial bias. Their engagement suggests that making and breaking
                     provide an effective means of teaching information ethics and social justice.

                     framework in the classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I found that
                     one effective strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate
                     topics such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status
                     through the careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing
                     so teaches students to think more critically about the act of curation by
                     encouraging them to participate in the making and breaking of knowledge. While
                     this approach differs from the tool-based pedagogy often utilized in the field,
                     its emphasis on knowledge production, critical thinking, digital literacy, and
                     social justice gives students proficiency in socially conscious methodologies
                     that can be applied to any project. It also gives one possible answer to Sadler
                     and Bourg, who note that “[t]he means of production for the
                     archives of humanity are up for grabs, and within our reach is the
                     possibility of new production methods that resist the recreation of
                     existing patterns of exclusion and marginalization”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#sadler2015">Sadler and Bourg 2015</a>]. I argue that “making” and
                     “breaking”, two digital humanities approaches to
                     meaning-making, can be used to interrogate the “archives of humanity” and develop a pedagogy
                     grounded in cultural critique and social justice [<a class="ref" href="#sadler2015">Sadler and Bourg 2015</a>].
