                     While neither the first renovation of the space — the room shifted from reserve books
                     to periodicals in the 1970s — nor the first home of the lab, which relocated from
                     a
                     room requiring a campus ID for access to a publicly accessible, much larger space
                     —
                     the transition of a reading room to a digital humanities (DH) laboratory represented
                     a new kind of commitment from the Library that required structural, aesthetic, and
                     programmatic transformations. The goal was to create a collaborative, open workspace
                     where the practice of digital humanities would be visible, accessible, and supported
                     within Sterling Memorial Library, the so-named “heart of the
                     university”

                     reimagining of this central and symbolic space. This article considers the role of
                     DH
                     labs as “humanities infrastructure,” with a focus on how
                     location, materials, and services could be designed to support DH research and
                     training within libraries.

                     calls for a reimagining of lab programming, one that moves away from faculty
                     fellowships toward incubator models that provide more training and capacity-building
                     support [<a class="ref" href="#fraistat2019">Fraistat 2019</a>]. We extend this call to consider how the
                     physical design of labs contributes to the services offered therein. Many
                     universities and colleges have built successful models where a DH lab or center is
                     affiliated with a single department or faculty lead: Stanford’s Literary Lab was at
                     one point physically housed within the English department, for example. More and
                     more, however, labs are forming within libraries. Joan Lippincott observes that
                     “more libraries are recognizing that they may want to invest
                     resources, including staff expertise and time, technology infrastructure such as
                     repositories, and physical spaces such as digital scholarship centers or labs, to
                     make a more formal commitment by the library to this type of scholarship”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lippincott2015">Lippincott 2015</a>]. This extension of library support for digital
                     training spans the United States, with examples from the University of California
                     Los
                     Angeles, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Rutgers University, University of
                     Virginia, and Brown University, to name a few. But even within libraries, the focus
                     and design of labs vary. Katy Kavanagh Webb’s recent survey of digital support
                     separates labs into groups covering Digital Media, Digital Humanities, Data
                     Visualization, and Makerspaces (2018), each of which has its own spatial constraints
                     with respect to the kind and amount of hardware needed, which in turn affects its
                     design flexibility.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">At Yale, the Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) has always been physically and
                     organizationally located within the Library, tasked from the beginning with
                     supporting scholarship across the humanities broadly considered. In addition to
                     departmental diversity, the audience for DH support has included a broad set of
                     clients, from Yale College students, graduate students, faculty, curators, and
                     librarians to occasional collaborations with external partners. This range of
                     disciplinary and professional perspectives presented unique opportunities and
                     challenges for designing a space that would be inspiring, inclusive, and
                     functional.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Moving DH labs into libraries invites a rethinking of library spaces that were
                     originally designed for oftentimes siloed engagements. Completed in 1931, Sterling
                     Memorial Library contains nearly 450,000 square feet of space to support learning
                     and
                     research. Positioned immediately to the left of the main entrance, the Reserve Book
                     Room (Figure 2) was an integral part of architect James Gamble Rogers’ design. The
                     room and its support areas total over 4,000 square feet and were designed to hold
                     10,000 volumes on wooden shelves that flank the northwest and southeast walls. Large
                     expanses of leaded glass windows bring filtered natural light into the room, rising
                     to a ceiling of decorative plasterwork and chandeliers. The abundance of
                     craftsmanship is characteristic of Sterling Memorial Library as a whole, completed
                     at
                     a time when the Great Depression enabled new campus construction nationwide at
                     relatively low cost. Yet the Reserve Room itself was described by contemporary
                     observers as a place of relative moderation: “Inasmuch as the
                     Reserve Book Room is really a work room where students go for study,” wrote
                     alum Ellery Husted in the <cite class="title italic">Yale Library Gazette</cite> the year
                     of Sterling’s opening, “its architectural treatment is more
                     restrained” than the other large reading rooms which filled the main floor
                     of the new library [<a class="ref" href="#husted1931">Husted 1931</a>]. The Reserve Book Room served its role
                     as designed well into the 1970s, when the construction of the new underground
                     Cross-Campus Library (now renamed Bass Library) opened up more modern space for
                     perusal of reserved books. As a result, in 1973, the room changed its function to
                     housing periodicals, continuing in that capacity through a renovation in the late
                     1990s that included new furniture and a renaming to the Franke Family Reading Room
                     in
                     honor of a gift from Barbara and Richard Franke (Class of 1953), who share a longtime
                     commitment to supporting the humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">By the early 2010s, consensus had built on campus that the room could serve a more
                     prominent role in the future of research in the arts and humanities. With the
                     availability of other rooms within Sterling to hold print periodicals, the space
                     seemed ripe for reimagination. Discussions imagined a “Digital Center for Arts and
                     Humanities,” modeled on the successful launch of the Center for Science and
                     Social Science Information (CSSSI) in a 1960s building in 2012 [<a class="ref" href="#fox2012">Fox 2012</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#thondavadi2012">Thondavadi and Yin 2012</a>]. That renovation project successfully provided a home
                     for the science and science libraries, 24-hour study space, and support for data
                     analysis in the basement of a science building. Subject specialists in that new space
                     worked in glass offices surrounding a central collaborative work area, where advanced
                     statistical consulting was also provided by graduate students. CSSSI thus provided
                     a
                     new template at Yale for how subject specialists, technology, and data services could
                     complement traditional library offerings such as print collections and periodicals.
                     The challenge was how to adapt this support model for a significantly older, and less
                     flexible, space.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Indeed, the design and materiality of the Franke Room was naturally much different
                     than the 1960s environment in which CSSSI was built. Instead of the basement of a
                     mid-century building, the Franke Room contained wooden carvings, leaded glass, and
                     plasterwork designed to evoke the early English Renaissance. Built-in bookcases lined
                     the room up to a height of nine feet, transitioning to walls that were designed to
                     appear uneven, as if finished by hand.

                     material fabric of Sterling Memorial Library also offered advantages (Figure 3). In
                     contrast to the disciplinary-specific reading rooms on higher floors (and behind
                     access gates that require Yale IDs), the Franke Room is near the main entrance on
                     the
                     ground floor, open and accessible to all, making it a strong candidate for a large
                     and welcoming space designated for the exploration of new ideas and methods.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">As a design team of architects and library staff examined the room’s complex
                     materials and physical adjacencies, several intriguing possibilities emerged. Given
                     the room’s close proximity to the library’s physical collections, the reimagined
                     space could position DH as contiguous with older traditions of humanities research
                     rather than a radical break from it. The presence of a substantial print collection
                     in the building could serve as a reminder that the root material for many digital
                     projects is the print book or periodical. From a workflow perspective, this proximity
                     could also streamline the research process: if the lab had equipment available for
                     digitization, researchers could pull books from the stacks and bring them straight
                     to
                     the lab where they could transform them into machine-actionable data.

                     opening it up to support collaborative meeting spaces and on-site offices for lab
                     staff. The 1930s ideal of hiding the mechanical aspects of scholarly support space
                     would give way to exposing this previously backstage area to the patrons in the main

                     [<a class="ref" href="#yale2013">Yale 2013</a>] to graduate student-led working groups and informal
                     committees. (For an overview of reactions to this effort, see <a href="#svensson2012">Svensson 2012</a>.) The Library first advertised a
                     Librarian for Digital Humanities Research in the late 2000s, but did not fill the
                     position until 2013. Throughout this time period, graduate students, librarians, IT
                     staff, and faculty continued to advocate for more structured support — along with
                     dedicated space — for DH inside the library. These conversations were focused into
                     an
                     informal committee led by the Deputy Provost for Humanities and Initiatives,
                     resulting in, among other things, a comprehensive survey of faculty and graduate
                     students who self-identified as having DH interests. This report [<a class="ref" href="#chiodo2013">Chiodo 2013</a>] was essential in cataloging and characterizing the ways
                     that scholars on campus wished to combine humanistic inquiry with new digital
                     techniques, and it laid the groundwork for coordinated effort to further Yale’s
                     support for scholarship in this area. In 2015, Yale University Library received
                     support from The Goizueta Foundation to inaugurate a comprehensive initiative in
                     science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education by
                     launching the DHLab [<a class="ref" href="#patrick2014">Patrick 2014</a>]. Recognizing the Franke Family
                     Reading Room as a natural home for the new initiative, the Library began a multi-year
                     design process with student, faculty, and staff stakeholders to identify campus needs
                     and aspirations for DH support, which would inform the design of the space.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Whereas the sciences have long-established models for constructing lab spaces
                     outfitted to their research needs, the humanities have operated more in a tradition
                     of individual work. DH labs create opportunities for collaborative work that brings
                     together different sets of expertise and equipment to pursue humanistic inquiries
                     at
                     varying scales. The challenge in designing such a space revolves, in part, around
                     striking the right balance between different needs and possibilities. For example,
                     should the room be a fully open workspace, or should it provide areas explicitly
                     marked out for different functions? Which is more likely to spur activity: a space
                     of
                     unstructured possibility, or one that actively suggests particular modes of
                     engagement? Is a computer with a large monitor actively displaying an interactive
                     visualization more, or less welcoming, than an open table? In describing Penn
                     Libraries’ integration of DH, Anu Vedantham and Dot Porter underscore that “[s]paces designed to encourage brainstorming and discussion need to
                     look, feel, and function differently from those designed to support deep reading,
                     note taking, writing, or presentation practice”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#vedantham2015">Vedantham and Porter 2015</a>]. Connected with the desired activity of the space,
                     however, is the overhead required to maintain it, from both a staffing and budgetary
                     consideration. What happens when the computer needs replacement – much sooner than
                     the table? Who will produce and update the content displaying on the digital screens?

                     experimentation and initial engagement with digital forms of scholarship. The
                     question seems to be, then, what percentage of the room should equipment (computers,

                     not identify as digital humanists was to ensure that the design team did not

                     already availed themselves of DH support services on campus. Fried Foster describes

                     desktop machines were lower on the list of must-have equipment: most students,
                     faculty, and staff preferred working from their own laptops, but they acknowledged
                     that a few high-end desktop computers in the DHLab would be helpful for accessing

                     computation, and its present-day, expanded commitment to providing support for DH
                     research and teaching.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p19">Serving as a focal point for — and for many, an introduction to — DH on campus, it
                        is especially important for labs to be inviting, inclusive spaces, welcoming to
                        long-standing DH practitioners, the curious but unsure, and everyone in between.
                        In conceptualizing the layout of the space (Figure 4), the team advocated for
                        modular designs that would support multiple kinds of DH engagements. DH is a
                        robust, rapidly developing area of research and teaching, and the goal was to
                        design a space that could respond to new needs and forms of collaboration that
                        might surface. Nearly half of the DHLab would thus consist of an open workspace
                        occupied only by wheeled tables and chairs. The tables, which can be linked
                        together at the ends, can be easily reconfigured into pod formations, long rows,
                        or U-shapes to support workshops, presentations, working groups, collaborations,
                        and individuals working on laptops or reading books. Walls would feature
                        alternating panels that incorporated both print book collections and digital
                        visualization monitors.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p20">One service point with a track record of inspiring initial conversations was the
                        print book collection that had lined the shelves of the temporary space. The team
                        wanted to expand and highlight this collection in the new, larger room — gesturing
                        towards the original function of the space. With new support from central
                        Collection Development funds, the books became a consistently growing resource —
                        as well as a dramatic visual characteristic of the space. The collection was
                        ingested into the central Yale Library catalog thanks to the work of the Technical
                        Services team, who adjusted their workflow to accommodate call letter labels that
                        would not obscure cover designs and who added custom bookplates designed by the
                        User Experience specialist in the DHLab. In the higher-profile location along the
                        walls of the renovated room, the books encourage patrons to take up theoretical
                        debates in the field, develop specific coding skills for their research, or read
                        up on DH applications within specific disciplines.

                        DHLab is most equipped to support (text, image, network, and spatial analysis), in
                        addition to highlighting several books on data visualization, web development, and
                        the DH field at large. The goal for the collection is for it to be a resource to
                        which scholars can turn for instruction and inspiration. With the increasing
                        uptake in e-resources and library services where books can be pulled from the
                        shelves for patrons, there is less browsing — and by extension, fewer
                        unanticipated connections being made — in the stacks. To stimulate engagement with
                        the DHLab’s print collection, the architects designed slanted shelves that could
                        display books covers facing out, as the DHLab team learned from the temporary
                        space that researchers coming to the lab for a table to work at might also find
                        themselves drawn toward a book on telling stories with data visualizations.

                        barriers. While the sound carryover can be distracting for work that requires
                        intense concentration, it also opens up the possibility for serendipitous
                        connections. Organic collaborations, as the DHLab witnessed in the temporary
                        space, often form in such communal spaces, where a group working on a given
                        project realizes they had something to offer a group working on a different effort
                        and vice versa because of overheard conversations. In this way, the team hopes
                        that the opportunity for collaborations encouraged by the open nature of the room
                        outweigh any disadvantage from sound travel.

                        fraction of DH activity occurs as an individual activity. This consideration
                        emerged during the information-gathering phase, with participants requesting a
                        space where they might, as Fried Foster described it, work “alone together”
                        [<a class="ref" href="#foster2016">Foster 2016</a>, 17]. Individuals working in the space want to be
                        able to focus on their own projects at the same time that they want to be a part
                        of the energy growing around DH on campus. The team wanted to ensure that scholars
                        working on their own could find places in the room that supported their needs for
                        privacy and concentration. The flexible table arrangement in the front portion of
                        the room and the relaxed but more isolated furniture in the back enables
                        researchers to reconfigure the space and find a seating option that works for
                        them.

                        advantages as well as disadvantages that must be taken into account when
                        determining the layout and equipment for a DH lab. To begin with the
                        disadvantages, participants are required to bring a computer with them, and not
                        everyone has access to a personal laptop. Many libraries have laptop checkouts
                        available to students, faculty, and staff; however, they do not usually grant
                        administrative access, meaning participants would be unable to download any
                        software. Tablets can also be insufficient substitutes for laptops when it comes
                        to certain software. Even for the participants who can bring laptops over which
                        they have administrative control, other challenges emerge. Personal laptops can be
                        slow, low on memory, limited in storage space, and/or suffer from low battery
                        capacity, which can pose a problem depending on where and how many outlets are in
                        the space.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p27">Conversely, these latter disadvantages point to some of the benefits of
                        participants working from their own machines. Since installations can be quirky
                        and setting up software environments daunting and confusing, it can be helpful for
                        participants to walk through the process with an instructor. If they’re able to
                        get everything up and running during the workshop, they can then leave it and
                        continue practicing without having to learn first how to install everything from
                        scratch by themselves. This is why Software Carpentry, of which Yale Library is

                        object: in most cases, the scanned images are discarded as soon as the textual
                        extraction process is complete, leaving only a transformed digital text.

                        each reel. The DHLab, in conjunction with other library departments, installed a
                        microfilm scanner capable of extracting documents from microfilm reels more
                        efficiently. The resulting images, segmented by a machine vision algorithm, can
                        then processed through OCR software installed on the DHLab’s machines to create a

                     <div class="ptext" id="p33">One of the aesthetic challenges that emerged during the information-gathering
                        phase was how to incorporate old furnishings with new technologies. The Yale
                        researchers who participated in our process indicated a preference for modern
                        equipment alongside a desire to retain a feel for the a “library setting.”
                        The design team knew that preserving the character of the room would thus be
                        essential. The architects did make two changes to bookcases: re-orienting the
                        shelves to display book covers facing outwards, and installing digital screens
                        carefully-matched to the scale and structure of the bookcases, flush with the wall
                        envelope. The result was an updated look for the room without changing the
                        fundamental geometry or finishes.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p34">The orientation of the room along a long axis is reinforced by the way that
                        patrons enter at one end: the foyer has a much lower ceiling that creates a sense
                        of compression. Proceeding into the room itself draws the eyes forward to large
                        windows on the far wall. Subdividing the space with any materials or objects that
                        blocked this axial view would fundamentally change the room and the experience of
                        entering it. A key design priority was thus to preserve as much of the view
                        corridor throughout the room as possible. This dictated the dimensions and
                        placement of the Special Projects Cube, which is located offset from the center of
                        the space but directly in the line of view of a patron entering the room (Figure
                        3). The surfaces of the cube are made of glass, which allows the transmission of
                        light and motion from all directions. In addition, the intervention of a
                        semi-transparent object in the middle of the room heightens the visual drama of
                        the space, as viewers have both a filtered view of the length of the room, and the
                        people working in the cube.

                        open environment right beside computer workstations meant we experienced auditory
                        interference from overheard conversations, along with a constant sense of “being
                        on call” for impromptu tech support. On the one hand, this arrangement
                        provided valuable insights into the projects people were taking on and the
                        technical or methodological difficulties they were encountering. On the other
                        hand, it meant that professional staff might be interrupted at any moment and
                        pulled away from other support efforts that required sustained concentration.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">For the renovation, the DHLab staff wanted to retain awareness of the kinds of
                        work clients were doing in the space, along with being visible ourselves so that
                        we could provide support, but we (as well as the faculty and students Fried Foster
                        interviewed) also recognized the need to work quietly without interruption at
                        times. The final design result was to locate the staff offices along the periphery
                        of the main space, with a glass wall on the one side that faces the space, thereby
                        enabling staff to see out and researchers to see in. An open door signifies staff
                        are available for questions, while a closed door asks that you return later. The
                        signs on all offices display the schedule for the DHLab’s open office hours, a
                        regular time during which staff are reliably available for drop-in consultations
                        (researchers who cannot meet during office hours can schedule consultations for
                        other times).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p37">Implementing this design involved creating several openings in a structural wall
                        to transform what was the former bookstack annex into a space for human
                        specialists. DHLab staff worked alongside architects to optimize the offices for
                        DH workflows. For instance, the DHLab’s User Experience Designer and Developer
                        share an inner sliding door they can push back so that they can, on occasion, turn
                        their two offices into one, allowing them to more easily converse during
                        production sprints. The repurposing of the annex created designated, visible
                        spaces for expertise and support that also provided DHLab staff with mechanisms
                        for signaling availability.

                        is therefore also adjacent to the main open lab space, provides DHLab staff and
                        collaborators with a sound-controlled location for presentations, meetings, and
                        smaller classes. Display screens are affixed to each of the shorter walls in the
                        room to facilitate presentations. On one of the longer walls, there is a magnetic,
                        glass whiteboard to help with sketching ideas and designs, while the opposite wall
                        acknowledges Yale’s early interest in humanities computing. A poster of Father
                        Roberto Busa working on a teletype at Yale in 1956 is affixed to one end of the
                        wall, while a poster of the cover page to the proceedings of the “Computers for the Humanities?” conference held at Yale in
                        1965 is at the other end. Between the posters are windows that look out into one
                        of the Library’s hallways. Given the DHLab’s investment in making DH work visible,
                        these windows remain uncovered so that people passing through the Library can have
                        a glimpse into what the DHLab is working on.

                        they are often not the only places where digital work occurs. Studying the larger
                        ecosystem of where such work takes place can help to identify opportunities for
                        cross-unit collaborations, whether that take the form of shared expertise or
                        equipment. At Yale, two centers that predate the DHLab — the Center for
                        Engineering Innovation and Design (CEID) and the Center for Collaborative Arts and
                        Media (CCAM) — have 3D printers available for researchers to use, along with
                        training sessions to help people get started. When it was time to make a decision
                        about what to include in the DHLab, the team decided that the strength of other
                        campus units in 3D printing meant that we could refer clients to those existing
                        service points (and their accompanying expert staff). This freed up space in the
                        Special Projects Cube for other kinds of equipment less readily accessed by
                        humanists on campus.

                        conversations, the DHLab has designated four touchdown spaces where Library staff
                        can meet with researchers or demonstrate projects of interest. Located in the four
                        corners of the main space, the touchdown desks signal specialized support. For
                        instance, the Geographic Information Specialist (GIS) Librarian, whose office is
                        located in CSSSI, holds weekly office hours in the DHLab. She meets with
                        researchers at the corner desk that is located next to the GIS books in the space
                        so that she may easily refer to texts in the collection that might be helpful
                        resources. Even when she is not physically present in the DHLab, researchers may
                        still find her contact information on the desk. Along with serving as touchdown
                        spaces for library and museum professionals on campus, the corner desks also
                        provide a workstation for visiting scholars who might be on campus to give a talk

                     Humanities Laboratory involved new ways of thinking about location, materiality,
                     transparency, security, collaboration, and adjacency. The challenge of adaptive reuse
                     of a historic (and historicizing) space is undoubtedly different from the process
                     of
                     renovating a newer, less decorative facility — or constructing a completely new room.
                     The diverse team that came together to accomplish this — student and faculty
                     participants, library and IT professionals, external architects, and university
                     facilities specialists — were well aware of the significance of this room to Sterling
                     Memorial Library’s design and history, as well as the scholarly practice that is
                     emerging around DH on campus. The various interventions in structure, materials,
                     function, and organization of the room to transform it into the Franke Family Digital
                     Humanities Laboratory involved both empirical evidence, discussions with campus
                     stakeholders, and educated guesses about what DH scholarship might evolve towards
                     in
                     an era when interdisciplinarity is increasingly inflected by the algorithm and the
                     dataset. Yale’s deep commitment to the Humanities, and its Library’s scholarly
                     support for the same, has always been expressed in world-class physical holdings and
                     subject specialist expertise. The design of the Franke Family Digital Humanities
                     Laboratory is an effort to reflect that same commitment, and that same support, in
                     a
                     new lab embedded within a historic room.
