                <p>This essay responds to two questions at the heart of the Invisible Labor in the
                    Digital Humanities 2016 symposium at Florida State University: (1) what is at
                    stake in making unseen work visible, and (2) how can DH projects equally
                    distribute and value the labor involved in their construction? For us, the
                    answer to these questions lies in privileging the pedagogical affordances of
                    data construction by crafting a workflow that included undergraduates as
                    intellectual partners, and using DH methods to visualize and make public this
                    collaborative labor. By drawing on our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes
                    federal New Deal documentary projects including photography and life histories,
                    we highlight three strategies for making labor visible in the digital
                    humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as a tool for teaching
                    undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them experience with
                    conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this way, we
                    explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we argue
                    that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects visible.
                    We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside the
                    traditional <title rend="quotes">About</title> page to make visible all
                    participants in the project. Third, we turn to an open discussion of the
                    challenges faced in the politics of attribution when working with university,
                    governmental and private historical organizations, including domain names and
                    the use of organizational logos.</p>

        <body>
            <p>In an effort to justify new methods of social documentation, W.T. Couch (1939)
                declared, <quote rend="inline">The people, all the people, must be known, they must
                    be heard. Somehow they must be given representation, somehow they must be given
                    a voice and allowed to speak, in their essential character</quote>
                <ptr target="#couch1939" loc="x–xi"/>. His zeal for a new method of documenting
                social history reflected his belief in a more democratic vision of American
                expression, which also starkly contrasted with growing fascism in Europe during the
                1930s. In order to give <quote rend="inline">the people their voice,</quote> he
                helped to craft the Southern Life Histories Project, which charged Federal Writers’
                Project (FWP) workers with interviewing and documenting the lives of everyday people
                in the American South. The collection is composed of nearly 1200 life histories that
                are entertaining, insightful, heartbreaking, and, on the whole, say as much, if not
                more about the writers than the interviewees. Because of the outbreak of WWII and
                political turmoil within the program, there is not much remaining evidence relating
                to the interviewees, the writers, the editors, or how precisely these life histories
                were written. Instead what remains are the stories themselves, while the labor
                behind them is obscured even rendered invisible.</p>
            <p>As many Digital Humanities (DH) scholars and workers know, this situation of having a
                product with little to no knowledge of the labor behind its construction is rather
                common. We create DH projects for particular audiences, but the decisions and labor
                behind their construction remain hidden as they are not the end goal of the
                projects. At the November 2016 Symposium on Invisible Labor in the Digital
                Humanities at Florida State University, Mark Algee-Hewitt referred to this issue as
                one of the great paradoxes of DH. In order to better understand this great paradox,
                the symposium centered on three key themes: (1) divergent expectations, (2) unequal
                labor, and (3) invisible work. Within each of these themes was a discussion of the
                core tension in collaborative DH projects about how to distribute and value labor,
                especially when decisions about the direction of research and allocation of funding
                are not evenly dispersed, which is often the case in the hierarchical system of the
                academy.</p>
            <p>In discussing these broader themes, the topic of student labor emerged, which by and
                large is an area that DH has yet to properly take on, especially undergraduate
                student labor. As Spencer D.C. Keralis explains in his poignant chapter on labor in
                    <title rend="italic">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and
                    Experiments</title>, <quote rend="inline">if there is a spectre haunting digital
                    pedagogy, it is the spectre of labor</quote>
                <ptr target="#keralis2016" loc="4"/>. This spectre results from the fact that
                students are often given what is thought of as the most mundane work, such as
                scanning material and data entry. Labor that is <quote rend="inline">rendered
                    invisible, alienable, and is easily effaced and taken for granted</quote> when
                looking at the final product. While such a labor structure is almost always
                uniformly bemoaned as unfortunate and unfair, few actually take the time and effort
                to work to disrupt it in their own DH work. In order to address this spectre of
                labor, we ask what would it mean to turn this seemingly mundane or taken-for-granted
                work into an opportunity to teach and re-envision undergraduate DH pedagogy? How can
                we use DH methods themselves as the means to represent such labor? This essay
                answers these questions by outlining our efforts to address labor inequities through
                our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes federal New Deal documentary projects
                including photography and life histories. For us, the answer to these questions lied
                in privileging the pedagogical affordances of data construction by crafting a
                workflow that included undergraduates as intellectual partners, and using DH methods
                to visualize and make public this collaborative labor.</p>
            <p>We will begin with an overview of Photogrammar and the constellation of labor that
                the project has required, and then highlight two strategies for valuing labor and
                making labor visible in the digital humanities. First, we discuss how this project
                served as tool for teaching undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them
                experience with conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this
                way, we explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we
                argue that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects
                visible. We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside
                the traditional <q>About</q> page to make visible all participants in the
                    project.<note>These visualizations of labor will be a part of a new version of
                    Photogrammar that will be released in 2020 at photogrammar.org.</note> We end by
                discussing politics of attribution when working with university, governmental, and
                private historical organizations, including domain names and use of organizational
                logos.</p>

                <head>Context: Photogrammar, Southern Life Histories Project, and Data
                    Construction</head>
                <p>In 2010, Photogrammar began as a collaboration between Lauren Tilton and Taylor
                    Arnold. Tilton was interested in the representational politics of the Farm
                    Security Administration-Office of War (FSA-OWI) Information, which employed
                    among the most influential documentary photographers of the century such as
                    Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Gordon Parks. They produced iconic photographs
                    of the Great Depression that were often in support of the New Deal state and,
                    with the onset of World War II, turned their gaze toward constructing an image
                    of an affluent and strong nation ready for war <ptr target="#stange1986"/>
                    <ptr target="#trachtenberg1988"/>. Yet, the collection was difficult to navigate
                    through the Library of Congress website. Tilton reached out to Arnold, a
                    statistician, and they worked together to scrape and map the 170,000 photographs
                    from the collection. They developed a prototype, which then received an NEH
                    Office of Digital Humanities grant.</p>
                <p>With the grant, the collaboration extended to include Laura Wexler, who was the
                    grant’s Primary Investigator; Ken Panko and Trip Kirkpatrick, who served as
                    Project Managers; Stacey Maples, who served as the Map Expert; and Peter
                    Leonard, who served as an Implementation Coordinator. Tilton and Arnold were
                    named Co-Directors. Over the next several years, they built the web-based
                    platform for organizing, searching, and visualizing the 170,000 photographs from
                    the FSA-OWI. In 2015, Courtney Rivard from the University of North Carolina,
                    Chapel Hill joined the Photogrammar team with the idea of adding aspects of the
                    Federal Writers' Project as a map layer. Then in 2016, Photogrammar received an
                    ACLS Digital Extension Grant to place the FSA-OWI photographs in the larger
                    federal effort to document America during the Great Depression. The grant
                    included funding to build out several components including the addition of the
                    Federal Writers’ Project’s Southern Life Histories Project from the University
                    of North Carolina, Chapel Hill’s Southern Historical Collection.</p>
                <p>The Southern Life History Project (SLHP) was part of the larger Federal Writers’
                    Project created under the New Deal as a way to put unemployed writers to work.
                    In many ways, the SLHP marked a major shift in forms of documentary expression
                    as its goal was to capture the life stories of everyday Americans from their own
                    perspectives. W.T. Couch saw these life histories as way to collect accurate and
                    authentic accounts of the hardships of life during the Depression with special
                    attention to marginalized voices such as African Americans, women, and working
                    class individuals. For him, the South faced many problems that needed to be
                    solved, but sociological data that focused on data and numbers obscured the
                    realities of life and failed to move a general public to enact necessary
                    changes. Instead he thought that real stories by real people constituted the
                    type of evidence that had the power to create change. However, like other forms
                    of documentation that purported authenticity, the life histories tell readers as
                    much about their creators, in this case the federal writers, as they do the
                    interviewees. Moreover, the writers’ use of representational practices often
                    demonstrate how racism, sexism, and inequality were perpetuated in stories of
                    the quotidian. Because of their complicated composition, they serve as an
                    important companion to the FSA-OWI photographs that were taken during that same
                    time period. Both projects sought to document the American experience and
                    negotiate the desires and needs of those who documented, those who were
                    documented, and the funding agencies. Our goal was to bring together these life
                    histories and the FSA-OWI photographs in the Photogrammar platform to allow
                    users to explore the documentary work of the Great Depression era, and the
                    reason many scholars have labeled it the <quote rend="inline">documentary
                        decade</quote>
                    <ptr target="#stott1973"/>
                    <ptr target="#finnegan2003"/>.</p>
                <p>When making the first version of Photogrammar, the project greatly benefited from
                    decades of work by the Library of Congress to digitize the photos and to create
                    the extensive metadata that accompanied them. This was not the case with the
                    life histories. Like many other projects involving archival documents, the life
                    histories layer necessitated creating, cataloguing, and organizing metadata from
                    the archival material, together with marking up and cleaning the individual
                    documents before the material was ready to be integrated into the Photogrammar
                    platform. In this case, the metadata centered around the names, races, and
                    genders of both the writers and interviewees for each life history so as to
                    optimize search functionality within the collection as well as to generate
                    visualizations that analyzed the collection in new ways. While this may seem a
                    straightforward process, it was quite murky as the metadata had to be
                    extrapolated from stories created through a writer’s interpretation of an
                    interviewee’s life often written as a conversation that did not unfold in a
                    linear progression.</p>
                <p>This data construction phase of the project is often the backbone of DH projects,
                    especially those that use visualization and text analysis. While this process is
                    crucially important, it is frequently the part of the project that receives the
                    least attention and attribution. Such inattention is likely because data is
                    often understood as that which is given, or as already existing <ptr
                        target="#rosenberg2013"/>. One frequently hears a DH scholar talk about
                        <soCalled>their corpus</soCalled> of books, photographs, or archival
                    material. Yet, making these sources computationally tractable is a significant
                    undertaking. Turning a PDF of a piece of writing into clean, plain text can take
                    expensive software and people who manually correct errors. Organizing the
                    sources online or for analysis often involves creating a tabular database; a
                    process that requires creating metadata. Bringing attention to the
                    constructedness of the process is one of the reasons Johanna Drucker argued for
                    using capta, that which is captured, rather than the term data <ptr
                        target="#drucker2011"/>. In reality, making a corpus requires countless
                    decisions over what actually counts as data and how to create such data.
                    Therefore, by referencing <q>the corpus</q> both the interpretative decisions in
                    data creation and the labor that makes data available (particularly those who
                    collect, store, and preserve these sources) are obscured through the singularity
                    of the term. Moreover, data construction is just one component of the
                    complicated labor network of digital projects. Responding to the work of
                    scholars such as Amy Earhart, Miriam Posner, and Roopika Risam, Spencer Keralis
                    explains: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block">The labor network necessary to produce digital projects

                    we used the data construction phase as a pedagogical opportunity to teach
                    students about the rhetorical nature of data. We aimed to animate the
                    undergraduate classroom by including students in the decision process for one
                    way of valuing labor is identifying opportunities and outcomes that also benefit
                    the person laboring. We accomplished this by building Rivard’s new course-based
                    undergraduate research experience (CURE) classes into the data construction
                    phase of the project.</p>

                <head>Building Pedagogy into Project Development</head>
                <p>Many DH practitioners have noted the lack of opportunities available to
                    undergraduate students to gain DH skills and experience unless they are able to
                    join a research project run by a DH scholar in their university <ptr
                        target="#anderson2016"/>. Moreover, the students who become part of such
                    projects are often thrown into the projects and told to <quote rend="inline"
                        >figure it out</quote> making for a challenging process of skills
                    acquisition. This problem of giving undergraduates genuine research
                    opportunities while at the same time teaching them necessary methods and
                    research skills is one faced by most areas of the university. To address this
                    issue, many universities have begun initiatives to incorporate genuine or
                        <q>real</q> research projects into the classroom often in the form of CURE
                    courses (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience) <ptr
                        target="#ishiyama2002"/>
                    <ptr target="#lopatto2010"/>. While such courses are most common in STEM fields,
                    we aimed to merge this approach with the project development of the life history
                    layer of Photogrammar. In other words, rather than viewing data construction as
                    a monotonous task that needed to be quickly accomplished, we used it to
                    accomplish pedagogical goals that focused on undergraduate research and skill
                    acquisition, thereby re-envisioning this labor as pedagogical in nature by
                    shifting our understanding of the goal of data construction.</p>
                <p>This approach of building pedagogy into DH project development was aided in large
                    part by the organizational structure of the Southern Life History Collection
                    (SLHC) and pedagogical resources made available by UNC, two factors that must be
                    in place to enact this type of project development. The SLHC is located at the
                    Southern Historical Collection on UNC’s campus, which meant that students had
                    easy access to the original archival material. Additionally, though written in
                    the 1930s, the writers of the life histories already understood the importance
                    of collecting data to organize its collection because at the beginning of almost
                    every life history is a listing of extremely helpful metadata including
                    information relating to the writer and the interviewee (see Figure 1). This
                    easily discernible metadata that introduced a reader into the life history
                    provided the beginning of metadata schema that could be used to organize the
                    data that would be incorporated into Photogrammar. It would have been possible
                    to simply use this schema to generate the data needed for the project ourselves;
                    something that we could have done rather quickly. Instead, we decided to slow
                    the data construction process down in order to turn it into a pedagogical
                    opportunity to include undergraduates in a course-based setting. The importance
                    of engaging students in the data construction process has been well-documented
                    in the literature on statistical education, an idea that should be extended into
                    DH pedagogy <ptr target="#hydorn2018"/>.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the decision to incorporate undergraduate pedagogical goals into
                    the data construction process of the project was influenced by an initiative at
                    UNC to promote CURE courses across campuses, which included providing faculty
                    with resources on how to incorporate authentic research experiences within the
                    structure of a class. At the same time, Rivard was collaborating with a faculty
                    working group at UNC focused on bringing data studies into humanities
                        curricula.<note>Additionally, Courtney Rivard is indebted to the leadership
                        of Kelly Hogan and John Bruno who helped to create the CURE program at UNC.
                        Additionally, special thanks is extended to the collaborative work produced
                        by the working group on data in the humanities — Melanie Feinberg, Jan
                        Hannig, Tessa Joseph-Nicholas, Ryan Shaw, Dan Anderson, and Malina
                        Chavez.</note> Therefore, UNC offered concrete resources and incentives to
                    promote course-based undergraduate research that fostered the development of DH
                    skills. Such resources and incentives allowed us the opportunity to take
                    pedagogical risks. <figure>

                <p>Seizing these opportunities, we brought students into the project as
                    collaborators in a new upper division, undergraduate course at UNC taught by
                    Rivard on digital rhetoric in Spring 2016 and again in 2017.<note>The course was
                        part of new minor (Composition, Rhetoric, and Digital Literacy) and
                        attracted many students from that growing field, but it also brought
                        together students from Computer Science as well as other students looking to
                        fulfill a writing intensive requirement. The course did not have any
                        requirements or prerequisites, which meant that students came in with a wide
                        range of abilities.</note> Students were positioned as leaders of the North
                    Carolina section of the Life Histories Collection, which constituted
                    approximately 600 life histories. As will be explained in greater detail below,
                    students were charged with creating a metadata schema for the inclusion of these
                    life histories in Photogrammar, and then to use this data as the basis of a
                    research project that they could publish in an undergraduate research journal.
                    By bringing students into the Photogrammar project, Rivard aimed to demonstrate
                    to students the ways in which data construction was a rhetorical act as
                    students, themselves, were in charge of the decisions behind the data.</p>
                <p>Such an approach of learning by doing is at the heart of recent advances in the
                    field of digital rhetoric. Douglas Eyman defines digital rhetoric <quote
                        rend="inline">as the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or
                        heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances</quote> that
                    must provide methods for both evaluation and making <ptr target="#eyman2015"
                        loc="44"/>. To teach students the methods of evaluation and making embedded
                    with Eyman’s conception of digital rhetoric, a number of scholars in Composition
                    and Rhetoric have demonstrated the need to more specifically focus on
                    information literacies and data literacies <ptr target="#purdy2011"/>
                    <ptr target="#sweeney2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#vetter2014"/>. To this end, Nathan Johnson argues for centering
                    information infrastructure within rhetorical studies, explaining <quote
                        rend="inline">infrastructure provides the invisible scaffolding for
                        discovery, dissemination, access to information,</quote> and as such has
                    real consequences for <quote rend="inline">public communication, knowledge, and
                        political life</quote>
                    <ptr target="#johnson2012" loc="1"/>. Therefore, teaching students not only how
                    to navigate, but also to construct information infrastructures is key to
                    developing information and digital literacies.</p>
                <p>These are, of course, the same goals that shape much of DH pedagogy as Alexander
                    Reid explains. He writes, <quote rend="inline">the promise of the digital
                        humanities lies in its potential to address the political, ethical, and
                        rhetorical challenges of living in a digital age</quote>
                    <ptr target="#reid2015" loc="16"/>. Therefore, many in DH promote curriculum
                    that allows for <quote rend="inline">tinkering</quote>
                    <ptr target="#sayers2012"/> and as Burdick, et. al. explain <quote rend="inline"
                        >hands-on, experiential, and project-based learning through doing</quote>
                    <ptr target="#burdick2016"/>. However, this approach has often led to what
                    Brandon Locke calls <quote rend="inline">tool based literacy</quote> in which
                    students develop <quote rend="inline"><q>tech skills</q>...through narrow
                        technology that limits potential outcomes and often monetizes user-created
                        content</quote>
                    <ptr target="#locke2017"/>. Such an approach can be helpful as it allows for

                    <ptr target="#anderson2008"/> tinkering, but it does not train students in, as
                    Locke states, the <quote rend="inline">critical evaluation of digital media and
                        the means to produce them</quote>
                    <ptr target="#locke2017"/>.</p>
                <p>We argue that cataloguing, indexing, and curating archival materials offer one
                    avenue for teaching students data and information literacies while avoiding a
                    tool-based approach.<note>Rivard has made this argument in relation to teaching
                        first year writing, see <title rend="quotes">Turning Archives into Data:
                            Archival Rhetorics and Digital Literacy in the Composition
                            Classroom.</title> College Composition and Communication. (June,
                        2019).</note> This approach simultaneously demonstrates the consequences
                    that information infrastructure has on shaping knowledge about the past. As
                    Graban, et. al explain, <quote rend="inline">the means of archival organization
                        are rhetorical acts deploying arguments about relations, power dynamics, and
                        gate-keeping methodologies and should be treated as such</quote>
                    <ptr target="#graban2015" loc="237"/>. Therefore, inviting students to come into
                    a project in which they were responsible for creating the system used to
                    describe archival materials put them in the driver's seat of this powerful act
                    of shaping the information infrastructure of our DH project. Specifically we
                    charged students with: (1) creating a metadata schema for the inclusion of the
                    life histories as layer for Photogrammar, (2) generating metadata for ten life
                    histories, (3) marking up three life histories with XML, (4) giving a Skype
                    presentation to Tilton outlining their rationale for the metadata and mark-up
                    schema, and (5) creating data visualizations from the metadata to construct an
                    original argument that they then were encouraged to publish in <title
                        rend="italic">People, Ideas, and Things</title>, an undergraduate research
                    journal at UNC.</p>
                <p>Knowing that they had the power to shape the infrastructure of the life history
                    layer helped motivate students to think critically about their decisions,
                    especially those involving their metadata schema and tagging decisions. For
                    example, students deeply struggled over how to tag gender and racial categories.
                    There are many instances in the life histories in which the writers named women
                    with their husbands’ names as was common at the time as seen in the story of
                    Mrs. Jake Bowen in Figure 2. Students had to decide whether to tag her with her
                    husband’s first name, i.e. Jake, or read the story for context clues for her
                    first name, Virginia. Therefore, they grappled with whether or not to<figure>

                    </figure> replicate the documentation system of the federal writers to maintain
                    authenticity or employ more inclusive practices in line with contemporary
                    standards. These are the same issues faced by archivists today, so we looked to
                    articles such as Duarte and Belarde-Lewis’ excellent piece, <title rend="quotes"
                        >Imagining: Creating Spaces for Indigenous Ontologies</title> to learn about
                    ideas such as co-locating and composing for audiences represented in the
                    collections rather than colonialist naming practices <ptr target="#duarte2015"
                    />. This led students to also decide to co-locate racial categories. The federal
                    writers used racial categories common to 1930s, which the students found
                    unacceptable and impractical for a contemporary user, so they chose to use
                    multiple terms for each racial category. One student, Julie Hayes, explained
                    this point in her final paper, which was published in UNC’s <title rend="italic"
                        >People, Ideas, and Things</title> journal. She stated, <quote rend="inline"
                        >this procedure [of data construction] involved much rhetorical
                        decision-making; for instance, outdated racial terms were replaced with more
                        contemporary and searchable words, thus reflecting the shifts in social
                        norms in regard to race and the resultant changes in language</quote>
                    <ptr target="#hayes2017"/>. Therefore, by thinking through the consequences of
                    their tagging systems, students understood their work as knowledge
                    production.</p>
                <p>In order to encourage students to think about how to make their decisions
                    transparent by documenting them, they included them in their XML headers with
                    interpretation tags within the project description (see figure 3). After tagging
                    their life histories and marking them up, students used Tableau to visualize
                    their data. Here they looked for patterns in the archive by analyzing it from a
                    distance <ptr target="#underwood2017"/>, an approach that had never been used to
                    analyze this collection. Knowing that they were looking at the collection in new
                    ways because of the data that they constructed gave them a profound sense of
                    accomplishment, and positioned them as knowledgeable researchers in their own
                    right. Moreover, their decisions fundamentally shaped the infrastructure of the
                    Photogrammar project. Therefore, students learned digital skills such as data
                    visualization, mark-up, and database management while developing critical
                    digital literacies that saw data construction as knowledge making. Though we
                    could have certainly come up with a metadata schema for the life histories more
                    quickly in a few weeks rather than over the span of a year, the pedagogical
                    affordances of this approach were an important end in themselves, and gave
                    students the opportunity to work on DH project that is legible and transferable
                    to their future endeavors. In order to focus on transfer, Rivard spent the last
                    week of the course helping students translate their classwork into points on
                    their resume as well as addressing how to discuss the project in an interview.
                    As a result of this focus on transfer, a number of students have used the
                    project to secure internships and summer research opportunities.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Together with these course-based experiences, many students at UNC and the
                    University of Richmond were eager to participate in the Photogrammar project,
                    which led us to hire Research Assistants (RA). We tried to find a balance
                    between the needs of the project and the kinds of experiences the RAs sought by
                    working with each RA to identify the type of work that would help them
                    accomplish their scholarly and professional goals. A number of students who were
                    in Rivard’s classes — Carla Aviles, Karissa Barrera, Kayley Bryson, Sarah Moody,
                    Sara Siemens, Elizabeth Bonesteel, Grace Hildebrand, Scott Robinson, and Lacie
                    Morrison — asked to continue to work on the project to gain experience that they
                    could put on their resumes. Grant Glass, a UNC English graduate student, also
                    helped with some text encoding to explore different theoretical methods that he
                    was planning to use in his dissertation. At the University of Richmond, three
                    students — Bal Artist, Emeline Blevins, and Emily Maanum — worked with Tilton
                    and Arnold at the University of Richmond. They expressed interest in being a
                    part of DH research beyond the Introduction to Digital Humanities course that
                    they took with Tilton. Blevins, for example, was interested in developing DH
                    skills with an eye toward jobs in museums and graduate studies. They worked
                    alongside the students at UNC to add metadata to the life histories. Because
                    they did not receive course credit, Richmond students collected hourly wages
                    according to university compensation rules. This growing group working on
                    Photogrammar required us to reevaluate how to give them credit and make their
                    important labor visible.</p>

                <head>Visualizing Project Labor</head>
                <p>With an expanding set of collaborators, we wanted to highlight that certain
                    people contributed in different ways. Valuing labor means recognizing the
                    various ways people contributed, particularly those who put significant work
                    into a project. In order to make visible labor, we supplemented traditional
                    approaches of attribution with DH visualization methods. This resulted in our
                    utilization of three different forms of acknowledging labor: (1) a page on the
                    site listing and describing textually the Photogrammar team, (2) a timeline
                    capturing the length of time by contributor by component on the project, and (3)
                    a network visualization. While each form has it benefits and drawbacks, we
                    believe that taken together they better reveal the kinds and degrees of labor
                    necessary to build Photogrammar.</p>
                <p>The most common form of acknowledging labor is the <title rend="italic"
                        >About</title> or <title rend="italic">Team</title> page. It often features
                    a list of participants and their roles starting with the PI or Director followed
                    by other team members. It is linear and hierarchical. In the case of
                    Photogrammar, a Team page is available as a subsection of the About page. It
                    lists the people involved and their role. Such a page is particularly well
                    suited for explaining the current state of the project. When one lands on such a
                    page, they expect to see who, at that moment, is the current team and their
                    role. If one has a comment or question, they know who to contact.</p>
                <p>Yet, there are drawbacks. The long list of students involved does offer a form of
                    credit, but it reads as a list that risks obscuring the amount of work
                    contributed. Those who are no longer involved in the project are often last,
                    regardless of the amount of work or time they spent on the project. Another
                    challenge is when roles shift. For example, Arnold and Tilton started
                    Photogrammar but could not serve as Primary Investigators on the grants since
                    they were graduate students, and later they were no longer affiliated with Yale
                    University. As a result, the Team page does not capture the four months Arnold
                    and Tilton spent building a prototype of Photogrammar or writing the NEH grant
                    before extending the project to include the larger team. It also does not make
                    clear when Project Management shifted from Ken Panko to Trip Kirkpatrick.
                    Certain students also moved from working within the classroom to Research
                    Assistants.</p>
                <p>In order address these issues to more fully represent the labor in the project,
                    we sought strategies for how to balance acknowledging labor while giving
                    participants control over how their labor is documented. We heeded the advice
                    outlined in <title rend="quotes">A Student Collaborators’ Bill of
                    Rights</title>, developed by Miriam Posner and colleagues, to give students
                    control over how their role is represented. Students may want to reframe their
                    work according to their career aspirations as well as decide to no longer be
                    affiliated by removing their name <ptr target="#dipressi2017"/>. To address
                    these issues, students were invited to create a GitHub page and provided with a
                    guide to developing their professional profile on the site. We then linked these
                    sites to their names on the Team page. The students then can customize their
                    GitHub pages to outline their roles on Photogrammar. As students move throughout
                    their studies and graduate, they can alter their profiles to meet their current
                    needs. Moreover, students did not have to develop a GitHub page, but the option
                    was available so that they could have control over how their labor is
                    framed.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>Photogrammar will feature a timeline that outlines the labor and funding
                        involved in the project.</head>
                    <figDesc>Timeline which includes the amount of labor each team member
                        contributed and funding involved.</figDesc>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p>Yet, even when text is written to describe the work by a member of the team, this
                    can still make it difficult to capture the amount of time spent on the project
                    for the different contributors. To address these issues, we turned to a timeline
                    to capture the shifts in labor and funding within the project. For each
                    component of the project, we assigned the person to the time span they worked.
                    Work is broadly conceived to include physical as well as affective labor. Here
                    we can see the shifts in the project including the new collaboration with
                    Courtney Rivard and the UNC, Chapel Hill, which then resulted in an ACLS grant.
                    This strategy helped reveal how multiple institutions of higher education became
                    involved, an important aspect considering that student labor was used at Yale
                    University and then University of Richmond and UNC, Chapel Hill. Yet, the
                    timeline still has drawbacks for it assigns a particular task to each person
                    obscuring how interconnected and collaborative the process was and continues to
                    be. Here we turned to another visualization technique — networks.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>Photogrammar is using a network visualization to show who worked on which
                        components of the project. The network is an example of work through
                        2017.</head>
                    <figDesc>A network visualization of the individuals who worked on the project.
                        Gray nodes indicate components of the project; green nodes indicate
                        individual workers.</figDesc>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure05.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p>Network analysis is particularly well suited for revealing collaboration and
                    labor for it literally visualizes connections and interactions between people.
                    The bimodal graph connects each person to the component of the project they
                    helped build. In this case, labor included creating data or building a digital
                    components and includes people who contributed 1-2 days or several months of
                    work. We recognize that one drawback of networks is their ability to represent
                    time, making it difficult to denote the amount of labor; an issue the timeline
                    helps address albeit imperfectly. This strategy was particularly important for
                    acknowledging student labor. Whereas undergraduate student labor in the
                    classroom was noted at the course level in the timeline, each student who served
                    as a research assistant is a node and connected to the Photogrammar component
                    they worked on, which in most cases was the life histories. We developed a
                    network visualization particularly to increase the visibility of student labor.
                    The new visualizations of labor and GitHub links will be a part of a new version
                    of Photogrammar that will be released in 2020.</p>
                <p>While these three methods help reveal a significant amount of the work on
                    Photogrammar, the issue of crediting labor is also why we will be changing
                    Photogrammar’s URL from photogrammar.yale.edu to photogrammar.org. While the
                    Photogrammar team did develop some new metadata about the FSA-OWI photographs,
                    it is deeply indebted to decades of work by the Library of Congress to digitize
                    the photographs and build the initial metadata <ptr target="#arnold2017"/>. When
                    the project was released, media outlets such as CNN and Gizmodo incorrectly
                    credited Yale for releasing the photographs.<note>For examples, see <ptr
                            target="#estes2015"/>
                        <ptr target="#groetzinger2015"/>
                        <ptr target="#long2015"/>.</note> This is despite the fact that the About
                    the Collection page outlines the work by the Library of Congress on the
                    collection and each photo includes a link back to the Library of Congress. Yet,
                    the URL sent the message that Yale owned these photographs. The issue is
                    particularly acute as we will be including documents from the Southern Life
                    Histories Collection, which is housed at the University of North Carolina,
                    Chapel Hill Southern Historical Collection in the next version. The new URL, we
                    hope, will help signal that the project is a multi-institutional collaboration
                    and ask people to look more closely at who is contributing to the project. This
                    will be augmented by logos from the participating institutions and funders when
                    possible.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>Valuing the creation of the data undergirding DH projects is an ongoing
                    challenge. While it can be a mundane and monotonous task, data construction is
                    an interpretive, iterative, and inexact process. These very conditions
                    necessitate acknowledging and making visible the intellectual work that
                    undergirds DH data. Yet, it can be difficult as it asks us to be reflexive about
                    who is doing what and under what conditions. Such a challenge is why we framed
                    data construction as a pedagogical opportunity for undergraduates and used DH
                    methods to make visible the labor behind Photogrammar.</p>
                <p>Our collaborative work with students was fundamentally motivated by a concern to
                    make sure student labor on Photogrammar served pedagogical goals rather than
                    just the labor needs of the project. Once we decided to work with
                    undergraduates, we have and continue to explore ways to give students credit
                    with a focus on increasing their visibility in the project alongside mechanisms
                    such as course credit and monetary compensation. These issues extend to how
                    Photogrammar gives credit to the partnerships that have made the project
                    possible. Our process has shortcomings and is not ideal for all projects.
                    Moreover, invisible labor will continue to haunt Photogrammar as it does across
                    DH and the academy. It can be difficult as it asks us to be reflexive about who
                    is doing what and under what conditions. Yet, we believe that revealing our
                    process and approaches by using methods that are now central to DH is a part of
                    the work we need to be doing as a field.</p>
