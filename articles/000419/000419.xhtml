                  <p>This essay responds to two questions at the heart of the Invisible Labor in the
                     Digital Humanities 2016 symposium at Florida State University: (1) what is at
                     stake in making unseen work visible, and (2) how can DH projects equally
                     distribute and value the labor involved in their construction? For us, the
                     answer to these questions lied in privileging the pedagogical affordances of
                     data construction by crafting a workflow that included undergraduates as
                     intellectual partners, and using DH methods to visualize and make public this
                     collaborative labor. By drawing on our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes
                     federal New Deal documentary projects including photography and life histories,
                     we highlight three strategies for making labor visible in the digital
                     humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as tool for teaching
                     undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them experience with
                     conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this way, we
                     explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we argue
                     that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects visible.
                     We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside the
                     traditional “About” page to make visible all
                     participants in the project. Third, we turn to an open discussion of the
                     challenges faced in the politics of attribution when working with university,
                     governmental and private historical organizations, including domain names and
                     use of organizational logos.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p1">In an effort to justify new methods of social documentation, W.T. Couch (1939)
                  declared, “The people, all the people, must be known, they must
                  be heard. Somehow they must be given representation, somehow they must be given
                  a voice and allowed to speak, in their essential character”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#couch1939">Couch 1939</a>, x–xi]. His zeal for a new method of documenting
                  social history reflected his belief in a more democratic vision of American
                  expression, which also starkly contrasted with growing fascism in Europe during the
                  1930s. In order to give “the people their voice,” he
                  helped to craft the Southern Life Histories Project, which charged Federal Writers’
                  Project (FWP) workers with interviewing and documenting the lives of everyday people
                  in the American South. The collection is composed of nearly 1200 life histories that
                  are entertaining, insightful, heartbreaking, and, on the whole, say as much, if not
                  more about the writers than the interviewees. Because of the outbreak of WWII and
                  political turmoil within the program, there is not much remaining evidence relating
                  to the interviewees, the writers, the editors, or how precisely these life histories
                  were written. Instead what remains are the stories themselves, while the labor
                  behind them is obscured even rendered invisible.

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">As many Digital Humanities (DH) scholars and workers know, this situation of having
                  a
                  product with little to no knowledge of the labor behind its construction is rather
                  common. We create DH projects for particular audiences, but the decisions and labor
                  behind their construction remain hidden as they are not the end goal of the
                  projects. At the November 2016 Symposium on Invisible Labor in the Digital
                  Humanities at Florida State University, Mark Algee-Hewitt referred to this issue as
                  one of the great paradoxes of DH. In order to better understand this great paradox,
                  the symposium centered on three key themes: (1) divergent expectations, (2) unequal
                  labor, and (3) invisible work. Within each of these themes was a discussion of the
                  core tension in collaborative DH projects about how to distribute and value labor,
                  especially when decisions about the direction of research and allocation of funding
                  are not evenly dispersed, which is often the case in the hierarchical system of the
                  academy.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">In discussing these broader themes, the topic of student labor emerged, which by and
                  large is an area that DH has yet to properly take on, especially undergraduate
                  student labor. As Spencer D.C. Keralis explains in his poignant chapter on labor in
                  <cite class="title italic">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and
                     Experiments</cite>, “if there is a spectre haunting digital
                  pedagogy, it is the spectre of labor”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#keralis2016">Keralis 2016</a>, 4]. This spectre results from the fact that
                  students are often given what is thought of as the most mundane work, such as
                  scanning material and data entry. Labor that is “rendered
                  invisible, alienable, and is easily effaced and taken for granted” when
                  looking at the final product. While such a labor structure is almost always
                  uniformly bemoaned as unfortunate and unfair, few actually take the time and effort
                  to work to disrupt it in their own DH work. In order to address this spectre of
                  labor, we ask what would it mean to turn this seemingly mundane or taken-for-granted
                  work into an opportunity to teach and re-envision undergraduate DH pedagogy? How can
                  we use DH methods themselves as the means to represent such labor? This essay
                  answers these questions by outlining our efforts to address labor inequities through
                  our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes federal New Deal documentary projects
                  including photography and life histories. For us, the answer to these questions lied
                  in privileging the pedagogical affordances of data construction by crafting a
                  workflow that included undergraduates as intellectual partners, and using DH methods
                  to visualize and make public this collaborative labor.

                  the project has required, and then highlight two strategies for valuing labor and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">In 2010, Photogrammar began as a collaboration between Lauren Tilton and Taylor
                     Arnold. Tilton was interested in the representational politics of the Farm
                     Security Administration-Office of War (FSA-OWI) Information, which employed
                     among the most influential documentary photographers of the century such as
                     Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Gordon Parks. They produced iconic photographs
                     of the Great Depression that were often in support of the New Deal state and,
                     with the onset of World War II, turned their gaze toward constructing an image
                     of an affluent and strong nation ready for war [<a class="ref" href="#stange1986">Stange 1986</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#trachtenberg1988">Trachtenberg 1988</a>]. Yet, the collection was difficult to navigate
                     through the Library of Congress website. Tilton reached out to Arnold, a
                     statistician, and they worked together to scrape and map the 170,000 photographs
                     from the collection. They developed a prototype, which then received an NEH
                     Office of Digital Humanities grant.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">With the grant, the collaboration extended to include Laura Wexler, who was the
                     grant’s Primary Investigator; Ken Panko and Trip Kirkpatrick, who served as
                     Project Managers; Stacey Maples, who served as the Map Expert; and Peter
                     Leonard, who served as an Implementation Coordinator. Tilton and Arnold were
                     named Co-Directors. Over the next several years, they built the web-based
                     platform for organizing, searching, and visualizing the 170,000 photographs from
                     the FSA-OWI. In 2015, Courtney Rivard from the University of North Carolina,
                     Chapel Hill joined the Photogrammar team with the idea of adding aspects of the
                     Federal Writers' Project as a map layer. Then in 2016, Photogrammar received an
                     ACLS Digital Extension Grant to place the FSA-OWI photographs in the larger
                     federal effort to document America during the Great Depression. The grant
                     included funding to build out several components including the addition of the
                     Federal Writers’ Project’s Southern Life Histories Project from the University
                     of North Carolina, Chapel Hill’s Southern Historical Collection.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The Southern Life History Project (SLHP) was part of the larger Federal Writers’
                     Project created under the New Deal as a way to put unemployed writers to work.
                     In many ways, the SLHP marked a major shift in forms of documentary expression
                     as its goal was to capture the life stories of everyday Americans from their own
                     perspectives. W.T. Couch saw these life histories as way to collect accurate and
                     authentic accounts of the hardships of life during the Depression with special
                     attention to marginalized voices such as African Americans, women, and working
                     class individuals. For him, the South faced many problems that needed to be
                     solved, but sociological data that focused on data and numbers obscured the
                     realities of life and failed to move a general public to enact necessary
                     changes. Instead he thought that real stories by real people constituted the
                     type of evidence that had the power to create change. However, like other forms
                     of documentation that purported authenticity, the life histories tell readers as
                     much about their creators, in this case the federal writers, as they do the
                     interviewees. Moreover, the writers’ use of representational practices often
                     demonstrate how racism, sexism, and inequality were perpetuated in stories of
                     the quotidian. Because of their complicated composition, they serve as an
                     important companion to the FSA-OWI photographs that were taken during that same
                     time period. Both projects sought to document the American experience and
                     negotiate the desires and needs of those who documented, those who were
                     documented, and the funding agencies. Our goal was to bring together these life
                     histories and the FSA-OWI photographs in the Photogrammar platform to allow
                     users to explore the documentary work of the Great Depression era, and the
                     reason many scholars have labeled it the “documentary
                     decade”

                     decades of work by the Library of Congress to digitize the photos and to create
                     the extensive metadata that accompanied them. This was not the case with the
                     life histories. Like many other projects involving archival documents, the life
                     histories layer necessitated creating, cataloguing, and organizing metadata from
                     the archival material, together with marking up and cleaning the individual
                     documents before the material was ready to be integrated into the Photogrammar
                     platform. In this case, the metadata centered around the names, races, and
                     genders of both the writers and interviewees for each life history so as to
                     optimize search functionality within the collection as well as to generate
                     visualizations that analyzed the collection in new ways. While this may seem a
                     straightforward process, it was quite murky as the metadata had to be
                     extrapolated from stories created through a writer’s interpretation of an
                     interviewee’s life often written as a conversation that did not unfold in a
                     linear progression.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">This data construction phase of the project is often the backbone of DH projects,
                     especially those that use visualization and text analysis. While this process is
                     crucially important, it is frequently the part of the project that receives the
                     least attention and attribution. Such inattention is likely because data is
                     often understood as that which is given, or as already existing [<a class="ref" href="#rosenberg2013">Rosenberg 2013</a>]. One frequently hears a DH scholar talk about
                     “their corpus” of books, photographs, or archival
                     material. Yet, making these sources computationally tractable is a significant
                     undertaking. Turning a PDF of a piece of writing into clean, plain text can take
                     expensive software and people who manually correct errors. Organizing the
                     sources online or for analysis often involves creating a tabular database; a
                     process that requires creating metadata. Bringing attention to the
                     constructedness of the process is one of the reasons Johanna Drucker argued for
                     using capta, that which is captured, rather than the term data [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2011">Drucker 2011</a>]. In reality, making a corpus requires countless
                     decisions over what actually counts as data and how to create such data.
                     Therefore, by referencing “the corpus” both the interpretative decisions in
                     data creation and the labor that makes data available (particularly those who
                     collect, store, and preserve these sources) are obscured through the singularity
                     of the term. Moreover, data construction is just one component of the
                     complicated labor network of digital projects. Responding to the work of
                     scholars such as Amy Earhart, Miriam Posner, and Roopika Risam, Spencer Keralis
                     explains:

                           The labor network necessary to produce digital projects
                           is complex, ranging from the physical labor of maintaining hardware and
                           the infrastructure essential to these projects, to hybrid labor “in
                           which machines combine with humans to perform tasks” in software
                           or with devices, to scripted tasks performed automatically within
                           systems, to the writing of those scripts, to the knowledge work that
                           serves as the intellectual foundation of a project, to the
                           instrumentalized labor of workers who perform repetitive tasks that
                           cannot be scripted

                     </blockquote> In efforts to re-envision the
                     data construction phase of this project and dwell in the murkiness of its labor
                     rather than to move past it as quickly as possible to get to the final product,
                     we used the data construction phase as a pedagogical opportunity to teach
                     students about the rhetorical nature of data. We aimed to animate the
                     undergraduate classroom by including students in the decision process for one
                     way of valuing labor is identifying opportunities and outcomes that also benefit
                     the person laboring. We accomplished this by building Rivard’s new course-based
                     undergraduate research experience (CURE) classes into the data construction
                     phase of the project.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Many DH practitioners have noted the lack of opportunities available to
                     undergraduate students to gain DH skills and experience unless they are able to
                     join a research project run by a DH scholar in their university [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2016">Anderson, et al. 2016</a>]. Moreover, the students who become part of such
                     projects are often thrown into the projects and told to “figure it out” making for a challenging process of skills
                     acquisition. This problem of giving undergraduates genuine research
                     opportunities while at the same time teaching them necessary methods and
                     research skills is one faced by most areas of the university. To address this
                     issue, many universities have begun initiatives to incorporate genuine or
                     “real” research projects into the classroom often in the form of CURE
                     courses (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience) [<a class="ref" href="#ishiyama2002">Ishiyama 2002</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lopatto2010">Lopatto 2010</a>]. While such courses are most common in STEM fields,
                     we aimed to merge this approach with the project development of the life history
                     layer of Photogrammar. In other words, rather than viewing data construction as
                     a monotonous task that needed to be quickly accomplished, we used it to
                     accomplish pedagogical goals that focused on undergraduate research and skill
                     acquisition, thereby re-envisioning this labor as pedagogical in nature by
                     shifting our understanding of the goal of data construction.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">This approach of building pedagogy into DH project development was aided in large
                     part by the organizational structure of the Southern Life History Collection
                     (SLHC) and pedagogical resources made available by UNC, two factors that must be
                     in place to enact this type of project development. The SLHC is located at the
                     Southern Historical Collection on UNC’s campus, which meant that students had
                     easy access to the original archival material. Additionally, though written in
                     the 1930s, the writers of the life histories already understood the importance
                     of collecting data to organize its collection because at the beginning of almost
                     every life history is a listing of extremely helpful metadata including
                     information relating to the writer and the interviewee (see Figure 1). This
                     easily discernible metadata that introduced a reader into the life history
                     provided the beginning of metadata schema that could be used to organize the
                     data that would be incorporated into Photogrammar. It would have been possible
                     to simply use this schema to generate the data needed for the project ourselves;
                     something that we could have done rather quickly. Instead, we decided to slow
                     the data construction process down in order to turn it into a pedagogical
                     opportunity to include undergraduates in a course-based setting. The importance
                     of engaging students in the data construction process has been well-documented
                     in the literature on statistical education, an idea that should be extended into
                     DH pedagogy [<a class="ref" href="#hydorn2018">Hydorn 2018</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Additionally, the decision to incorporate undergraduate pedagogical goals into
                     the data construction process of the project was influenced by an initiative at
                     UNC to promote CURE courses across campuses, which included providing faculty
                     with resources on how to incorporate authentic research experiences within the
                     structure of a class. At the same time, Rivard was collaborating with a faculty
                     working group at UNC focused on bringing data studies into humanities
                     curricula.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e378">[2]</a> Therefore, UNC offered concrete resources and incentives to
                     promote course-based undergraduate research that fostered the development of DH
                     skills. Such resources and incentives allowed us the opportunity to take
                     pedagogical risks.

                     collaborators in a new upper division, undergraduate course at UNC taught by
                     Rivard on digital rhetoric in Spring 2016 and again in 2017.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e395">[3]</a> Students were positioned as leaders of the North
                     Carolina section of the Life Histories Collection, which constituted
                     approximately 600 life histories. As will be explained in greater detail below,
                     students were charged with creating a metadata schema for the inclusion of these
                     life histories in Photogrammar, and then to use this data as the basis of a
                     research project that they could publish in an undergraduate research journal.
                     By bringing students into the Photogrammar project, Rivard aimed to demonstrate
                     to students the ways in which data construction was a rhetorical act as
                     students, themselves, were in charge of the decisions behind the data.

                     field of digital rhetoric. Douglas Eyman defines digital rhetoric “as the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or
                     heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances” that
                     must provide methods for both evaluation and making [<a class="ref" href="#eyman2015">Eyman 2015</a>, 44]. To teach students the methods of evaluation and making embedded
                     with Eyman’s conception of digital rhetoric, a number of scholars in Composition
                     and Rhetoric have demonstrated the need to more specifically focus on
                     information literacies and data literacies [<a class="ref" href="#purdy2011">Purdy 2011</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#vetter2014">Vetter 2014</a>]. To this end, Nathan Johnson argues for centering
                     information infrastructure within rhetorical studies, explaining “infrastructure provides the invisible scaffolding for
                     discovery, dissemination, access to information,” and as such has
                     real consequences for “public communication, knowledge, and

                     [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2012">Johnson 2012</a>, 1]. Therefore, teaching students not only how
                     to navigate, but also to construct information infrastructures is key to
                     developing information and digital literacies.

                     Reid explains. He writes, “the promise of the digital
                     humanities lies in its potential to address the political, ethical, and
                     rhetorical challenges of living in a digital age”

                     that allows for “tinkering”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#sayers2012">Sayers 2012</a>] and as Burdick, et. al. explain “hands-on, experiential, and project-based learning through doing”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2016">Burdick, et al. 2016</a>]. However, this approach has often led to what
                     Brandon Locke calls “tool based literacy” in which
                     students develop “‘tech skills’...through narrow
                     technology that limits potential outcomes and often monetizes user-created

                     avenue for teaching students data and information literacies while avoiding a

                     that information infrastructure has on shaping knowledge about the past. As
                     Graban, et. al explain, “the means of archival organization
                     are rhetorical acts deploying arguments about relations, power dynamics, and
                     gate-keeping methodologies and should be treated as such”

                     a project in which they were responsible for creating the system used to
                     describe archival materials put them in the driver's seat of this powerful act
                     of shaping the information infrastructure of our DH project. Specifically we
                     charged students with: (1) creating a metadata schema for the inclusion of the
                     life histories as layer for Photogrammar, (2) generating metadata for ten life
                     histories, (3) marking up three life histories with XML, (4) giving a Skype
                     presentation to Tilton outlining their rationale for the metadata and mark-up
                     schema, and (5) creating data visualizations from the metadata to construct an
                     original argument that they then were encouraged to publish in <cite class="title italic">People, Ideas, and Things</cite>, an undergraduate research
                     journal at UNC.

                     example, students deeply struggled over how to tag gender and racial categories.
                     There are many instances in the life histories in which the writers named women

                     Mrs. Jake Bowen in Figure 2. Students had to decide whether to tag her with her
                     husband’s first name, i.e. Jake, or read the story for context clues for her
                     first name, Virginia. Therefore, they grappled with whether or not to

                     authenticity or employ more inclusive practices in line with contemporary
                     standards. These are the same issues faced by archivists today, so we looked to
                     articles such as Duarte and Belarde-Lewis’ excellent piece, “Imagining: Creating Spaces for Indigenous Ontologies” to learn about
                     ideas such as co-locating and composing for audiences represented in the
                     collections rather than colonialist naming practices [<a class="ref" href="#duarte2015">Duarte 2015</a>]. This led students to also decide to co-locate racial categories. The federal
                     writers used racial categories common to 1930s, which the students found
                     unacceptable and impractical for a contemporary user, so they chose to use
                     multiple terms for each racial category. One student, Julie Hayes, explained
                     this point in her final paper, which was published in UNC’s <cite class="title italic">People, Ideas, and Things</cite> journal. She stated, “this procedure [of data construction] involved much rhetorical
                     decision-making; for instance, outdated racial terms were replaced with more
                     contemporary and searchable words, thus reflecting the shifts in social
                     norms in regard to race and the resultant changes in language”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hayes2017">Hayes 2017</a>]. Therefore, by thinking through the consequences of
                     their tagging systems, students understood their work as knowledge
                     production.

                     transparent by documenting them, they included them in their XML headers with
                     interpretation tags within the project description (see figure 3). After tagging
                     their life histories and marking them up, students used Tableau to visualize
                     their data. Here they looked for patterns in the archive by analyzing it from a
                     distance [<a class="ref" href="#underwood2017">Underwood 2017</a>], an approach that had never been used to
                     analyze this collection. Knowing that they were looking at the collection in new
                     ways because of the data that they constructed gave them a profound sense of
                     accomplishment, and positioned them as knowledgeable researchers in their own
                     right. Moreover, their decisions fundamentally shaped the infrastructure of the
                     Photogrammar project. Therefore, students learned digital skills such as data
                     visualization, mark-up, and database management while developing critical
                     digital literacies that saw data construction as knowledge making. Though we
                     could have certainly come up with a metadata schema for the life histories more
                     quickly in a few weeks rather than over the span of a year, the pedagogical
                     affordances of this approach were an important end in themselves, and gave
                     students the opportunity to work on DH project that is legible and transferable
                     to their future endeavors. In order to focus on transfer, Rivard spent the last
                     week of the course helping students translate their classwork into points on
                     their resume as well as addressing how to discuss the project in an interview.
                     As a result of this focus on transfer, a number of students have used the
                     project to secure internships and summer research opportunities.

                     University of Richmond were eager to participate in the Photogrammar project,
                     which led us to hire Research Assistants (RA). We tried to find a balance
                     between the needs of the project and the kinds of experiences the RAs sought by
                     working with each RA to identify the type of work that would help them
                     accomplish their scholarly and professional goals. A number of students who were
                     in Rivard’s classes — Carla Aviles, Karissa Barrera, Kayley Bryson, Sarah Moody,
                     Sara Siemens, Elizabeth Bonesteel, Grace Hildebrand, Scott Robinson, and Lacie
                     Morrison — asked to continue to work on the project to gain experience that they
                     could put on their resumes. Grant Glass, a UNC English graduate student, also
                     helped with some text encoding to explore different theoretical methods that he
                     was planning to use in his dissertation. At the University of Richmond, three
                     students — Bal Artist, Emeline Blevins, and Emily Maanum — worked with Tilton
                     and Arnold at the University of Richmond. They expressed interest in being a
                     part of DH research beyond the Introduction to Digital Humanities course that
                     they took with Tilton. Blevins, for example, was interested in developing DH
                     skills with an eye toward jobs in museums and graduate studies. They worked
                     alongside the students at UNC to add metadata to the life histories. Because
                     they did not receive course credit, Richmond students collected hourly wages
                     according to university compensation rules. This growing group working on
                     Photogrammar required us to reevaluate how to give them credit and make their
                     important labor visible.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">With an expanding set of collaborators, we wanted to highlight that certain
                     people contributed in different ways. Valuing labor means recognizing the
                     various ways people contributed, particularly those who put significant work
                     into a project. In order to make visible labor, we supplemented traditional
                     approaches of attribution with DH visualization methods. This resulted in our
                     utilization of three different forms of acknowledging labor: (1) a page on the
                     site listing and describing textually the Photogrammar team, (2) a timeline
                     capturing the length of time by contributor by component on the project, and (3)
                     a network visualization. While each form has it benefits and drawbacks, we
                     believe that taken together they better reveal the kinds and degrees of labor
                     necessary to build Photogrammar.

                     a list of participants and their roles starting with the PI or Director followed
                     by other team members. It is linear and hierarchical. In the case of
                     Photogrammar, a Team page is available as a subsection of the About page. It
                     lists the people involved and their role. Such a page is particularly well
                     suited for explaining the current state of the project. When one lands on such a
                     page, they expect to see who, at that moment, is the current team and their
                     role. If one has a comment or question, they know who to contact.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Yet, there are drawbacks. The long list of students involved does offer a form of
                     credit, but it reads as a list that risks obscuring the amount of work
                     contributed. Those who are no longer involved in the project are often last,
                     regardless of the amount of work or time they spent on the project. Another
                     challenge is when roles shift. For example, Arnold and Tilton started
                     Photogrammar but could not serve as Primary Investigators on the grants since
                     they were graduate students, and later they were no longer affiliated with Yale
                     University. As a result, the Team page does not capture the four months Arnold
                     and Tilton spent building a prototype of Photogrammar or writing the NEH grant
                     before extending the project to include the larger team. It also does not make
                     clear when Project Management shifted from Ken Panko to Trip Kirkpatrick.
                     Certain students also moved from working within the classroom to Research
                     Assistants.

                     we sought strategies for how to balance acknowledging labor while giving
                     participants control over how their labor is documented. We heeded the advice
                     outlined in “A Student Collaborators’ Bill of
                     Rights”, developed by Miriam Posner and colleagues, to give students
                     control over how their role is represented. Students may want to reframe their
                     work according to their career aspirations as well as decide to no longer be
                     affiliated by removing their name [<a class="ref" href="#dipressi2017">DiPressi 2017</a>]. To address
                     these issues, students were invited to create a GitHub page and provided with a
                     guide to developing their professional profile on the site. We then linked these
                     sites to their names on the Team page. The students then can customize their
                     GitHub pages to outline their roles on Photogrammar. As students move throughout
                     their studies and graduate, they can alter their profiles to meet their current
                     needs. Moreover, students did not have to develop a GitHub page, but the option
                     was available so that they could have control over how their labor is
                     framed.

                     can still make it difficult to capture the amount of time spent on the project
                     for the different contributors. To address these issues, we turned to a timeline
                     to capture the shifts in labor and funding within the project. For each
                     component of the project, we assigned the person to the time span they worked.
                     Work is broadly conceived to include physical as well as affective labor. Here
                     we can see the shifts in the project including the new collaboration with
                     Courtney Rivard and the UNC, Chapel Hill, which then resulted in an ACLS grant.
                     This strategy helped reveal how multiple institutions of higher education became
                     involved, an important aspect considering that student labor was used at Yale
                     University and then University of Richmond and UNC, Chapel Hill. Yet, the
                     timeline still has drawbacks for it assigns a particular task to each person
                     obscuring how interconnected and collaborative the process was and continues to
                     be. Here we turned to another visualization technique — networks.

                     The bimodal graph connects each person to the component of the project they
                     helped build. In this case, labor included creating data or building a digital
                     components and includes people who contributed 1-2 days or several months of
                     work. We recognize that one drawback of networks is their ability to represent
                     time, making it difficult to denote the amount of labor; an issue the timeline
                     helps address albeit imperfectly. This strategy was particularly important for
                     acknowledging student labor. Whereas undergraduate student labor in the
                     classroom was noted at the course level in the timeline, each student who served
                     as a research assistant is a node and connected to the Photogrammar component
                     they worked on, which in most cases was the life histories. We developed a
                     network visualization particularly to increase the visibility of student labor.
                     The new visualizations of labor and GitHub links will be a part of a new version

                     credited Yale for releasing the photographs.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e590">[5]</a> This is despite the fact that the About
                     the Collection page outlines the work by the Library of Congress on the
                     collection and each photo includes a link back to the Library of Congress. Yet,
                     the URL sent the message that Yale owned these photographs. The issue is
                     particularly acute as we will be including documents from the Southern Life
                     Histories Collection, which is housed at the University of North Carolina,
                     Chapel Hill Southern Historical Collection in the next version. The new URL, we
                     hope, will help signal that the project is a multi-institutional collaboration
                     and ask people to look more closely at who is contributing to the project. This
                     will be augmented by logos from the participating institutions and funders when
                     possible.

                     challenge. While it can be a mundane and monotonous task, data construction is
                     an interpretive, iterative, and inexact process. These very conditions
                     necessitate acknowledging and making visible the intellectual work that
                     undergirds DH data. Yet, it can be difficult as it asks us to be reflexive about
                     who is doing what and under what conditions. Such a challenge is why we framed
                     data construction as a pedagogical opportunity for undergraduates and used DH
                     methods to make visible the labor behind Photogrammar.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Our collaborative work with students was fundamentally motivated by a concern to
                     make sure student labor on Photogrammar served pedagogical goals rather than
                     just the labor needs of the project. Once we decided to work with
                     undergraduates, we have and continue to explore ways to give students credit
                     with a focus on increasing their visibility in the project alongside mechanisms
                     such as course credit and monetary compensation. These issues extend to how
                     Photogrammar gives credit to the partnerships that have made the project
                     possible. Our process has shortcomings and is not ideal for all projects.
                     Moreover, invisible labor will continue to haunt Photogrammar as it does across
                     DH and the academy. It can be difficult as it asks us to be reflexive about who
                     is doing what and under what conditions. Yet, we believe that revealing our
                     process and approaches by using methods that are now central to DH is a part of
                     the work we need to be doing as a field.
