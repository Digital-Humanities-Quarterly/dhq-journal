            <dhq:abstract>
                <p>The recent proliferation of experimental literature has produced a critical and
                    creative exchange between the possibilities of print and digital distribution
                    platforms. Through a focused study of Jonathan Safran Foer’s <title
                        rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title>, this article confronts the difficulty
                    of citation as an occasion to develop a web based prototype or model of this
                    decidedly paper bound text. The result of this experiment produced a digitized
                    version of Tree of Codes that allows for a further discussion of issues of loss,
                    deformation, and versioning alongside a wider conversation on presentation
                    semantics on the web and browser capabilities. This article argues that
                    experimental features on the web have a great deal to gain in a reciprocal
                    exchange between experimental print media.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p> With the release of Sony’s Reader in 2004 and the subsequent release of Amazon’s
                    Kindle in 2007, the introduction of consumer ebook platforms remains within the
                    realm of recent memory. The relative newness of publishing literature in both
                    open and proprietary formats — whether they are marked with html, epub, pdf,
                    mobi, KF8, or ibook suffixes — demands that publishers and authors take chances
                    with the digitization of literature and accept the risk of modifying literary
                    meaning through digital presentation and dissemination. Since their initial
                    release, each of these formats has been changed and tweaked from version to
                    version. New functionality and bug fixes continue to improve and modify these
                    technologies in subtle increments. The introduction of new formats and platforms
                    has produced an unprecedented period of literary experimentation where
                    versioning becomes the hallmark of software development and academic work in the
                    humanities alike. As the titles of their works become marked by these file
                    format acronyms, contemporary authors are now responding to the digital context
                    in which their works are published with a renewed attention to the materiality
                    of publishing. Simultaneously, the normalization of reflowable text is upending
                    the fixity of print and the stability of the venerable codex. I argue that
                    contemporary novelists are engaging with this new and fluid digital publishing
                    environment by experimenting with the possibilities of print. Because the novel
                    has always been an experimental form — insofar as it has always presumed to be
                        <emph>new</emph> — a renewed interest in experimental print texts has come
                    to express an anxiety about the proliferation of digital texts and digitized
                    distribution models for literature. For this reason, I wish to discuss<title
                        rend="italic"> Tree of Codes</title> (2010) by Jonathan Safran Foer because
                    it is highly experimental in form and also acknowledges the work of creating
                    digital versions of paperbound books. </p>
                <p> This book is, I believe, one of the most coherent responses to the current shift
                    in reading technologies and offers insights into the role of books in the
                    preservation of human history through mechanical reproduction. Foer’s text works
                    as an extension and modification of Johanna Drucker claim in <title
                        rend="italic">The Century of Artists’ Books </title>(1995) that the artist
                    book is representative of the 20th century social, cultural, and technological
                    development. In a 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>-century context, the generic
                    strictures of artist book do not necessarily apply to Foer’s work, but he has
                    taken up a similar formalist avant-garde sensibility in exploring the artistic
                    possibilities of paper in a digital environment. However, any academically
                    situated discussion of Foer’s book demands that such a text submit to some kind
                    of citation, reference, or quotation. This is a book that presents many problems
                    for academic or critical discourse because it cannot be reliably cited. <title
                        rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title> is written by die-cutting words from the
                    pages of Bruno Schulz’s 1936 novel <title rend="italic">The Street of
                        Crocodiles</title>. The result is a fragile paper latticework of paper tabs
                    that allows the reader to peer through several pages at once and read the
                    remaining text. The experience of reading <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes</title> calls to mind the fragility of art and the realization that so
                    much of our artistic legacy has been lost. In this case, <title rend="italic"
                        >Tree of Codes </title>is a physical reminder of the literary
                    <!-- Figure 1 Image of Tree of Codes (<hi
                    rend="Hyperlink.0"
                    >www.visual-editions.com/our-books/tree-of-codes#</hi> 
                 >www.visual-editions.com/our-books/tree-of-codes#</hi>)-->
                    meaning that has been lost to war and the need of art to reconstitute and
                    imagine our past. Schulz was a Polish artist and author of Jewish ethnicity
                    living in Drohobych when the Nazis invaded in 1941. After being kept alive for
                    his skills as a draftsman and storyteller, he was murdered in November of 1942
                    at the hands of a Nazi officer. The excised text in <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes</title> is a physical representation of this loss and the loss of much
                    of Schulz’s corpus during the war. The result is, as Foer describes it by
                    borrowing Schulz’s words, <quote rend="inline" source="#schulz2008">a geometry
                        of emptiness</quote> and a highly material — even sculptural — reading
                    experience <ptr target="#schulz2008" loc="65"/>. Foer has also said, in a
                    publicity video for his publisher, <quote rend="inline" source="#foer2010">I
                        hope that <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes </title>in some ways
                        contributes to the conversation we are now having about what’s possible with
                        literature and what’s possible with paper.</quote> This book presents an
                    experience of remediation — of representing one medium through another — in its
                    production and printing. By building on Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin’s
                    basic proposition that <quote rend="inline" source="#bolter2000">remediation is
                        a defining characteristic of the new digital media</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bolter2000" loc="45"/>, I argue that <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes</title> represents a version of Schulz’s story that helps to preserve
                    and revive its memory by paradoxically losing vast swaths of the text.
                    Furthermore, Foer has presented a printed object that offers a profound
                    experience of loss and also captures something of the history of literature that
                    has been preserved from WWII. In a 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>-century
                    publishing environment, however, the possibilities of paper now comment on the
                    experience of loss in digital media. </p>
                <p> Publishers have come to play an increasingly important role in the production of
                    such experimental literature, but this is a very old genre. Experimental
                    literary precedents have long drawn on a common thread of scientific and
                    methodological exploration of humanistic thought. In the words of Emile Zola,
                    perhaps the first commenter on the experimental novel, <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#zola1893">The idea of experiment carries with it the idea of
                        modification. We start, indeed, from the true facts, which are
                        indestructible basis; but to show the mechanism of these facts it is the
                        genius in the book</quote><ptr target="#zola1893"/>. While Zola is writing
                    as a champion of the emergent 19th century naturalist school of thought in
                    French writing — which of course had its correlate in U.S. fiction with authors
                    like Theodore Dreiser, Frank Norris, Stephen Crane, and Upton Sinclair — the
                    American equivalent sought to challenge the deterministic impacts of the
                    scientific thought of psychology, evolution, and economics that fated the
                    livelihoods of so many Americans at the time. As a kind of extension of
                    scientific method, experimental literature must not confine itself, says Zola,
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#zola1893">to those lofty regions that lie
                        beyond the boundaries of science</quote><ptr target="#zola1893"/>. Instead,
                    experimental literature tests the limits of form and the mechanism of medium in
                    an attempt to challenge the limits of what can be known and said. Bruno Latour
                    has been arguing for the use of scientific experimentation in humanities
                    discourses since at least the 1987 publication of <title rend="italic">Science
                        in Action</title>, where he defined experimentation as simply a scientific
                    methodology to explore, test, and modify <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#latour1987">a core of common problems and methods</quote> in
                    academic and scholarly knowledge creation <ptr target="#latour1987" loc="16"/>.
                    It is not until 1999, in <title rend="italic">Pandora’s Hope, </title>that
                    Latour comes full circle and claims that <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#latour1987">an experiment is a story</quote> (124). While
                    experimental texts have long challenged the norms of social and academic
                    discourse, experimental print literature has recently turned the locus of its
                    critique towards the limitations of digital publishing, while relishing the
                    materiality of paper. As a work of intermedia — between technologies and
                    discursive fields — the tools and critical tradition of the digital humanities
                    is perfectly suited to logically integrate experimental literature and analyze
                    broader shifts in medium and genre in the face of technological change;
                    prototyping becomes a way to link the means and methods of cultural inquiry as a
                    unified gesture.<note> Despite their seeming equivalence, the terms intermedia
                        and transmedia require some differentiation and are useful to sequester
                        certain valences of meaning that do not apply to my argument. Intermedia has
                        its roots within modern multimedia artists interested in transgressing
                        typical discursive norms of art and classical formal restrictions. Collage,
                        photography, and sculpture were mixed as a means of blurring the conventions
                        of 2D and 3D art. In the transition from drawing to sculpture, the norms of
                        the artistic establishment were undermined but a range of expressive
                        possibilities were also made possible. Transmedia has recently been used by
                        Henry Jenkins to describe a cross marketing opportunity between literature,
                        film, and various levels of consumer goods like toys, games, and immersive
                        experiences such as theme parks to maximize the profit gained from a single
                        story or character. We often experience this so-called <soCalled>transmedia
                            storytelling</soCalled> through the marketing and franchising of mass
                        media. Therefore, my study has more in common with the intermedia movement
                        made popular by Dick Higgins in the 60s. Klaus-Peter Busse defines

                        Prototype Argues</title> (2010), the position of this interpretive gesture

                    <ptr target="#galey2010" loc="406"/>. A prototype in a humanities context is a
                    generative and creative artifact that enacts a literary and critical gesture,
                    but a prototype is also a kind of scholarly outcome that must be experienced as
                    it performs a theory or argument alongside a discursive intervention. A critical
                    engagement with literature requires a creative act that seeks to bridge formal
                    constraints, but such a creative and critical gesture also offers the
                    opportunity to explore fundamentally paired themes within Foer’s text: the
                    fragility of human life and the fragility of print.</p>

                <head>Lost on the Way</head>
                <p> In a 2012 issue of <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title>,
                    Paul Stephens marveled at the <quote rend="inline" source="#stephens2012"
                        >extraordinary cornucopia of recent avant-garde writing</quote> (6). This
                    comment arose from his discussion on the recent <soCalled>metadata
                        revolution</soCalled> that has sought to catalogue and aggregate vast
                    datasets into accessible archives that are usable by contemporary authors for
                    creative works (1). Foer’s text represents a corollary gesture that Stephens
                    identifies, but Foer takes Schulz’s <title rend="italic">The Street of
                        Crocodiles</title> as his sole archive. While I have proposed that Foer’s
                    text intentionally resists digitization in response to our current digital
                    context, the manufacture of <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes </title>suggests
                    that this text must not be confused for somehow resisting technology in general.
                    The publisher of <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title>, Visual Editions, is
                    a small boutique-like company dedicated to experimental writing. The demands of
                    the project required Visual Editions to seek out a variety of highly technical
                    processes from different craftspeople and companies and a whole host of
                    sophisticatedly engineered manufacturing processes. So, while the pages were
                    printed by the Belgian firm die Keure — who were chosen because of their
                    experience with printing art books and custom government forms like voting
                    ballots — the actual die-cutting was done by Cachet in The Netherlands. Finally,
                    the pages were returned to Belgium for individual hand-finishing, only to return
                    to The Netherlands to be bound into a final product. Because of technical
                    restrictions of a book that lacked so much bulk, <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes</title> could not be released as a hardcover. While at once forgoing
                    the anachronistic tradition of releasing a hardcover object that is associated
                    with status, expense, and durability, the intensive labour required to produce
                    each book also makes for a quite expensive paperback. My copy, on its initial
                    release, cost $45.95 Canadian, before taxes. <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes
                    </title>implicitly raises questions about the purpose of technology in the
                    humanities and the production of literary art through an implicit understanding
                    of its manufacture. However, if it is possible to suppose that technology is no
                    mere means, humanities scholars must take account of these implicit meanings of
                    the tools used to analyze cultural products of all kinds. </p>
                <p> To accurately cite <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title> in ann online
                    journal, I have found it necessary to encode this complex text using HTML, CSS,
                    and an open source page turn script developed by Google. Therefore, digitizing
                    experimental literature becomes a prototyping framework for testing the
                    limitations of the presentation semantics of the web and the inherent meanings
                    held between print and digital versions. In the words of Geoffrey Rockwell and
                    Stéfan Sinclair in a draft essay by the same name,<title rend="quotes">There’s a
                        toy in my essay!</title> The <soCalled>embedded hermeneutical toy</soCalled>
                    in my essay <quote rend="inline" source="#rockwell2013">can be explored for
                        technique,</quote> but I believe that such an act of remediation is also an
                    interpretive gesture that is in sync with the thematics of loss within <title
                        rend="italic">Tree of Codes. </title>The markup I produce functions as an
                    elaborate quotation mark that attempts to describe the complex aesthetic
                    experience of reading the material text of <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes</title>; it has, I hope, as much to say about digital humanities
                    methods and experiments as it does about literary analysis. However, between the
                    limits of print and the limits of web-based presentation, digital humanities
                    discourse engages with certain poststructuralist philosophies of language, text,
                    and signification more generally. Poststructuralism arose by questioning the
                    assurances of meaning associated with the Saussurean sign, and the
                    poststructuralist conception of language demands that the meaning of a text is
                    also bound to its context and must signify new meanings for new contexts. If
                    digital texts are situated within the context of markup languages, the shifting
                    and reflowing contexts are boundless in ways that theorists of the last century
                    could not anticipate. Jacques Derrida’s essay <title rend="quotes">Signature
                        Event Context</title> acts as something of an invitation to Galey and
                    Ruecker’s prototyping theory and methodology. During a colloquium on the theme
                    of communication in 1971, Derrida describes the philosophical basis of citation
                    as follows: <quote rend="block" source="#undocumented">Every sign, linguistic or
                        nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the usual sense of this opposition), as
                        a small or large unity, can be <emph>cited</emph>, put between quotation
                        marks; thereby it can break with every given context, and engender
                        infinitely new contexts in an absolutely nonsaturable fashion. This does not
                        suppose that the mark is valid outside its context, but on the contrary that
                        there are only contexts without any center of absolute anchoring. This
                        citationality, duplication, or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is
                        not an accident or an anomaly, but is that (normal/abnormal) without which a
                        mark could no longer even have a so-called <soCalled>normal</soCalled>
                        functioning. What would a mark be that one could not cite? And whose origin
                        could not be lost on the way? (<title rend="quotes">Signature</title>
                        320-321)</quote></p>
                <p>As a way of answering Derrida’s question, it is necessary to consider the
                    material context of the sign; the mark that cannot be cited is the mark that is
                    bound to its material support or substance. When a substance functions to
                    support the meaning of a text, the citation of printed marks now demands
                    supplementary markup. In other words, postmodern emphasis on iterability now
                    finds its full expression in the versioning logic of software developers and the
                    digitization efforts of digital humanists. By limiting his definition of
                    citation to only quotation marks, Derrida has limited the citationality of text
                    unnecessarily.</p>
                <p> In what little critical attention Foer’s book has received, Katherine Hayles and
                    Kiene Brillenburg Wurth’s essays are good examples of the limits of citation.
                    Both authors are forced to cite the physical spaces in the text with slashes,
                    and cannot attempt to cite the layering and linking of meaning between pages.
                    Hayles attempts to cope with the problem with a system of angle brackets
                    intended to signal the relative depth of a word appearing through the holes in
                    the text <ptr target="#hayles2013" loc="229"/>. While Hayles offers an
                    insightful statistical analysis of relative word prevalence between the original
                    story and Foer’s text, she ultimately accepts <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#hayles2013">a limitation of digitization</quote> because Foer
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#hayles2013">predeformed his text, with the
                        result that it resists further deformation</quote><ptr target="#hayles2013"
                        loc="230"/>. The language of deformation has been used by many in digital
                    humanities discourse, but I believe that the language of supplementation is more
                    representative of the critical and creative acts of contemporary literature.
                    Lisa Samuels and Jerome J. McGann’s essay, <title rend="quotes">Deformance and
                        Interpretation,</title> served to found this logic as a means of describing
                    the performative aspects of an interpretive method that sought to alter the
                    original text. Samuels and McGann’s goal at that time, in many respects, was to
                    describe the necessity of altering a text to archivists, whose very profession
                    is defined by the act of preserving the original. However, Stephen Ramsay
                    inherits this language in <title rend="italic">Reading Machines </title>by
                    describing how the <quote rend="inline" source="#ramsay2011">risks of
                        deformation</quote> are inherent to all criticism, which equally risks
                    deforming meaning through critical rhetoric and argument. Ramsay settles on a
                    broader critical digital literacy that demands that digital humanists <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#ramsay2011">contend not only with deformed texts, but
                        with the <q>how</q> of those deformations</quote> (63). As a final rejoinder
                    to this tradition, Alain Liu describes his <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#liu2009">deformational forms</quote> as containing <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#liu2009">something of the flavor of
                        deconstruction</quote>
                    <ptr target="#liu2009" loc="505"/>. Because a digital version always modifies
                    the original, it must be understood as both a supplement to the paper text and a
                    new creation. If the purpose of a good citation honors the original in good
                    faith, it is incumbent upon those working in the humanities to simulate the
                    original context in every way possible, including the experience of variable and
                    uncertain meanings. The kind of versioning that I describe avoids the entropy of
                    deformation through a practice of making that is both technological and
                    creative. Between print and digital manifestations of Foer’s text, markup
                    functions as an elaborate, malleable, and generative language of citationality.
                    Markup is the performance of a quotation that leaves traces of code behind. </p>

                <head>Conspiracy of Winking</head>
                <p>If Foer’s highly material text openly resists digital technology — though a
                        <soCalled>tree of codes</soCalled> at least obliquely references a tree-like
                    file system directory — what can possibly be learned by attempting to digitize
                    this print object? In the essay <title rend="quotes">Beyond Remediation</title>
                    (2009), by the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) group, a founding
                    premise of the project argues that the <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#galey2009">relationship between old and new
                            media is reciprocal</quote>
                        <ptr target="#galey2009" loc="4"/>
                    </cit>. While Foer’s title suggests a somewhat contradictory link between print
                    and programming, I claim that any difference between versions represents the
                    traces of the print medium left behind in the digital form. While there has been
                    a sense that digital texts will long be bookish in design, the reciprocal
                    exchange between media necessitates that print texts are capable of enacting
                    digital characteristics. In the context of the previous language of deformation,
                    Foer’s supposed deformation of Schulz’s novel would be further deformed in any
                    critical discourse that struggles with citation. My prototype, therefore,
                    represents the attempt to push the limits of what is condoned and possible with
                    the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) schema and what is supported by browsers as
                    a generative process of supplementation. Simply because a browser does not
                    support a standard does not mean that a given or aesthetic goal is invalid. The
                    history of web standards has demonstrated how tools, techniques, and
                    capabilities that are implemented by developers and used by the public become
                    the norm. The acceptance of JavaScript is one such example of usage dictating
                    its acceptance as a standard. In the words of Douglas Crockford in <title
                        rend="italic">JavaScript: The Good Parts</title>, <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#crockford2008">JavaScript’s popularity is almost completely
                        independent of its qualities as a programming language</quote> (1.0) and
                    still owes a great deal to its adoption by Netscape Navigator 2 in 1996.
                    Furthermore, artistic and creative endeavors are always pressing against the
                    norms of presentation, and web development must follow a similar path. This kind
                    of methodology demands that a new version of a text, even a version that loses
                    so much tactile meaning through digitization, leaves behind traces of readerly
                    intention and more critical possibilities. Presentation semantics of the web are
                    simply more strict and documented than the cultural norms of print in previous
                    periods. I can only describe the instances of reading through the text by
                    flipping pages but also by catching glimpses and sidelong glances of different
                    pages. The interplay between text and object is lost each time it is read
                    because the experience of reading the print version cannot, by and large, not be
                    repeated, while the imagistic language in Schulz’s original story appears and
                    overlaps in confusing and sensuous ways. Foer’s text echoes this rush of imagery
                    through its form; pages slide into view unexpectedly and reappear in new
                    contexts again and again.</p>
                <p> I have found that the whisper is the most salient metaphor to describe the
                    experience of reading this book. <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes </title>asks
                    readers to relinquish the strictly conservative — in terms of the preservation
                    function — value of a text as an unchanging entity. While it is safe to assume
                    that the meaning of any text will change as the readers change, <title
                        rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title> goes further by asking that readers
                    renew their experience of the novel through a varied attention to these visual
                    whispers. The reader of <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title>is complicit
                    in Foer’s rewriting of <title rend="italic">The Street of Crocodiles.
                    </title>One passage on a single page reads as follows: <q>the room grew enormous
                        / filled with / whispers, / a conspiracy of / winking / eyes / opening up
                        among the flowers on the wall / .</q> (<title rend="italic">Tree </title>
                    27). Reading a single page and ignoring the pages beneath produces a coherent
                    sentence, but the text begs our eyes to wander. The underlying text whispers
                    from within the book as our eyes move over the page. The <soCalled>conspiracy of
                        winking</soCalled> generates a new text, with gradients of emphasis that are
                    unique to each reader. This same page may also be read, <q>Then / anger, choking
                        / the room grew enormous / he would fall / into / , filled with / whispers /
                        transformed / beyond / his thoughts / a conspiracy of / a storm of sobs /
                        grown unfamiliar winking / He would /eyes / his breath and listen / opening
                        up / among the flowers on the wall / .</q> (27).<note> Incidentally, Hayles’
                        notation style using angle brackets to indicate the depth of pages is
                        interesting to implement in this instance. The word <q>Then</q> appears
                        deeper in the text and thereby breaks the assumption that any given sentence
                        can be read from left to right of a single page or higher or lower order

                        would look like this: <quote rend="inline" source="#foer2010"

                        <ptr target="#foer2010" loc="27–37"/>). While such a citation style does
                        well to emphasize the text that is at a greater depth, it privileges the
                        deeper words without giving a sense of how the individual tabs are placed on
                        the page. Indeed, this citation ignores the X and Y axis to give a sense of
                        the movement through the Z axis.</note> Some decisions are made consciously
                    and some are unintended slips of the eye. Words are completed by the reader and
                    grammatical correctness is made out of necessity and habit. <title rend="italic"

                    but this text is constantly shifting despite its decidedly static print form.

                    profound and drastically shape the meaning of the text and the context of my
                    interpretations.</p>
                <p> This prototype simultaneously makes arguments about the limitations of the
                    browser and the limits of text to be digitized. Such an argument follows closely
                    from Galey’s claim about <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#galey2011">the web browser as a vital yet
                            unacknowledged agent in the sociology of texts in the present</quote>
                        <ptr target="#galey2011" loc="197"/>
                    </cit>. The experience of this discrepancy offers insight into several issues
                    for digital humanists. The basic languages of the web — HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript — are all highly accessible and offer a promise of backward
                    compatibility and format longevity for humanities projects. While the browser is
                    far from a transparent rendering of web content, the first web pages at CERN
                    developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992 are still readable by modern browsers (see
                        <ref target="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"
                        >http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</ref>). So, despite being
                    excellent at rendering text, modern browsers each have an individual bias
                    towards experimental code, and render the W3C standards with varying success and
                    clarity. In addition to the legal limitations of copyright and contemporary
                    literature, this digital prototype of <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title>
                    represents an opening of academic discourse to a global conversation on the
                    capabilities of the web. However, as the relatively new HTML5 and CSS3 schema is
                    implemented across browsers, support for certain features approved by the W3C
                    remains spotty and uneven. In the implementation of a mix of CSS keyframe
                    animations and JavaScript page turns, the current support for animations and 3D
                    transforms represents a great deal of variability across browsers. Additionally,
                    there were several changes in browser rendering engines during the development
                    of this prototype. Notably, Google announced on April 3, 2013 that the Chrome
                    browser would be forking the Webkit rendering engine and producing their own
                    version called Blink, which they have been working on since 2007 under the title
                    Webcore. Shortly before Google’s announcement, the Norwegian-based Opera browser
                    made an announcement of their own and committed their change from the Presto
                    rendering engine to Google’s development trajectory. While this shift has the
                    potential to further divide browser performance, it is important to remember
                    that the open source Webkit project — initiated by Apple in 1998 — is not a
                    wholly unified project. The Chrome and Safari implementations of Webkit have
                    long differed in their respective V8 and Nitro JavaScript engines. An early
                    prototype using keyframe animations was unsuitable because of how differently
                    each browser rendered 3D transforms, and the book opening ultimately needed to
                    be animated with the Transit JQuery library (<ref
                        target="http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/">
                        http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/</ref>). As open source
                    implementations of Webkit continue to fork and diverge from the original source
                    code, the aesthetics of the web will undoubtedly remain heterogeneous. In short,
                    the culture of experimental presentation and endless versioning is built into
                    the very fabric of the web. </p>
                <p> Due to this variability, digitizing Foer’s text for the purposes of citation or
                    distribution requires an acceptance that such an intermedial versioning will
                    generate errors, gaps, and an experience of loss. Because any reproduction must
                    fall within the auspices of academic fair use and not violate the terms of
                    Foer’s copyright, this task represents a departure from many digital humanities
                    prototyping or archiving activities. Perhaps more significantly, Foer’s text
                    fulfills the theory and practice of Zola’s description of experimental
                    literature as the performance of modification. The experimental text, Zola
                    insists, must <quote rend="inline" source="#zola1893">show the mechanism</quote>
                    of its manufacture to modify the seeming stability of the form. This formal
                    modification is not a passive lens through which one language or mode of
                    communication is interpreted. It is a supplementary text that negotiates between
                    media contexts. For example, the <q>find</q> function that allows users to
                    search for words within a single page becomes a powerful tool to read
                        <emph>through</emph> this prototype. Because all modern browsers have this
                    functionality, it is possible to drill through a text and mine for word
                    frequency and position. Searching for <q>father</q> reveals eight instances of
                    the word and are numerically significant given the small sample size, but their
                    placement in three dimensions allows readers to assess the physical structure of
                    text in addition to iteration.</p>

                <head>A Deeply Humanistic Way of Knowing</head>
                <p> Due to the experiential nature of using a prototype to explore a text,
                    unanticipated results can lurk within the code and are often exposed only by
                    making and using the digital version. There is a tension between the
                    experiential discovery of making and prototyping and forms of large scale text
                    analysis. In the context of Ramsay’s <q>algorithmic analysis</q> and Franco
                    Moretti’s <q>distant reading,</q> the digital humanities offers a promise to
                    lessen the labor of humanistic inquiry and distance the human reader from the
                    initial experience of the text. Michael Witmore first made the connection
                    between this aim and certain strains of philosophy in a blog post. The so-called
                    speculative realists — led by Alan Badiou, Quentin Meillassoux, and Graham
                    Harman — have found that the absolute meaning and clarity afforded by the
                    analytic tools of mathematics and computer science has produced a viable
                    alternative to a metaphysics predicated on a correlation between language,
                    thinking, and being. This brand of realist philosophy draws its inspiration in
                    part from a long tradition of experimental literature that identifies the
                    tension between the literary experience and generalizing literary meaning
                    through number. In <title rend="italic">The Number and the Siren </title>(2012),
                    Meillassoux works to <quote rend="inline" source="#meillassoux2012">bring to
                        light a procedure of <emph>encryption</emph></quote> housed within Stéphane
                    Mallarmé’s <title rend="italic">Coup de dés </title>
                    <ptr target="#meillassoux2012" loc="3"/>. This is a text, Meillassoux claims,
                    that can and must be read algorithmically. The text’s procedure, once
                    deciphered, allows the precise determination of the <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#meillassoux2012"><q>unique Number</q>
                            enigmatically evoked in the poem</quote>
                        <ptr target="#meillassoux2012" loc="3"/>
                    </cit>. By contrast, the individual experience of the direction and production
                    of light offers a significant change in the meaning of <title rend="italic">Tree
                        of Codes</title>. In Foer’s print version, the text has shadows and
                    gradients of light and visibility — and therefore intelligibility — that the
                    digital version does not quite simulate. The screen itself is the source of
                    light and the <soCalled>shadows</soCalled> are a product of the linear-gradient
                    function. It is the interaction design — or even the highly constructed user
                    experience of the paper book — that allows for leaps in logic and meaning to be
                    read — quite literally — <emph>through</emph> the work. Mallarmé’s <title
                        rend="italic">Un Coup de Des</title> (1914) is, of course, a direct
                    precedent for this blocking of text that is set in a visual and spacial array,
                    but Foer’s text resists algorithmic analysis despite their formal similarities.
                    Visual or aesthetic similarity does not always guarantee similar meaning. So,
                    while Mallarmé’s poem differs greatly from <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes</title>, Foer’s rewriting of Schulz through a process of redaction has
                    been taken up more recently in Michalais Pichler’s version of <title
                        rend="italic">Un Coup de Des </title> (2008). In this formal gesture of
                    emptying out the text, he rewrote the original text by masking the text in a
                    constellation of black bars. As a visual statement about omission and the chance
                    erasure of texts — whether they are incriminating official documents or poetry —
                    reworking and often annihilating past texts in this way makes comments on the
                    state of the historical record and memory in general. So, while Meillassoux
                    celebrates the loss of human experience even as Pichler and Foer demand it, the
                    loss of our direct experience of a text represents a powerful new motif within
                    21st century experimental literature.</p>
                <p> Through a kind of tactile encryption that resists algorithmic methods, Foer’s
                    novel echoes the linking and layering of digital texts and becomes a kind of
                    paper correlate of hypertextuality. I find it surprising, therefore, when
                    literary journalists cast <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes </title>as an <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kachka2010">object of anti-technology</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kachka2010"/>
                    </cit>. In a <title rend="italic">New York Magazine</title> interview, Foer put
                    the issue of physicality like this: <quote rend="inline" source="#kachka2010"
                        >It’s a way of remembering something about books,</quote> he says. <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kachka2010">I think there’s going to be
                            something that happens now, where books move in two directions, one
                            toward digitized formats and one toward remembering what’s nice about
                            the physicality of them</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kachka2010"/>
                    </cit>. In an earlier <title rend="italic">Vanity Fair</title> interview held
                    with Heather Wagner, Foer describes the early inception of the novel by saying, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#wagner2010">I started thinking about what
                            books look like, what they will look like, how the form of the book is
                            changing very quickly. If we don’t give it a lot of thought, it won’t be
                            for the better. There is an alternative to e-books. And I just love the
                            physicality of books. I love breaking the spine, smelling the pages,
                            taking it into the bath. . .</quote>
                        <ptr target="#wagner2010"/>
                    </cit>. Later in the interview with Wagner, Foer is sure to say that he is no
                    iconoclast and does not want to be perceived as rejecting the digitization of
                    literature. Instead, he describes his motivations by saying, <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#wagner2010">I love the notion that <q>this is a book
                            that remembers it has a body.</q> When a book remembers, we remember. It
                        reminds you that you have a body. So many of the things we may think of as
                        burdensome are actually the things that make us more human</quote>
                    <ptr target="#wagner2010"/>. Foer continues his use of the metaphor of the
                    embodied text in a <title rend="italic">New York Times</title> interview with
                    Steven Heller when he says, <quote rend="inline" source="#heller2010">On the
                        brink of the end of paper, I was attracted to the idea of a book that can’t
                        forget it has a body</quote>
                    <ptr target="#heller2010"/>. The book, for Foer, has an important historical
                    function that digital technologies have difficulty simulating. There is no
                    digital metaphor for smell. They cannot simulate wear and tear. How do you water
                    stain an iPad without voiding its warranty? They do not collect marginal
                    comments, pressed flowers, or old train tickets. Indeed, the closest analogy
                    print has for deleting an ebook is to burn it. While Foer’s thoughts on the
                    status of the printed codex betray his paper bias, his thinking about print has
                    become saturated in a reaction to digital media. His concern for print books is
                    fundamentally inflected by digital culture, and his resistance to digital media
                    has become a reciprocal exchange. </p>
                <p> This reciprocal relationship is also shaping common conceptions of history and
                    memory. In the drive to digitize and archive paper texts for the purposes of
                    faster access and safe storage, it is also becoming increasingly difficult to
                    forget or lose digital footprints and works of literature alike. With the
                    degradation of electronic files through bit-rot notwithstanding, <title
                        rend="italic">Tree of Codes </title> implicitly argues that loss has meaning
                    that is valuable and is a crucial aspect of human life; the loss that is
                    experienced through any digitization attempt is a means of accessing this type
                    of meaning. In the words of Matthew Kirschenbaum in <title rend="italic"
                        >Mechanisms </title>, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#kirschenbaum2008">Versions are the textual
                            differences that make a difference</quote>
                        <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2008" loc="188"/>
                    </cit>. By borrowing the language of programming tools, versioned code makes for
                    easier debugging and helps facilitate backup throughout the development process.
                    Comparing versions between media is a fundamental function of the digital
                    humanities’ ethos of thinking through making. However, versioning was designed
                    precisely to have a perfect record of code development. Therefore, by following
                    Kirschenbaum’s play on the word, there is a paradox within the heart of digital
                    humanities methodology. Creating a digital version preserves documents while
                    also resulting in a loss of certain kinds of medium specific meaning. <title
                        rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title> offers an experience of versioning loss.
                    It is an experimental text that demands an experimental methodology, and it is a
                    material text that gestures to the digital in a way that offers an experience of
                    loss at the heart of the story. The text implicitly asks its readers to consider

                    The history of the Holocaust and of the Jewish diaspora is never far from Foer’s
                    writing. In the context of Schulz’s life and the precarious position of his
                    oeuvre as it emerged from post-war Europe, his books come to embody the
                    fragility of paper in Foer’s hands. </p>
                <p> The nuance and detail demanded of any reading of <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes</title> must be situated within the history and life of Schulz. In the
                    afterword to <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes</title>, Foer supplies his
                    readers with an account of Schulz’s death: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#foer2010">Felix Landau, a Gestapo officer in
                            charge of the Jewish labor force in Drohobycz, became aware of Schulz’s
                            talents as a draughtsman, and directed Schulz to paint murals on the
                            walls of his child’s playroom</quote>
                        <ptr target="#foer2010" loc="138"/>
                    </cit>. Though kept like something of a pet, Landau was only able to save
                    Schulz’s life until November, 1942. Schulz had obtained falsified papers and was
                    planning to escape, when a Gestapo sergeant named Karl Günter decided take
                    revenge for Landau’s earlier murder of his Jewish dentist. The common account,
                    which Foer relates in his afterword, is that Günter told Landau, <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#foer2010">You killed my Jew. Now I’ve killed
                        yours</quote><ptr target="#foer2010" loc="138"/>. All that remains of
                    Schulz’s reportedly great artistic output of stories and drawings can be
                    assembled into a single volume. The two surviving short story collections,
                        <title rend="italic">The Street of Crocodiles </title>and <title
                        rend="italic">Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass,</title> are all
                    that remain of his writing, despite having entrusted a single copy of a larger
                    manuscript entitled simply <title rend="italic">Messiah </title>to non-Jewish
                    friends. This manuscript remains lost to history. Yet, this profoundly affecting
                    story is not entirely settled. In the wake of the war, historians were eager to
                    claim great artists and tragic figures as part of a coherent narrative of
                    antisemitism and a unified Jewish identity to justify the establishment of
                    Israel. Brian R. Banks describes the conflicted claims placed upon Schulz’s
                    ethnic, religious, and racial identities in this fraught political arena: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#banks2006">Yes he was of Jewish blood but also
                            an aggregate of Polish blood (significantly he sought to flee west not
                            to east at the end) and also Drohobycz blood (which he could not flee)
                            in the sense of being the landscape of his life, merged with a
                            profoundly artistic spirit that does not necessarily exclude forms of
                            personal faith borne out by the scattered scriptural metaphors</quote>
                        <ptr target="#banks2006" loc="257"/>
                    </cit>. Banks argues that Schulz’s national and religious identity was so
                    locally situated that he could hardly stand in for these global events. Indeed,
                    Banks goes so far as to claim that Schulz was not even killed primarily because
                    of his ethnicity but <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#banks2006">due to a personal rivalry between
                            murderers who enjoyed legitimacy for their barbarism</quote>
                        <ptr target="#banks2006" loc="258"/>
                    </cit>. The casualness of his murder emphasizes the profound sense of loss
                    throughout <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes,</title> but this casualness also
                    demands a certain fastidiousness or attention to detail in Schulz’s memory.
                    Recently, however, the murals painted in Schulz’s distinctive style were
                    retrieved from the original cottage in which they were painted for Landau and
                    his children, but an Israeli documentary film team had taken them to Israel with
                    a great deal of controversy in 2001. They were exhibited in Jerusalem’s Yad
                    Vashem Holocaust Museum in 2009 despite Polish protests (Bronner). Repatriating
                    these works to unify the history of the Holocaust demands a critical attention
                    to context and a kind of citationality that finds these works in a radically
                    different context from which they were originally conceived. </p>
                <p> The fragility of his life and the fragility of his literature is a testament to
                    the problems of ever maintaining an accurate historical record and the
                    provisional nature of any text. And yet, it is literature and the book that
                    functions as an imaginative canvas against which the very definition of literary
                    art and literary history is expressed. For example, the story that opens
                    Schulz’s <title rend="italic">Sanatorium </title>collection is entitled simply
                        <title rend="quotes">The Book</title> and relishes the childish wonder of
                    reading. In the story, the book is a near magical object: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#schulz2008"> the wind would rustle through its
                            pages and the pictures would rise. And as the windswept pages were
                            turned, merging the colors and shapes, a shiver ran through the columns
                            of text, freeing from among the letters flocks of swallows and larks.
                            Page after page floated in the air and gently saturated the landscape
                            with brightness. At other times, The Book lay still and the wind opened
                            it softly like a huge cabbage rose; the petals, one by one, eyelid under
                            eyelid, all blind, velvety, and dreamy, slowly disclosed a blue pupil, a
                            colored peacock’s heart or a chattering nest of hummingbirds. </quote>

                    </cit> He has often been called the Polish Kafka, but comparisons to Borges are
                    equally appropriate. Schulz's vision of the book of life — or a living book —
                    shares similarities to Borges's <title rend="quotes">Library of Babel</title> or
                        <title rend="quotes">Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertus.</title> In such a context,
                    it is not unreasonable for <title rend="italic">The Street of Crocodiles</title>
                    to metamorphose through the wear and tear of time and the unforeseen losses of
                    history into <title rend="italic">Tree of Codes.</title> For Schulz and Foer,
                    the form of the book is the very source of imagination that springs from the
                    pages of literary art. The book is both animate and inanimate, alive and also
                    skirting with oblivion. </p>
                <p>While these existential metaphors of literature and life are also at home in the
                    new forms of natively digital literature and the aesthetics of the web, it
                    remains important to maintain that such motifs continue to draw a tradition from
                    the book. Beyond any one sided appeal by designers and developers to reshape
                    reading, the artistic and historical foundations of literature’s place in
                    expressing something inherently human remain. Foer gestures towards our bookish
                    past when he says, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#foer2010">we / find ourselves / part of the /
                            tree / of / cod / es /. Reality is as thin as paper / . / only a small
                            section / immediately before us / is / able / to endure</quote>
                        <ptr target="#foer2010" loc="92–3"/>
                    </cit>. What is lost in such a citation? If the relationship between old and new
                    media is reciprocal, the meaning of such an imperfect citation turns doubly
                    through valences of experimentation and authority. A Polish author, lost during
                    the horrors of WWII and translated into English, has continued to make meaning
                    by physically removing his words. The text continues to be cited and versioned
                    again and again. The original text moves further from its original context, but
                    it continues to speak to the theme of loss through a process of citing,
                    versioning, digitizing, prototyping, and making. Like Schulz’s surviving texts
                    and images, the preservation of this material history defines the enormity of
                    the challenge facing digital technology as a historical medium. Jerome McGann’s
                    reminder, in <title rend="italic">Radiant Textuality</title> (2004), that <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#mcgann2001">the literature we inherit (to this date)
                        is and will always be bookish</quote> may be inverted to accept the
                    possibility that print publishing will become — in some respects — digital <ptr
                        target="#mcgann2001" loc="168"/>. If experimental fiction can be a useful
                    yardstick to measure digital humanities scholarship and model new types of
                    digital texts, these new print prototypes, like <title rend="italic">Tree of
                        Codes,</title> are less about resisting digital technology and more about
                    pushing digital technology further with lessons from the past. As Elizabeth
                    Eisenstein’s vision of print history argues, the printing press has long been an
                    agent of social and political change, but it is also becoming a tool of
                    technological critique. As a prototype of the possibilities of print, <title
                        rend="italic">Tree of Codes </title>is a reminder that digital publishing
                    platforms must find a way to incorporate the historical and formally creative
                    functions of literature. If an experimental remediation from one medium to
                    another represents the history and experience of loss, the methodology of
                    thinking through making may have found its ethical purpose. The loss of meaning
                    through digitization may simply represent an extension of a long tradition of,
                    in Kirschenbaum’s words, <cit>
