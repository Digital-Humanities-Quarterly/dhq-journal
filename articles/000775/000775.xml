            <p><title rend="italic">Digital Codicology: Medieval Books and Modern Labor</title> 
               (2022) by <name>Bridget Whearty</name> is a crucial work for scholars engaging 
               with digitized materials. Advocating for a digital codicology that treats digital 
               materials as objects worthy of study in their own right, <name>Whearty</name> 
               addresses the many concerns surrounding digital manuscripts and promotes a more 
               active, informed use of these resources. She highlights the often invisible 
               human labor behind digitization, providing a detailed history and 
               autoethnographic insights that challenge the perception of digital manuscripts 
               as mere stand-ins for physical texts. Through personal experiences and 
               institutional analysis, <name>Whearty</name> delves into the complexities of 
               interoperability and the labor-intensive processes behind digitization and 
               metadata curation. Her book emphasizes the emotional and intellectual engagement 
               digital manuscripts can provoke, advocating for broad digitization and 
               recognizing the dynamic nature of digital projects. Ultimately, 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Codicology</title> calls for greater transparency, 
               collaboration, and a redefined understanding of digital manuscripts as integral 
               primary sources in modern scholarship.

               spotlights the intellectual, human labor behind every digitized manuscript,

            <p><title rend="italic">Digital Codicology: Medieval Books and Modern Labor</title> 
               is an essential read for anyone who finds themselves making regular use of 
               digitized materials, in particular anyone who feels uneasy with the digital turn 
               and anyone who may doubt the intellectual merits of remediating premodern texts 
               for digital users <ptr target="#whearty2022"/>. <name>Bridget Whearty</name> 
               confronts anxieties around digital manuscripts by pushing her readers to become 
               active users, writing: <quote rend="block">One persistent concern I have heard 
               voiced about digital manuscripts is <emph>but what if they</emph> — it is 
               unclear in these complaints who <q>they</q> might be — <emph>are messing with 
               the images I use?</emph> My answer is that they are. Or might be. And if so, they 
               likely have good, mission-oriented reasons for doing so. If you want and need to 
               know, you can, and should, find out. <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="162"/></quote> 
               Responsible scholarship in the digital age means recognizing the invisible hands 
               of digital labor and understanding the structural choices shaping sources. 
               <name>Whearty</name> provides an insightful history of the development of 
               manuscript digitization, and her autoethnographic approach will make readers 
               reexamine their own practices and reevaluate the intellectual and physical labor 
               that is the silent backbone of all digital repositories. Broken up into a preface, 
               introduction, four chapters, a coda, and an appendix, <title rend="italic">Digital 
               Codicology</title> offers a scope ranging from the personal — as 
               <name>Whearty</name> recounts her firsthand experiences in digitization and 
               metadata curation — to the structural — as she demystifies institutional 
               workflows, their long histories, their rationales, and how they operate (or don't) 
               across institutional borders. The case studies of <title rend="italic">Digital 
               Codicology</title> are centered upon material from late medieval Western 
               <name>Europe</name>, but — as <name>Whearty</name> notes — her methods are 
               <quote rend="inline">transferable</quote> to all disciplines that make use of 
               digital artifacts <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="235"/>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Whearty</name> defends the idea that the digital is no less human or 
               sensory than the material and even gently teases the way in which scholarship 
               suddenly began fetishizing material books as a result of <quote rend="inline">the 
               perceived threat of media extinction</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="12"/>. 
               She dismisses the notion that bookish objects lacking in the same sensory data as 
               the material book are incapable of provoking human attachment, and she advocates 
               for the broad digitization of more everyday copies, not only out of purely 
               intellectual rationales but also out of love. In reference to the emotional pull 
               of her work digitizing Stanford University Libraries MSS Codex M0379, 
               <name>Whearty</name> insists, <quote rend="inline">All digital manuscripts are 
               made by real people, each with their own intellectual <emph>and</emph> affective 
               responses to the objects of their labor. Even in the midst of workflows that 
               emphasize systematic digitization, human elements and human emotions remain</quote> 
               <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="53"/>. But although she argues that digital 
               manuscripts are equally capable of provoking emotional responses, a cornerstone of 
               <name>Whearty</name>'s argument is the fact that digital manuscripts are certainly 
               not the same as their hard-copy counterparts. She writes: 
               <quote rend="inline">Pixels can represent parchment but they cannot 
               <emph>become</emph> it</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="12"/>. Yet, it is 
               not enough to say what digital manuscripts are <emph>not</emph>, and digital 
               codicology fills this gap. We need a <emph>digital</emph> codicology to fully 
               appreciate this new medium, <quote rend="inline">to understand what digital 
               manuscripts are, as well as the fears and expectations that swirl around 
               them</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="9"/>. Treating digital manuscripts as 
               primary sources, and not merely as <q>stand-ins</q> or <q>replacements</q>, allows 
               for a more careful consideration of their use in scholarship, of the institutional 
               constraints that shape them, and the labor required for their production and 
               maintenance <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="37"/>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Whearty</name> weaves together the intricate threads of medieval manuscript 
               copying and modern manuscript digitization, shedding light on the labor-intensive 
               processes of the latter which are too often obscured in the digital age. Building 
               on <name>Jay David Bolter</name> and <name>Richard Grusin</name>'s 
               <title rend="italic">Remediation</title>, <name>Whearty</name> insists on the 
               presence of the human in the digital: <quote rend="inline">The digital presents 
               itself as immaterial, unmediated, unproduced by human laborers. But that is a 
               lie. Humans are always there. They always have been</quote> 
               <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="120"/>. To counteract any concealment of the 
               human in the digital, <name>Whearty</name> urges end users to recognize the labor 
               embedded in digital books. More than that, <name>Whearty</name> insists that the 
               creative and intellectual qualities medievalists often attribute to medieval 
               scribes must also be attributed to modern copyists even <quote rend="inline">when 
               the tools of the copyist move from stylus and parchment to computer and 
               camera</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="79"/>. Drawing parallels between 
               the work of digitizers and medieval copyists, she emphasizes the skilled labor 
               involved and underscores the physical and mental gruel of creating digital 
               preservation copies, calling the work of digitization a 
               <quote rend="inline">dance</quote> and an <quote rend="inline">anchoritic</quote> 
               discipline <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="66, 56"/>. <name>Whearty</name> invites 
               a reconsideration of the erasure of copyists in both medieval and digital 
               contexts, ultimately envisioning a future where that erasure is overcome.
            </p>
            <p><name>Whearty</name> likewise makes clear the need for digital codicology on a 
               large scale as she explores the intricate challenge of interoperability in 
               merging manuscript metadata across digital infrastructures via <q>crosswalks</q>. 
               She emphasizes the broad lack of interoperability within manuscript studies, 
               citing problems such as the absence of universally standardized terms for 
               concepts as essential as how to refer to the <quote rend="inline">processed 
               animal skins upon which many Western European manuscripts are written</quote> 
               <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="172"/>. As a whole, <title rend="italic">Digital 
               Codicology</title> makes clear the need for large-scale collaboration to tackle 
               these major concerns, but <name>Whearty</name>'s autoethnographic approach keeps 
               the issue concretely grounded in the personal and the human. 
               <name>Whearty</name>'s account of her postdoc work on the DMS-Index — a project 
               which was ultimately <quote rend="inline">shuttered</quote> — models the mix of 
               humility and determination scholars must adopt in addressing interoperability 
               collectively <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="205"/>. As she writes, 
               <quote rend="inline">I hoped, fiercely, that in the next iteration of DMS-Index 
               a new, more skilled contributor would come along to correct my errors and improve 
               my work</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="204"/>. <name>Whearty</name> 
               makes clear how the decisions we make now must be made in the service of the 
               future of the field and how we must not be afraid to make mistakes as we face 
               such new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, <name>Whearty</name> underscores the valuable lessons that may be 
               gleaned from failed digital projects. She challenges traditional notions of 
               success and failure, emphasizing the continuous, evolving nature of digital 
               manuscripts and their repositories. <name>Whearty</name> insists that failure 
               itself is not a problem but that hiding failures and even small error corrections 
               without making such changes obvious to users is the true problem, as that hidden 
               mutability breeds distrust and a <quote rend="inline">crisis of 
               authenticity</quote> in digital resources <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="228"/>. 
               In the same way that hidden changes to data and code contributes to the ongoing 
               reproducibility crisis in hard sciences, silent alterations to digital materials 
               can leave humanities researchers who are reliant on these resources unsure of the 
               validity of their own work and that of their peers. <name>Whearty</name> 
               acknowledges the unfortunate impracticality of trying to preserve every little 
               modification and error for posterity, noting, <quote rend="inline">Server space 
               is finite. Curation is not the same as hoarding. Not everything can — or should 
               — be saved</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="230"/>. But as the cost of 
               digital storage continues to decline and as storage methods continue to improve, 
               particularly through solutions like distributed version control systems, saving 
               records of modifications for posterity should not just be a worthy goal but 
               standard practice. Much like medieval copyists who were responsible for 
               preserving human knowledge through the production and distribution of local 
               copies, distributed version control systems like Git prevent data loss and reduce 
               strains on local storage via a peer-to-peer approach, as opposed to a 
               client-server approach. While the digital age promises such expanded research 
               possibilities, <name>Whearty</name> recognizes the persistence of gaps and data 
               loss as problems that have plagued record keeping since well before digitization, 
               writing, <quote rend="inline">Lost books and destroyed files <emph>are</emph> the 
               long history of medieval manuscripts</quote> 
               <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="118"/>.
            </p>
            <p>In the meantime, <name>Whearty</name> proposes practical solutions such as the 
               widespread adoption of version control systems through methods as simple as 
               giving digital manuscripts version numbers, emphasizing the importance of visible 
               records, and preserving errors and glitches to maintain authenticity and 
               transparency in curation practices <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="231–232"/>. 
               <name>Whearty</name> advocates for a shift in perspective, viewing digital 
               projects not merely as completed data but as dynamic <quote rend="inline">raw 
               materials that are passed on to the future, an archive of labor, into which 
               someone may yet breathe new, unexpected life</quote> 
               <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="211"/>. She suggests that openly addressing 
               project failures, errors, and glitches contributes to collective knowledge, 
               preventing not just the reinvention of wheels but especially of 
               <quote rend="inline">broken wheels</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="207"/>.
            </p>
            <p>Another major area of concern for <name>Whearty</name> is accessibility, which 
               for the purposes of <title rend="italic">Digital Codicology</title> she limits to 
               mean accessibility <quote rend="inline">in the senses used by archivists and 
               librarians</quote> about the ability to locate and retrieve information, 
               redirecting readers who may be concerned with <quote rend="inline">equal 
               engagement by users with disabilities</quote> to publications by <name>Donna 
               McCrea</name>, <name>Wendy Walker</name> and <name>Teressa Keenan</name>, and 
               <name>Kathryn Wymer</name> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="38"/>. 
               <name>Whearty</name> emphasizes discoverability as a pivotal component of 
               accessibility, underscoring that knowledge of a manuscript's existence and 
               relevance to one's line of inquiry is fundamental before one can even think of 
               laying hands on it <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="163"/>. Furthermore, she 
               highlights the pedagogical value of accessible digitized manuscripts, which 
               serve as <quote rend="inline">a doorway in for new users</quote> and provide 
               essential skills like paleography for students 
               <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="94"/>. Contrary to what many may fear, digital 
               collections act as a <quote rend="inline">gateway</quote> to archives, not as a 
               substitute for them <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="94"/>. In essence, 
               <name>Whearty</name> argues for a broader view of accessibility, encompassing 
               various levels of engagement in both physical reading rooms and online 
               repositories.
            </p>
            <p>But one area of inquiry that is too briefly addressed is the relationship between 
               increasing digital accessibility and current editing practices. 
               <name>Whearty</name> cites <name>Maureen Jameson</name>, who asserts that mass 
               digitization <quote rend="inline">fundamentally changes the status of the editor 
               or paleographer… whose judgements are now exposed to wider scrutiny</quote> (qtd. 
               in <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="166"/>), but she does not address the 
               implications of broad accessibility to digital manuscripts on current editing 
               practices with much depth, keeping her focus primarily on digitization and 
               metadata curation. In Chapter 1, <name>Whearty</name> does suggest that editing 
               and digitization are both acts of compositing — of combining several source 
               elements to produce a single final product — but for <name>Whearty</name>, the 
               act of compositing is much more obscured from the viewer of the digital manuscript 
               than it is from the reader of a modern print edition, and so, best practices 
               concerning digital manuscripts are in greater need of immediate attention and 
               reform. <name>Whearty</name> also demonstrates the ways in which editors of 
               premodern texts are careful to produce editions that are as true as possible to 
               their source material through her analysis of a late nineteenth-century edition of 
               a <name>Hoccleve</name> manuscript, but she otherwise leaves the issue of editing 
               in the wake of the digital turn outside of the purview of 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Codicology</title>, leaving the door open for others 
               to consider this matter elsewhere <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="111"/>.
            </p>
            <p><name>Whearty</name> leaves readers with one last compelling case for reforming 
               the ways we approach digital manuscripts and their metadata, 
               <quote rend="inline">...when you use digital manuscripts and you cite them 
               honestly, you are helping make a case for present and future investment, for the 
               ongoing maintenance of the digital collections upon which your — and our — 
               collective work depends</quote> <ptr target="#whearty2022" loc="240"/>. 
               Underscoring the responsibility of users to contribute to the ongoing maintenance 
               and development of digital collections, <name>Whearty</name> calls on her readers 
               to be more rigorous, more curious, more humble, and less afraid. Whether by means 
               of analog or digital copy, readers will come away from 
               <title rend="italic">Digital Codicology</title> better equipped for the reading 
               rooms of our increasingly virtual field.
