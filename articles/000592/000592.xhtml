                  <p>This essay offers a case study of the ZHI project, a digital craftsmanship project
                     showcasing the beauty of traditional craftsmanship at three levels: knowing, making,
                     and
                     intelligence. The project began with a Designer Residency Program and was developed
                     to
                     answer three crucial questions: (1) How could we bridge the gap between enthusiastic
                     outsiders and little-known creators of intangible cultural heritage? (2) How could
                     we
                     help students understand and participate in craftwork? and (3) How could we facilitate
                     sustainable knowledge production about intangible cultural heritage among the audiences,
                     students, and craftsmen so everyone benefits and contributes? The ZHI project uses
                     minimal computing strategies to encourage craftspeople to pass their skills and
                     knowledge onto others, particularly younger generations, through digitization and
                     online
                     exhibitions that use minimal computing practices. The project provides user-friendly,
                     accessible information to researchers and craftspeople who do not possess expensive
                     digital equipment or high-level technical skills. This offers them opportunities to
                     virtually present their craft and research, share knowledge, and tell their own stories
                     to audiences unfamiliar with craftsmanship. </p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In 2003, UNESCO established their Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), “to
                     ensure better visibility of the intangible cultural heritage and awareness of its
                     significance, and to encourage dialogue which respects cultural diversity” (UNESCO
                     2003). Subsequently, the Chinese government launched a national campaign to promote
                     the
                     recognition, discovery, and conservation of ICH. As a result, 42 types of ICH in China
                     have been added to the UNESCO list and China is the country with the highest number
                     of
                     ICH elements on the list as of December 2020.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e310">[1]</a> The
                     national and local governments in China consider the conservation and promotion of
                     ICH
                     to be crucial to enhancing national identity, amplifying cultural heritage, raising
                     consciousness about the need to protect cultural heritage, and promoting Chinese culture
                     both domestically and internationally. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">High-performance technology was promoted as an important method for the conservation
                     and
                     distribution of ICH. Many IT companies are used to working with museums to digitize
                     ICH.
                     While it is important to promote ICH to broad audiences, high-performance technology
                     requires technical skills and equipment that bear high costs. Moreover, it is crucial
                     to
                     work directly with craftspeople to better understand the goals and outcomes of
                     conservation. Our work on ZHI: A Digital Project of Traditional Craftsmanship, developed
                     by graduate students at Nanjing University’s School of Arts, offers an alternative
                     that
                     incorporates minimal computing technologies and direct collaboration with creators
                     of
                     ICH. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The project began with our Designer Residency Program, developed in 2017 to bring
                     together designers, craftspeople, non-governmental organization (NGO) workers, and
                     administrators from cultural institutions. As we visited local studios and interviewed
                     designers and craftspeople, we sought to understand the obstacles to digitally
                     preserving and transmitting knowledge about craftsmanship in Nanjing. What became
                     clear
                     is that it was impractical to launch a multi-year training program to share Nanjing’s
                     ICH with amateurs or hobbyists. Seeking alternatives, we interviewed designers,
                     craftspeople, students, and potential audiences interested in learning more about
                     craftsmanship. We further explored digital technologies that would be user-friendly
                     and
                     economical for preserving ICH. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">This research led to even more questions. How could we bridge the gap between
                     enthusiastic consumers and the little-known creators of ICH? How could we create
                     opportunities for students to learn about and contribute to craftwork? How could we
                     facilitate a sustainable process of knowledge production about ICH among the audiences,
                     students, and craftsmen so everyone benefited and had opportunities to contribute?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">To answer these questions, we developed ZHI, a digital craftsmanship project.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e334">[2]</a> As indicated in the name, this project
                     establishes a model of knowing and making to strengthen knowledge production on
                     craftsmanship in the digital era. ZHI is dedicated to showcasing the beauty of
                     traditional craftsmanship at three levels — knowing, making, and intelligence — and
                     providing sources of imagination and cultural roots for contemporary hobbyists. As
                     a
                     shareable network supported by the community, it aims to provide a user-friendly,
                     knowledge-based, and accessible website for both craftspeople who do not possess
                     expensive digital equipment and experienced skills and young researchers and to
                     virtually present their craft or research, share their knowledge, and tell their stories
                     to audiences who may only know a little about the craftsmanship.</div>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">According to UNESCO’s 2003 Convention, ICH connotes the “practices, representations,
                     expressions, knowledge, and know-how, transmitted from generation to generation within
                     communities, created and transformed continuously by them, depending on the environment
                     and their interaction with nature and history” [<a class="ref" href="#unesco2011">UNESCO 2011</a>, 4]. Its importance lies in
                     the way it “adapts permanently to the present and constitutes cultural capital that can
                     be a powerful driver for development. Food security, health, education, sustainable
                     use
                     of natural resources — intangible cultural heritage is a wealth of knowledge to be
                     used
                     in many aspects of life” [<a class="ref" href="#unesco2011">UNESCO 2011</a>, 4]. Rather than emphasizing historical value,
                     unique places, or material objects, ICH focuses on the “living” status of heritage in
                     the communities; ensuring it can be known, learned, and transmitted from
                     generation-to-generation and thus remain alive; and the human spirit that lies in
                     communities that provides a sense of identity that promotes broader cultural and social
                     effects. Starting from the understanding of ICH as “living heritage,” we adopted three
                     key concepts to develop a sustainable model to help practitioners share the knowledge
                     and skills of ICH. From the process of making and producing digital twins of ICH,
                     supported technically by the strategies of “minimal computing” — that is, using
                     accessible technologies — we designed a flexible website to showcase the knowledges,
                     communities, and aesthetic values of ICH. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In the case of the ZHI project, digitization of craftsmanship is not simply duplicating
                     products, but a process of making “digital twins,” a term used by Michael Grieves to
                     describe “a virtual representation of what has been produced” in his project for his
                     Product Lifestyle Management Development Consortium. Grieves suggests one could,
                     “Compare a Digital Twin to its engineering design to better understand what was produced
                     versus what was designed, tightening the loop between design and execution” [<a class="ref" href="#grieves2015">Grieves 2015</a>]. 
                     By adopting and applying the term “digital twins” to cultural heritage,
                     Pierre-André Jouan and Pierre Hallot indicate that implementing digital twins for
                     the
                     management and preservation of cultural heritage assets would assist with data
                     collection and management for cultural heritage, which will in turn provide initial
                     and
                     long-term support for the conservation of cultural heritage. This all relies on the
                     value attributed to the form of cultural heritage, while evaluation of that value
                     itself
                     depends on data preservation [<a class="ref" href="#jouan2019">Jouan and Hallot 2019</a>]. In this sense, the ZHI project
                     considers digitization, data collection, and analysis as a process of making digital
                     twins of craftsmanship. This process requires knowledge about material, the skill
                     of
                     making, the emotion and time required, and the use of proper equipment. The outcomes
                     —
                     physical product and digital content — are interdependent and complement each other.
                     Under the principle of making-as-knowing, digitization, data collection, and analysis
                     provide an epistemological approach to the knowledge of craftsmanship and its virtual
                     representations. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Emphasizing the principle of living heritage, we take the sustainable production of
                     knowledge as the core of the ZHI project to encourage craftspeople to pass their skills
                     and knowledge onto others, particularly younger generations, through digitization
                     and

                     how
                     to make things by drawing on their skills, it is difficult for them to convert the
                     knowledge that they learned from their practical experiences into what Ulrich Lehmann
                     calls a systematic “knowledge shape.” Lehman notes this difficulty:</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">If making is knowing, it doesn’t follow that all makers “know” their crafts. They might
                     know how to produce an effective, economical, or detailed result. But this does not
                     mean
                     that they can change completely, reverse, or deconstruct their techne in such a way
                     as
                     to challenge established thinking about this craft [<a class="ref" href="#lehmann2012">Lehmann 2012</a>, 151].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Lehmann reminds us that Plato and Aristotle’s metaphorical expression of the distinction
                     between “knowledge” and “techne” universalized and empowered making processes, such as
                     weaving and clothes-making. These are epistemological processes of knowledge production
                     that go “beyond material creation, and thus constitute[s] conceptual knowledge” [<a class="ref" href="#lehmann2012">Lehmann 2012</a>, 151]. 
                     Following Lehmann, epistemology is not just about the conditions of
                     knowledge origins, its structures, and limits, but more importantly the creation,
                     distribution, and consumption processes. Lehmann’s study of pleated fabrics in the
                     contest of fashion context illustrates his argument, but his analysis is largely analog,
                     not digital. Yet, he raises crucial questions that are pertinent to our digital work:

                     a “research and pedagogical initiative in the Center for Science and Society at Columbia
                     University that explores the intersections between artistic making and scientific
                     knowing,” where craftspeople represent their skills and knowledge through their own
                     voices and stories [<a class="ref" href="#making2021">The Making and Knowing Project 2021</a>]. While our project emphasizes the
                     role of digital technology in the conservation of cultural heritage, the Making and
                     Knowing Project provides a research-driven model of pedagogy by creating an open-access
                     digital critical edition of an anonymous French manuscript through text- and
                     object-based research and hands-on reconstruction. Students not only reconstruct 16th-
                     and 17th-century culinary recipes but also collect data and record the acquisition
                     process through field notes; this illuminates the making-as-knowing process as students
                     undertake working processes similar to those of artists or craftspeople. What they
                     have
                     explored and examined, as presented on the project’s website, fills the missing spots
                     in
                     the historical documents: students have decoded and brought tacit components of
                     knowledge back to the surface from the deeply encoded texts in the 16th and 17th
                     centuries through their digital representations and the work of remediation. The
                     students’ digital engagements transform tacit knowledge of the early modern period
                     into
                     comprehensible common knowledge, bringing insights from the early modern period to

                     ZHI project invited the craftspeople to work with the undergraduate and graduate
                     students. During the collaboration process, craftspeople learned to use language that
                     young people understand to explain the tacit knowledge behind the texts and objects.
                     Students also needed to learn how to use texts, images, and videos — the digital content
                     that represents not only the material craft product but also the knowledge and emotions
                     of craftspeople — that demonstrate the value of crafts to users in virtual environments.
                     This is a making process of both material media and translations of knowledge across

                     fits
                     our needs and provides a framework for theorizing our practices. In “The User, the
                     Learner and the Machines We Make,” Alex Gil asks the question, “What do we need?” to
                     open a discussion of necessity-based technical practices, articulating a concern about

                     help we can’t get, even as we fight to build the infrastructures we need at the
                     intersection of and beyond our libraries and schools” [<a class="ref" href="#gil2015">Gil 2015</a>]. We fully agree with
                     Gil’s argument that the orientations of digital knowledge production should be towards
                     the “ease of use, ease of creation” [<a class="ref" href="#gil2015">Gil 2015</a>]. Because ZHI is a student-based research
                     project with little grant funding, ensuring the sustainability and affordability of
                     both
                     labor and technology was the first, perhaps most important, concern for the project.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">In contrast, the digital heritage community in China trends towards fetishizing
                     technology. The more “advanced” and expensive digital technologies or devices are, the
                     more popular they are. Recently, virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) have
                     become popular in the national digital heritage community. However, not all types
                     of
                     cultural heritage or ICH are suitable for VR/AR, even though VR/AR have been strongly
                     recommended and supported by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Are they necessary
                     for
                     the ZHI project? No. The required terminal display equipment and the cost of modeling
                     3D
                     content, as well as easily outdated operating environments, are unaffordable luxuries
                     for individual craftspeople and students. Even with the possibility of grant funding,
                     the question remains about who could continue maintaining content and customized
                     technologies for VR/AR when the funding runs out. Rather than following the VR/AR
                     trend,
                     we considered the purpose of using technologies, focusing on the question of “what we
                     need.” We further considered which technologies would allow ZHI project participants to
                     engage in the hands-on making-as-knowing process with digital technologies, rather
                     than
                     outsourcing the making process and turning our technologies into a figurative “black
                     box” for craftspeople and students. With the strategic framework of minimal computing,
                     the ZHI project maximizes the use of only the most necessary technologies and the
                     most
                     effective ways to expose the most important, but often neglected, aspects of ICH:
                     the
                     beauty of handcrafts and the wisdom of craftspeople. </div>

                     industry. Due to existing market needs, especially for gold foil, craftspeople are
                     still
                     living within self-identified communities. To preserve ICH, craftspeople need to

                     our approach combines the study of documents and images with fieldwork and collaboration
                     with craftspeople. The first stage of the project focused on identifying challenges
                     to
                     the preservation of intangible cultural heritage through fieldwork. Through our
                     international Designers-in-Residency program, we worked closely with designers,
                     craftspeople, NGO workers, and administrators of cultural institutions. We visited
                     local
                     studios and interviewed designers and craftspeople, discussing the obstacles of digital

                     do
                     not have a systematic digital record of their products, skills, tools, and stories,
                     since they are not part of the museum system. As a result, the value of their work
                     has
                     not been recognized by cultural heritage authorities. Some organizations, such as
                     television stations, interview craftspeople but not all of these organizations give
                     copies of images, audio, videos, and texts back to the craftspeople. Additionally,
                     craftspeople do not have their own physical or virtual archives to preserve their
                     work,
                     documents, and ephemera. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Second, it is almost impossible to help designers from different cultural contexts
                     understand an artifact with a 2000-year-old history of complicated techniques, complex
                     meanings behind colors and patterns, or these groups of people spend their whole lives
                     weaving a textile or making a fan. They can respect it but not understand it. This
                     happens with students too, even when they share the same cultural contexts as these
                     craftspeople. Students love these beautiful artifacts and enthusiastically want to
                     know
                     more about them, but they do not know how to acquire that knowledge. Not all students
                     are from the local area, so some are unfamiliar with the culture. But, more importantly,
                     as a younger generation, they do not have first-hand knowledge and experience of
                     traditional craftsmanship — just surface knowledge from books, museums, tourist stores,
                     and TV shows, which are carefully illustrated, elucidated, encoded, and programmed
                     by
                     authoritative researchers, professionals, and product designers. Students seldom have
                     a
                     chance to have hands-on experiences with the making process that is needed to acquire
                     the deep, tacit knowledge of craftsmanship and craftsmen themselves.</div>

                     to establish a digital website to virtually represent craftsmanship to general audiences
                     and create an archive for craftspeople to digitally preserve their works, processes,
                     and
                     stories. We also adopted a research-driven pedagogical model: The process of developing
                     the website engaged students in making-as-knowing, as they worked with the craftspeople
                     to select, digitize, design, and interpret content, with the help of collaborators,

                     making
                     short video clips, (3) searching the free copyright images, and (4) conducting oral
                     history interviews (see Figure 1). Most of the filming is done on students’ phones,
                     and
                     they can edit them on their laptops with video editing software. We ask them to strictly
                     follow our protocols of data collection, which have been designed and customized by
                     us,
                     so the filming and editing work is also part of the scientific investigation process
                     and
                     includes consent of the craftspeople (see Figures 2 and 3). For example, students
                     have
                     to clearly understand the name and purpose of every step in the development of a craft,
                     as well as additional considerations, such as why we should take a photo of silk yarn
                     from a particular perspective — because the reflection of silk yarn in a different
                     light
                     will affect color representation. Students also have to understand why particular
                     patterns have to be arranged next to another one — because royal rules in ancient
                     China
                     dictated the whole pattern for clothes. All of this detailed information about ICH

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">Simple does not mean inelegant. On the contrary, we want to make the website simple
                     but
                     beautiful. By studying the materials, tools, making process, products, and talking
                     with
                     craftspeople, we developed our “3S principle” as we found that the <em class="emph">scales</em>, <em class="emph">scene</em>, and <em class="emph">scenario</em> are
                     very important for virtual representation. This principle begins with the idea that
                     beauty is based on understanding, not intuition alone. For example, to present a
                     pattern, an image should present a minimal unit of pattern with an explanation of
                     the
                     meaning of each element, rather than showing a photo with just a title. In this sense,
                     <em class="emph">scale</em> is crucial for understanding (see Figure 9). Second,
                     beauty emerges in context. Craftsmanship is rooted in history, so we have to go back
                     to
                     the <em class="emph">scene</em> of history to understand it. While craftsmanship may
                     have seemed to have disappeared from daily life, we can trace it in some <em class="emph">scenes</em> of contemporary culture, such as paintings or TV soap
                     dramas (see Figure 10). Finally, beauty is constructed by narratives. Beauty is complex
                     but we can select specific <em class="emph">scenarios</em> and the most tangible and
                     touching moments for storytelling (see Figure 11).</div>

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Since the launch of the ZHI website, we have received compliments and feedback from
                     craftspeople and researchers alike. Reflecting on our process, we can summarize the
                     lessons we learned. First, developing a sharable knowledge network is essential. We
                     are
                     fortunate to have many collaborators working with us on the ZHI project, including
                     craftspeople, dyeing experts, scholars, designers, and museum curators. They examine
                     our
                     workflow, protocol, and principles, and give students seminars and workshops on dyeing
                     and color analysis. The students work very closely with craftspeople to record and
                     annotate all the photos of procedure and craft works. During this process, tacit
                     knowledge is circulated among this collaborative community and students’ experiences
                     merge into knowledge production and become a new branch of the digital twin of
                     craftsmanship. Consequently, three students from the team decided to work in cultural
                     heritage fields after they graduated — another outcome of this project.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">Next, based on the principle of mutually beneficial sharing, all photos, video, and
                     oral
                     history texts taken by us from the local studios and craftspeople are given back to
                     them
                     as documents. Meanwhile, all materials are authorized by craftspeople and local museums
                     are presented on our website as <em class="emph">their</em> own archives, so it is not
                     necessary for them to establish another one. Our team routinely visits their studios
                     to
                     help them digitize and record their newly made craft works. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Further, establishing data collection specifications from the beginning and following
                     them throughout the research and technical processes is crucial to sustainability
                     and
                     scalability. Minimal computing shaped our decision to set a variety of rules before
                     the
                     “actual work” began and to undertake both data collection and our technical work
                     carefully. For example, the students record all of the scientific data as they learn
                     about dyeing and, in turn, all images of craftsmanship on the website are also
                     color-managed so that accurate and effective color analysis can be performed.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Our hope is that the ZHI project offers a model for others working to present ICH
                     digitally in an economic and aesthetic way. While ZHI tries to decode the knowledge
                     of
                     craftsmanship and present the beauty of craftsmanship with minimal computing, several
                     concerns arose with the launch of the website, chiefly sustainability and permanence.
                     The construction of the website was largely supported by Nanjing University, Nanjing
                     Art
                     Foundation, and established partnerships with craftspeople, but the operation and
                     maintenance of the website requires continued investment in human and financial
                     resources. At the same time, we have started to promote the ZHI model to the community
                     of elders as well as to middle school students. Through these new developments, we
