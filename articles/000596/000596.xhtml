                  <p>Originally devised as an insult by Richard Wollheim, the term “minimalism”
                     described a 1960s movement that foregrounded the relationship between an art object
                     and
                     its museum viewer. Today, minimalism is the guiding ethos for a surprising variety
                     of
                     pop cultural phenomena, from belongings that spark joy to
                     contemplative practice that increases mindfulness. This article first takes a broader
                     view of minimalism to register several problematic echoes of minimal computing among
                     digital detoxers and disaster survivalists in intensities ranging from Luddism to
                     asceticism. Attention needs to be given to these echoes, especially when valorizing
                     DIY
                     infrastructures built out of necessity by Indigenous, poor, or coastal communities and
                     out of privilege by doomsday preppers. Second, this article asks what becomes of minimal
                     computing now that we have seen the vital importance of maximal connection during
                     the
                     COVID-19 pandemic. Do arguments for minimalism still hold in a socially-distant,
                     unevenly-connected world? I argue that it will be important to reframe the digital
                     minimalist conversations of the 2010s for the demands of digital equity in the 2020s.
                     Going forward, we should ask: which of these competing claims to minimalism — as a
                     form
                     of attention, mindfulness, and agency — are compatible with maximal connection, with
                     maximal choice, with maximal investment in communities and infrastructures? And when
                     we
                     hold up minimalism as a virtue, is that virtue a property of particular tools or
                     specific techniques for using them? Finally, this article profiles the ways that
                     academic conversations on minimal computing have independently taken root outside
                     universities through grassroots organizing and activism under the banner of community
                     technology. I close by suggesting ways that minimal computing can be led by community
                     input, while also playing a role in public scholarship and community partnerships
                     that
                     extend existing academic research.</p>

                     researchers about books they needed to access, department chairs surveying faculty
                     for
                     their remote teaching needs, undergraduate students sharing leads on summer work after
                     paid internships were cancelled, and graduate students turning CVs into resumes as
                     the
                     remains of the academic job market all but evaporated. As I write this, academics
                     continue to hash out detailed scenario plans at universities whose fates seem to change
                     by the day. But these approaches to what we need in academia, these finer-grained
                     tactics and forms of exchange, have only now become possible to imagine. Not long
                     ago,
                     we found ourselves asking even more fundamental versions of the question: What do
                     we
                     need in order to communicate, to eat, to stay healthy, to keep communities intact?</div>

                     soon forget the feeling of preparing in March 2020 for a crisis whose shape seemed
                     to
                     evolve in real time. I remember standing with my partner in a grocery aisle, wondering
                     whether microwaveable or stovetop rice would be a safer bet if infrastructure
                     maintainers could no longer report to work. Which utilities would last longer:
                     electricity (delivered here in Philadelphia by a private company) or gas (a municipal
                     utility)? The next day, I tried to reassure myself that it was just paranoia that
                     led me
                     to download PDFs of grocery checklists and CDC preparedness guides in case our Internet
                     connection also went down. “Who knew what was true,” says the protagonist of <cite class="title italic">Severance</cite> (2018), Ling Ma’s uncannily timed novel of pandemic

                     Computing Working Group in 2014. In a field often tempted by the discourse of
                     innovation, minimal computing instead has pushed digital humanities conversations
                     toward
                     issues of technology access, participation, sustainability, stewardship, and equity.

                     <cite class="title italic">New Digital Worlds</cite>, Roopika Risam describes minimal computing
                     as “a range of cultural practices that privilege making do with available materials to
                     engage in creative problem-solving and innovation. These go by names like <em class="emph">jugaad</em> in India, <em class="emph">gambiarra</em> in Brazil, <em class="emph">rebusque</em> in Colombia, <em class="emph">jus kali</em> in Kenya,

                     by foregrounding cultural practices rather than tools or platforms, minimal computing

                     essay
                     — is that minimal computing often bumps up against problematic echoes of constraint,
                     disaster, and isolation that circulate in far more public contexts than digital
                     humanities discourse is capable of reaching. Some of these echoes can be found among
                     groups animated by imaginaries of collapse, like the aforementioned disaster preppers
                     and a recent subgenre of speculative fiction known as “solarpunk,” committed to far more
                     generative stories of “ingenuity, generatively, independence, and community” in the face

                     control of our attention, ultimately advancing an asocial imaginary of disconnection

                     centuries. As Stacey Patton put it, “The pathology of American racism is making the
                     pathology of the coronavirus worse.” Higher rates of incarceration, homelessness,
                     chronic medical conditions, and a lack of access to quality health care all leave
                     Black Americans “more vulnerable to increased viral transmission, infection and death

                     Many of these mesh groups have learned from the foundational training curricula
                     developed by the Detroit Community Technology Project, founded by Diana Nucera, who
                     defines community technology as, “A principled approach to technology that is
                     grounded in the struggle for a more just digital ecosystem, placing value on equity,

                     perspective of community technology, building mesh networks means not only
                     maintaining the codebase and buildout, but also “fostering relationships of trust and
                     cooperation among neighbors, who must work together to make decisions about network

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">One thing we have learned at PCW by centering our conversations on community
                     technology is that not all approaches to “minimalism” are compatible. For example, two very distinct versions of minimalism have emerged
                     in our
                     survey of mesh projects around the country, as well as within our own conversations.
                     In the first version, decentralized networks, non-proprietary hardware, and open
                     source software are prized for their ability to build truly independent networks.
                     A
                     decentralized web (DWeb) could minimize reliance on exploitative Internet service
                     providers looking to sell user data, as well as minimize the surveillance harms that
                     disproportionately impact BIPOC communities. The second version of minimalism instead
                     emphasizes inclusion and access, regardless of the tools used to achieve them. In
                     this version, access to the Internet is viewed as a fundamental human right. The
                     Alliance for Affordable Internet — a global coalition of organizations working to
                     reduce cost barriers to Internet access — further specifies that baseline
                     connectivity is not enough and instead emphasizes “meaningful connectivity” as the
                     standard. “Meaningful connectivity,” according to their definition, involves the
                     following four “minimal thresholds”:</div>

                     animate them. As Rory Solomon details, technologists have only recently developed
                     the
                     routing protocols that make mesh networks scalable, in which every radio sends and
                     receives packets of information simultaneously, minimizing “hops” between nodes while
                     avoiding interference between all of that delicately interwoven traffic [<a class="ref" href="#solomon2020">Solomon 2020</a>, 2–3].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e480">[11]</a> And so the kinds of political
                     ideas emerging from mesh praxis — ideas about justice, equity, and privacy — will
                     only become clearer as more communities in cities around the country begin to map
                     their lines of sight and thread themselves together, node-by-node. It will be
                     interesting to see whether the “minimal thresholds” of meaningful connectivity can be
                     achieved through complex, experimental hardware, and whether that highly specialized
                     hardware can be made responsive to community input and ownership.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">For now, the problem is that the non-proprietary hardware prized by one crowd
                     presents yet another barrier to access in the eyes of the other, who prefers tools
                     that easily connect people right out-of-the-box. And so the pursuit of
                     decentralization on the one hand and meaningful connectivity on the other is a
                     tension that seems present in many mesh communities. But the debate plays out
                     differently depending on its context. In some cases, one form of tech activism
                     gradually transforms into another when arguments for network independence and racial
                     justice are found to be complimentary. In others, a mesh group splinters and factions
                     end up pursuing different goals. This outcome is more likely to be the case when the
                     group’s membership consists largely of tech and telecom employees volunteering their
                     time to build experimental infrastructures without much input from the

                     guiding ethos for a surprising variety of pop cultural phenomena, spanning everything
                     from belongings that spark joy to contemplative practice that increases mindfulness

                     monochrome backgrounds with slogans reading “Own less stuff. Find more purpose” and

                     a stark departure from the minimalism of necessity highlighted by practitioners of
                     minimal computing. Taking a broader view of minimalism registers several problematic

                     echoes, especially when valorizing DIY infrastructures built out of necessity by

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Minimalism was originally the name for an avant garde movement in 1960s art that
                     foregrounded the relationship between an art object and its museum viewer. With
                     techniques like prioritizing shape and scale over representation, artists associated
                     with minimalism sought to project little more than objecthood from their sculptures
                     and paintings. “What is at stake . . . is whether the paintings or objects in
                     question are experienced as paintings or as objects,” wrote Michael Fried, who
                     preferred the term “literalist” to describe these conceptual works, in 1967. “Like
                     the shape of the object, the materials do not represent, signify, or allude to
                     anything: they are what they are and nothing more” [<a class="ref" href="#fried1998">Fried 1998</a>, 151]. In the case of
                     a minimalist sculpture, brushed aluminum is just brushed aluminum. Think of Donald
                     Judd’s repeating cubes of identical size, Anne Truitt’s pillars broken by contrasting
                     bands of color, Dan Flavin’s sculptural arrangements of fluorescent light fixtures,
                     and Richard Serra’s massive, curved steel structures. At first, critics and artists
                     alike applied a variety of terms to these works: literalist, cool, ABC, receptive,
                     primary. But eventually, “minimalist” stuck.</div>

                     of the museum goer’s experience in the presence of their works. The sculptor Robert
                     Morris described “one’s awareness of oneself existing in the same space as the work .
                     . . as he [<em class="emph">sic</em>] apprehends the object from various positions and under varying
                     conditions of light and spatial context” [<a class="ref" href="#fried1998">Fried 1998</a>, 153–154]. Minimalist sculptures
                     tend to be either massive or scaled to the size of the human body. When massive,
                     viewers have to back up and circle around the sculptures, participating in space and
                     time as they take in the objects from multiple angles. When they are
                     anthropomorphically scaled, like Tony Smith’s six-by-six-by-six foot cube <cite class="title italic">Die</cite>, the sculptures possess an eerie presence: coming across
                     one in an empty room feels like being surprised by someone you didn’t expect to be

                     provoked atomization and isolation. For Kyle Chayka, minimalism today is “an
                     inevitable societal and cultural shift responding to the experience of living through
                     the 2000s,” from the impossibility of owning a home and paying down debt to the
                     vanishing likelihood of ever being paid a fair wage in a job that is secure. During
                     a
                     time when crises fade only as the next one begins, “flexibility and mobility now feel
                     safer than being static, another reason that owning less looks more and more
                     attractive. . . . It makes sense that millennials embrace minimalism. My generation

                     imaginary in order to cope with ever-intensifying forms of precarity that affect our
                     ability to maintain not just livable wages, but also uninterrupted trains of thought.
                     Digital minimalists seek to reinforce the permeable membrane of their attention
                     through mindfulness exercises, software settings, productivity apps, and other forms
                     of tech fixes. Approaches in this area fall into a few different categories. First
                     are the books that seek to identify and change the habits that lead users to
                     constantly seek refuge in their phones. Proponents in this camp offer prompts like
                     “spend time alone” and “hold conversation hours.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e665">[17]</a> A related group
                     consists of tech industry employees and insiders who have seen the light and devoted
                     themselves to fixing the social harms their algorithms have created. Former Google
                     engineer Tristan Harris, for example, founded the nonprofit Center for Humane
                     Technology to draw attention to the ways recommendation algorithms manipulate our
                     cognitive biases in order to keep us scrolling. The group has begun a laudable
                     campaign that pressures tech companies to pivot from business models built on
                     cognitive exploitation by “creat[ing] market conditions for humane tech,” albeit
                     without a real road map for doing so [<a class="ref" href="#center2021">Center for Humane Technology 2021</a>].</div>

                     part, tech companies now allow users to seemingly calibrate their attention through
                     options recently added to the system preferences of all major mobile platforms. These
                     features are known as “Digital Wellbeing” in Android, “Screen Time” in iOS, and “Zen
                     Mode” on OxygenOS. A digital minimalist might be further outfitted with gadgets like
                     IRL Glasses with polarized lenses that block the images on screens and slabs of solid
                     plastic called NoPhones that act as pacifiers for smartphone addicts. Digital
                     minimalists can also choose from the Google Paper Phone, a paper printout folded like
                     a zine containing all of the information you’ll need for the day and the Light Phone,
                     an app-less device with an e-ink display that only calls and texts. If minimalism
                     has
                     become synonymous with the capitalist injunction to do more with less, it also
                     promises that buying more will allow us to do less.</div>

                     detoxes and tech fixes used by both groups above. But they go one step further by
                     attributing the 21st-century crisis of attention not only to overreach by the tech
                     industry and its powerful algorithms but also to a certain moral failure on the part
                     of users. Public philosophers James Williams and Matthew Crawford both describe
                     attention as a battleground for human agency. And both seem almost nostalgic for an
                     earlier era when humanity could rely on an “off-the-shelf package of religious and
                     cultural constraints” to regulate our attention, agency, and values [<a class="ref" href="#williams2018">Williams 2018</a>, 21].
                     Williams writes, “In the twentieth century the rise of secularism and modernism
                     in the West occasioned the collapse — if not the jettisoning — of many of these
                     off-the-shelf packages of constraints in the cause of the liberation of the
                     individual.” Users of digital devices are now faced with “the self-regulatory cost of
                     bringing your own boundaries” to attention [<a class="ref" href="#williams2018">Williams 2018</a>, 21–22].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e714">[18]</a> 
                     For Crawford, “The left’s project of liberation led us to dismantle
                     inherited cultural jigs that once imposed a certain coherence (for better and worse)
                     on individual lives” [<a class="ref" href="#crawford2016">Crawford 2016</a>, 41].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e727">[19]</a> Both writers retreat into the Western philosophical

                     new methods for transforming our habits and desires into profitable data. But most
                     researchers understand this transformation not in terms of the absence of religion,
                     but the presence of capitalism. These are the terms that Soshana Zuboff has
                     persuasively developed in her work on “surveillance capitalism” [<a class="ref" href="#zuboff2019">Zuboff 2019</a>]. Others
                     describe the tech industry’s co-opting of our everyday behavior into new forms of
                     value as a colonial process. Nick Couldry and Ulises A. Mejias see this digital
                     extraction as an expansion of the ways colonialism has appropriated human life for
                     centuries: “Colonialism’s sites of exploitation today include the very same West that
                     historically imposed colonialism on the rest of the world. . . . What if the armory
                     of colonialism is expanding? What if new ways of appropriating human life, and the
                     freedoms on which it depends, are emerging?” [<a class="ref" href="#couldry2019">Couldry and Mejias 2019</a>, x].
                     Unfortunately, the self-help nature of digital minimalism is disconnected from a
                     broader accounting of the tech industry’s collective, social impacts. Instead, much
                     like the isolated, atomized viewer of a minimalist sculpture, digital minimalists
                     emphasize the sanctity of an idealized, individual human experience without ever

                        an equal position to refuse, owing to existing forms of stratification.  [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2019">Benjamin 2019</a>, 15–16, 17] </p>

                     connectivity could mean the difference between going out of business and creating
                     an
                     online storefront, or going without healthcare and scheduling a virtual appointment.
                     The writings of the digital minimalists seem almost quaint now that so much of social
                     existence has become filtered through screens. For some time, maximal digital
                     connection will be all we have. It’s difficult to say how much of this new maximalist
                     sensibility will survive the pandemic. But it will be important to reframe the
                     digital minimalist conversations of the 2010s for the demands of digital equity in
                     the 2020s. Going forward, we should ask: which of these competing claims to
                     minimalism — as a form of attention, mindfulness, and agency — are compatible with
                     maximal connection, with maximal choice, with maximal investment in communities and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">It’s almost impossible to talk about minimal computing without reference to these
                     free-floating cultural imaginaries of minimalism as a “solution” to the problems of
                     technology today, from doing more with less to surviving off the grid. Before we
                     deploy minimal computing in digital humanities pedagogy and practice, these
                     problematic echoes of minimal computing need to be examined. At a moment when
                     minimalism in pop culture commodifies asceticism and romanticizes disconnection,
                     practitioners of minimal computing should use the term carefully. When digital
                     humanists use the phrase, what does “minimal” mean? And when we hold up minimalism as
                     a virtue, is that virtue a property of particular tools or specific techniques for
                     using them?</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">In 2014, Dennis Tenen and I published a tutorial that showed how academic writers
                     could step outside “proprietary word processing software and fragile file formats”
                     like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. The values guiding that piece included an
                     emphasis on the fundamentals of computation, legibility of the many layers of
                     mediation involved in word processing, and above all, sustainability of the media
                     on
                     which we record our ideas [<a class="ref" href="#tenen2014">Tenen and Wythoff 2014</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#gil2015">Gil 2015</a>].
                     The tools we used to achieve those goals are now closely associated with “minimal
                     computing”: markdown and the document conversion software Pandoc, as well as static
                     site generators. But I now wonder whether we were prioritizing the values embedded
                     in
                     the tools (as do the proponents of a decentralized web who advance non-proprietary
                     hardware) or the values that informed our selection and use of those tools (like the
                     community technologists who advocate for meaningful connectivity for all). When it
                     comes to Pandoc and static sites, do these artifacts have politics, as Langdon Winner
                     famously asked? Can particular technologies have either inherently democratic or
                     inherently authoritarian tendencies, “embody[ing] specific forms of power and
                     authority?” [<a class="ref" href="#winner1980">Winner 1980</a>, 121].</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">The answer is of course a resounding yes. Pandoc prevents information from being
                     endangered or locked into proprietary ecosystems, while static sites enable the
                     democratization and rapid deployment of humanist praxis, which Alex Gil and Élika
                     Ortega usefully describe as “the renewal, dissemination, and preservation of the
                     scholarly record” [<a class="ref" href="#gil2016">Gil and Ortega 2016</a>, 29]. However, I would caution against an easy
                     equivocation between tools and their attendant politics. Too often, digital humanists
                     attribute democratic tendencies to some tools while overlooking the authoritarian
                     tendencies of others. I’m thinking in particular about the number of digital
                     humanities studies that use
                     facial recognition technologies in studies of film and television without once
                     mentioning the racist ways those tools are deployed in the world<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e872">[23]</a> — or work in cultural analytics that sidestep questions about machine
                     learning’s amplification of existing inequities with the briefest of preambles before
                     moving on to the value-neutral application of those tools.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e882">[24]</a> If we simply borrow a data

                     tool is deployed in the world today, that is a missed opportunity for dialogue and
                     advocacy.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">A better approach might be to invert Langdon Winner’s question, as Christina
                     Dunbar-Hester does in her book <cite class="title italic">Low Power to the People:</cite> “Do
                     politics have artifacts?” This is a much more difficult question, asking how we can
                     identify which tools best exemplify a particular political argument. Dunbar-Hester’s
                     book is an ethnography of community technologists working with radio and WiFi in the
                     early 2000s who negotiated “the construction and implementation of specific beliefs
                     about what technology can do, what technology should do, or what artifact is most
                     appropriate to enact a set of politics” [<a class="ref" href="#dunbarhester2014">Dunbar-Hester 2014</a>]. Winner explores the
                     existence of “artifactual politics,” rightly concluding that all artifacts entail
                     some form of political argument or effect. His approach to artifactual politics would
                     describe minimal computing as an assemblage of particular tools and platforms —
                     Jekyll, Hugo, Pandoc, Markdown — that afford a particular form of politics, an
                     argument about the role of technology in daily life. Dunbar-Hester asks instead how
                     to identify and describe “political artifacts,” or the artifacts that embody
                     particular arguments. If the politics of minimal computing are access, participation,
                     sustainability, and equity, then what tools are best suited to achieve those goals?
                     The benefit of Dunbar-Hester’s approach is that there is never just one right answer,
                     and it ensures that we lead with a fluid conversation about values rather than
                     locking those values into the affordances of a particular tool.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">For example, while the tools currently associated with minimal computing are more
                     sustainable, they can be less equitable in terms of participation (considering the
                     steep learning curve of starting from scratch) or bandwidth (given their pared back,
                     lower-definition, lesser-than resources). Jentery Sayers warned of this early on,
                     in
                     2016: “It’s easy to become preoccupied with technical details and specialization,
                     which often ostracize people or inhibit participation” [<a class="ref" href="#sayers2016">Sayers 2016</a>]. Since then,
                     minimal computing has become near synonymous with static sites in particular, but
                     static sites are often at odds with some of minimal computing’s core values of access
                     and participation. The Executive Council of the Association for Computers and the
                     Humanities, for example, recently decided against migrating their website from
                     WordPress to a static site generator due in part to learning-curve concerns. The
                     Council worried that the command line, markdown, and Git may have presented too great
                     a barrier to entry for new contributors to the site.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e920">[25]</a> While static site generators are remarkable tools — I’m a known fan
                     — they have become too easily conflated with minimal computing. An artifactual
                     politics approach has welded a value (rapid deployment) to a tool (static site
                     generators) at the expense of sustainable community partnerships and equitable
                     participation.</div>

                     difficult to appreciate if particular tools elevate some values at the expense of
                     others. I find that this has been especially difficult to remember during the
                     pandemic, amid a rush to throw tools and platforms at every activity under the sun
                     in
                     a desperate attempt to recreate the way things felt before social distancing. But
                     the
                     contribution of minimal computing has always been the way it foregrounds — instead
                     of
                     particular tools — what Roopika Risam calls “cultural practices,” what German media
                     theorists call <em class="term">Kulturtechniken</em>, and what we can simply refer
                     to here as technique, or the way we do things [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>, 43] [<a class="ref" href="#siegart2015">Siegert 2015</a>]. If
                     minimal computing is to continue asking “What do we need?” in order to define the
                     “we” in question and elevate the values held in common by that “we,” then it will
                     have to find new ways to center its principles on the way we do things rather than
                     the tools we use to do them. I offer three suggestions in closing for how to surface
                     such techniques in the unsettled months and years to come.</div>

                     independently taken root outside universities through grassroots organizing,
                     activism, and advocacy on technology. Two groups of people are having the same

                     MetaLab, a Pittsburgh MetaMesh. It’s especially important to recognize these existing
                     parallels as many expect the makeup of academia to change dramatically from the
                     coronavirus’s irreparable damage to already-misguided university budgets. Asking
                     “What do we need?” in minimal computing now means defining the “we” that will

                           intermediaries is called routing, and a crucial part of building mesh networks is
                           the development and deployment of routing algorithms that optimize network
                           efficiency in terms of several possible variables, including: minimizing number of
                           intermediate steps or ’hops’ [between network nodes], minimizing time or cost of
                           message delivery, maximizing the quantity of overall throughput in the network,
                           performing well in the presence of high levels of message traffic or noise, and
                           perhaps most importantly, maximizing network resiliency, meaning the capacity of
                           messages to be successfully routed from sender to receiver even in the event of

                     more authentic world is always just beyond our current existence in a place we can

                     great benefits. Yet by rejecting entire packages of constraint, we’ve also
