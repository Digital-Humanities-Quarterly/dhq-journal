                  <p>In this paper, we describe OuPoCo (l’Ouvroir de Poésie Combinatoire), a system producing
                     					new sonnets by recombining lines of poetry from existing sonnets, following an
                     idea that
                     					Queneau described in his book <span class="hi italic">Cent Mille Milliards de poèmes</span> (<span class="hi italic">A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems</span>, 1961). We first give the
                     					rationale of the project and review past experiments in poetry generation using
                     					combinatorial methods. We then demonstrate different outputs of our implementation
                     (a Web
                     					site, a Twitter bot and a specifically developed device, called La Boîte à poésie)
                     based
                     					on a corpus of 19th century French poetry. We describe how this project was an
                     opportunity
                     					to work with artists and reach a new audience through the Boîte à poésie, and
                     also through
                     					a video clip that frequently served as an introduction to the project. Our goal
                     is to
                     					revive people’s interest in poetry by giving access to automatically produced
                     sonnets
                     					through original and entertaining channels and devices.</p>

                     by
                     					recombining existing lines of poetry. The starting point of the project was the
                     book by
                     					Raymond Queneau, <span class="hi italic">Cent Mille Milliards de poèmes</span> (<span class="hi italic">A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems</span>, in English) (Queneau, 1961). </div>

                     of paper
                     					(cf. figure 1), allowing the reader, by freely combining the different lines,
                     to
                     					potentially produce and read a hundred thousand billion different sonnets. This
                     					combinatorial approach (the main characteristic of the book) encourages the reader
                     to play
                     					with the meanings of the lines, with the various language registers, or simply
                     to have fun

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Queneau’s book seems an ideal candidate to be transposed to a computer, since a machine
                     can
                     					very easily combine lines and produce a comprehensive list of all the possible
                     poems.
                     					However, Queneau’s work is still under copyright, which should normally prevent
                     one from
                     					putting the sonnets contained in his book online, although numerous implementations
                     can in
                     					fact be found on the Internet. Nevertheless, this is one of the reasons why,
                     instead of
                     					working on Queneau’s poems, we decided to focus on freely available ones, which
                     also
                     					helped develop more original and challenging research. An Hence, an important
                     part of the
                     					project consisted then in constitutcollecting assembling a collection of 19th
                     century
                     					French sonnets. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Beyond the availability of relevant collections of poetry, which facilitated the creation
                     					of our corpus, 19th century poetry also appeared as a fertile ground to reflect
                     upon the
                     					sonnet and to work and play with various constraints. This means that the original
                     poems
                     					first have to be analyzed so as to determine the rhyme, as well as other features
                     (line
                     					length, topic of the sonnet, etc.). Our project thus deals with analysis, as
                     much as with
                     					the generation of poetry. We will see that the project gave birth to various
                     outputs,
                     					including artistic ones. Finally, we made several public demos, showing that
                     such a
                     					project can have an impact on the general public as well as on children in school,
                     in a
                     					learning perspective. </div>

                     process
                     					(section 5). We conclude the technical part of the paper with an evaluation of
                     the

                        						Queneau’s book to a computer. In fact, in 1961, immediately after the publication
                        of
                        						the book, a first attempt was made by Dimitri Starynkevitch, a French computer
                        						scientist, working on a computer of the time (a CAB 500, to be precise, according
                        to
                        						Bens (2005); see Figure 2 and (Starynkevitch, 1990). Baillehache (2021) reports
                        						OulipLiPo’s answer<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e397">[3]</a> to
                        						Starynkevitch’s program: “We wished that M. Starynkevitch would explain the
                        method
                        						used; we hoped that the choice of the lines was not left to randomness” (Bens,

                        						moreover, it shows Oulipians’ lack of interest, in 1961, in the process that

                        						make it possible to generate poetry indefinitely and automatically, which may

                        						aversion to randomness, seen as opposite to the idea of constraints that the

                        						produce an infinite number of poems generated randomly. The book, with its strips

                        						creativity and authorship in the realm of literature. Goldsmith's approach advocates
                        						for a departure from the traditional, romanticized image of the writer as a
                        solitary
                        						genius crafting original, imaginative works. Instead, he promotes the idea that
                        						creativity can also be found in the act of appropriation and remixing, where
                        writers
                        						repurpose existing texts, often without significant alteration, to create something

                        						existing texts as a source of inspiration. Uncreative Writing invites us to

                        						the boundaries of creativity in the digital age, where information is abundant

                        						In Jacques Bens' account of the early Oulipo meetings, there is extensive discussion
                        						on this topic, and Queneau believed that writers should always be conscious

                     century
                     					French is more normalized than the language a few centuries before). We first

                     the text to
                     					poetry, we still needed to extract sonnets. In order to do this, several heuristics
                     were
                     					used, thanks to Python scripts aiming at retrieving based on the fact that we

                     					mentioned. First, as is widely known, pronunciation and spelling differ greatly
                     in French,
                     					as in English. There is thus a need to first transform written texts into a phonetic
                     					transcription. Second, French has a specific and quite complex versification
                     system, which
                     					is different (and far more complex) than simple phonetics. The second stage consists
                     then
                     					in transforming the phonetic transcription into a representation that corresponds
                     to
                     					French versification rules. </div>

                     					transcription) was done with eSpeak, a free software available on the Web
                     					(http://espeak.sourceforge.net), that provided satisfactory results on our data.
                     We
                     					analyze the whole verse and not only the last word of each line, so that a full

                     go from a
                     					phonetic transcription to a representation that corresponds to the rules of versification.
                     					Let’s take an example. The two words “aimé” and “aimée” have the same phonetic

                     rhyme);
                     					there are also cases where the phonetic transcription is slightly different but
                     the words

                     					Spenser all proposed and initiated slightly different rhyming schemes (for example,

                     main
                     					topics were identified (beauty, love, death, melancholy, nature, spirituality),
                     later on
                     					reduced to five, as melancholy and death were hard to distinguish (beauty and
                     love are
                     					also very close from a linguistic point of view, as well as death and spirituality,
                     but
                     					they are nevertheless different enough to be annotated and recognized with sufficient
                     					accuracy). A sample of sonnets was annotated using these categories (50 sonnets
                     per
                     					category) and a classifier was subsequently trained on the resulting manually
                     annotated
                     					corpus. It is thus possible to generate sonnets on a specific topic. Note that
                     the
                     					annotation operates at the sonnet level, whereas generation operates at the level
                     of the
                     					individual line of verse. However, we assume that the theme gives a general flavor
                     to the
                     					text, and that not every line has to be relevant from a thematic point of view</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">This annotation is however highly subjective. Sometimes most of the poem is on a specific
                     					topic, while the last line gives a completely different perspective. See for
                     example <span class="hi italic">Le dormeur du val</span>, by Rimbaud. This poem is highly bucolic, clearly
                     					about nature since it is about a man peacefully sleeping in a field — except
                     that the last
                     					verse line completely changes the whole perspective, by revealing that the man
                     is in fact
                     					a dead soldier. In cases like this, we chose to annotate the dominant topic (the
                     one which
                     					covers most of the poem), ‘nature’ in this case (but ‘death’ would also have
                     been
                     					relevant, and maybe more relevant if we take into account the deep meaning of
                     the sonnet).
                     					All this reveals the subjectivity of any annotation. During the experiment,
                     					inter-annotator agreement was not high, but still acceptable and far beyond chance.

                        						unconsciously encouraged to find coherence in them, simply because we are used

                        						coherence in our everyday life and because incoherence is bewildering (Reinhart,

                        to some
                        						extent), is a frequent need for the experiencer to go back to the original poem,

                        						see where a given line comes from (on the Oupoco website, ‘tooltips’ always

                        goal
                        						is to re-engage people with poetry (showing that poetry is interesting, and

                        due
                        						to the pandemic, several people told us that the Boîte à poésie, beyond engaging
                        						pupils and students with poetry, was also a very good way to raise their awareness
                        of
                        						complex linguistic issues such as text coherence. The program frequently produces
                        non
                        						optimal texts (with pronouns not referring to any antecedents or with erratic
                        						syntactic constructions, as shown in section 6). Since these texts are produced
                        by a
                        						machine, there is no harm in using them to explain why they are problematic,
                        and how
                        						they could be improved. The whole process also helps to show that a computer
                        is not
                        						perfect in itself: it is just the results result of what people (especially,

                        gives of
                        						literature, and more specifically poetry. By assembling lines of verse selected

                        						humans. Conversely, as explained in the previous sections, people were often

                     					reservoir of pre-existing texts available in a digital form allows people (esp.especially
                     					writers) to engage with language in novel ways, emphasizing the value of
                     					recontextualization and reinterpretation over the creation of entirely new content.
                     This
                     					approach challenges conventional ideas about what constitutes originality and
                     innovation
                     					in the realm of writing and highlights the evolving relationship between humans
                     and text.
                     					Goldsmith provocatively advocates for a shift towards a more "uncreative" approach
                     to
                     					writing. He posits that human creativity can also be found in the act of
                     					appropriationappropriating and remixing existing texts, blurring the lines between
                     					authorship and readership. We partly wanted explore this idea through the Oupoco

                     					book, Hartman explores technology and literature, showcasing the transformative
                     potential
                     					of computers in redefining the very essence of poetry. Through meticulous analysis
                     and
                     					experimentation, he demonstrates how algorithms and computational processes can
                     be
                     					harnessed to generate innovative and unexpected poetic forms, challenging established
                     					norms and expanding the horizons of creative expression. More specifically, his
                     first
                     					experiment was in a way a precursor of our own: a program named "RanLines" was
                     designed to
                     					store a collection of 20 lines within and subsequently to fetch one of these
                     lines at
                     					random whenever the user pressed a key, so as to produce a kind of poem. Through
                     this
                     					program, the author explores a “simple sort of randomness” that reminds him of
                     the Greek

                     observed
                     					that “It’s hard to put together two words that don’t make some kind of sense
                     to the
                     					willing reader” (p. 31). He also adds that: “The more discrete and self-contained
                     the
                     					syntax of the line (complete clause, complete prepositional phrase), the more
                     easily it
                     					joins with lines before and after”, which is also what we observed, and one of
                     the limits
                     					of our experiments (when a linguistic element refers to other ones outside the
                     line,
                     					coherence – or justsimple linguistic well formedness – is often lacking). But
                     beyond this
                     					issue, we agree with Hartman that these experiments open new perspectives to
                     the willing
                     					reader. As suggests Hartman suggests, the reader’s imagination is pushed
                     					forwardchallenged, as it is nearly always possible to find some meaning, draw
                     some
                     					connexions and interpret combined verses. At the same time, our experiments showed
                     that
                     					the application is also a deepstrong incentive to rediscover poetry: very regularlyoften,
                     					people are intrigued by a verseline and want to go back to the original poem.

                     						puisse donner à cette recherche une nouvelle forme de visibilité et de
                     						matérialité.Pour cela, nous avons réalisé un dispositif simple qui permet à
                     un
                     						utilisateur de générer un poème automatiquement en tournant une manivelle. Par
                     						l’intermédiaire d’un petit écran périphérique, l’utilisateur est également informé
                     de
                     						la quantité d’énergie électrique qu’il a été nécessaire de mobiliser pour générer
                     ce
                     						nouveau poème. S’il le souhaite, il peut essayer de deviner le fonctionnement
                     de la
                     						Boîte à Poésie à travers les parois transparentes.Ce dispositif, à la fois mécanique
                     						et électronique, fait directement référence au Condensation Cube de Hans Haacke
                     qui
                     						peut être considéré comme une œuvre jalon de l’art conceptuel américain, et
                     qui est
                     						presque contemporain du livre de Raymond Queneau puisqu’elle a été réalisée
                     en 1965.
                     						Il nous semble que l’on peut voir une grande similitude entre ces deux œuvres
                     dans la
                     						mesure où chacune d’entre elles réagit pour ainsi dire aux conditions de leur
                     						exposition ; le Condensation Cube produit de la vapeur d’eau en fonction du
                     taux
                     						d’hygrométrie du lieu dans lequel il est exposé et le livre de Queneau produit
                     des
                     						poèmes en fonction de la chance et l’humeur du lecteur.Ce projet a été pour
                     nous
                     						l’occasion de nous confronter à la réalisation d’un objet qui puisse être à
                     la fois
                     						une machine et une œuvre d’art et de réfléchir aux enjeux écologiques qu’implique
                     une
                     						telle pratique. Qu’est-ce qui relève de la machine dans les œuvres d’art et
                     en retour
                     						qu’est-ce qui relève de la sculpture dans les machines qui nous entourent ?
                     Comment
                     						rendre mieux visible l’impact environnemental qu’entraine la construction d’une
                     						machine ou d’une œuvre d’art ?</span></div>
