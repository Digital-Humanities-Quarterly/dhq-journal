                  <p>Our digital gadgets are often blamed for introducing unprecedented levels of
                     distraction, but how might we recognize and harness the attentional
                     possibilities such an environment offers? This editorial essay introduces a
                     special issue of DHQ devoted to thinking about distracted reading, and sets out
                     an agenda and a context for our exploration of distributed modes of attention.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Central to the humanities is the theorization and practice of modes of attention.
                     Yet if digital technology has changed one thing above all else in the texture of
                     our everyday lives, it is precisely the nature of our attention to the world and
                     to the cultural artifacts within it. Indeed, within our teaching spaces many of
                     us devote much time to finding ways to redirect our students’ attention away
                     from the distractions of their multiple electronic gadgets. But what if we
                     consider how such distributed focus might enable new acts of attention and new
                     ways of reading? How might we think about pedagogically-inspired research
                     methods, in addition to the more usual research-led pedagogy? How might we
                     rethink our research methods and our pedagogy in an era of hyper-connectivity?
                     This is the context and these are the questions that motivated this special
                     issue, in which “reading” is taken to represent an act of critical
                     engagement with works in any medium (text, visual art, film, or music, for
                     example), and with the digital interfaces and devices through which we access
                     those media. Indeed, it is important that the essays in this issue engage with a
                     variety of art forms (from the visual arts, and cinema, to text) and with a
                     variety of digital contexts and information systems. This is a conversation that
                     has brought us together from across the humanities.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">This special issue emerged from a project that ran over two years at New York
                     University and which involved two symposia over the course of 2016: one
                     milestone event in the school of the interdisciplinary global liberal arts,
                     Liberal Studies, and one in NYU’s Centre for the Humanities. Both gathered
                     scholars from across the disciplines, the first within a school, and the second
                     from across the university and beyond. The project was designed initially to
                     catch energies for new ways of working with digital technologies, to bring them
                     together, and to give a space in which they could be fostered, developed, and
                     shared with others. The initial aim, then, was to give us the space to
                     experiment and to think afresh about our ways of working within the institution.
                     However, the project attracted considerable attention from outside the
                     university and began to connect with existing initiatives and inspire new
                     projects in the work of scholars from across the US, Europe and Australasia. As
                     a result, this special issue includes work from all three of those continents.
                     It is a project that grew from the local to the global and whose growth was, of
                     course, facilitated by the digital cultures it explores. 
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The project community often worked with digital tools in a way that has become
                     expected of the digital humanities – sometimes misusing tools and technologies
                     creatively for new purposes and to provide new ways of thinking; sometimes
                     creating new tools to enable new methods of engagement. Above all, though, the
                     project has been centred not around a tool-led approach, but around an
                     engagement with the broader concerns of digital cultures and our operation
                     within them. The aim, ultimately, was to bring a greater self-consciousness to
                     our use of digital tools and technologies and to our thinking about the acts of
                     attention they entail, enable, or disable. Overall, the aim has been to think
                     more about how we read with them and through them rather than about their
                     ability to bring, for example, quantitative methods to the humanities. Digital
                     humanities might often be focussed on what technology can bring to our study of
                     the humanities, but it also reflects on what the humanities can bring to our
                     engagement with our technological present. And in the case of the latter, what
                     the humanities have to offer is, above all else perhaps, an assessment of how
                     digital technologies are changing our experience of the world in the most
                     profound and general of ways. A change in the way we attend is just one of
                     these, but one particularly important to scholars and teachers.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">It is worth clarifying two points at the outset, then. The first is that
                     “distracted reading” is not about simply celebrating the anarchy of
                     distraction, but rather about exploring how distraction might involve acts of
                     micro-attention or a distributed focus that can be harnessed constructively as
                     useful methods of engagement for certain goals. The second: for all that the
                     essays here frequently explore the uses of digital distraction as a method of
                     study, this is not a manifesto for the use of technology, and it is certainly
                     not an insistence on a revolution in pedagogy that will displace other methods.
                     It’s worth stressing again that the main point of the project is rather to
                     encourage a more self-reflexive engagement with these gadgets (perhaps one of
                     the most important skills for our current age) – and should lead to exactly the
                     opposite of a blanket adoption of digital tools: it should lead to a more
                     conscious decision as to when and why one might want to harness their
                     distractive power and, equally, when and why one might call for an avoidance of
                     them. The key to this project is to be more aware of fitting the methods to the
                     aims, and to see — in a way that has not been adequately recognized —
                     technological distraction as one legitimate method, among many others, but
                     certainly not the only method, or even one that should be privileged. The point
                     is to explore the potential of a range of practices we might add to our
                     repertoire.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Consider, for example, enlivening the large lecture format by offering an
                     electronic message board to which any of the students can send a question during
                     the lecture if they are puzzled, or want more elaboration on a particular point.
                     Then every fifteen minutes or so (which in reality is the length of most
                     people’s attention span) the lecturer stops to answer some of the questions. The
                     questions do in a sense distract from the onward flow of the lecture, and they
                     certainly break up its texture, but they do both in a way that promotes
                     understanding of the content and, I would argue, attention. The technique
                     results in the students feeling involved — the lecture becomes a two-way
                     interaction — and of course this method has a core pedagogical purpose: in such
                     a large group, without such techniques it is virtually impossible, otherwise, to
                     know whether most students are following the lecture or completely lost. The
                     lecturer can modulate the content in light of the level of understanding
                     demonstrated in the questions posted. Moreover, in such a large lecture format
                     it will always be impossible to strictly enforce a ban of technology, so it
                     might be an occasion on which embracing its potential is more appropriate.
                     However, there are still plenty of teaching sessions in which one might want to
                     insist on the absence of electronic gadgets and work with pen and paper alone.
                     There might be good reasons to do this for particular purposes; studies have
                     shown that the phenomenological engagement involved in the inscription of
                     cursive on the page is a better route towards certain types of mental activity
                     than typing on a keyboard [<a class="ref" href="#may2014">May 2014</a>].

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The essays in this issue fall naturally into three groups. The first two essays
                     begin by thinking about the processes of research and reading: how do
                     distraction and distributed attention function within economies of information?
                     We start with Jennifer Edmond’s insightful, detailed, and fascinatingly
                     evidenced analysis of distraction as a fundamental, but often undervalued, part
                     of the process of humanities research. Focussing particularly on historians, her
                     analysis of the methods of the humanities scholar is enlightening and
                     refreshing. Moreover, her call for an exploration and validation of the
                     distracted reading processes central to some research methods is essential.
                     Tully Barnett’s essay then goes on to think about “distributed reading” as
                     a generative concept for understating processes of reading in the digital era.
                     Barnett thinks about the impact of digitization on reading by exploring what it
                     means to read through interface. She draws our attention to reading as a process
                     within a network of “devices,
                     platforms, features, networks, contexts”, in order that “these can usefully be understood as
                     forming an infrastructure of reading”. These first two essays frame
                     the field in different ways, but both offer a good platform for rethinking the
                     informational economy of the humanities around notions of attention,
                     distraction, and distribution. 
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The next three papers outline particular pedagogical strategies, and experiments
                     with students, that are based on an interest in the type of distracted reading
                     our engagement with electronic gadgets encourages. These three papers focus,
                     respectively, on art history, cinema studies, and literature, providing a strong
                     disciplinary range. Writing in the context of art history, Martha Hollander
                     describes her experiments with student phone and tablet use. Using the capacity
                     of students’ individual electronic devices to call up a wealth of images to
                     supplement those that are the focus of the syllabus, Hollander incorporates them
                     into her teaching method. As she notes, with so many artworks being stored
                     rather than exhibited publicly, the smartphone becomes a vehicle for accessing
                     some of the “hidden treasures” of the museum. In requiring
                     the use of personal devices in this way, Hollander keeps students active as
                     individual participants, asking “What constitutes distraction as opposed to associative or divided thinking?
                     How would we characterize a habit of mind enabled, rather than created, by
                     personal digital devices?” For Hollander these methods have enabled
                     an importantly different approach to learning the history of art; one which
                     involves starting not with the reified canonical example, but with a mass of
                     examples that give a feel for the genre or the artist’s style before proceeding
                     to the particular images she has chosen as the focus for communal attention. In
                     other words, these new pedagogical strategies reflect and capitalize on the
                     abundance of data now at our fingertips. Also working with visual images, but in
                     the very different disciplinary context of cinema studies, Marina Hassapopoulou
                     explores distraction through the idea of play and gamification, asking how
                     “social media, remixing, GIS
                     tools, and augmented reality” can be incorporated into pedagogical
                     methods. Platforms and technologies that are more often experienced by students
                     as distractions from study are repurposed by Hassapopoulou to enable “productive models of distributed
                     attention and collective intelligence”. Countering claims that
                     shorter attention spans in younger audiences are damaging students' ability to
                     learn, Hassapopoulou explores the new cognitive skills that media theorists have
                     argued might be emerging: “such
                     as the ability to process information more rapidly as a result of a less
                     linearly-constrained and more interactive thought process”. Moving
                     next to literary studies, Sarah E. Kersh and Chelsea Skalak offer an analysis of
                     the development and use of an annotation tool that helps their students read
                     recursively. Noting that student assignments often presuppose a textual
                     environment very different from that which exists for the students in actuality,
                     they seek to enable them to create hypertext analyses. Working with the
                     understanding of “hypertext-enabled
                     radial reading” as a distracted form of reading, they show how such
                     acts of overlaying and interconnecting readings helped students to understand
                     the relationship between the theories and methodologies they were exploring.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The final two papers consider digital humanities courses themselves, asking what
                     role digital humanities pedagogy can play in helping us think about economies of
                     attention. Paul Fyfe argues that introductory digital humanities courses offer
                     unique opportunities for exploring the act of reading itself. Focussing
                     particularly on “metacognition” and “transfer”, he describes how a
                     focus on acts of attention might help students learn how to read in a more
                     self-aware manner, in addition to enriching their sense of the possibilities for
                     engaging with the “distributed facilities
                     and extra-disciplinary partnerships” across the university that can
                     help integrate their learning. He describes how his digital humanities pedagogy
                     can help make students aware of how attention itself is mediated. Focussing on
                     the relationship between medium and meaning, he uses this analysis of mediated
                     attention to encourage students to reflect upon the problems and possibilities
                     for knowledge creation within their own educational environment. In the closing
                     essay Grant Wythoff also writes about how the digital is both the object and the
                     method of study in his course “Introduction to Digital
                     Media”, describing various strategies he offers to think about acts
                     of attention. These methods include turning the distracted attention our digital
                     devices often elicit from us into a “deep material literacy” of those same devices. This is achieved by
                     having students literally deconstruct the physical make-up of those devices in
                     all their material complexity. In addition to this close attention, Wythoff
                     proposes another, rather more surprising pedagogical experiment. Thinking about
                     distraction as an act of attention, but one “no longer directed by volition, discipline, or
                     desire”, he explores something that we might sometimes think of as
                     the opposite of distraction: boredom. Using Kracauer to theorize acts of
                     attention, he considers boredom as a valuable experience of the self that we
                     rarely have to confront when we have our digital devices with us (which for many
                     is almost always). Yet what happens if we insist on preserving some spaces free
                     of digital distractions; “What might
                     dwelling with our boredom open up to students?”

                     distractions (even with the two important caveats introduced in the first
                     section of this essay) in an age in which distraction is often perceived as the
                     enemy of everything universities hold dear about education. Indeed, in May of
                     2017, a researcher at Oxford University was the first winner of the Nine Dots
                     Prize (awarded for work tackling cotemporary societal issues) for an essay arguing
                     that the distractions of digital technologies are
                     fundamentally undermining our political processes. James Williams’s essay “Stand
                     Out of Our light: Freedom and Persuasion in the Attention Economy”
                     argues that digital technologies privilege “our <em class="emph">impulses</em> over our
                     <em class="emph">intentions</em>” and distract us from goals we may want
                     to achieve [<a class="ref" href="#williams2017">Williams 2017</a>]. The distraction is, of course, often
                     to the benefit of advertisers and other commercial interests, and Williams — who
                     himself worked in the tech industry for ten years — argues that the very design
                     principles of some of the digital platforms most central to our lives are guided
                     by the aim of hijacking our attention.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e298">[1]</a> In Williams’ words, these technologies,

                        <p>

                           reflection and self-regulation, making it harder, in the words of
                           philosopher Harry Frankfurt, to “want what we want to want.” A
                           primary effect of digital technologies is thus to undermine the
                           operation and even development of the human will. This militates against

                     the information environment we live in has changed categorically as a result of
                     the digital revolution: “Back in an information-scarce
                     environment, the role of a newspaper was to bring you information — your

                     nineteenth century as similar to that of the present minus the digital
                     technology, when in fact the reality of up to twelve postal deliveries a day in
                     London in the late nineteenth century created a situation in which letters were
                     often exchanged with a frequency we now associate with emails: whole
                     conversations unfolded over the course of a day in quickly scribbled ink on
                     paper. The proliferating worlds of sales, advertising, journalism, and new
                     technologies in the later nineteenth century were also experienced as a
                     revolution in the demands on attention (for example, the distractions of a
                     constant onslaught of sales boys selling “papers and candy” and “new novels” to a captive audience on the train

                     to concerns about distraction <em class="emph">at least</em> since the second industrial
                     revolution (the revolution of the commodity in the latter half of the nineteenth
                     century).

                     concerns informing theories of reading. Ezra Pound asserted in the 1930s, “The main expression of nineteenth-century
                     consciousness is in prose”. Why? Because “The art of popular success lies
                     simply in never putting more on any one page than the most ordinary
                     reader can lick off it in his normally rapid, half-attentive
                     skim-over”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#pound1918">Pound 1918</a>, 32]. Readers were too distracted to be able to attend to the density of
                     poetry, and its play with multiple resonances. According to this narrative, the
                     novel became much more popular than poetry in the second half of the nineteenth
                     century because it could be read while distracted. Whether or not this is the
                     reason for the dominance of the novel over poetry after the industrial
                     revolution, it is fascinating to see this articulation of a crisis in
                     “modern” culture, and in reading specifically, attributed
                     to the saturation of modern life with distractions that destroyed the capacity
                     for attention that was necessary for reading linguistically complex literary
                     forms. It feels so familiar, in spite of being written nearly a hundred years
                     ago.

                     of new technologies are to be resisted. Many scientific studies show the damage
                     to IQ effected by distraction, and this has become a popular theme in some media
                     outlets [<a class="ref" href="#levitin2015">Levitin 2015</a>]. Adam Alter’s <cite class="title italic">Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping

                     succumbing to the random demands on our attention from pinging phones, screen
                     notifications, and step monitors. The project asks instead how we might harness
                     these delicious distractions as attentional devices - and in the process develop
                     much greater self-awareness of the role these technological tools play in our
                     lives, and, crucially, the role we <em class="emph">want</em> them to play in our lives.
                     Experimenting with distraction is about exploring how we regulate attention, and
                     becoming more aware of how we distribute our attention. After all, our acts of
                     attention are, arguably, rarely other than partial. For some cognitive
                     theorists, attention requires a state analogous to an orchestra playing in
                     unison: the synchronised activity of relevant processes (see [<a class="ref" href="#mole2011">Mole 2011</a>], <span class="foreign i">passim</span>). Under such a
                     definition, focussed attention is a rare achievement. As Christopher Mole notes,
                     Philipp Koralus has suggested that such approaches could better encompass
                     divided attention if we think of attention as something structurally analogous
                     to the answering of a question [<a class="ref" href="#koralus2014">Koralus 2014</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mole2017">Mole 2017</a>]. Naomi Eilan also characterizes attention as “the means by which we answer
                     questions about the environment”

                     furthering this idea and for reconsidering the role such gadgetry can play in
                     our cognitive economy. This is a framework psychologists and philosophers are
                     using for thinking about cognitive processes (what we might call mind) as not
                     being solely brain-based but being distributed across the body, across social
                     groups, and also across the electronic gadgets that become extensions of our
                     cognitive selves. What does it mean to think about mind as dispersed across
                     objects external to our bodies? One of the key examples used to launch a central
                     line of enquiry in this field focuses on the cognitive function of memory and
                     the possibility for its extension outside of the body. In “The Extended Mind” (from 1998), Andy Clark and David Chalmers offer
                     the thought experiment of “Otto”, an Alzheimer’s sufferer
                     whose process of “remembering” relies on consulting a
                     notebook in which he has key facts written down. Exploring the role the notebook
                     plays in Otto’s beliefs and action, the authors argue that it constitutes a
                     technology of the extended mind because of the way it drives cognitive processes
                     – it “plays the role usually played by a
                     biological memory”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#clark1998">Clark and Chalmers 1998</a>, 12]. (It is important to note that it is not the <em class="emph">processes</em> of
                     consulting the notebook or referring to biological memory that are thought to be
                     equivalent here; what is similar is the role of the notebook and/or memory in
                     acting as the basis for beliefs and actions.) “Otto <em class="emph">himself</em>”, they conclude, “is best regarded as an extended
                     system, a coupling of biological organism and external resources”

                           museum and he believed the museum was on 53<span class="hi superscript">rd</span> Street. And just as Inga had her belief even before she
                           consulted her memory, it seems reasonable to say that Otto believed the
                           museum was on 53<span class="hi superscript">rd </span> Street even before
                           consulting his notebook. For in relevant respects the cases are entirely
                           analogous: the notebook plays for Otto the same role that memory plays
                           for Inga. The information in the notebook functions just like the
                           information constituting an ordinary non-occurrent belief; it just

                     technology in examples of extended mind theory, with Chalmers starting his
                     Foreword to Clarke’s book, <cite class="title italic">Supersizing the Mind</cite>,
                     with the claim that his iPhone “has
                     already taken over some of the central functions of my brain”. “Friends joke”, he goes on, “that I should get the iPhone
                     implanted into my brain, but if Andy Clark is right, all this would do
                     is speed up the processing, and free up my hands. The iPhone is part of
                     my mind already”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#chalmers2010">Chalmers 2010</a>, 1]. The implication of this for our relationship with technology has been
                     picked up by bloggers and commentators who have explored, for example, the
                     complex issues this theory raises for the real-life case of the rights of the
                     police to access a suspected terrorist’s smart phone [<a class="ref" href="#smith2016">Smith 2016</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Theories of extended mind ask us to rethink the nature of our relationship with
                     our electronic gadgets, and in turn we must rethink our relationship with the
                     possibilities for distributed attention they offer. Perhaps our tendency to keep
                     facts to hand in Wikipedia rather than in the brain, and to keep our sense of
                     direction in a map app rather than in our heads, is not so much a failure as a
                     success by other means: demonstrating a suitable deployment of extended mind
                     technologies. Perhaps our constant need to consult with these devices is not
                     necessarily a sign of lack of attention so much as a different kind of
                     attention. So, while distraction by new technology is not a new phenomenon, the
                     idea of “distracted reading” has a new currency and relevance in our
                     current moment in key part because of changing thinking about cognition. As we
                     begin to understand better the role digital gadgets play in our cognitive
                     economy, the capacity they hold for forms of distributed attention might be more
                     easily recognized and used constructively. What happens if we take this idea
                     into our research and our teaching, and harness the relationship between the
                     student or scholar and their electronic devices as a mode of distributed
                     cognition? What then (to follow up on the second and third strands of the
                     distributed cognition framework introduced at the start of this section) if we
                     also consider cognition as embodied, or as a social phenomenon among groups of
                     students and/or researchers?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">The contributors to this issue were not asked to engage specifically with the
                     concept of extended mind, or the framework of distributed cognition, but it is
                     interesting to see how much those ideas resonate with what is written here.
                     Edmond’s analysis of the process of research, for example, is one that speaks
                     profoundly to ideas of distributed cognition. She notes how the piling and
                     arrangement of papers on the top of a scholar’s desk becomes what we might call
                     an extended mind system for “arranging
                     ideas, building a knowledge organization system”. The messy, crowded
                     desk might facilitate the distracted processes of reading necessary for the type
                     of research practices she explores, or the systems of arrangements of papers on
                     the desk might “optimise certain kinds
                     of concentration”. Either way, the surface of the desk might become a
                     kind of cognitive technology. In the third essay, Hollander’s sense of the
                     personal digital device as as a sort of technologically extended mind has
                     important consequences for her pedagogical vision: taking on board the extended
                     mind capacities of the devices in the classroom she notes that her assessment is
                     now geared toward “test[ing]
                     research skills rather than memorization”. Similarly, Paul Fyfe
                     gestures towards this kind of cognitive extension when he points to Malcolm
                     McCullough’s work in <cite class="title italic">Ambient Commons: Attention in the Age
                        of Embodied Information</cite>, which notes how interface design is often
                     geared not toward demanding our focussed attention but toward introducing new
                     things to the periphery of our attention – making them available for more
                     central focus as and when needed. His interest in such “extended cognition” within our digital
                     environments might sound very familiar to extended mind theorists. In a rather
                     different way, Hassapopoulou’s interest in collaborative learning resonates with
                     the idea that social groups and networks can also provide extended-mind
                     environments. Finally, the claims for embodiment made repeatedly through this
                     issue make a great deal of sense in relation to work on embodied cognition.
                     Hassapopoulou writes of moving away from “ocular-centric paradigms of media
                     reception” to “challeng[e] our bodies to, literally, make <em class="emph">sense</em> of mediated
                     information using other modes of perception besides vision”. And
                     note, particularly, Fyfe’s comment about how critical-making projects can render
                     us aware of cognition as “an unfolding,
                     embodied relation”. Clearly, then, the recent interest in distributed
                     cognition (and its claims for the extension of mind across external devices,
                     social groups, and our bodies) makes itself felt in the concerns of this issue,
                     and creates a timely context in which to think about distraction and distributed
                     attention.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">This special issue aims to showcase and prompt new thinking around how we might
                     harness modes of attention that have been embedded in our everyday lives by
                     digital technologies. Our aim is to inspire new techniques for research and for
                     pedagogy, and to inspire innovation in method as much as we seek innovation in
                     content. More broadly, though, this special issue suggests that a new wave of
                     work in digital humanities is taking on, and will have to take on, the
                     revolution in cognition that is quickly transforming the way we think about our
                     relationship with digital technologies. The speed with which the digital
                     revolution changed older industrial processes is being matched by the speed with
                     which the cognitive revolution is, in turn, transforming our use of digital
                     technologies. Whether of the distributed or “in unison” kind,
                     more attention needs to be devoted to our cognitive engagement with digital
                     tools, and we need to continue to become more self-reflexive in our use of
                     them.
