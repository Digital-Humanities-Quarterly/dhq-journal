            <p>We can already begin to envision research projects that were scarcely, if at all,
               feasible in print culture. The papers in this collection allow us as well to
               enumerate the services and publication types on which emerging scholarship depends.
               We also need models for publication that meet the needs and realize the potential of
               the digital media and we describe here the Scaife Digital Library, a concrete example
               of true digital publication.</p>

            <quote rend="block" source="#emerson1971">I look upon the discontent of the literary
               class, as a mere announcement of the fact, that they find themselves not in the state
               of mind of their fathers, and regret the coming state of mind as untried, as a boy
               dreads the water before he has learned that he can swim. If there is any period one
               would desire to be born in, is it not the age of Revolution; when the old and the new
               stand side by side, and admit of being compared; when the energies of all men are
               searched by fear and by hope; when the historic glories of the old, can be
               compensated by the rich possibilities of the new era? This time, like all times, is a
               very good one, if we but know what to do with it.</quote>

            <quote rend="block" source="#vonhumboldt1821">Every human individuality is an idea
               rooted in actuality, and this idea shines forth so brilliantly from some individuals
               that it seems to have assumed the form of an individual merely to use it as a vehicle
               for expressing itself. When one traces human activity, after all its determining
               causes have been subtracted there remains something original which transforms these
               influences instead of being suffocated by them; in this very element there is an
               incessantly active drive to give outward shape to its inner, unique nature.</quote>
            <ref target="#vonhumboldt1821">Wilhelm von Humboldt, <title rend="quotes">Lecture to the
                  Prussian Academy,</title> 1821</ref>
         </cit>
         <p>When Emerson addressed Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1837, slavery was still an
            established institution and those who in Massachusetts favored its abolition, such as
            William Lloyd Garrison, were the dangerous radicals of their day and those who, like the
            author Lydia Maria Child, suggested racial equality found the doors of polite society
            slamming shut in their faces. Many twenty-first century readers will note the linguistic
            assumption that scholars are boys, fathers and men. Revolution has its own logic and
            revolutionaries should never forget that the critical pose which they apply to the
            present and the past will turn itself upon them when they have themselves passed into
            history — if, of course, they are so fortunate as to touch the historical memory of
            succeeding generations. If, in decades and generations to come, students of the ancient
            world read these words, we cannot now say where they may pause to wonder at how
            prescient the members of this early generation had been or where they may cringe and
            squirm. But all of those who contributed to this collection have dedicated their lives
            to a love for the past and that love allows us to embrace the future. The authors of
            this collection cannot predict what course events will assume or how they will appear to
            those who follow, but they have recognized the revolution of their own time and all have
            taken action to carry this revolution forward. </p>
         <p>Emerson does not really define the title of his talk, but for those of us who
            contributed to this collection, whether we happen to live in United States or not, Ross
            Scaife embodied the best qualities that a phrase such as the <title rend="quotes"
               >American Scholar</title> might suggest. Of course, Ross happens to have lived his
            life in the United States: born and educated in Virginia, trained as a scholar in Texas,
            Ross fashioned a home in Kentucky — and the many who had the privilege of visiting that
            home know how much literal truth there is in that statement. But Ross was a man unmoved
            by social convention or established authority. For him, the future was one of boundless
            possibility and the past was not a burden, but a foundation on which to build. He feared
            neither change nor continuity but evaluated each on its own merits according to the
            values that had grown strong within his heart. And like every true scholar from every
            nation and every period, he loved both grand ideas and the people around him with equal
            warmth.</p>
         <p>A generation from now, the course that classical studies and the humanities in general
            have taken may seem to have been a natural outgrowth of the early twenty-first century.
            And, indeed, we cannot say to what extent the larger forces at work within society may
            constrain the shape that our field will assume. But those of us who knew Ross also saw a
            man who anticipated far ahead of his fellows the importance of making our ideas
            accessible to the widest possible audience. The original proposal that secured funding
            to the Stoa called for a new generation of publications that would be designed from the
            start to be intellectually as well as physically accessible to an audience far beyond
            the narrow channels of twentieth century academic discourse. Blackwell and Martin in
            this collection articulate how this vision was, in fact, realized: Stoa publications
            such as Blackwell’s <title rend="italic">Demos</title>
            <note>
               <ref target="http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/home"
                  >http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/home</ref>
            </note> bring the broader public directly into contact both with his interpretation of
            Athenian democracies and with the primary sources on which his interpretations are
            based.</p>
         <p>Ross was among the first to recognize the importance of making our publications fully
            open — it is not enough to provide a single perspective via a single web site with
            primary and secondary sources. We need to make the source materials accessible — others
            need to be able to download what we produce, apply their own analytical methods, and
            even build new derivative works on what others have done. It is already difficult for us
            to remember how radical and far-sighted Ross was years ago. He had the vision to see
            what was obviously wrong at the time but would become obviously correct in the future.
            Ross embodied that profound originality that Humboldt describes in those who produce the
            times of which we are all products.</p>
         <p>In this conclusion, we synthesize some of the themes outlined and work described in the
            previous papers. We recall the categories of ePhilology and eClassics, first discussed
            in the <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000023/000023.html">introduction</ref>, and use these
            two categories to characterize two fundamental advances now becoming possible: our
            ability to begin increasingly complex intellectual projects with greater command of the
            underlying data and to answer finally the challenge, articulated in Plato’s <title
               rend="italic">Phaedrus</title>, that written words cannot explain themselves. We then
            shift to describe some of the basic services and collections that must be a part of any
            Cyberinfrastructure for classics and humanities. From there, we list the requirements
            for publication for a Cyberinfrastructure in which automated systems and broad based
            communities interact in novel, complex ways with our primary and secondary sources. We
            then describe the Scaife Digital Library (SDL), an open effort that integrates primary
            and secondary sources, has an immediate core of classical materials but also can manage
            content from many disciplines, and embodies more broadly and perfectly than any other
            effort with which we are familiar the needs of advanced research. While the SDL
            represents, in our view, a major step forward for classical studies and ultimately, we
            hope, for other disciplines, the SDL builds directly upon foundations that Ross Scaife
            laid over his decade of work on the Stoa Publishing Consortium.<note>

                  <p>And one day they taught Hesiod glorious song while he was shepherding his lambs
                     under holy Helicon, and this word first the goddesses said to me — the Muses of
                     Olympus, daughters of Zeus who holds the aegis:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Shepherds of the wilderness, wretched things of shame, mere bellies, we know
                        how to speak many false things as though they were true; but we know, when
                        we will, to utter true things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So said the ready-voiced daughters of great Zeus, and they plucked and gave me
                     a staff, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvelous thing, and breathed into me a
                     divine voice to celebrate things that shall be and things that were before; and
                     they bade me sing of the race of the blessed gods that are eternally, but ever
                     to sing of themselves both first and last.</p>

            </cit>
            <p>The Muses gave Hesiod a staff, and for the poet that is enough — few, if any, have
               produced poetry that has exerted such a spell over so many people from so many
               periods of time and disparate cultures as have the works of Hesiod and the Homeric
               Epics. All of us who live the life of the mind, whether we are poets or professors,
               follow our Muses. The staff that we have now taken into our hands is still rough and
               we are learning its balance and heft, but already we can begin to glimpse the stories
               that we will be able to see when the inspiration of our new muses takes full
               hold.</p>
            <p>The <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000023/000023.html">introduction</ref> to this
               collection distinguished two goals within a digital world. On the one hand,
               ePhilology emphasizes the role of the linguistic record in producing and organizing
               ideas and information about the ancient world. We use eClassics, by contrast, to
               describe Greek and Latin languages and literatures, wherever and whenever produced,
               as they live within our physical brains, touch our less tangible hearts and shape our
               actions in the world around us. We return now to these topics, suggesting how a
               Cyberinfrastructure, including both comprehensive collections and advanced, domain
               optimized services, can advance each of these goals. Memographies allow philologists
               to explore vast topics far too large for individual scholars in print culture.
               Plato’s challenge allows us to appreciate the magnitude of the opportunities before
               us now, as we can finally begin to address a critique of the static written word that
               is more than two thousand years old.</p>

               <p>It is easy to see how we can, in a digital environment, pursue our research topics
                  more extensively than was previously possible. We have also described how we can
                  make the sources of antiquity intellectually accessible to new audiences. We now
                  turn to the question of what research questions we can pursue that would not have
                  been feasible without collections that are, if not exhaustive, at least large
                  enough to be representative of the published record available in print.</p>

                  </note>) as a rough indicator of words on a typical newspaper page (c. 5,000),
                  North American English language newspapers printed perhaps 50 billion words each
                  year in the late 1860s. If we simply analyzed these newspapers, we could open up
                  whole new lines of inquiry, tracking a range of topics: Which newspapers reprinted
                  stories from which? What sorts of things did people say in newspapers from
                  different parts of the country with different party affiliations about slavery
                  over the course of time? What poetry and fiction appeared in these newspapers?
                  What products were advertised? All of these are eminently tractable problems: we
                  don’t need perfect transcriptions or perfect services to begin identifying the
                  trends behind these topics. If we begin to think about 19th century newspapers in
                  other languages around the world, the challenges and opportunities become even
                  greater.</p>
               <p>Clearly we can begin to pursue topics that require analysis of much more data than
                  any human being can see, much less contemplate. We can begin to trace topics that
                  have a life in human tradition that goes beyond any single period or immediate
                  context. Such topics have lives of their own. We can now write histories or (to
                  pursue the metaphor of living things) biographies of these topics. The geneticist
                  Richard Dawkins coined the term <term>meme</term> in 1976 to describe the cultural
                  counterpart to biological genes: memes include any thoughts or behaviors that can
                  be passed from one person to another and examples include <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#dawkins1976">thoughts, ideas, theories, gestures, practices, fashions, habits,
                     songs and dances.</quote>
                  <note>
                     <ptr target="#dawkins1976"/>. The above is drawn from the Wikipedia entry on
                     the topic: <ref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meme"
                        >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme</ref> (accessed August 23, 2008). </note>
                  The term <term>meme</term> provides a useful concept because it stresses the
                  autonomy of ideas as they circulate through our biological brains and storage
                  technologies. The concept of a meme allows us to consider both information about a
                  historical topic that existed in the material world (e.g., the life of the
                  historical Alexander the Great) and topics that have a life of their own (e.g.,
                  Alexander as a hero of Iranian folk tales). We use the term memography to describe
                  the history of a meme within a larger body of material.</p>
               <p>While the term <term>meme</term> may be new, the underlying concept is not. The
                  continuous tradition of European literature begins with the <title rend="italic"
                     >Iliad</title> and Achilles’ choice. He knows from his mother, the goddess
                  Thetis that he may choose a long but unremarkable life, soon forgotten, or he may
                  die young but win undying fame. Undying fame means that others will speak about
                  him and what he accomplished at Troy forever. He can trade life as a biological
                  entity for life as an idea that the songs of the epic tradition will pass from one
                  mind to another. The physical Achilles will pass sooner or later. But this new
                  entity — this object of thought and memory — will never die. Achilles knows ahead
                  of time that his death would secure for him the goal of all great heroes: he would
                  become a <term>meme</term> — a meme that succeeded because it jumped from the
                  medium of oral transmission into a network of material information
                  technologies.</p>
               <p>The biological Plato, likewise, vanished more than two thousand years ago but his
                  writings have been copied ever since and the historical Plato continues to exist
                  as the topic of discourse. Scholars could, in print culture before the advent of
                  searchable texts, laboriously track down many Platonic testimonia, e.g., the
                  explicit quotations and most obvious allusions to particular passages in Plato.
                  German classicists have begun to apply text mining algorithms to search for
                  quotations and allusions that previous generations missed.<note>For more on the
                     eAQUA project, see their website <ref target="http://www.eaqua.net/"
                        >http://www.eaqua.net/</ref> (accessed October 1, 2008).</note> If we wanted
                  to understand the role of Plato and the ways in which others have quoted and used
                  his dialogues, we would need to work in every language where Plato was
                  influential. This would include not only such common languages of classical
                  philology as Latin, English, French, German and Italian, but virtually every
                  European language that left behind a substantial body of written discourse. If we
                  then consider that Plato has had a major presence within Islamic thought and
                  realize that we will need to consider Arabic and Persian as well, it quickly
                  becomes clear that no single scholar can create from the primary sources a global
                  overview of Plato’s influence from antiquity through the present. The
                  nineteenth-century newspapers mentioned above present just another component from
                  the sources that shed light on who said what about Plato.</p>
               <p>In an age of very large collections, we can, however, begin to design systems that
                  will provide automatic visualizations of topics such as Plato and Plato’s
                  works.</p>
               <list type="unordered">
                  <item>Named entity analysis finds passages that refer to Plato the philosopher,
                     filtering out those passages that refer to other figures of the same name
                     (e.g., the Athenian Comic poet named Plato).</item>
                  <item>Quotation identification finds direct quotations and paraphrases of passages
                     in Plato.</item>
                  <item>Cross language information retrieval extends named entity and quotation
                     identification to multiple languages (e.g., Arabic, Chinese, Latin, English,
                     French, German, Italian, Russian and other languages for which major
                     cross-lingual resources are available).</item>
                  <item>Text mining identifies words and phrases that appear in conjunction with
                     references to and quotations of Plato. These words and phrases allow us to
                     discover common ideas associated with Plato across different genres and
                     periods.</item>
                  <item>Machine translation links similar words and phrases associated with Plato in
                     multiple languages, identifying cross-lingual cultural units.</item>
                  <item>Visualization systems allow readers to track, for example, where and how
                     often Plato’s Republic has been discussed, what passages have been most
                     examined, and what sorts of things people have said about Plato, whether in
                     Berlin or the Iranian university city of Qom.</item>
                  <item>Customization and personalization services then provide individual analysts
                     with relevant materials in languages that they understand as well as machine
                     translation and interactive translation support services to help them with
                     languages in which they have little or no fluency. Thus, the system might
                     present scholars of Islamic thought with translations of Plato and translation
                     support geared to their particular knowledge of Greek.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Each of the above and similar processes is analogous to the sensors by which
                  scientists track data in the material world. Each of the above processes will
                  produce noise as well as a usable signal. The results will not, of course, be
                  scholarship, but rather data within which patterns can emerge to stimulate
                  scholarship — in the end, human beings will have to contemplate what the systems
                  have found. They will refine the questions that they ask, contemplate the results
                  again, and then repeat their analysis in an iterative process. But, despite all
                  the noise within the system, we will quickly start to see patterns about who has
                  said what at various times about which passages of Plato in a variety of
                  languages.</p>
               <p>If we consider established genres of reference work such as lexica, grammars,
                  encyclopedias and editions, we can see that a wide range of topics constitute
                  memes that we could now begin to study. <list type="unordered">
                     <item>People and places: Any major person (Shakespeare, Abraham Lincoln) and
                        place (Rome, Athens) has a history within human imagination that goes far
                        beyond anything that we could analyze with traditional means.</item>
                     <item>Languages: Few scholars study Latin much as they may wish to: no one can
                        become sufficiently familiar with all the communities who wrote in Latin for
                        more than 2,000 years to describe the language as a whole. We can, however,
                        already begin to track patterns of syntax, style, and lexicography as they
                        change in different genres and periods.</item>
                     <item>Abstract concepts: Some concepts aggressively attempt to transcend
                        language and cultural barriers. Thus official Catholic doctrines are in
                        theory designed to be comprehensible to any speaker of any language. The
                        Pythagorean theorem both points to a mathematical concept and comprises a
                        metaphor for mathematical knowledge with its own history.</item>
                     <item>Texts: The Greek texts of Plato’s <title rend="italic">Republic</title>
                        and the Christian <title rend="italic">New Testament</title> are both
                        textual entities that have their own existence, in an open ended set of
                        language versions, as complete versions, as the source for quotation, and as
                        a foundation for allusion.</item>
                  </list> No one will ever be able to see, much less read and contemplate over time,
                  the primary sources underlying broad topics such as the history of Latin over two
                  thousand years or even the reception of Plato. Of course, this is hardly new: no
                  living humanist publishing on major canonical authors such as Homer or Shakespeare
                  can claim to have read and pondered more than a subset of conventional published
                  scholarship in the conventional languages of European and American scholarship.
                  But the rise of large collections and emergent systems with which to analyze those
                  collections allows us to shift our stance away from the limits of what we can read
                  with our two eyes and towards the challenges of working with machines that can
                  scan large bodies of material and then (as we will see through the discussion of
                  Plato’s challenge below) allow us to focus in detail on passages in more languages
                  and from more contexts than was possible before. </p>
               <p>A memography contains elements that are deeply traditional in form and general
                  purpose, even if it represents an engagement between author, reader and source
                  materials so quantitatively broader in scope as to constitute a radical change.
                     <title rend="italic">Demos</title> has only begun to adapt the scholarly
                  monograph to a digital form but it already illustrates the increased connection
                  between argument and primary source that we expect from a memography: <title
                     rend="italic">Demos</title> covers a major topic — Athenian Democracy — which
                  had grown so heavily worked that many publications on the topic stopped providing
                  direct citations to the primary sources on which their conclusions were based.
                     <title rend="italic">Demos</title> provides, wherever possible, not only
                  citations to the primary sources on which each statement is based but also
                  explanatory information — briefing materials, in effect — to support critical
                  analysis of the sources once found. The history of Athenian democracy is a
                  tractable subject. The history of the reception of Athenian democracy that
                  includes Islamic and Western views of Athenian democracy is a memography. Thomas
                  Martin’s <title rend="italic">Overview of Greek Civilization</title> (also
                  published separately as a book by Yale University Press)<note>
                     <ptr target="#martin1996"/>
                  </note> was published as an on-line product for the original Perseus CD ROM
                  publications and constitutes a subject so vast as to justify a memography.</p>
               <p>A memography, in effect, applies the same principles to even larger topics and
                  immediately requires automated methods. <title rend="italic">Demos</title>
                  exploited the digital environment of the early 21st century to more fully realize
                  the ancient goals of the monograph. When Thucydides invented the form of the
                  scholarly monograph, there were neither libraries of stable written sources nor,
                  if such collections had existed, were there the systems whereby he could reliable
                  cite these sources. In the historic passage where he describes his methodology,
                  Thucydides reports that he has sifted the evidence and generated from this his
                  best analysis of what happened (Thuc. 1.22). During the course of antiquity we
                  find authors who begin to quote other authors and we begin to find references for
                  previous works by author, work and even chapter length <q>books</q> (the amount
                  that a papyrus scroll could conveniently store). Print technology allowed us to
                  refine these citations so that we could describe precise variations between
                  multiple editions of a single work. <title rend="italic">Demos</title> set out in
                  the twenty-first century to restore to discussion on Athenian Democracy the
                  connection between statements and primary sources that the citation system on
                  which Roman historian Edward Gibbon could already in the eighteenth century
                  rely.</p>
               <p>Characteristics of a memography include: <list type="unordered">
                     <item>
                        <label>Citation</label>: A memography contains citations between statements
                        and the evidence on which they are based. A memography differs from a
                        traditional monograph because in a memography we know that authors have only
                        been able to scrutinize a subset of the evidence cited. Citations in a
                        memography include versioned queries: we can thus see what evidence was
                        available at the time when the memography was completed and how that
                        evidence has subsequently changed as new sources come on-line, existing
                        analytical tools become more powerful or wholly new services emerge.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>Scale</label>: A project becomes a memography as its scope brings in
                        more primary materials than a single human author can effectively analyze.
                        Topics so vast that authors in print culture needed to focus their work on
                        synthesizing specialized studies and could base their work primarily upon
                        the primary sources would be subjects for memographies. The author must
                        depend upon techniques such as sampling and automated analyses. A memography
                        of George Washington would, for example, require, as one foundational
                        dataset, the relative frequency of references to George Washington in
                        multiple periods, genres, languages and cultural contexts. Such figures
                        would require automated named entity analysis applied to very large
                        collections. The memography would include a human author’s assessment of the
                        accuracy of the automatically generated data.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>Heterogeneity</label>: Memographies include not only more content
                        than authors can review but content that assumes more categories of
                        background knowledge than individual authors can expect to acquire. Such
                        barriers can be language, cultural background, mathematics and any other
                        topic. The history of mechanics could thus justify a memography because it
                        requires not only a substantial understanding of mathematics and physics but
                        sources produced over millennia and across Europe, North Africa and the
                        Middle East in Greek, Latin, Arabic and every European language.
                        Memographies thus require scalable, automated systems that can provide
                        customized background information with which readers can examine and
                        manually analyze any given object referenced. Thus, readers without training
                        in Arabic but familiar with other languages and with the underlying
                        scientific contexts can use automated morphological analyses, links to an
                        on-line dictionary, and existing translations in languages that they do
                        understand to pull apart Arabic source texts and determine which words are
                        used in particular contexts to describe key concepts.<note>

                  </list> Whether we are producing or reading (or both), most memographies will
                  force us to interrogate primary materials from more contexts, linguistic, cultural
                  or both, than we can expect to have studied in detail — the most powerful memes
                  will work their way across time, genre, language and culture and it is this very
                  quality that leaves a trail too long and complex for any single human mind. We
                  must look to machines which can find and preprocess material relevant to a given
                  meme through immense bodies of data. </p>
               <p>The heterogeneity of background knowledge brings us again to the need for a
                  Cyberinfrastructure. The German-US Archimedes Project was able to assemble the
                  machine readable dictionaries, on-line source texts, morphological analyzers,
                  annotation systems and other resources needed to explore the history of mechanics.
                  Scholars without training in Arabic were, for example, able to work effectively
                  with materials in Arabic. Almost two decades ago, a formal evaluation of students
                  using the first generation of Perseus reading tools had already demonstrated that
                  students with no knowledge of Greek could produce analyses of Greek texts that, in
                  the view of external evaluators, matched the performance of students with advanced
                  training in the language.<note>

                  </note> One major purpose of a Cyberinfrastructure is to generalize these results,
                  providing a platform in which an increasing number of topics receive increasingly
                  sophisticated services with even more dramatic results than those obtained by
                  Perseus, Archimedes and other individual projects. </p>
               <p>New technologies can help us locate relevant currents in the vast oceans of source
                  material but we will still need to descend from our overview and think carefully
                  about some subset of the sources. While we will never be able to read everything,
                  it becomes all the more important for us to ponder a few things, carefully
                  selected, in great detail. In the past, practical issues such as language were
                  fundamental barriers: if we found a text in a language that we could not read and
                  did not have a human informant or translation, then we could literally do nothing.
                  That condition has begun to change. This leads us to the topic of eClassics and
                  Plato’s Challenge.</p>

                           but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they
                           always say only one and the same thing. </p>

               </cit>
               <p>In a famous paper, published in 1950, Alan Turing proposed what has been since
                  called the Turing test: a machine demonstrates intelligence when we cannot tell
                  whether we are conversing with a human or a machine.<note>
                     <ptr target="#turing1950"/>
                  </note> We propose a simpler challenge based upon a critique posed in Plato’s
                     <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title>. In that dialogue, Plato’s Socrates
                  critiques writing as inert and voiceless — we can no more ask the written word to
                  explain itself than we can carry on a conversation with a painting, however
                  lifelike it may appear. In a digital world, however, we can begin to address this
                  ancient critique: manually edited hyperlinks and search engines are only initial
                  instruments by which readers can make digital texts less opaque than their print
                  counterparts. Named entity analysis addresses questions such as <q>to which
                        <emph>Alexander</emph> does this particular passage refer?</q> and enables
                  services such as plotting the right Alexandria for a given passage on a map for
                  the relevant chronological period. Simple dictionary look-up tools answer
                  questions such as <q>what does this word mean?</q> Word sense disambiguation
                  systems allow us to determine the probability of a particular word sense in a
                  given context (e.g., Latin <emph>oratio</emph> as <q>speech</q> vs.
                  <q>prayer</q>). Text mining systems elicit key words and phrases by which
                  documents can begin to describe what they are about. We may be a long way from a
                  meaningful answer to the Turing test, but even relatively simple technologies have
                  allowed us to make progress against the challenge that Plato leveled against
                  information technology two and a half millennia ago.</p>
               <p>Addressing Plato’s challenge has important implications for the problems that
                  humanists choose to address. In 1972, Jacques Derrida published an essay,
                  translated into English in 1981 as <title rend="quotes">Plato’s Pharmacy</title>,<note>
                     <ptr target="#derrida1981"/>
                  </note> that featured the critique of writing in the <title rend="italic"
                     >Phaedrus</title>. In that dialogue, one speaker rejects the claim that writing
                  aids memory — writing is not a medicine but a poison, encouraging us to depend
                  upon writing and weakening our memories. Derrida’s essay probes the limitations of
                  what we can express in language and thus, innovative as it may have seemed,
                  reinforces the traditional scholarly focus upon questions that are obscure and may
                  indeed have no final answer (e.g., topics prominent in the <title rend="italic"
                     >Phaedrus</title> such as love and truth). </p>
               <p>If we address the <title rend="italic">Phaedrus</title> test, however, we find
                  ourselves looking at scholarship from the opposite direction. Derrida pondered the
                  limitations of language and logic. More traditional scholars such as the Latinist
                  D. R. Shackleton Bailey pondered the best variant reading in a given text or to
                  which Antonius a particular passage referred. Both focused upon the extremes,
                  where language or the historical evidence at our disposal had not been sufficient
                  for human analysis to generate a final decision. Scholarship largely focused on
                  outliers.</p>
               <p>In addressing Plato’s challenge, we focus less upon the 2% of instances where we
                  cannot readily determine to which Antonius an author refers than upon the other
                  98% where any reader, familiar with the context, can determine the intended
                  referent. To address Plato’s challenge, we need to maximize a machine’s ability to
                  recognize the dizzying number of simple referents that expert readers understand
                  without conscious effort. We shift from pondering the un-decidable to representing
                  deceptively simple operations in machine actionable form that we can apply
                  billions and billions of times. While we will continue to ponder the meaning of
                  concepts such as <q>justice</q> and <q>goodness,</q> we now need systems that can
                  reliably distinguish <q>iron</q> as metal from the verb by which we press
                  clothing. In classics, we could use a lexicon with more up-to-date information of
                  the various meanings of the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχή</foreign>, but
                  we need systems that can, with reasonable accuracy, distinguish where Greek
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχή</foreign> corresponds more closely to English
                     <q>beginning</q> or <q>empire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The introduction to this collection has already called for a Cyberinfrastructure,
                  including both collections and services, that can make an ever increasing body of
                  knowledge about the Greco-Roman world intellectually, as well as physically,
                  accessible to an ever widening global audience, supporting many languages and
                  cultural backgrounds. To accomplish this goal, we need not only clever software
                  and well-curated knowledge sources but vast collections from which we can harvest
                  increasingly larger amounts of machine actionable knowledge.</p>

            <p>The articles in this collection document a range of efforts, each of which is farther
               along today because of Ross Scaife’s patient and indeed loving support. We see no
               field within the humanities that has either made the material progress towards — or,
               even more important, fostered a community to develop and then use — infrastructure on
               which all of the humanities must depend in a digital world. In this section, we
               outline a plan forward and argue that any Cyberinfrastructure for the humanities as a
               whole should begin with classics.</p>
            <p>The center of gravity for intellectual life in every developed or developing society
               is now digital and humanity has already begun to arrange an infrastructure around
               that new center. The term Cyberinfrastructure, however, emerges from the National
               Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States and it was the NSF that funded the
               workshop from which this collection emerges.<note>The NSF first began to use
                  Cyberinfrastructure as a strategic term in a 2003 report often called the
                     <q>Atkins Report</q>, Atkins, Daniel E., et al. (2003). <title rend="quotes"
                     >Revolutionizing Science and Engineering Through Cyberinfrastructure: Report of

                     Cyberinfrastructure.</title>

                  2008).</note> We therefore begin this section by engaging with a discussion that
               may at first appear peculiar to the United States. In fact, our argument applies as
               well to Europe, China and every nation, large and small: if we are to prosper in the
               present, we must better understand the pasts of every community with whom we come in
               contact. Each nation needs Cyberinfrastructure that can not only preserve, augment,
               and export ideas about its own cultural heritage but that can import and make as
               intellectually accessible as possible the cultures, histories, and languages from the
               rest of humanity. Europe may preside over more languages and a longer historical
               record, but Europe is not the world. Nor is China, or India, or the Middle East — or
               all of these together. Every point on the globe is connected. Every cultural
               community must be prepared to interact with every other, whether history has, for
               better or worse, already bound them together for millennia or the contingencies of
               history have kept them apart.</p>
            <p>Within this larger context Greco-Roman antiquity provides a logical starting point
               for development. Several reasons stand out:</p>
            <p>First, Greco-Roman antiquity provides a cultural heritage that is fundamentally
               international. The Greco-Roman world physically stretched from Ukraine to Spain, from
               Morocco to Iraq, and from England to the Sahara. Intellectually, the Greco-Roman
               world provides a foundation for the entire Western Hemisphere. The two largest
               entities within this space, the United States and the European Union, must
               collaborate with each other and with every other group that can contribute. A focus
               upon Greco-Roman antiquity can thus balance the focus upon cultural heritages for
               which particular nation states must take responsibility. In the United States, we run
               the risk of replicating in our cultural infrastructure the Anglophone, geographically
               isolated, culturally leveling tendencies of our history and not preparing for the
               multi-lingual, physically interconnected, culturally complex world in which we
               actually live. Any Cyberinfrastructure for classics should draw seamlessly and
               naturally upon resources scattered across the globe.</p>
            <p>Second, though this collection has focused primarily upon the textual record, the
               vast body and variety of data about the ancient world come from archaeology. The
               study of the Greco-Roman world demands new international practices with which to
               produce and share information. The next great advances in our understanding of the
               ancient world will come from mining and visualizing the full record, textual as well
               as material, that survives from or talks about every corner of the ancient world.
               Individual nations will be best able to document the physical remains within their
               borders by integrating locally produced data in international networks of
               interoperable data. Cyberinfrastructure for Greco-Roman antiquity provides strong,
               constructive motives for individual ministries of cultures and similar institutions
               to think globally as well as locally.</p>
            <p>Third, beyond the influence of any one nation there exists today a finite textual
               corpus that has exerted and continues to exert, directly and indirectly, an immense
               influence upon human life. Much of this textual corpus and an increasing body of
               machine actionable knowledge associated with it is already available under open
               licenses.</p>
            <p>Fourth, Greco-Roman antiquity demands a general architecture for many historical
               languages. Even if we focus upon Greek and Latin, once we begin to contextualize
               these languages, we will find that we need to work with materials about the ancient
               near east of which Greece was one component and thus with languages such as Sumerian,
               Akkadian, Hittite, Old Persian, Coptic and Hebrew. As we consider the reception and
               influence of Greco-Roman culture, we must work with Syriac and Arabic, as well as
               with every language of Europe. To work with so many historical languages, we must
               develop an architecture that can integrate language specific content and services
               with general services. While we may focus initially on the languages and cultures of
               the Mediterranean and the Near East, these subjects, daunting as they may be, provide
               only a component of an environment that must include the historical languages and
               cultures of the Indian subcontinent, Asia and the rest of the world.</p>
            <p>Fifth, contemporary classical scholarship is multilingual. Many scientific
               disciplines manage the language problem by concentrating their publications in
               English. North American and European classicists alike are conventionally responsible
               for anything written in, as a minimum, English, French, German and Italian, while
               classical scholarship appears in Spanish, Modern Greek, Russian, Croatian, Dutch, and
               any other language spoken by classical scholars. Technologies such as cross language
               information retrieval (CLIR) are well-established and would be essential in a field
               such as classics, where scholars want to pose queries in one language to retrieve
               results in at least four modern languages for which they are officially
                  responsible.<note>For a survey of recent work, see the Cross Language Evaluation
                  Forum, which has been evaluating CLIR since 2000: <ref
                     target="http://www.clef-campaign.org/">http://www.clef-campaign.org/</ref>
               </note> Classics is one of the most fundamentally multilingual intellectual
               communities in the academy and provides the best humanities community within which to
               explore genuinely multilingual infrastructures.</p>
            <p>Sixth, our knowledge of the Greco-Roman world casts light upon residents of areas
               that were at some point part of the Greco-Roman world who are not professional
               academics. We have natural audiences who speak not only every language of Europe but
               Arabic, Farsi and Turkish. We must address the challenges not only of professional
               academics with extensive linguistic training in a handful of languages but of general
               audiences as well.</p>
            <p>Seventh, classical scholarship begins the continuous tradition of European literature
               and continues through the present. Classicists have in recent years led projects on
               topics such as the history and topography of London, multitexts of Marlowe and
               Shakespeare, the history of science, 19th century newspapers, and the American Civil
               War. These have provided us with tangible grounds to argue that the problems of
               classical studies raise a superset of issues that appear in the humanities before the
               rise of time-based media such as films and sound. An infrastructure that provides
               advanced services for primary and secondary sources on classical Greek and Latin
               includes inscriptions, papyri, medieval manuscripts, early modern printed books, and
               mature editions and reference works of the 19th and twentieth centuries. Even if we
               restrict ourselves to textual sources, those textual sources provide heterogeneous
               data about the ancient world. If we include the material record, then we need to
               manage videos and sound about the ancient world as well. A major classics development
               project should have allied projects, sharing the same infrastructure in
               representative domains (e.g., the History of Science, early modern studies, 19th
               century Anglo-American history and literature).</p>
            <p>Eighth, classicists have already devoted a generation to developing collections and
               services. They need a more robust environment and are ready to convert project-based
               efforts into a shared, permanent infrastructure. They have begun to outgrow the
               physical systems which they can, as projects, reasonably support. We thus shift
               discussion to the collections and the services that have already been developed to
               describe what is now feasible in this field.</p>
            <div>
               <head>Services for eClassics</head>
               <p>Services define what we can accomplish. We develop collections in conjunction with
                  services — even if that service consists solely of a mechanical lookup (e.g., call
                  up a particular passage by chapter and verse). We cannot call up Homer, <title
                     rend="italic">Iliad</title>, book 9, lines 44-48 unless we have a digital text
                  and structural markup for books and lines of Homer’s <title rend="italic"
                     >Iliad</title>. Backend services capture those processes that are available
                  automatically for all textual materials. Every classification service implies both
                  browsing, search and visualization services: i.e., if we identify commentaries
                  among OCR-generated text, we can search for all commentaries; if we recognize that
                     <emph>fecit</emph> is a form of <emph>facio</emph> (Latin <q>to do, make</q>),
                  then we can query <emph>facio</emph> and retrieve <emph>fecit</emph>. They provide
                  data on which customization and personalization services draw and to which users
                  respond with corrections and additions. Much fundamental work remains to be done
                  on discovering and perfecting services relevant to classical studies that
                  technology already enables. Ultimately, the decisions become social — technology
                  establishes what is possible but only those engaged in the study of classics can
                  assign, whether by conscious decision or default action, relative values to the
                  services that could be built. Nevertheless, after decades of collection
                  development within the field of classics, a number of services have begun to
                  emerge, some of them actively used for years. The following services represent a
                  core set, and should be components in any cyberinfrastructure for classical
                     studies.<note>For a discussion of cyberinfrastructure and classical studies,
                     albeit with a focus on scholarly publishing, please see <ptr

               </p>
               <p>The following list offers a minimal set of services, each of which can be built
                  with the technologies available today and each of which addresses established
                  problems relevant to classicists in particular and many humanists. The services
                  below largely address the problem of classification, i.e., applying a set of
                  criteria to find and/or to label materials. Different annotation tasks admit of
                  different levels of certainty: human readers can identify the correct
                  transcription for print on a modern page but lexicographers will disagree on the
                  senses of a given word. Nevertheless, these services aim at more or less
                  deterministic, right-or-wrong answers. We do not include below clustering and
                  other techniques that can detect patterns that require new categories. The
                  services below reflect basic tools on which more open-ended research depends.</p>

                  <p>Canonical text services allow us to call up canonical texts by standard
                     chapter/verse citation schemes. Christopher Blackwell and Neel Smith, working
                     in conjunction with Harvard’s <title rend="italic">Center for Hellenic
                        Studies</title> (CHS), have developed a general protocol for canonical text
                     services that provides essential functions for any system that serves
                     classicists — or any scholarly community working with canonical texts.<note>For

                     current OCR technology can be indexed by conventional citation (e.g., this page

                     have used tables to represent structured data and we need much better tools
                     with which to convert tabular data into semantically analyzed machine

                  <p>Morphological analysis takes an inflected form (e.g, <emph>fecit</emph>) and
                     identifies its possible morphological analyses (e.g., <emph>3rd sg perfect
                        indicative active</emph>) and dictionary entries (e.g., Latin
                        <emph>facio</emph>, <q>to do, make</q>). David Packard developed the first
                     morphological analyzer for classical Greek, <title rend="italic">Morph</title>,
                     over a generation ago.<note>For more on Packard’s system, see <ptr
                           target="#packard1973"/>, and for a discussion of Crane’s Morpheus, see
                           <ptr target="#crane1991"/>.</note> Gregory Crane began the initial work
                     on what would become the core morphological analyzer for Greek and Latin in
                     Perseus in 1984. Neel Smith and Joshua Kosman, then graduate students at
                     Berkeley, extended this work and created a library of subroutines that remain
                     part of the current code base for Morpheus. Morpheus is written in C, has been
                     compiled on a range of Unix systems over the course of more than twenty years,
                     and contains extensive databases of Greek and Latin inflections and stems. Of
                     all the classics specific services with which we are familar, Morpheus is the
                     most mature and well developed. The goal has long been to create an open source
                     version of Morpheus. Desiderata include new documentation, modern XML formats
                     for the stems and endings and a distributed environment whereby users can add
                     new stems and endings. </p>

                  <head>Syntactic Analysis</head>
                  <p>Syntactic analysis identifies the syntactic relationships between words in a
                     sentence; it allows us to provide quantitative data about lexicography (e.g.,
                     which nouns are the subjects and objects of particular verbs), word usage
                     (e.g., which verbs take dative indirect objects? where do we have indirect
                     discourse using the infinitive vs. a participle vs. a conjunction?), style
                     (e.g., hyperbaton, periodic composition), and linguistics (e.g., changes from
                     SOV to SVO word order). Even relatively coarse syntactic analysis can yield
                     valuable results when applied to a large corpus: working with our morphological
                     analyzer and a tiny Latin Treebank of 30,000 words with which to train a
                     syntactic analyzer, we were able to tag 54% of the untagged words correctly,
                     but the correct analyses provided a strong enough signal for us to detect
                     larger lexical patterns.<note>The development of the Latin treebank has been
                        documented in <ptr target="#bamman2006"/> and <ptr target="#bamman2007"
                        />.</note> More robust syntactic analysis based on very large treebanks can
                     yield accuracies of 80 and 85%. Human annotators can build upon preliminary
                     automated analysis to create treebanks, where every word’s function has been
                     examined and accounted for. Treebanks provide not only training data for
                     automated parsing but also explanatory data whereby readers can see the
                     underlying structure of complex sentences — a valuable instrument to support
                     interdisciplinary researchers from fields such as Philosophy or the History of
                     Science who are not specialists in Latin and Greek.</p>

                     reveal words that are closely associated (e.g., phrases such as the English
                        <q>ham and eggs</q>) and thus identify idiomatic expressions.<note>For some

                     Metrical analysis is particularly important for areas such as post-classical
                     Latin, which have very large bodies of poetic materials that will never receive

                     word sense disambiguation identifies when that word most likely corresponds to

                  <p>Cross language information retrieval (CLIR) allows users to pose a query in one

                     or Chinese). For classics, CLIR is an extremely important technology because
                     classicists are expected to work with materials not only in Greek and Latin
                     but, at a minimum, in English, French, German and Italian. CLIR is a mature

                  <head>Citation Identification</head>
                  <p>Citation identification is a particular case of named entity identification
                     that focuses on recognizing particular: e.g., determining whether the string
                        <q>Th. 1.33</q> refers to book 1, chapter 33 of Thucydides, line 33 of the
                     first Idyll of Theocritus or something else? Are numbers floating in the text
                     such as <q>333</q> or <q>1.33</q> partial citations and, if so, what are the
                     full citations? Primary source citations tend to be shorter and more variable
                     in form from the bibliographic citations found in scientific publications.
                     Perseus has, over the course of more than twenty years, extracted millions of
                     citations from thousands of documents but the citation extractors tend to be ad
                     hoc systems tuned for the subtly different formats by which publications
                     represent these already brief and cryptic abbreviations. In the million book
                     world, we need citation extractors that can recognize the underlying citation
                     conventions of arbitrary documents and then match them to known citations on
                     the fly (e.g, observe numerous references to Thucydides and then infer that
                     strings such as <q>T. 1,33</q> describe Thucydides, Book 1, Chapter 33).</p>

                  <head>Quotation Identification</head>
                  <p>Quotation identification can recognize where one text quotes — either precisely
                     or with small modifications — another even when there is no explicit machine
                     actionable citation information: e.g., it can recognize <q>arma virumque
                        cano</q> as a quotation from the first line of the <title rend="italic"
                        >Aeneid</title>. The fundamental problem is analogous to plagiarism
                        detection.<note>For more on plagiarism detection and quotation

                     other citation markers or between source texts that are tagged with different
                     citation schemes. Text alignment is one of the priorities of the Mellon-funded

                     morphological analysis, we flag that word as a possible error and associate the

                  <p>Markup projection services, implicit in many of the services above,
                     automatically associate machine actionable data from one source with the same
                     passage in another source. Thus, an index might state that a reference to
                     Salamis in passage A describes Salamis near Athens but that the reference in
                     passage B is to Salamis of Cyprus. Markup projection services would associate
                     those statements with all references to Salamis in various versions of passages
                     A or B, including not only full scholarly editions but also quotations of those
                     passages that appear in journal articles or monographs</p>

               <p>The fifteen basic services described above provide mechanisms whereby human beings
                  can think about the ancient world. Services are dynamic processes that depend upon
                  the algorithmic processing of pre-existing materials. Google and similar
                  comprehensive organizations succeed insofar as they have identified very general
                  algorithms that can generate useful results over thousands of domains to millions
                  of users. Algorithms are the core of computer science. Computer scientists seek to
                  maximize what can be computed and to minimize the pre-existing knowledge that a
                  system needs. In this context, if we can associate 90% of the geographic names in
                  90% of the English language internet with their locations to which they refer, we
                  may decide that the problem has been solved. Much of the work underway focuses
                  upon such first order approximations which are good enough for many people in many
                  contexts.</p>
               <p>The remaining 10% or 5% or even 1% may, however, be the space in which the most
                  interesting intellectual work takes place and thus the locus of that value which a
                  digital environment can offer. First, we may be most interested in finding the
                  uncommon instances that are much harder to find. Thus, it is easy to score well on
                  an ambiguous name such as Washington if we are looking for George Washington or
                  Washington state but much harder if we are looking for Washington, MA, or
                  Washington, GA. Second, we need to consider the issues of context. The patterns
                  that we find in English language documents from India and South Africa will, of
                  course, differ from those that we find produced in the US and the UK. If we remain
                  focused on the United States, the 1855 <title rend="italic">Harper’s Gazetteer of
                     the World</title> lists more than 150 places named Washington. The early 21st
                  century version of the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN) with which
                  Perseus researchers worked contained only 90 Washingtons. Thus even if we are
                  working with American materials in English but we shift our attention a century
                  and a half into the past, the services optimized for the present rapidly degrade.
                  If we push back into English collections from the 18th century the problem
                  worsens. If we work with early modern documents in English before standardized
                  spelling, the problem grows more complex still. And if we are working with
                  materials in other languages, our generic services may not only degrade but be
                  useless — how may place names can we find in Latin much less Greek or Syriac?</p>
               <p>Scholarship has always begun where obvious conclusions are not available or, on
                  deeper inspection, prove inadequate. In most cases, readers within a scholarly
                  community can automatically identify the people and places cited by a text but in
                  a small percentage of instances, these references are unclear. Scholars have spent
                  generations trying to decide to which Antonius a particular text refers or which
                  variant reading among the manuscripts (if any) most probably reflects what
                  Aeschylus composed. We may well be able to identify what texts of Plato people
                  have read in dozens of languages over thousands of years and see in a form that we
                  can understand the sorts of things that people have said about Plato as a whole, a
                  particular work of Plato or a particular passage. But such automated analyses and
                  visualizations provide only the starting point for meaningful interpretation.</p>
               <p>In this digital age, a major — and indeed, perhaps the important — portion of our
                  work must center on the space between where the machines can bring us and where
                  our intellectual aspirations lead. As technology advances, some scholarly tasks
                  become wholly automated and are thus obsolete as effective instruments of
                  scholarship. We may print the results of word searches as keywords in context but
                  the production of print concordances is at best a problematic activity: we are
                  better off creating an electronic text and then shuffling the words via various
                  algorithms. If we want to create more sophisticated visualizations, we are better
                  served marking the source text (e.g., identifying each dictionary entry) to create
                  a particular view of that data (e.g., a dictionary organized by dictionary entry
                  rather than inflected form).</p>
               <p>The following categories of document provide some, though by no means necessarily
                  all, of the foundational data on which we base our work with primary sources. Each
                  constitutes a structured environment through which we human authors communicate
                  with other authors and with automated systems. Each category of document can play
                  the following roles:</p>
               <list type="unordered">
                  <item>
                     <label>Training data:</label> Many systems depend upon a training set in which
                     human annotators classify phenomena (e.g., <q>bank</q> in passages x, y, z
                     corresponds to a financial institution, but to a river bank in passages a, b,
                     c). Part of each training set is set aside to serve as a gold standard: we test
                     various learning algorithms by training on one part of the training set and
                     then comparing how well it performs on the part that we set aside. Training
                     data thus does not have to be perfect to be useful — in fact, perfection is not
                     a relevant category. In reality, training sets include at least some ambiguous
                     examples and a mature environment must be able to distinguish levels of
                     certainty/community agreement. </item>
                  <item>
                     <label>Corrections and augmentations:</label> All of the services outlined
                     above include some element of probabilistic analysis. We may be able to
                     identify all variations across multiple versions of a text but still need to
                     refine the ways in which our system classifies differences (e.g., two texts may
                     differ because of an OCR or data entry error rather than because of an
                     editorial change). Our reference works should, insofar as possible, draw upon
                     and then refine and augment an initial automated analysis, thus allowing us to
                     focus time on those instances where we want to change or add to what the
                     machines have done. Our reference works thus provide a place to store our
                     response to the automated work. The audience for these reference works will
                     include both human readers and automated systems which will use the reference
                     works as a training source with which to provide better results.</item>
                  <item>
                     <label>Models and argumentation:</label> In the end, human authors will
                     continue to analyze, reflect and pose arguments. Print editions, lexicon
                     entries, and even indices of people and places contain models for what an
                     author wrote, what words mean, and what we think we know about the people and
                     places in a document. In a digital environment, these models must be explicit
                     and, where appropriate, encoded into a machine actionable form. Their
                     accompanying arguments must build upon automated methods not available in print
                     when these methods are relevant. We need reasoned arguments and these will
                     retain a familiar expository structure but accompanying data sets may be what
                     have the greatest impact upon intellectual life. The next monographic study of
                     a Greek word, for example, should include annotations that link the findings of
                     and arguments behind that study with the passages to which they are relevant.

               <p>The following describe some of the document types that we need in a digital

                  <head>Multitexts</head>
                  <p>The contribution of <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000029/000029.html">Dué and
                        Ebbott</ref> in this collection outlines the concept of a multitext. We use
                     the term multitexts here to describe methods to track multiple versions of a
                     text across time. The term multitext does not mean that editors cannot produce
                     their best attempt to reconstruct a source text no longer available to us — we
                     can represent a multitext as a network of versions with a single, reconstructed
                     root. We may well find that the new linguistic and analytical resources at our
                     disposal — especially resources such as treebanks and other categories of
                     linguistic annotation — will allow editors to place old questions on a
                     fundamentally new foundation and to provide new insights into the editions that
                     classical authors produced of their works.</p>
                  <p>The term multitext does, however, insist upon our ability to track and compare
                     versions over time. In many cases, the original words of an author are as
                     relevant as the Hubble telescope was to Galileo. Petrarch and Machiavelli did
                     not read Teubner Editions or Oxford Classical Texts. We are in a position to
                     begin modeling the texts of our authors as they appeared at different points of
                     time and even the textual universes in which different actors works. Scholars
                     in early modern studies, for example, need systems that can show us at a glance
                     how various sixteenth and seventeenth century editions of classical authors
                     differ from the modern editions that they have laboriously read.</p>
                  <p>First, digital editions are designed from the start to include images of the
                     manuscripts, inscriptions, papyri and other source materials, not only those
                     available when the editor is at work but those which become available even
                     after active work on the edition has ceased.<note>For further discussion of
                        this issue, see <ptr target="#monella2008"/>.</note> This is possible
                     because a true digital edition will include a machine actionable set of sigla.
                     Even if we do not yet have an internationally recognized set of electronic
                     identifiers for manuscripts, the print world has often produced unique names
                     (e.g., LIBRARY + NUMBER) that can later be converted into whatever standard
                     identifiers appear. A mature digital library system managing the digital
                     edition will understand the list of witnesses and automatically search for
                     digital exemplars of these witnesses, associating them with the digital edition
                     if and when they come on-line. If the digitized exemplars have associated
                     citation data (e.g., page X in MS Y corresponds to lines M to N of the Iliad,
                     segment A,B,C,D of a given page corresponds to line 38 etc.), then the digital
                     library system can automatically select the page or page segment relevant to a
                     given section of the edition. If that metadata is not present, then the reader
                     will simply have to find the relevant section by flipping through the
                     electronic pages of the witness.</p>
                  <p>Second, multitexts are versioned: they encode not only one reconstructed
                     edition produced by one editor but are designed from the start to represent
                     multiple editions.<note>For more on the importance of supporting versioned
                        multitexts, see <ptr target="#schreibman2003"/>.</note> Any reader should at
                     any time be able to call up visualizations and analyses of multiple editions,
                     seeing which editions are more closely related, which editions had the greatest
                     impact on subsequent editions, which editions are more dependent on particular
                     witnesses, etc.</p>
                  <p>Third, multitexts include multiple apparatus critici, but these apparatus
                     critici are machine actionable. Machine actionable means that textual comments
                     are encoded in such a way that readers can compare the text with readings from
                     MS A vs. MS B and/or select their own readings. While there can be multiple
                     apparatus critici, each apparatus criticus must build upon the same set of
                     common identifiers: a machine must be able to determine that B in one apparatus
                     criticus corresponds to V in another.</p>

                  <head>Parallel Texts</head>
                  <p>The multitext as described above only covers versions of a text within a single
                     language. In many cases, however, literary texts have exerted their influence
                     in translations that were one or more languages removed from the original.
                     Shakespeare’s worked with Thomas North’s translation of Plutarch, but Thomas
                     North translated Jacques Amyot’s French translation of Plutarch, rather than
                     Plutarch’s Greek. We have to remember that many Greek texts exerted much of
                     their influence when they circulated in Latin or Arabic translation. We need
                     parallel texts of multiple linguistic versions</p>
                  <p>The contribution of <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000033/000033.html">Bamman and
                        Crane</ref> to this collection introduces the concept of parallel texts and
                     their application to lexicography. Parallel texts can include a single edition
                     and translation (like the Loeb and Budé series) but can also include multiple
                     translations in multiple languages aligned with multiple editions (e.g., an
                     Italian translation of Aeschylus that contains variant translations for a
                     number of major editions). Parallel texts assume some level of common citation
                     schemes: e.g., chapter 86 of book one of Thucydides in an English translation
                     roughly corresponds to the Greek in chapter 86 of book one of Thucydides in
                     standard editions. The more numbered sections, the more precisely citation
                     schemes can align source texts and translations. Parallel text analysis and
                     automatic alignment software can, however, discover many instances where words
                     in the translation correspond to words in the source text. Even if we restrict
                     ourselves to high probability correspondences, we can align our texts far more
                     closely than any traditional citation system. Put another way, once we have
                     page sized chunks of text and translation aligned, automatic alignment can do a
                     better job than manually added structures such as section markers. Such section
                     markers are probably most useful for human readers who want to extract logical
                     chunks. Automatic alignments would be familiar to those who work with Plato and
                     Aristotle, where editions use the page breaks and page sections of particular
                     editions rather than the logical structure of the text itself.</p>
                  <p>Once we have established the correspondences between different linguistic
                     versions of the text, we need automated methods to help identify likely
                     locations where those versions diverge, whether because a translator
                     misunderstood the original or because the idea of translation was looser than
                     that of later periods. Finally, we need methods whereby scholars can annotate
                     these differences according to the patterns which they determine are
                     significant.</p>

                     continuously, and their information is from the start structured to support
                     morphological, syntactic and semantic queries. True machine actionable
                     dictionaries must articulate word senses in such a way as to help both human
                     and machine readers to recognize these senses as precisely as possible.</p>

                  <p>Treebanks are databases that label the syntactic role of each word in a set of
                     sentences. These syntactic tags constitute parse trees (hence the name) that
                     can be used to analyze lexical, syntactic and even rhetorical patterns.<note>
                        <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000033/000033.html">Bamman and Crane</ref> in this
                        collection; for sample Treebank data and bibliography, see <ref

                     </note> Treebanks tend to have fairly compact tagsets — they might not encode
                     purpose clauses per se but allow users to query for patterns such as <hi
                        rend="italic">ut</hi> followed by a subjunctive.</p>
                  <p>Syntax is important but by no means the only subject of linguistic annotation.
                     Co-reference annotation maps pronouns to their referents (e.g., <q>he</q> in
                     passage X refers to Julius Caesar). Annotation languages have emerged to
                     capture higher level semantic phenomena such as temporal expressions (TimeML).<note>
                        <ref target="http://www.timeml.org/">http://www.timeml.org/</ref>.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We use machine actionable grammars to describe resources comparable to print
                     grammars. These may have hundreds or thousands of observations, each roughly
                     corresponding to the numbered paragraphs of their print predecessors. But in a
                     machine-actionable grammar, each paragraph would include not only citations but
                     a set of patterns (e.g., <hi rend="italic">ut</hi> heading a subordinate clause
                     followed by the subjunctive) and some indication of the precision (how many
                     false hits the pattern would retrieve) and recall (how many correct hits the
                     pattern would miss). The machine-actionable grammar would thus build on the
                     treebank. Where the treebank would stress use of a smaller number of categories
                     to describe the relations of individual words, machine readable grammars would
                     suggest an open-ended set of more complex phenomena inferred from the corpus.

                  <p>The contribution by <ref target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000031/000031.html">Elliott and
                        Gillies</ref> in this collection outlines the major issues surrounding
                     geographic information in classical studies. We also need to represent
                     information about people, organizations, technical/scientific terms and other
                     entities with regular features.</p>
                  <p>The underlying principal of machine actionable indices is the same as that of
                     their print antecedents. Machine actionable indices differ in at least two
                     ways. First, the structure of the index entries is explicit: we can extract
                     headwords, hierarchical structures (e.g., <q>Athens, (1) Religion …. (2)
                        Government …</q>) descriptive labels (e.g., <q>born at X,</q>
                     <q>stood for consul in Y</q>), and associated citations. Second, index
                     headwords contain the most general possible identifiers. Thus, we don’t simply
                     cite Athens, Greece, or Thucydides the Historian, but add the identifiers such
                     as the numbers for Athens (TGN 7001393) and Thucydides (TLG 0003) in the <title

                  <head>Propositional Knowledge</head>
                  <p>Propositional knowledge includes standard database fields: e.g.,
                     author=Thucydides + Title=History-of-the-Peloponnesian-War in effect states
                     that Thucydides is the author of the <title rend="italic">History of the
                        Peloponnesian War</title>. Propositional data is, however, designed to
                     support reasoning: e.g., if two people share the same two parents, then we can
                     infer that they are also siblings; if someone was born after an author died,
                     then the works of that author cannot refer to that person.</p>
                  <p>Such propositional reasoning rapidly becomes computationally complex. More
                     significantly, the underlying propositions rapidly become idiosyncratic, as
                     each observer creates slightly different categories and our propositional
                     knowledge becomes internally inconsistent — as soon as computer scientists
                     began converting print reference works such as the <title rend="italic">Oxford
                        English Dictionary</title> to digital form, they discovered that human
                     editors were never fully consistent.<note>

                     </note> If we restrict ourselves as much as possible, however, to established
                     ontologies (a common set of propositions), then we can build off the work of
                     others. Insofar as we can share the same ontologies with broader communities,
                     we have a chance to create propositional knowledge that can be integrated with
                     propositional knowledge from other sources, creating a much larger and more
                     powerful knowledge base than any single project could develop. Put another way,
                     a large number of propositions describing a finite set of well-defined
                     phenomena will probably yield far more useful results. Individuals may extend
                     shared vocabulary with their own categories but retain a common set of
                     categories by which at least part of their data can interact with other
                     systems. All of the reference works listed above depend upon propositional
                     knowledge of the form <q>A has property B</q>: the string <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">

                     treebank contains compound propositional statements such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >agricola</hi> is-a noun and <hi rend="italic">agricola</hi> is-subject-of
                        <hi rend="italic">fecit</hi>. We include propositional knowledge as a
                     separate category to emphasize categories not included above. Thus, the
                     CIDOC-CRM ontology includes a wide range of categories for art and
                     archaeological objects and HEML provides a vocabulary for describing people,
                     places and events in time.<note>

                  <p>A true digital commentary must build judiciously upon all of the tools listed
                     above. Full commentaries should include annotations identifying every
                     phenomenon of interest to its intended audience: every word should be
                     morphologically disambiguated, every sentence should have its syntactic data
                     encoded; every major variant should be labeled; every person and place should
                     have at least one identifier from a general work or a label indicating that
                     this is a place/person/institution not yet in available reference works and a
                     new identifier. Put another way, if scholars have developed a widely recognized
                     classification scheme (word senses in a lexicon, numbered paragraphs in a
                     standard grammar, metrical analyses), then fully commented texts will have
                     categorized every instance of each relevant phenomenon in a text. And, of
                     course, commentaries must from the start allow commentators to include variant
                     explanations for the same phenomenon (e.g., proposographic disputes about which
                     Antonius is meant, textual arguments about which reading is correct).</p>

               and the general understanding of the past.</p>
            <p>Before discussing some of the essential features that characterize true publication
               in a digital age, we distinguish, in the context of this discussion, archives and
               libraries. For our purposes, libraries provide the foundation on which public
               discourse takes place. Libraries constitute the most advanced and efficient space
               with which society is able to conduct discourse that extends across time and space
               and that depends upon preservation of, and access to, the terms of discussion.</p>

                     Greek books, as to exceed in that respect all those who are remarkable for such
                     collections; such as Polycrates of Samos, and Pisistratus who was tyrant of
                     Athens, and Euclides who was himself also an Athenian, and Nicorrates the

                     countryman Ptolemaeus, surnamed Philadelphus, bought them all, and transported
                     them with all those which he had collected at Athens and at Rhodes to his own
                     beautiful Alexandria. </quote>

               <p>Our varied conceptions of a library are both descriptive and prescriptive: these
                  conceptions shift as material culture changes the methods with which we can manage
                  information. In the Greco-Roman world, Alexandria had the most famous library and
                  every lover of Greek literature sighs to think of the tragedies of Aeschylus,
                  Sophocles, and Euripides, the poems of Sappho and the other works that once lay
                  among its holdings and are now lost. The library at Alexandria was based upon
                  miraculous technologies such as papyrus production and sea-born travel as well as writing.<note>

               </p>
               <p>Popular conceptions of institutions such as libraries evolve along with the
                  capabilities of their enabling technologies. The ancient library at Alexandria was
                  not the instantiation of a Platonic ideal but the best use of the most advanced
                  methods of the time. The library at Alexandria brought texts from around the Greek
                  world into a single location. In the industrialized world, we have used
                  industrialized print technologies to create hundreds of large libraries around the
                  world, in effect protecting long-term access by maintaining multiple copies of the
                  same work in widely separate locations. In the digital world we can not only
                  create far more numerous copies and greater redundancy but our libraries are no
                  longer inherently limited to physical locations.<note>For more on this theme see
                        <ptr target="#campbell2006"/> and <ptr target="#pomerantz2007"/>.</note>
                  They can at any point reach any point on the earth. Twenty-first century
                  collections become libraries only insofar as they fulfill the need to provide
                  access over time and across space. Long term preservation and global access are
                  foundational challenges for our new information infrastructure.<note>This issue
                     has been discussed by many, including <ptr target="#smith2008"/> and <ptr

               <p>The passage quoted attributes to an intellectual of the second century CE the
                  claim that he had assembled an unparalleled collection of ancient Greek books. Two
                  features from the underlying Greek are worth noting. First, no word corresponding
                  to <q>library</q> actually appears: the Greek phrase (<foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >bibliôn ktêsis</foreign>) describes the <q>possession of books</q> and does
                  not designate either a place or an organization. Second, the passage above speaks
                  in terms of individuals and collectors. The one exception, Nelius, is not a
                  librarian: the Greek text probably includes an error but the term applied to
                  Nelius (<foreign xml:lang="grc">diatêrêsanta</foreign>) states that he preserved
                  the books of Aristotle and does not designate a generalized occupation such as the
                  term librarian implies. We have left the nineteenth century translation unchanged
                  to illustrate how easily we all project the categories of the present into sources
                  from the past.</p>
               <p>A collection of hand-written documents, however, did not fit the dominant
                  conceptions of libraries that took shape in print culture. We still call the
                  ancient manuscript collections of Europe libraries because they bore this name,
                  but in the massive libraries that emerged in the 19th century manuscripts,
                  pamphlets and everything that did not fit the exacting demands of academic
                  publication was preserved in special collections and archives. There, these
                  documents would await the scholar who would cull them for information or create
                  printed editions of them that could circulate and play an active role in the
                  mainstream of intellectual life. For each surviving ancient text of Greek and
                  Latin the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi>, the first printed edition, no
                  matter how problematic its contents, represented a milestone and a new birth,
                  marking the transition from handwritten manuscript into the new technology of
                  print. Works still available only in manuscript were, in print culture, the
                  material for published editions and printed facsimiles. They had not yet been
                  published in print and thus were not yet a part of the citable record upon which
                  general human discourse could depend.</p>
               <p>In the past decade, the academic library system has quietly shifted again. The
                  print libraries of the 19th and 20th century have, in effect, become the archives
                  of the 21st century, as publication and discourse in the most heavily supported
                  disciplines have shifted entirely to a digital medium. The debate about print and
                  digital information may continue but the infrastructure of mainstream intellectual
                  discourse is now digital. The hotter the scientific discipline, the shorter the
                  half-life of its publications — the last five or ten years of published material
                  is enough to support many and probably most cutting edge research projects.
                  Biologists studying changes in flora and fauna need access to as much historical
                  data as possible — for them observations from the 18th century provide
                  foundational data. The <title rend="italic">Biodiversity Heritage Library</title>
                  may be the last major historical collection to be digitized within the
                     sciences.<note>See <ref target="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/"

                  </note> With this project, the last major community of scientists is leaving the
                  print world — and even these scientists maintained their own separate print
                  library infrastructure: all ten of the institutions participating in the
                  Biodiversity Heritage Library draw on specialized libraries that were already
                  distinct from the libraries upon which humanists depend (e.g., the Harvard
                  University Botany Libraries rather than Widener Library).<note>American Museum of

               <p>But just because information is on-line does not mean that that information has
                  exploited the full potential of the digital medium. The debate has shifted instead
                  to the question of open vs. closed access. The extraordinary cost increases for
                  scientific journals have done more than anything else to drive the principle of
                  open access — roughly one quarter of the entire acquisition budget for the Tufts
                  University library in 2007, for example, went to a single scientific publisher,
                  which does not invest any significant sums in the research that it publishes.<note>

               <p>The massive library collections at Harvard University have been a magnet for
                  scholars and the university has traditionally been quite conscious of the
                  investment it has made and the advantages which that investment confers upon it —
                  the Boston Library Consortium is often described as <q>everyone but Harvard.</q>
                  Nevertheless, Harvard University surprised many observers by taking a dramatic
                  stance in favor of open access. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard
                  University voted in February 2008 <q>to give the
                     University a worldwide license to make each faculty member's scholarly articles
                     available and to exercise the copyright in the articles, provided that the
                     articles are not sold for a profit.</q>

                  </note> The ruling automatically applies to all faculty publications and
                  individuals must <q>request a waiver of the license
                     for particular articles where this is preferable</q> — faculty cannot,
                  according to the language of the press release, simply refuse to exempt themselves
                  but must request waivers on a case by case basis. Steven E. Hyman, Provost at
                  Harvard University framed the new policy in terms of responsibility: <q>The goal of university research is the creation,
                     dissemination, and preservation of knowledge. At Harvard, where so much of our
                     research is of global significance, we have an essential responsibility to
                     distribute the fruits of our scholarship as widely as possible.</q> Harvard
                  is, of course, only a single institution but the actions of its faculty and
                  administration provide a powerful example of how conventional thought has begun to
                  shift.</p>
               <p>Google may ultimately solve the problem of access to the earlier print record.

               <p>Scholars have written about the ancient world since antiquity itself, and we build
                  upon more than half a millennium of the scholarship that print made possible. A
                  great deal of material about the Greco-Roman world exists in digital form, but
                  only a small subset of that material can fulfill its potential in a digital world.
                  The essential criteria for true publication are different in the digital world
                  because the digital world supports services that are not feasible in print and can
                  reach audiences millions of times larger than academic print publications could
                  reach. The fact that a resource exists in a digital format is a necessary but not
                  sufficient condition: just because an object of potential relevance to classics is
                  digital does not mean that it is useful.</p>
               <p>Not only the print volumes that sit upon our library shelves but the digitized
                  publications to which commercial entities sell access have all become, within the
                  digital world, archival materials, tied to a few discrete points on the earth and
                  membership in specialized organizations. Whatever the merits of their content,
                  these essays are important because, despite the vast body of existing scholarship,
                  these essays are among the first original works of classical scholarship to meet
                  the minimal criteria for publication in a digital age.</p>
               <p>Scholarly publication in a digital age must satisfy at least the following four
                  conditions. These four conditions overlap, of course, with those familiar from
                  five centuries of print culture, but, of course, they also must adapt to the
                  digital foundation on which all shared intellectual expression already
                  depends.</p>
               <p>First, the content must be of interest to someone other than its producers. In
                  academia, we have developed peer review as an instrument to assert that a
                  particular intellectual production has sufficient value to warrant a permanent
                  place in the scholarly record and we used traditional peer review in this
                  collection as well. Peer review is, of course, no guarantee — and readers will
                  come to their own conclusions about what is published here, as they do about
                  everything that they read. Other models exist to achieve the same goal and we
                  should not confuse the instrument of peer review with its purpose.<note>For a look
                     at how institutional repositories could help to create new models for journals
                     and peer review systems, see <ptr target="#bankier2008"/>; for a good
                     discussion of the need to reevaluate all aspects of scholarly publishing see
                        <ptr target="#hahn2008"/>.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Second, the content must be in a format that we can preserve and use for long
                  periods of time. Print culture developed for the organization of books and
                  articles conventions that have proven so successful as to become almost invisible:
                  we take tables of contents, chapters, footnotes, indices, bibliographies and other
                  conventions for granted. In a digital environment, machines are the first and
                  essential readers of all published materials — where more is written than any one
                  person can digest, we depend upon what machines can extract to identify those few
                  objects on which we can focus the limited attention and intellectual capacity of
                  the human brain. The articles in this collection express their basic structures in
                  a standardized format that machines can understand. More sophisticated documents
                  will surely emerge but these are likely to enhance, rather than abandon, the
                  structures within this collection. By investing in the XML markup we have
                  conformed to the best practices of the present so that the digital librarians in
                  future generations can manage these articles within their digital collections.</p>
               <p>Third, the content must have at least one reliable long-term home. In print
                  publication, authors needed publishers to put their work into circulation.
                  Publishers committed, however, only to provide very short-term access.
                  Preservation in print culture has always been the task of libraries. Even if war
                  or natural catastrophe destroyed one library, other libraries preserved separate
                  copies of each work and these could be reprinted or reproduced with increasing
                  facility. In a digital age, distribution is trivial — any web page could in early
                  2008 reach more than half a billion machines.<note>The Internet Systems Consortium
                     published for January 2008 an estimate of c. 600,000,000 machines: <ref
                        target="https://www.isc.org/">https://www.isc.org/</ref>, accessed August
                     16, 2008.</note> Preservation is, however, a major challenge. Classicists know
                  that they can usually track down copies of the most obscure 19th century
                  dissertations somewhere because libraries have worked hard to preserve academic
                  publications. A 2005 study found that half of the URLs cited in a 1995 issue of
                     <title rend="italic">D-Lib Magazine</title>, a major venue for publication, no
                  longer worked <ptr target="#mccown2005"/>. Libraries have, however, moved to
                  address this situation and have created institutional repositories with which to
                  fulfill in this new digital world their ancient mandate of preserving what they
                     collect.<note>For more on the growing recognition of the importance of
                     institutional repositories, see <ptr target="#hockxyu2006"/>.</note> The
                  articles in this collection are part of the permanent collection of the University
                  of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) libraries.</p>
               <p>Fourth, the content can circulate freely — it is, indeed, truly public and thus
                  published. A decade ago, this idea was radical and unnerving to many of us, but
                  the Stoa Publishing Consortium always supported open access from its creation in
                  1997. In the quotation that opens this section, Plato’s Socrates expresses anxiety
                  that information, once represented in a physical medium is separate from its
                  producers and begins a life of its own. In the end, we have overwhelming reasons
                  to leave these anxieties behind. First, we need both our primary and secondary
                  sources to be open for analysis by as many systems as possible if we are to
                  exploit the full power of the digital world and to fulfill our professional
                  obligations as scholars. Second, each scholar, department, discipline, college,
                  and university is, at some level, locked in a Hobbesian war of all against all.
                  College and university web sites are very expensive to produce and maintain but
                  they are freely accessible because each institution is competing for exposure.
                  Subscription revenues do not pay for scholarship. Third, we have plenty of money
                  in the system to pay the costs. During 2005, the 123 members of the Association of
                  Research Libraries invested more than 1.1 billion dollars in their
                     collections.<note>ARL Statistics 2005-06: <ref
                        target="http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/arlstats06.pdf"
                        >http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/arlstats06.pdf</ref>, accessed September 30,
                     2008.</note> Our interest lies in maximizing exposure. We need to shift from
                  importing the products of third parties and towards exporting the productions of
                  our scholars, departments, and disciplines. Some of the authors in this collection
                  remember hearing that it would be impossible for libraries to provide access to
                  electronic materials — they didn’t have enough resources to collect print.
                  Likewise, we heard that universities could never support web sites — they were too
                  expensive and the budget was already overstressed. Nothing can ever change — but
                  everything always does in the end. The first three reflect a narrowly construed
                  Hobbesian model of self-interest, but they all support the fourth and most
                  important reason. We have a moral obligation as scholars to preserve, expand and
                  disseminate, as broadly as possible, as much of the human record to as much of
                  humanity as possible. For this reason, we have adopted a Creative Commons license
                  not only for the publications in this collection but for all of our work.</p>
               <p>Peer review, the <title rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</title> (DHQ)
                  XML style-sheet, institutional repositories and Creative Commons licenses are the
                  four instruments by which we address ideals of content, form, stability and
                  openness inherent in true digital publication.</p>

               <quote rend="block" source="#canonical">The advice of Themistocles had prevailed on a
                  previous occasion. The revenues from the mines at Laurium had brought great wealth
                  into the Athenians' treasury, and when each man was to receive ten drachmae for
                  his share, Themistocles persuaded the Athenians to make no such division but to
                  use the money to build two hundred ships for the war, that is, for the war with
                  Aegina. This was in fact the war the outbreak of which saved Hellas by compelling
                  the Athenians to become seamen. The ships were not used for the purpose for which
                  they were built, but later came to serve Hellas in her need.</quote>

            <p>Themistocles somehow convinced his fellow citizens to forego a windfall payment and
               to invest instead in a navy. Even then, the nominal object of the navy — a war with
               the nearby island of Aegina — masked the vastly greater, but inconceivably distant,
               Persian threat. Aegina looms as a presence visible from the Acropolis. Herodotus
               elsewhere (Hdt. 5.53) reports that the Persian capital at Susa was a three-month
               journey from Ephesus on the West coast of modern Turkey. </p>
            <p>While most of us remained focused upon publishing our own work under our own name and
               building digital resources that would serve our own projects, Ross Scaife early
               realized that there were bigger issues at stake than a few drachmas of scarce
               prestige in a small academic field. The idea behind the Scaife Digital Library (SDL)
               reflected Ross’s own long-term interests: a 1997 grant from the Fund for the
               Improvement for Postsecondary Education helped Ross Scaife found the Stoa Publishing
               Consortium to pioneer new models of publication to enhance learning and intellectual life.<note>

            </p>
            <p>The SDL is a new, virtual collection designed to support the digital publications
               that meet the four criteria outlined above. The first plans for the SDL were
               presented at the beginning of a two day workshop on <q>What do you do with a million
                  books?,</q> Humboldt University in Berlin on March 17, 2008, two days after Ross
               Scaife died in Kentucky. On August 6, 2008, the Institute for the Study of the
               Ancient World, based at New York University, funded a planning meeting hosted at
               Harvard’s CHS in Washington, DC. The first release of the SDL was announced on
               November 6 of the same year, at the TEI Annual Meeting at King’s College London.</p>
            <p>The SDL contains durable digital objects that satisfy the four criteria of digital
               publication outlined above: <list type="ordered">
                  <item>The content has been judged worth preserving. Peer review is the most
                     established mechanism to establish this judgment. </item>
                  <item>The content is in a defined, approved format suited for preservation over
                     long periods of time. Examples include XML documents encoded according to the
                     Guidelines of the TEI and of EpiDoc.<note>
                        <ref target="http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/"
                           >http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/</ref>; see also <ref

                        this collection.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>Each object has a long-term institutional home separate from the individual
                     or group that produced it. Digital repositories at Brown University, NYU, Tufts
                     University, and UIUC among other institutions currently store the initial
                     objects in the SDL. </item>
                  <item> Each object is available under an open license. Where authors create
                     documents to present a particular scholarly voice at a particular time, an open
                        <emph>access</emph> license should allow third parties to quote and
                     republish the document but not to change its content. Where authors create
                     works designed to encapsulate general and evolving points of view (e.g.,
                     lexica, commentaries, editions), then an open <emph>source</emph> license is
                     necessary so that third parties can, in fact, modify the content. In this case,
                     versioning systems track and identify who was responsible for each
                     change.</item>
               </list> The SDL is simultaneously an idea, a concrete collection, and an organization
               to produce new content. Any digital objects that satisfy the four criteria of
               publication automatically belong to the SDL — thus every article already published by
               the DHQ can be treated as part of the SDL because each DHQ article satisfies all four
               criteria. Ross Scaife was a classicist and classics offers the initial center of
               gravity for the SDL, but we exclude nothing relevant to the humanities.</p>
            <p>The SDL is also a concrete collection: it includes a catalogue of known objects and
               the information needed for automated services to collect each digital object from its
               home repository. We hope to see objects from the SDL in a range of locations and
               organizations: with Internet giants such as Google, at particular computational and
               storage Grids, and on local computing clusters.</p>
            <p>Finally, the SDL is an organization designed to produce new content. The production
               of new SDL content can be a simple decision that any digital object produced by a
               particular third party (e.g., <title rend="italic">DHQ</title>) automatically becomes
               part of the SDL — in this, the SDL mirrors the standing subscriptions by which
               libraries traditionally purchased every publication from particular publishers in
               print culture. But the SDL, however, also provides editorial review of original
               content.</p>
            <p>The SDL does not, however, provide services for end users. The SDL may include the
               code for those services that only humanists can be expected to provide (e.g., an
               advanced morphological analyzer for classical Greek) but the SDL does not plan to
               provide those services. The SDL provides a long term home for the objects which
               others can analyze or make accessible in various systems. We require that each object
               have an approved format so that as many groups as possible will develop the largest
               possible number of services with which to make SDL objects useful to the widest
               possible audience. In addition, we require that each object have a long term home,
               which in effect, states that we have entrusted libraries to apply their traditional
               functions of preservation and access for SDL objects. The requirement that each
               object have an open license reduces our dependence on any one institution: we hope
               that there will be many copies of each object from the SDL, both under formal
               preservation systems (such as LOCKSS) and in thousands of informal
                  collections.<note>LOCKSS stands for <q>Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe</q> a

            <p>The SDL thus answers questions of production and preservation but questions remain.
               The digital environment allows us to rethink not only publication but who can publish
               and how we divide labor in the scholarly world. </p>

            <p>The papers in this collection have focused upon the practices of scholarship. In this
               section we consider the work of scholarship and the associated division of labor. The
               center of gravity for intellectual life has not only shifted, decisively and forever,
               to a digital medium but the relative position of professional humanists has changed
               as well. To some extent, that division of labor has already begun to shift. The
               scholarly practices to which we award Phds, tenure and promotion may have remained
               largely unchanged but new practices of intellectual life have exploded onto the
               scene. Most of us like to think of ourselves as a progressive force, but we, in the
               eyes of many, more closely resemble the bullying Theban Herald of Euripides’ <title
                  rend="italic">Suppliants</title>. Worse, we may appear to have become like the
               Athens of Thucydides, a <hi rend="italic">turannos polis</hi>, a city-state in which
               only holders of Phds or even those with professional academic appointments alone have
               the right to speak and contribute. The Tyndales of the twenty-first century maintain
               blogs, work for the Open Content Alliance (OCA), write for Wikipedia, produce content
               under Creative Commons open licenses and drive explosive growth of other, novel forms
               of intellectual production. All of those who have written for this collection feel a
               profound obligation to address this gulf between the work that we do as professional
               scholars and the messy, passionate, unruly, intense streams of activity that have
               carried <title rend="italic">Wikipedia</title> and other efforts so far.</p>
            <p>Professional academics have played, insofar as we can tell, almost no direct role
               within this historic movement. The authors of this conclusion do not know of any
               academic who has included Wikipedia along with their conventional publications in
               their yearly reviews. We do know that, as of the end of August 2008, Wikipedia
               contains more than two and one half million entries. And we know that this resource
               has proven astonishingly useful, its flaws real but, when systematically analyzed, no
               worse than those of conventional, centralized reference works.<note>See <ptr
                     target="#rosenzweig2006"/> (also available at <ref

            <p>No one knows how much labor the various language versions of Wikipedia have absorbed
               — in part because volunteers have contributed the vast majority of the labor and
               volunteers do not track billable hours. Wikipedia does cost money — the 2005 budget
               for Wikipedia was $739,200, while the overall Wikimedia foundation reported a budget
               of 4.6 million dollars for 2007-2008.<note>See <ref
                     target="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/budget/2005"
                     >http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Budget/2005</ref> and <ref
                     target="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/planned_spending_distribution_2007-2008"
                     >http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Planned_Spending_Distribution_2007-2008</ref>.</note>
               The aggregate cost will thus repesent well under 40 million dollars (i.e., which
               would be the cost if they had spent $5,000,000/year each year since 2001 when they
               began). Clay Shirky, however, recently estimated that Wikipedia represented
               100,000,000 hours of labor — thus representing at least 1 billion dollars in labor.
               The ratio of paid to volunteer labor is thus at least 20 to 1, and probably very much
               higher. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), by contrast, requested a
               budget of less than 145 million dollars for fiscal year 2009 — it would take almost
               seven years of the entire NEH budget to produce $1,000,000,000. The labor power
               unleashed by this one new mode of intellectual production is extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Scholarly publications incorporate a great deal of accumulated labor. In classics,
               the language barriers make such embedded labor relatively easy to identify —
               classicists need expertise in the Greek and Latin languages, familiarity with the
               ancient core texts of at least one of these languages, and enough knowledge to work
               comfortably with book-length studies in English, French, German and Italian. If we
               consider four years of undergraduate education and six years of doctoral studies as
               one model of scholarly apprenticeship, each scholarly publication represents years of
               embedded labor. When a faculty member devotes a month or two in the summer to a new
               publication, we thus need to consider not only the hundreds of hours invested during
               that summer but all the years of work on which that scholar is drawing.</p>
            <p>Wikipedia and other forms of community-driven intellectual production ultimately
               increase the audience for — and thus the realizable value of — advanced scholarship.
               Professional academics need to decide how they wish to respond to this vast audience.
               Many of us are products of a print culture in which our publications simply could not
               reach beyond a few hundred or, at best, thousand research libraries. We had no reason
               to write for audiences that our publications would never reach. Furthermore, the
               professionalized incentives of academia rewarded us for producing work that would
               impress our colleagues and facilitate tenure, promotion, and other signs of academic
               success. We now have, however, radically new technologies and social practices with
               which to advance the intellectual life of humanity as a whole.</p>
            <p>Twentieth century print culture produced scholarship that required a great deal of
               training to produce and almost as much training to understand, much less appreciate.
               We now see a world emerging with much lower barriers for entry. <list

                        immense amount but they benefit as well from very large amounts of skilled
                        human labor. Many basic tasks reflect the strengths of human intelligence
                        and provide opportunities for students and non-professionals to contribute
                        tangibly to the infrastructure on which the study of classics depends. The

                        contributing tangibly to our understanding of the ancient world. <ref
                           target="/dhq/vol/3/1/000033/000033.html">Bamman and Crane</ref> describe
                        the emerging role of syntactic databases — treebanks — for the study of
                        classical Greek and Latin. Even if we have a treebank with millions of words
                        already analyzed to serve as a training set for an automated syntactic
                        analyzer, the best automated systems do not, at present, provide more than
                        87 or 88% accuracy — enough for many analytical purposes but not perfect.
                        Greek classes at Brandeis, Tufts, Furman and elsewhere have already begun to
                        integrate the production of syntactic data into their curricula. The method
                        is straightforward. Treebanks use their tags and methodologies but, in
                        essence, the production of treebanks depends upon ancient practices of
                        reading — we need to identify the main verb, its subjects, objects, etc. Two
                        students can, for example, analyze each sentence, the class can then discuss
                        the points at which they differ, and produce carefully analyzed sentences
                        that may include variant interpretations.</p>
                     <p>When given a particular set of tags and relationships most readers will
                        agree on the syntactic relationships between most words in most texts,
                        however, some Greek sentences support multiple interpretations, whether
                        because we are not sure what the author originally wrote or because the text
                        that we have reconstructed is fundamentally ambiguous. Ultimately, the
                        syntactic analysis for some words in our surviving texts remains an object
                        of research.</p>
                     <p>Other tasks that are in most cases straightforward can be the object of
                        research as well: in some cases we cannot determine to which Antonius or
                        Cleopatra a particular passage alludes and we depend upon skilled
                        prosopographical analysis to rank the possibilities. We find place names
                        where we do not know for sure the original location. Word sense
                        disambiguation depends upon the senses that we ascribe to a word and thus
                        upon semantic analysis that can become complex for common words.</p>
                     <p>We thus see a gradient of tasks. In many cases, students and undergraduate
                        classes can improve upon the results of automated processes and/or provide
                        the initial training data from which, in turn, automated methods can analyze
                        much larger bodies of material. In some cases, the answers to conceptually
                        simple questions (e.g., who is the Antonius in this passage? What is the
                        structure of this sentence?) are not immediately clear and have historically
                        provided scope for some of the most skillful classical scholarship. The
                        patterns visible from the many passages that are not controversial will,
                        when aggregated and analyzed, allow us to place discussions of ambiguous
                        instances on a more explicit and quantified footing. We may even find
                        scholarly consensus advancing as new scholarly instruments, developed in
                        large measure by students and the general public, allow us to shed light
                        upon old problems. Thus, we have a space that provides ample room for
                        contributors at a various levels of expertise.</p>

                        <hi rend="bold">Undergraduate research</hi>. Once we have large databases of
                        information we can begin to see patterns that were not visible before. We
                        rely upon automated methods of analysis to direct our attention to
                        interesting patterns and thus to serve as the starting point for, rather
                        than a conclusion to, analysis. It is important to emphasize that we do not
                        need perfect data to identify major patterns —a recent study conducted by
                        David Bamman showed that even when automated syntactic analysis generated
                        results that were as low as 50% accurate, some significant linguistic
                        patterns were visible despite the noise of a 50% error rate.<note>

                     <p>New sources of data open up possible research topics to which our advanced
                        undergraduates can realistically aspire. The Homer Multitext Project, for
                        example, has published high resolution images of the most important
                        manuscript of Homer, the 10th century Venetus A, making visually accessible
                        scholia and readings that have never been published, much less translated.
                        Students are well able to produce initial diplomatic editions with basic
                        contextual information and English translation. Published in standard
                        formats under open licenses and in long term institutional repositories,
                        such works can provide the foundation for a new generation of editions.
                        Generations of students can productively provide the intellectual apparatus
                        needed to understand the detailed page images already being produced in
                        Europe and North America for manuscripts of Homer and other classical
                        authors, fundamentally changing the role that these source materials can
                        play in intellectual life. Likewise, the creation of treebanks allows us to
                        see patterns of word usage, linguistic practice and individual style. Even
                        now, as we develop large automated treebanks, students can create treebanks
                        for individual works and control samples to produce original research: thus,
                        given a treebank and the ability to find Greek words corresponding to
                        English, students could undertake valuable systematic studies that were not
                        practical before (e.g., the semantics of words for <q>power</q> in Herodotus
                        and Thucydides). The results of their research can be published through our
                        university repositories, connected to every passage on which they shed
                        light, and preserved, as permanent contributions, long after their youthful
                        authors have passed from the scene.</p>
                  </item>
               </list> It would be hard to overstate the possible opportunities of practical
               undergraduate research for classics and the humanities in general. </p>
            <p>The field of classics — and, indeed, every field within the humanities — needs to
               adapt itself to the challenges and opportunities, some realized, others emergent
               though visible in outline, that this digital environment has thrust upon us.</p>
            <p>First, all classicists are digital classicists. Insofar as the practices of our work
               advance research projects imagined within the limitations and for the tiny academic
               audiences of print culture, we are antiquarians. We may not believe in particular
               ideas such as the <q>judgment of history,</q> but we do believe in conventional ideas
               and are confident that the implicit assumptions about what constituted scholarship in
               the twentieth century will give way to new conventional ideas. Each of us working now
               for an audience in the future is making bets about what those conventional ideas will
               assume. The authors of this conclusion are not so sanguine as to believe that the
               culture and languages of ancient Greece and Rome will inevitably flow outwards into
               the hearts and minds of humanity as vigorously as we hope. Technology constrains and
               enables the space within which we move. How well and how quickly we in classics and
               the humanities adapt to the niches within this space depends upon the decisions that
               we make (however unpredictable the outcomes of those decisions may be).</p>
            <p>We do not know yet what common technological knowledge classicists must share. We
               cannot all be accredited system administrators or application programmers. On the
               other hand, it is hard to accept complaints that the TEI Guidelines or the underlying
               structures of treebanks are too complicated for scholars who work with six languages.
               The services outlined above can use textual and syntactic markup to enable new forms
               of scholarship and of reading support but such data structures are, fundamentally,
               surface expressions of traditional ideas. Habits from the past and anxiety about the
               future are the major barriers. Those who have succeeded in the traditional tasks of
               classical philology will, if they can muster the necessary labor, find themselves in
               a world that allows them to pursue their traditional tasks more fully. If they can
               read Pericles’ Funeral Oration in the original Greek, they are well able to master
               any general technological system.</p>
            <p>Classicists need only to exploit the analytical tools and conventions of intellectual
               discourse available to them to achieve their goals. For us, the blogs, wikis,
               assorted web pages and other digital tools simply challenge us to adapt the
               complementary goals of rhetorical power and intellectual discipline. We hope that
               others will more fully realize these goals than has been possible so far for us.</p>
            <p>Second, classicists need some scholars who have more advanced knowledge of the
               technology. We do not have the resources to sustain a subfield such as
               bioinformatics, but the broadening textual collections and treebanks now starting to
               emerge for Greek and Latin build upon many of the same techniques used to find
               patterns in the human Genome. The most important philologists now at work may well be
               the classicists who have joined the field of computer science and are now laying the
               foundations on which all philological research will depend. Rising scholars such as
               David Smith, David Mimno, Ryan Gabbard, and Gabriel Weaver, originally trained as
               classicists, were unable to conduct work in machine translation, text mining and
               general natural language processing that is foundational for classical studies. We
               may not be able to imagine the shape that our field will assume in the centuries to
               come, but future change does not absolve us from the obligation to understand what is
               already possible. None of the PhD programs with which we are familiar has addressed
               the challenge of producing and supporting those scholars who can show us how to
               pursue the ancient goals of our field in the rapidly shifting technological spaces
               within which we live.</p>
            <p>Third, we need new institutions to provide access to the results of our work. Neither
               the libraries nor the publishers of the early twenty-first century serve the needs
               that emerge in this collection. While libraries may survive and indeed flourish as an
               institution, they will do so by subsuming and transforming the functions that we
               entrusted to publishers in print culture. We need a small number of
               library-publishers that can help classicists produce new content and then maintain
               that content over time. And that content must include not only relatively static
               documents but, at least for now, a minimal set of executable code: every discipline
               will probably need at least some services that only experts in the field can create
               and that are part of the field’s core infrastructure. Morphological analysis and
               lemmatization, mentioned above, are fundamental processes that should be applied
               automatically to every digital word of Greek and Latin. Classicists may need to
               develop these systems, but the systems, once developed, need to be preserved as
               active services along with the XML texts, 2d images, GIS datasets and stable
               collections.</p>
            <p>The seeds of these new organizations are visible in the Digital Knowledge Center in
               the Johns Hopkins University Library system and the California Digital Library, but
               we do not yet see in operation a mature model that can serve our needs in the present
               and expand over time. The Perseus Digital Library thus still finds itself compelled
               to maintain its own servers as best it can, maintaining services that were innovative
               a decade ago but are still beyond the capacity of any systems with which we are
               familiar. Google is moving very quickly in this vacuum. The academic library system
               failed to address the legal, technical, and financial challenges of converting its
               retrospective print holdings into digital form. Google Books is rapidly filling the
               vacuum of collections and services that libraries left. Perhaps it was impossible for
               our library system, rich in the aggregate, to organize itself. If so, libraries may
               evolve into a handful of repositories, acting as wholesalers to provide the content
               by which the Googles, Microsofts, Yahoos and their brethren support the intellectual
               life of humanity. If the commercial world can generate revenue by providing access to
               content that anyone can download, then the market may function well enough to provide
               universal access.<note>In the public information Google reports (<ref

                  dedicating 1% of the $1,000,000,000 collections budget into digital conversion,
                  the $10,000,000 would pay for roughly 300,000 books per year or roughly 16 years
                  for 5,000,000 volumes with the Open Content Alliance Workflow. The library
                  community simply did not think that its retrospective collections were worth the
                  technical, political, and legislative trouble. It will be interesting to see how
                  many observers, a generation from now, will view the leadership of the early
                  twenty first century libraries with sympathy, much less admiration.</note>

                     <q>I see here the spirit of my dead mother; she sits in silence near the blood,
                        and does not look upon the face of her own son or speak to him. Tell me,
                        prince, how she may recognize that I am he.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[145] So I spoke, and he straightway answered, and said: <q>Easy is the word
                        that I shall say and put in your mind. Whomsoever of those that are dead and
                        gone you shall allow to draw near the blood, he will tell you true things;
                        but whoever you refuse, he surely will go back again.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>[150] So saying the spirit of the prince, Teiresias, went back into the house
                     of Hades, when he had declared his prophecies; but I remained there steadfastly
                     until my mother came up and drank the dark blood. At once then she knew me.</p>

                     <q>Fifty sons I had, when the sons of the Achaeans came; nineteen were born to
                        me of the self-same womb, and the others women of the palace bore. Of these,
                        many as they were, furious Ares hath loosed the knees, and he that alone was
                        left me, that by himself guarded the city and the men, him you slew, just
                        now as he fought for his country, even Hector. For his sake have I now come
                        to the ships of the Achaeans to win him back from you, and I bear with me
                        ransom past counting. Nay, have awe of the gods, Achilles, and take pity on
                        me, remembering your own father. See, I am more piteous far than he, and
                        have endured what no other mortal on the face of earth hath yet endured, to
                        reach forth my hand to the face of him that hath slain my sons.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So he spoke, and in Achilles he roused desire to weep for his father; and he
                     took the old man by the hand, and gently put him from him. So the two thought
                     of their dead, and wept.</p>

            <p>A new, digital infrastructure provides the explicit subject for this collection of
               essays. We can create now collections that are larger than any Ptolemy or Cleopatra
               could have imagined for their Alexandria. We have ever more sophisticated services
               that can analyze and combine these collections in new ways and even to generate the
               stuff of new knowledge. And the material systems on which these services are based
               simply did not exist half a century ago and cost 100,000 times less now than they did
               a quarter century ago.<note>In 1982, the Harvard Classics Department paid $34,000 for
                  a 660 megabyte disk ($51 per megabyte). In October 2008, 1 terabyte drives — with
                  more than 1,000 times the capacity of the 600 megabyte drive from 1982 — are
                  available for under $500 (c. $.0005 per megabyte).</note> And if the essays
               published here have focused upon what we can learn from our textual record, these
               collections capture sound, images, and data that human hands alone can never
               transcribe. Indeed, the writing on inscriptions, papyri, and manuscripts now appear
               as images, open for humans to read and machines to analyze, ready to reveal long
               forgotten aspects of the living world that produced them.</p>
            <p>But if everything that we use as a tool is different, nothing that we truly value is
               new. Like Odysseus in the Underworld, we bring blood to the shades and seek, insofar
               as possible, to let those who have gone before us to converse with us in their own
               words. All of us who have studied literature in the academy understand that we can
               never fully understand our subjects — the very notion of understanding implies a
               fixity that does not suit complex human beings, filled with contradictory impulses
               and defined as much by their changing potential for actions as by anything they have
               done in the past. Priam and Achilles communicate in a single language and understand
               the cultural backgrounds from which each comes but each of them crosses a gulf as
               great as that which any mere quantity of time and space can pose. Their moment
               together has no material effect upon the great events around them. Each will soon
               suffer a violent death. Troy will fall and a massacre will follow. But the moment
               above has been powerful for many audiences over the course of almost three millennia,
               perhaps all the more powerful for the violence that surrounds it.</p>
            <p>The future of the past has never been brighter. The digital medium offers new methods
               with which to make Greco-Roman culture and classical Greek and Latin physically and
               intellectually accessible to audiences vastly larger and more diverse than was ever
               feasible in print. The culture of the Greco-Roman world and the languages of
               classical Greek and Latin can play a fuller role in the cultural memory of all
               mankind than ever before. The ideas and actions of those who lived in the Greco-Roman
               world and expressed themselves in Greek and Latin can begin to quicken hearts and
               fire minds that dream in Chinese, Hindi, and, in the end, every language of
               humanity.</p>
            <p>Each of us brings to bear the skills that we have acquired during the time that we
               have on this earth. Those skills and periods of time vary. Generations pass.
               Technologies change. Nations rise and fall. Languages fade away and transform
               themselves beyond recognition. But the memory of classical antiquity has endured over
               the millennia. All of us who have dedicated our lives to this field — whether we
               struggle with new technologies or contemplate the record of the past in more
               traditional ways — are privileged in the subject that we have chosen. We composed
               these essays in sadness at the loss of our friend, Allen Ross Scaife, but we send
               them forth in hope as we contemplate the future that Ross helped to make
               possible.</p>
