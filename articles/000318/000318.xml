                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>Digital technologies offer opportunities for engagement with cultural heritage
                    resources through the development of online platforms and databases. However,
                    questions have been raised about whether this type of engagement is structurally
                    open or bounded by pre-existing institutional frameworks. Michel Foucault’s
                    later work on <q>governmentality</q> speaks to this concern and identifies in
                    modes of government the mutually reinforcing relation of all and each, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#foucault2000a">to develop those elements
                            constitutive of individuals’ lives in such a way that their development
                            also fosters that of the strength of the state</quote>
                        <ptr target="#foucault2000a"/>
                    </cit>. This article takes Foucault’s insight as a point of departure for
                    thinking about how digital technologies are mediating and structuring the
                    relationships between individuals and organizations, using the European
                    Commission-funded Europeana project as a case study. Europeana is the embodiment
                    of all and each as a technique of government: it functions by fostering the
                    contributions of individuals and national audiences in a way that celebrates
                    their diversity, while also engaging in a project to systematically standardize
                    and unify. Examination of the technical elements of Europeana reveals the
                    political imperatives implicit in its technical operations, and how the
                    parameters for audience participation are subsequently defined. In this article,
                    we examine the audiences explicitly and implicitly delimited by Europeana, and
                    then analyze them in relation to the project’s development of the European Data
                    Model (EDM) for the interchange of metadata about cultural heritage objects. The
                    article concludes that a lack of explicit definitions about audiences, what
                    Europeana is, and how its various parts work in concert constitute a
                        <term>definitional void</term>. This void is a technique of government in
                    that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague. It involves power
                    relations that are hard to center and render visible, and it is thus difficult
                    to detect which actors are occupying a space of privilege. We suggest some
                    tentative strategies for addressing this problem by attending to the sites of
                    awkward engagement and difference that are currently masked in the technical
                    framing of Europeana.</p>

                <p>The logic of participation and shared ownership, frequently glossed as the
                    democratization of knowledge, belies much of the public discourse around digital
                    heritage web technologies (see, e.g., <ptr target="#terras2011"/>). However, the
                    institutional imperatives that drive the development of such technologies have
                    sometimes given cause for unease about the maintenance of autonomy for those
                    using them <ptr target="#andrejevic2007"/>. Most often, debates focus on how far
                    the enabling aspects of online participation at the same time pose a threat to
                    control over personal content; how the ephemeral nature of digital content
                    serves to further entrench the existing politics of dominant memory narratives;
                    or how the tensions play out between digital heritage in official memory
                    institutions and community-oriented or personal projects.</p>
                <p>Michel Foucault’s later work on <q>governmentality</q> speaks to these concerns
                    and also challenges the personal-institutional dichotomy they presuppose. He
                    identifies in modes of government the mutually reinforcing relation of all and
                    each, which seeks <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#foucault2000a">to develop those elements
                            constitutive of individuals’ lives in such a way that their development
                            also fosters that of the strength of the state</quote>
                        <ptr target="#foucault2000a"/>
                    </cit>. Here, we investigate the move of all and each as it relates to the
                    longstanding goal of European integration, and efforts to confirm Europe as a
                    unified entity through the notion of a shared cultural heritage. The Europeana
                    project is the case study through which these issues will be examined
                    further.</p>
                <p>Europeana is a database and website that offers access to digitized items from
                    over 2500 of Europe’s museums, libraries and archives. Funded by the European
                    Commission (EC), the European Union’s (EU) executive body, Europeana
                    demonstrates the move of all and each very clearly in its aim to promote a
                    distinctly European space online for heterogeneous cultural objects and
                    experiences. It is precisely the involvement of individual users and
                    organizations that furthers this aim; the former group search for and submit
                    content to it, while the latter are the primary donors of cultural heritage
                    metadata. The parameters for user participation are subsequently defined
                    according to these operations, which potentially limits the nature of audiences’
                    relationships with it. </p>
                <p>Our interest here is in the way audience-organization relations are represented
                    and delimited by technology. In this case study, we examine how such relations
                    present themselves within the socio-technical network of Europeana, and how
                    audience conceptions operate as techniques of government on the part of the EC.
                    We discuss the interplay between the EC’s cultural policies and the techniques
                    enacted through Europeana and show how the dynamic of all and each is manifested
                    at different levels of the project. Digital platforms like Europeana, because of
                    their scale, their partial (at best) success/adoption, and their nebulous
                    geographic location are an interesting site for further exploration of these
                    issues.</p>
                <p>Our argument proceeds via an investigation of several technical elements of the
                    project, particularly the European Data Model (EDM) for aggregation and the
                    application program interface (API). A conglomerate of existing metadata
                    standards, the EDM was designed to facilitate the aggregation of digital
                    cultural heritage objects (CHOs) for the construction of the public memory
                    portal found at europeana.eu. The technical premise of Europeana, and its data
                    model, entail interoperability, which have political implications when
                    considered in light of the EC’s drive for greater social and political cohesion
                    in Europe. However, the political dimensions of interoperability are seldom, if
                    ever, owned by developers. The article concludes that a lack of explicit
                    definitions about audiences, what Europeana is, and how its various parts work
                    in concert constitute a <term>definitional void</term>. This void is a technique
                    of government in that it absorbs difference and is deliberately vague. It
                    involves power relations that are hard to center and render visible and it is
                    thus difficult to detect which actors are occupying a space of privilege. We
                    suggest some tentative strategies for addressing this problem by attending to
                    the sites of awkward engagement and difference that are currently masked in the
                    technical framing of Europeana.</p>

                <p>In the 1979 lecture, <title rend="quotes">Omnes et Singulatim: Towards a
                        Criticism of <q>Political Reason</q>,</title> Foucault proposed that Western
                    modes of government rely on the limited freedom of individuals for their
                    continued functioning, an idea that both parallels and challenges debates about
                    cultural production and the public consumption of digital heritage. Instead of
                    stating the relationship between organizations and audiences in oppositional
                    terms, Foucault identifies the mutually reinforcing relation of <term>all and
                        each</term>. He writes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#foucault2000a">right from the start, the state
                            is both individualizing and totalitarian […] Its inevitable effects are
                            both individualization and totalization. Liberation can only come from
                            attacking, not just one of these two effects, but political
                            rationality’s very roots</quote>
                        <ptr target="#foucault2000a" loc="325"/>
                    </cit>. While the reference to the state is somewhat misleading, since, for
                    Foucault, the state has no essence and is a function of changes in the practice
                    of government, the suggestion that these totalizing and individualizing effects
                    work to bolster one another is an important insight. In a passage from <title
                        rend="quotes">Governmentality</title>, Foucault clarifies his theory
                    further: <quote rend="block" source="#foucault2000b">What government has to do
                        with is not territory but, rather, a sort of complex composed of men and
                        things. The things, in this sense, with which government is to be concerned
                        are in fact men, but men in their relations, their links, their imbrication
                        with those things. <ptr target="#foucault2000b" loc="208–209"/></quote></p>
                <p>These relational networks are composed of humans and things, both technological
                    and analog. In fact, in speaking about entities like the EU, the EC or
                    Europeana, we are employing simplistic terms to denote incredibly complex
                    networks of persons and technologies, as well as technological representations
                    of analog things <ptr target="#law1992"/>. Technologies in the broad sense are
                    understood by Foucault as techniques of government such as programs, apparatuses
                    and calculations. There is a growing recognition that processes and power
                    structures are inflected in the way new technologies are being developed,
                    practices that are often specialized and opaque <ptr target="#lash2007"/>; <ptr
                        target="#beer2013"/>; <ptr target="#drucker2013"/>. Such in-scriptions <ptr
                        target="#akrich1992"/> may or may not play out as designers intend when
                    technologies are implemented, and mismatches between design and actual use
                    explain, in part, why some are successful and why others fail. Understanding
                    potential ethical and political issues requires greater knowledge of the way
                    technologies are created, how they work, and how they are ultimately deployed.
                    This approach, a socio-technical analysis based on theories of governmentality,
                    informs our discussion of digital technologies in the cultural heritage
                    context.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we suggest that the dynamic of all and each is particularly relevant
                    to this context and offers a method of investigating, more closely, the
                    negotiation of audience relationships and the individual-institution dichotomy.
                    As Chiara de Cesari notes, heritage scholars have been too focused on the
                    centralization, homogenization and cultural imperialism of heritage regimes and
                    insufficiently attentive to the capacities of decentralized groups, e.g. local
                    communities, or historically marginalized peoples <ptr target="#decesari2012"/>.
                    The all and each relation highlights the interplay of power relations at
                    different scales <ptr target="#harvey2015"/> and is linked to another important
                    aspect of government: that it is not always successful in its regulative aims.
                    Its strategies are therefore diverse and undergoing constant revision. Rosemary
                    Coombe and Lindsay M. Weiss explain: <quote rend="block" source="#coombe2015"
                        >Government, in short, “is a congenitally failing operation;” unanticipated
                        outcomes emerge from the intersection of diverse technologies, the
                        conjunction of new techniques and old conditions enable things to work in
                        new and different ways. <ptr target="#coombe2015" loc="51"/></quote></p>
                <p>The technologies that have been developed within and through the Europeana
                    project provide an opening for exploring how such failures are manifested in
                    practice, how they are adapted and re-aligned with the aims of government and
                    how these renegotiations require the enrollment of a variety of audiences.</p>

                <head>Europeana and the Drive for Cultural Unity [in Diversity]</head>
                <p>The story of the development of Europeana is bound up with the EC’s ongoing
                    commitment to fostering European unity, emphasizing transnational, rather than
                    national, institutions and affiliations <ptr target="#europeana2011"/>. The
                    original impetus for the initiative came from a perceived threat to Europe’s
                    economic interests after the announcement of the Google Books Project in 2005.
                    Amid worries that companies like Google would transfer a considerable volume of
                    cultural heritage content into the private sector, the proposal was made for an
                    equivalent European program, premised on open access and non-exclusive rights
                        <ptr target="#purday2009" loc="171"/>.</p>
                <p>In 2008, the prototype Europeana database was launched, the appellation making
                    its transnational affiliations clear. This was in line with EU strategies, since
                    the 1980s, to promote the formation of a cohesive European identity through its
                    cultural programs <ptr target="#shore2001"/>. Formation is an important notion
                    here, because the aim of these strategies is to create something new, built on
                    existing histories and cultural heritage. As Cris Shore observes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#shore2001">in many respects, what the [EC] is
                            doing is not dissimilar to that which nationalist elites achieved during
                            the formation of European nation-states in the nineteenth century: i.e.
                            mobilising symbols and inventing traditions in order to give flesh and
                            credibility to a new political order</quote>
                        <ptr target="#shore2001"/>
                    </cit> (see also <ptr target="#hobsbawm2012"/>). Yet difficulties stem from
                    attributing <q>European</q> meanings to manuscripts and artworks that are
                    associated with specific national-historical narratives. Likewise, the very
                    different circumstances from which the nation states of Europe have developed
                    present a challenge to the idea of a coherent European identity. Cultural
                    programs have attempted to overcome such disparities by inscribing diversity
                    into the model for European integration and endorsing the idea of <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#mcdonald1996">unity in diversity</quote>
                    <ptr target="#mcdonald1996"/>; <ptr target="#shore2006"/>. Such language
                    connotes the move of all and each in that diverse local projects become mutually
                    constitutive of larger governmental discourses. Foucault describes how the logic
                    of modern political rationality can be understood as a permanent integration of
                    individuals in a totality and, vice versa, a mode of governing that regulates
                    individual conducts or, rather, requires individuals to self-regulate conduct.
                    This is liberalism, namely a constant correlation between an increasing
                    individualization and the reinforcement of a totality <ptr
                        target="#foucault2000a"/>; <ptr target="#foucault2000b"/>. </p>
                <p>The motif of unity in diversity also echoes existing debates in heritage studies
                    about the move from monocultural to multicultural forms <ptr
                        target="#kirshenblatt-gimblett2007"/>; <ptr target="#harrison2013"/>.
                    Narratives and representations of local and national heritage, and the roles
                    they play in the constitution of larger, pan-national projects, are important as
                    they manifest themselves in these relational structures. One view is that the
                    assimilation of peoples and nations into larger social and political entities is
                    accompanied by the increased diversity of local traditions and practices <ptr
                        target="#jamieson2002"/>. On this interpretation, cultural difference is
                    potentially reconcilable with the emergence of broader transnational entities.
                    The vision expressed by initiatives like Europeana, that cultural diversity can
                    be a part of European identity, suggests a similar model but it is difficult to
                    discern how it works in practice, especially when such narratives are imported
                    into the technical space <ptr target="#presner2016"/>. </p>
                <p>In the face of vast collections like those of Europeana, a selective approach to
                    representation is required to make the content serviceable. The concern is that,
                    if the task of representing European culture in all its forms proves
                    insurmountable, then unity becomes a legitimating gloss for a discourse of
                    European culture that is limited to a narrow construction of cultural heritage.
                    In this context, the need to both define and safeguard European interests
                    reflects the difference by which Europe has historically distinguished itself
                    from other territories <ptr target="#hall2003"/>. </p>
                <p>However, the political uncertainty surrounding Europe has resulted in a need for
                    the EC to circumvent disputes that arise from talking about a unified European
                    entity directly. Anthropological research into the EC indicates that this is
                    manifested at an organizational level as well. Abélès suggests that the
                    underlying paradigm of the European political process is less one of unification
                    than of harmonization and rationalization. That is, European political practice
                    aims to influence national politics without spelling out its political goals; he
                    writes: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#abeles2004">everything is working as if Europe
                            was destined to remain a virtual object</quote>
                        <ptr target="#abeles2004" loc="6"/>
                    </cit>. The concept of virtual Europe clarifies the way in which unity in
                    diversity reproduces forms of identification and difference and reflects the
                    indefinite geographical and governmental status of Europe.</p>
                <p>As we will go on to argue, these relations continue to be replicated at various
                    scales through the creation and implementation of cultural heritage
                    technologies, including Europeana. There are also clear ways in which the policy
                    trajectory of Europeana has changed during its lifespan, which is consistent
                    with flexibility as a practice of government. Here, we conduct an analysis of
                    Europeana’s conception of its audience over time as the project priorities
                    shift; in this way, it is possible to understand Europeana’s changing
                    self-conception and its relationship with European state and identity politics.
                    We take as material for analysis a series of papers produced by or at the behest
                    of people involved in various aspects of Europeana, with a particular focus on
                    the API and the data model. These materials represent different points in
                    Europeana’s development, including:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>2008 – The launch and trial of Europeana as an aggregator for
                        metadata.</item>
                    <item>2010-12 – The development of both the API and the EDM.</item>

                        the introduction of the Europeana 1914-1918 project.</item>
                </list>
                <p>Notions of audience, both implicit and explicit, at each of these stages reflect
                    the adaptations Europeana makes in order to position itself as a successful
                    digital cultural heritage platform, although we acknowledge the difficulty
                    entailed in defining success in this context. With each new phase of
                    development, Europeana speaks to different audiences, including cultural
                    heritage institutions in member states and elsewhere; internal and external
                    technology developers; individual content donors; and the projected users who
                    will search the platform to access digital representations of cultural heritage
                    objects (CHOs). This latter group is represented by individual users within
                    Europe, yet given its partnerships with non-European heritage institutions,
                    there is also the aspiration to reach a more global audience. Decisions taken
                    about technology primarily reflect the positioning of Europeana in relation to
                    its users. These different users and Europeana itself are both implicated in the
                    European identity the EC promotes. It is not insignificant that the structuring
                    of the EDM also, superficially, reflects this idea of unity, which we will
                    discuss below. </p>
                <p>Despite pushing for a kind of unity, Europeana is underpinned by disparate
                    metadata and collections information. This implies a political manoeuvre:
                    Europeana is, on one level, an absolute expression of unity in diversity (it
                    works as an aggregator of disparate data) but only in cases where those terms
                    are representative of standards and data models. The vexed political question of
                    how unity in diversity actually works is left to one side. As discussed by
                    Abélès, unity in diversity is a process of harmonization and rationalization,
                    and one that operates via a definitional void: when Europeana fails to define
                    its terms, assumptions and dominant power relations risk becoming further
                    entrenched. </p>

                <head>Europeana and its Audiences</head>
                <p>How does Europeana work and what is its emphasis? This question is not trivial,
                    and it is telling that at a 2016 heritage studies conference, the authors
                    encountered far more people who had never heard of Europeana than people who
                    could describe the project and its aims. Answering the question requires an
                    understanding of what the name ‘Europeana’ encompasses. For example, Antoine
                    Isaac et al speak about the multiple priorities and user groups of Europeana,
                    which belies the fact that it is not a single entity, nor does it have a single,
                    sweepingly agreed-upon identity for its users and creators <ptr
                        target="#isaac2012" loc="38"/>. Europeana is a complicated socio-technical
                    network comprising many components that change over time. Here, we recognize a
                    few of them, including the public-facing web portal; the API and the developers
                    behind this; and macro-level policy makers who act as intermediaries between the
                    various manifestations of the Europeana project and the EC. </p>
                <p>The public-facing part of the project is represented by a web platform which
                    offers access to digitized items from national museum, library and archive
                    collections across Europe. </p>

                <p>Its earliest iteration was modeled on the idea of a digital library. However, it
                    is also a database that enables participating cultural heritage organizations to
                    engage with a large volume of digital content, primarily metadata about digital
                    surrogates for CHOs. Those involved in its development have shown an awareness
                    of this public platform/back-end database duality: <quote rend="block"
                        source="#concordia2010">To the general public, Europeana is primarily
                        perceived as a portal exposing a great amount of cultural heritage
                        information. Even though this perception is not entirely misleading, the
                        main goal of Europeana is rather to build an open services platform enabling
                        users and cultural institutions to access and manage a large collection of
                        surrogate objects representing digital and digitized content via an
                        application program interface (API). <ptr target="#concordia2010" loc="61"
                        /></quote></p>
                <p>A more pointed quote that concludes the same paper demonstrates a measure of
                    tension in how the greater Europeana project is defined: <quote rend="block"
                        source="#concordia2010">Finally, Europeana is much more than a portal: even
                        though offering portal functionality its main technical incarnation is the
                        Application Programming Interface (API) on which the portal services will be
                        built. <ptr target="#concordia2010" loc="66"/></quote></p>
                <p>As indicated, Europeana has conceived of itself and its relationship with users
                    in different ways over its lifespan, and this is indicative of a number of
                    tensions that have persisted within it. What Europeana is or does is informed by
                    some early key policy decisions, chief among these the decision not to store any
                    digital objects itself. Rather, Europeana holds metadata about digital objects
                    from national collections. In other words, by using Europeana’s search portal,
                    users are looking at aggregated metadata about digital surrogates for heritage
                    objects: for example, an image file representing a painting and data about the
                    museum to which it belongs, its size, and what the paint and backing media are
                    etc. Europeana does not save or hold these art objects or their digital images:
                    it simply collects data about them. When users click through the content
                    represented at europeana.eu, they are directed away from Europeana proper to the
                    website of the particular institution that holds the analog object and that
                    contributed the digital surrogate and its data to the Europeana database.
                    Example: if you want to know more about the <title rend="italic">Mona
                        Lisa</title>, Europeana will direct you to the Louvre’s website.</p>
                <p>Concerns about ownership, and especially about the ability to point to web
                    traffic as a metric for successful community engagement, pervade discussions
                    about how Europeana should interact with one of its key audiences: cultural
                    heritage institutions donating their data about their collections: <quote
                        rend="block" source="#erway2009">Europeana’s approach to aggregation is very
                        reasonable: aggregate the metadata, but access the digital objects from the
                        providers’ sites. This allows the provider to brand the content with their
                        own identity and to offer up navigation and context pertinent to the
                        content. It also precludes the need for Europeana to have to centrally store
                        all of the digital objects and the responsibility for preservation remains
                        with the owning institution. <ptr target="#erway2009" loc="108"

                <p>The technological discussions raise this same concern: Cesare Concordia et al.
                    call for both a <quote rend="inline" source="#concordia2010">unified mentality
                        shift</quote> when dealing with large scale aggregations while also noting
                    that ownership must be clearly visible to two additional key audiences: imagined
                    users who will visit the portal and search for content and those who will build
                    applications and other projects on top of the data and data model <ptr
                        target="#concordia2010" loc="67"/>.</p>
                <p>If the foregoing section identifies three audiences – the individual searching
                    via the portal, the cultural heritage institutions that submit CHOs, and
                    developers using the API – there are a further two audiences implied in the case
                    set of texts about Europeana, though they are not necessarily explicitly defined
                    as such therein. Karen M. Wickett et al point to the audiences implied in the
                    functional roles of collections and collection description: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#wicket2014">individual users accessing or
                            contributing content, system developers seeking to improve search
                            experiences, and institutions providing data to federated
                            aggregations</quote>
                        <ptr target="#wicket2014"/>
                    </cit>. This suggests the fourth audience, which emerges through more recent
                    projects like Europeana 1914-1918, for the World War I centenary. By relying on
                    individuals to submit content directly, based on personal or family experiences
                    of the War, the fourth audience is distinct from the other donor audience of
                    (often publicly or state-sponsored) cultural heritage institutions. We also
                    argue that there is a fifth audience construction here, and that this is
                    precisely a mirror of self, the <q>I</q> in I-methodology <ptr
                        target="#akrich1995"/>. This last audience manifests itself in Europeana in
                    a few ways. Firstly, there is an actual user base which is constructed via the
                    peers and colleagues of those involved in the Europeana technical programs, and
                    secondly, there are the technologies developed for Europeana, which act as a
                    mirror of self, both in the sense of mirroring the ideological and
                    epistemological standpoint of the developers but also in the sense that
                    technological tools mirror the nebulous identity construction of the larger
                    Europeana project.</p>
                <p>Developments that stem from Europeana, like the creation of the data model (EDM)
                    and an interface designed to encourage developers to use Europeana (the API) are
                    inflected with the identities designers have in mind and who they think they are
                    talking to. For example, Concordia et al write about the Europeana API to
                    differentiate it from other portals and other digital libraries <ptr
                        target="#concordia2010" loc="65"/>. In fact, the authors imply that the
                    technical designers do not talk to Europeana portal users, and distance
                    themselves from the notion that Europeana is a portal at all. Rather, they
                    describe the portal as simply one small use of the API, and this branch of
                    research and development is seen as distinct from work on the EDM. While they
                    are both technological projects under the general Europeana umbrella, exchanges
                    on Google user group pages for Europeana’s API highlight the gulf between those
                    who see themselves as working on the API versus those who work on the data
                    model. In one instance, when someone on a forum asked a question regarding a
                    functional ontology for their home institution, in this case a museum, they were
                    quickly referred away to the EDM people by the API Google group. Yet the
                    Concordia et al paper, which argues for an understanding of Europeana as an API,
                    counters this notion by appealing to different audiences <ptr
                        target="#concordia2010" loc="65"/>. That is to say, it is an API for those
                    developers in the know: those already working at Europeana and those developers
                    Europeana hope will take up the API. </p>
                <p>A competing discourse arises when the primary user audience is invoked, the
                    non-specialist who uses the europeana.eu search bar to look for art works. These
                    portal users are coded by the technical authors as detached from the complexity
                    of the underlying technologies, such as the call method architecture, data
                    system levels, and functionalities. At the same time, Concordia et al use
                    language about <q>hiding</q> things in the API and a techno-centric discourse is
                    employed to purposefully mask the complexity of these functionalities behind
                    graphical user interfaces (GUIs): in this case, the simple search box on the
                    website landing page <ptr target="#concordia2010" loc="65"/>.</p>
                <p>These issues draw attention to Europeana’s lack of definition around audiences.
                    Because it does not concretely define audience when speaking to its
                        <q>audience</q> writ large, it implicates a variety of actors with different
                    interests and levels of power in relation to the project. Defining the various
                    audiences of Europeana would require the explicit designation of
                    techno-audiences, including second-party developers at partner institutions and
                        <q>external</q> third-party developers like the humanistic researcher
                    investigating watermarks on historical documents. Instead, Europeana literature
                    switches back and forth between discussions of the first four distinct audiences
                    as though they fit within the same group; moreover, it never addresses the fifth
                        <q>I</q> audience explicitly.</p>
                <p>What is the potential impact of eliding distinct audiences in this way? When
                    audiences are assumed rather than defined, they default to norms that reinforce
                    existing power relationships. Developers design for themselves, representing
                    assumed users on both the technological side, where API users may in fact share
                    many traits with Europeana developers, and on the public access side, where
                    portal users – often school children doing class projects – probably do not. As
                    such, the portal model suffers from not being what casual access users need in
                    technical terms: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#erway2009">online access to collections is not
                            serving a clear user need</quote>
                        <ptr target="#erway2009" loc="104"/>
                    </cit>. Europeana promotes itself as a rich resource with enough depth to
                    support serious research, yet this kind of take-up by scholars has not been
                    seen, on the portal side or on the API side. In all these discussions, another
                    key audience is never mentioned because it is obscured in the definitional
                    vacuum of Europeana itself: what do heritage institutions get out of their
                    participation in Europeana? This is part and parcel of the tension around
                    concepts of ownership, mentioned earlier, and speaks to the all and each
                    relationship whereby individual contributions are re-aligned with the totalizing
                    effects of government.</p>
                <p>Europeana structures itself around its projected audiences. The most clearly
                    identifiable organizational audiences are also what it relies on to provide
                    content: both organizations and individuals donating content as well as
                    individuals searching for content. Yet Europeana also structures itself around
                    audiences that are less explicitly defined, such as those that are incorporated
                    into the design of the API and the EDM, which we will address in greater detail
                    in the next section. Europeana emphasizes the fact that it wants to
                    incorporate/absorb existing descriptive metadata structures in use by partner
                    institutions: it builds on many standards that are in popular use to maximize
                    the ease of interoperability and encourage the participation of institutional
                    partners <ptr target="#europeana2014" loc="12"/>. This type of move reflects the
                    policy motif of unity in diversity – unification through the aggregation of
                    diverse heritage. </p>
                <p>When the audience is functionally a mirror of the project creators, both the EC
                    and the tech developers, it does not necessarily reflect the way people would
                    actually use or contribute to a digital heritage portal. As Ben Roberts writes, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#roberts2009">how meaningful is such
                            participation when its terms and vocabulary are decided elsewhere?
                            Indeed, what can appear to happen in such debates is a kind of staged
                            engagement with the outside, one which simply mirrors the political
                            establishment</quote>
                        <ptr target="#roberts2009"/>
                    </cit>. This tension is further complicated by the fact that success in this
                    realm is difficult to define: while it is often lamented that students are the
                    most prevalent group of users of the portal, it is unclear who else might use
                    Europeana on a regular basis. The development of the EDM, to which the
                    discussion will now turn, highlights similar issues with regard to the potential
                    problems that arise in the uncertain space between the developers’ ambitions and
                    the needs of organizational and individual users.</p>

            <div>
                <head>The EDM</head>
                <p>The Europeana Data Model (EDM) is the successor of the European Semantic Elements
                    (ESE), metadata which were used to describe the digital objects aggregated by
                    Europeana. Both the ESE and EDM govern the use of metadata in the larger
                    Europeana project, with the aim of creating interoperability between discrete
                    digital collections. The EDM came about in response to claims that the ESE was
                    inadequate to properly express the relationships between CHOs and their digital
                    surrogates. The EDM, a Resource Description Framework (RDF)-based data model,
                    incorporates the existing elements from the ESE, along with additional elements
                    from several other common metadata schemas such as Simple and Qualified Dublin
                    Core (title, format, author, etc); it is also compatible and partly aligned with
                    the major cultural heritage ontology, CIDOC-CRM (<ptr target="#amad2017"/>; <ptr
                        target="#peroni2012"/>). The EDM was implemented as part of Europeana’s
                    Linked Open Data (LOD) pilot. The documentation about the LOD pilot indicates
                    the shifting nature of Europeana’s project: EDM creators note the fact that the
                    LOD pilot was limited from the outset given that the Data Exchange Agreement
                    between donors and Europeana did not specifically call for partner institutions
                    to give permissions to make metadata publicly available. Linked open data, as
                    the <q>open</q> in its name suggests, is based on the ability to share metadata
                    to make linkages work. Because the agreement partner institutions sign with
                    Europeana does not entail public permissions, the exchanges of metadata
                    necessary to link data openly are limited. Isaac et al write about the process
                    of moving Europeana’s database towards open data, explaining: <quote
                        rend="block" source="#isaac2012">It was important that the solution chosen
                        by Europeana should reuse existing standards and be flexible enough in its
                        approach to interoperability to allow their coexistence with custom ones
                        from across the sector. Because Europeana wants to reuse and be reused, a
                        web-based open technology was ideal to make it simple to connect data
                        together and share it. Such semantic web and linked data technologies
                        directly relate to open data strategies. <ptr target="#isaac2012" loc="40"
                        /></quote></p>
                <p>This type of language also exemplifies attempts by those involved with Europeana
                    to unify elements of the project, and to project backwards a more unified vision
                    of Europeana’s development than other events on the timeline indicate. To
                    maximize interoperability, the EDM builds on a commonly used schema like the
                    Dublin Core Internet metadata standard. As Ashraf Amad and Nasreddine Bouhaï
                    explain, <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#amad2017">its primary objective is to unify
                            descriptions originating from various metadata providers to make data
                            accessible on the Europeana website independently of the metadata schema
                            used by the provider</quote>
                        <ptr target="#amad2017" loc="168"/>
                    </cit>. In this way, cultural heritage institutions can move local data about
                    CHOs directly into the EDM without having to do metadata
                        <soCalled>crosswalking,</soCalled> which is to say without engaging in the
                    practice of translating some fields for information to match those fields
                    existing in a different standard that might have different rules or use
                    different types of vocabularies. This type of functionality indicates a shift
                    away from a sole focus on schema development towards creating methods for
                    interoperability and translation between existing schemas <ptr
                        target="#mcdonough2008"/>.</p>
                <p>However, the creation of the EDM raised concerns about a
                        <soCalled>flattening</soCalled> of relationships between pieces of
                    information. Specifically, the need to attribute authority to particular
                    statements presented technological challenges to the developers. We identify two
                    sources of these challenges, although there are likely more. Firstly, the need
                    for proper attribution stems from the complex negotiations between donating
                    institutions who need to demonstrate clear ownership of artworks and the
                    associated digital surrogates and metadata. Secondly, the EDM has to contend
                    with potentially conflicting information given to Europeana by its numerous
                    donors. RDF, the framework used by the EDM, employs simple triples to structure
                    data: a subject and an object are linked by a predicate, or property <ptr
                        target="#cyganiac2014"/>.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Europeana relies on its relationships with content donors who were, until the
                    1914-1918 World War I project, primarily cultural heritage institutions from the
                    Eurozone. Such donors are contributing valuable data to Europeana: Europeana
                    relies on these institutions to create more or less interoperable metadata on
                    which the entire database and platform run and therefore relationships with
                    these institutions must be cultivated. If two contributing institutions submit
                    conflicting metadata about the same CHO, say, for example, one attributes an
                    anonymous artwork to one artist while another institution attributes it to
                    someone else, standard database logic does not allow for such contradictions to
                    exist simultaneously: accommodating contradictions within a database permits it
                    to represent all its assertions as true, as well as all its negations, which
                    would bring down a functional database. Yet Europeana requires a structure that
                    allows institutions to retain their own information as authoritatively true
                    precisely because it aims to side-step disagreements about artist attribution.
                    Therefore, developers opted for a mechanism that allows contradictions to exist
                    within the database without ruining the database’s functionality. This is
                    accomplished through the use of <term>proxy</term> elements which attribute the
                    authority of statements to a particular agent. Isaac et al describe the proxies
                    as <quote rend="block" source="#isaac2012">Enabl[ing] the separation of
                        different views of the same item that may be the focus of multiple
                        aggregations from different providers. In every case, there will be one
                        proxy for the provider descriptive data for an item and another for the data
                        created by Europeana. <ptr target="#isaac2012" loc="38"/></quote></p>
                <p>Europeana developed the proxy notion from the Open Reuse and Exchange (ORE)
                    specification <ptr target="#peroni2012"/>. Proxies separate the items themselves
                    from the information about them. As such, a work of art can simultaneously be
                    attributed to two different artists with the caveat that one attribution comes
                    from one authority, while the second comes from another.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>From the EDM primer, a diagram wherein we have noted the use of proxies
                        (emphasis added by the authors in red).</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.png"/>
                </figure>

                <p>These contradictions are especially important in the cultural heritage sector
                    when representing information such as provenance, which can be questionable and
                    institutionally dependent, or date ranges which differ depending on perspectives
                    and definitions. Contradictions must be represented in a way that retains the
                    integrity of the database structure, and this can be challenging. For example,
                    in an LOD project using CIDOC-CRM to create an interoperable LOD dataset of
                    World War I data and objects, the authors note: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#makela2016">formal encoding of such different
                            viewpoints has been discussed, but remains future work</quote>
                        <ptr target="#makela2016"/>
                    </cit>. The proxies in EDM are designed to accommodate both the programmers, who
                    accept an inelegant use of RDF because it allows for functional programs, and
                    the cultural heritage providers, who can claim authority over their own
                    collections.</p>
                <p>The politics embedded in the technological foundations of the EDM allow the
                    contributing institutions a measure of autonomy that has, in turn, solidified
                    the functionality of the Europeana project as a whole. There is a difficulty in
                    the work of an aggregator like Europeana in that it is engaged, by definition,
                    with many partners. As such, this tension can be described partly as one of
                    scale: in moving beyond a single institution, Europeana must find a way to grant
                    a visible measure of authority to many partners across many nations. </p>
                <p>Digital archive technologies describe such problems of scale for heritage
                    representations as technical ones, thus depoliticizing or decentring the <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#tsing2005">friction</quote>
                        <ptr target="#tsing2005"/>
                    </cit> that inherently occurs in multi-scalar projects like Europeana. Anna
                    Tsing uses the term friction to signal the awkward sites of interconnection
                    across difference <ptr target="#tsing2005" loc="4"/>. Collaborative partners
                    that share the same goals without necessarily sharing other commonalities embody
                    a similar friction. The EDM corresponds to the way friction works, proposing a
                    technological solution for what is an inherently political problem in a way that
                    decenters the power dynamics that arise when actors at individual,
                    organizational, national, and supranational scales are thrown together.</p>
                <p>A key feature of the governmental rationality of all and each is that it can be
                    made to accommodate the politics of difference. It is flexible and aimed at
                    absorbing that which initially seems to unsettle it, making the seamful appear
                    seamless <ptr target="#sherratt2015"/>. The use of proxies in the EDM is an
                    example of this seamlessness and the way in which it is used to accommodate
                    difference. A purposefully seamful way to handle disparities in data would
                    acknowledge and present the difference to a user, and this could be accomplished
                    within an RDF schema using a named graph (see <ptr target="#amad2017"/> for an
                    explanation of this). In the EDM, conversely, proxies are seamless in that they
                    accommodate differences by creating silos. Within one silo, one thing is true,
                    while within another silo, a different thing is true. The result is that, when a
                    user is viewing information, the differences are not apparent, only what is
                    valid within the user’s particular silo is visible. We place this concept of
                    seamlessness into dialogue with the privileged position of neutrality often
                    afforded to technological spaces: the EDM can claim a political neutrality
                    because it frames itself as a solution to a technological problem of data
                    representation. In fact, we argue that the EDM, like the other technologies that
                    together constitute the nebulous entity of Europeana, occupies a place of
                    enormous privilege in the way it chooses to represent its heritage collections,
                    a choice that is, in itself, inherently political.</p>
                <p>This issue links back to the definitional void described above: the lack of
                    definition for a European cultural heritage in Europeana mirrors a lack of
                    definition around the European project more generally. Europeana operates as a
                    form of soft power and a somewhat indirect arbiter, making its power all the
                    more difficult to render visible. In entering into data agreements for
                    aggregation, cultural heritage institutions enter into the all and each dynamic:
                    the actions they take to exert authority over their own collections, while
                    perhaps raising their own profile through their partnership with Europeana, are
                    mutually constitutive of the governmental rationality of culture exercised by
                    the EC. </p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>In this article, we have argued that the study of Europeana has much to
                    contribute to the debates about the relationship between technical expertise,
                    the representation of heritage, and the exercise of government. First, this case
                    study demonstrates the move of all and each; all and each is embedded in
                    Europeana’s very invitation to participate and it implicates its conception of
                    audiences in the same gesture. Second, it highlights the effects of a
                    definitional void: dominant power relations fill a definitional void. The
                    ambition of the EC is unity, but if and when it cannot express that directly,
                    particularly in the current fraught political environment, it instead chooses to
                    emphasize diversity. This is not a logically incompatible goal, but it moves
                    people in an indirect trajectory towards unity: the terms change, but the goal
                    does not.</p>
                <p>The indirect movement towards unity is reflected in the development of the EDM, a
                    space that masks frictional aspects of its networks and relationships <ptr
                        target="#caswell2013"/>. Those in charge of technological developments have
                    the power to remove themselves and their work from spaces of frictional
                    engagement wherein democratically important decisions might be taken. This is
                    accomplished by purposefully focusing on the technological problem – and its
                    resolution – in order to depoliticize it. Hence, the problem of representing
                    different and potentially conflicting national heritage collections becomes a
                    technical conversation about technical problems. However, we argue that such
                    conversations cannot happen without reference to social and political frameworks
                    even though these tensions are masked in the organizational language of
                    Europeana and the EC.</p>
                <p>Friction, as Tsing describes it, has the potential to be productive <ptr
                        target="#tsing2005" loc="4"/>. In the realm of metadata, a move towards
                    translation across schemas, as opposed to the ongoing creation of new schemas
                    that vie for dominance, could be one result of productive friction: such
                    friction both requires and allows communities to come into contact.
                    Professionalizing the task of data model creation, to unify and standardize
                    metadata across cultural heritage institutions, is an elegant solution to a
                    difficult problem, even if Europeana’s use of RDF is a somewhat inelegant use of
                    an ostensibly straightforward framework. But the professionalized environment in
                    which Europeana was created is also a political one, underpinned by the drive
                    for European cohesion, as we have shown in this article. As such, there is no
                    requirement to open such processes up to debate in ways that preclude the
                    project’s <soCalled>European</soCalled> character, or to create a space for
                    dialogue as part of the development process. </p>
                <p>Yet, as we have also argued, technical solutions for political problems do not
                    necessarily work, even when they <soCalled>work</soCalled>. Responding to the
                    questions this article raises, increasingly so because of the current
                    uncertainty surrounding the future of the EU, demands openness of process
                    without assuming total interoperability. To that end, we propose a challenge to
                    the idea of interoperability as total – and seamless – assimilation. There are
                    ways in which interoperability could be productively frictional but are not,
                    because of the discourses of neutrality around technology and because of the
                    political forces motivating Europeana’s technological development. Europeana is
                    not neutral, it is a project and tool aimed at promoting European unity. The
                    totalizing and individualizing move of unity in diversity does not take account
                    of the way different heritages also work against each other, creating a space of
                    friction. It is from this space of friction, we argue, that we can find the
                    means to fill a definitional void in a way that contests existing power
                    relations. This friction has the potential to allow tools like Europeana to be
                    used in a recuperative fashion, rather than as a technique of government on a
                    supranational scale.</p>
