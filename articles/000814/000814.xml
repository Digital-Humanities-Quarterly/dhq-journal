            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>As in other western cities, the fast-paced urban, industrial, and commercial sprawl
               of Paris during the 19th century provided the backdrop and driving force for the
               publishing phenomenon of trade directories. We show how these collections of millions
               of nominative entries associated with addresses can be turned into a serial dataset
               whose massive, fine-grained, and geolocated nature opens up new possibilities for
               quantitative and multi-scale analyses of the dynamics at play during one of the most
               dramatic socio-spatial transformations of the city. We highlight the methodological
               conditions of such data-driven analyses and emphasize the importance of understanding
               source effects. The findings underscore the significance of data science in
               critically evaluating digital sources and adhering to best practices in the
               production of large historical datasets.</p>

            <p>City directories are extensive lists of residents, shops, businesses, and
               institutions, with a description of their professional or commercial activity and an
               address to locate them. They became a widespread publishing phenomenon in Europe and
               the USA during the 19th century, subsequent to the introduction of house numbering in
               the 18th century <ptr target="#tantner_2009"/>
               <ptr target="#rose-redwood_2012"/>
               <ptr target="#albers_2023"/>. The primary purpose of directories was to facilitate
               business relations between people, whether through written correspondence or by
               visiting the listed address. Published at a rapid pace (often annually) throughout
               the 19th and 20th centuries, they form sequences of highly detailed snapshots of the
               economic activities taking place in a city. They are a highly fine-grained source of
               information for interdisciplinary studies of cities, as well as for specialized
               fields research such as urban studies and historical economics <ptr
                  target="#dileonardo_2019"/>
               <ptr target="#bell_2020"/>. Yet their potential for quantitative historical studies
               is vastly under-exploited, due to the extensive transcription, geocoding and
               structuring operations required to transform them into digital databases.</p>
            <p>In the research project SoDUCo, we developed an automatic pipeline to extract,
               semantically annotate, geocode, and structure 144 directories of Paris published
               between 1787 and 1914. This process involved image segmentation to detect entries,
               OCR for text extraction, named entity recognition and geocoding to assign geographic
               positions to the addresses in directory entries, resulting in an open dataset of
               about 23 million records <ptr target="#geohistoricaldata_2023"/>.</p>
            <p>The spatial and social dynamics of European cities in the 19th century are
               characterized by growth, sprawl, and socio-economic transformations as a result of
               industrialization. Growth and sprawl dynamics have been mainly investigated using
               demographic sources, dependent on census rationale and administrative boundaries, or
               getting morphological information from city plans. Both types of sources are less
               detailed than directories in terms of spatial and temporal scale.</p>
            <p>For the first time, it is possible to study the dynamics of a European capital at a
               key moment in its history, with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution and extent:
               address-level information for the whole city, roughly every year over more than a
               century. Adopting a data-driven geography perspective, we demonstrate that the Paris
               directories dataset is a valuable multi-scale and multi-granularity (spatial and
               temporal) research tool for analyzing the city’s urban growth throughout the 19th
               century. However, such a massive digital dataset can mask many biases and source
               effects. We show that an expert examination of the directories, and their extracted
               and geocoded content, helps to better understand the dynamics at work in the city’s
               urbanizing margins.</p>
            <p>Paris changed a lot between 1787 and 1914. Demographic growth is considerable, rising
               from an estimated 593k inhabitants in 1780 to around 2.9M in 1911 <ptr
                  target="#bree_2020"/>
               <ptr target="#varet-vitu_2020"/>, partly combined with strong urban sprawl. Major
               planning policies have led to significant transformations in the urban fabric that
               affected the organization of the city, house numbering and street naming. Haussmann’s
               renovation (1853-1870) dramatically reshaped entire parts of the city, while the
               merging of all neighboring municipalities following the 1859 law on the extension of
               Paris, abruptly doubled the city administrative area in 1860 <ptr
                  target="#jordan_1995"/>
               <ptr target="#montel_2012"/>. Until then, the municipal territory was bounded by the
                  <foreign xml:lang="fr">Fermiers généraux</foreign> wall<note> This name
                  disappeared with the abolition of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">Ferme

                     >Barrières de Paris</foreign> were nationalized and in the 19th century became
                  known as the <hi rend="italic">octroi</hi> wall. The physical reality of this
                  boundary did not change much despite the changes in names. For the sake of
                  consistency, we refer to it as the <q><foreign xml:lang="fr">Fermiers
                        généraux</foreign> wall</q> in the paper for the entire study period.</note>
               (Figure 1, delineation of the blank area). The division of Paris into districts and
               arrondissements was completely revised when the administrative area was extended to
               the Thiers wall in 1860. Built between 1841 and 1844, this fortified belt is already
               planned on the map of Figure 1 dating from 1831. The red-lavished built-up areas
               already stretch along the main roads that connect the city to the surrounding
               networks beyond its administrative boundaries.</p>

            <p>The study of urban fabric depends on the ability to map directory entries in
               geographic space on the basis of the addresses they contain. This operation, known as
               geocoding, is essential and requires precise knowledge of the evolution of the urban
               fabric of Paris, in particular the numbering of buildings and houses.</p>
            <p>The introduction of systematic house numbering in European and American cities during
               the 18th century reflected the emergence of a regulatory and rationalist vision of
               municipal administrations in their territories <ptr target="#rose-redwood_2012"/>.
               The first<note> In Paris, numbering houses in the suburbs became compulsory from
                  1727-1728, in an attempt by the royal authorities to regulate and limit urban
                  expansion in these rapidly urbanizing areas <ptr target="#tantner_2009"/>. The
                  first attempt at numbering buildings in Paris, however, was a privately undertaken
                  project by Marin Kreenfelt de Storcks in 1779 <ptr target="#varet-vitu_2020"
                  />.</note> systematic numbering of all buildings in Paris was attempted by the
               revolutionary administration in 1790, only to be replaced in 1805 by a numbering
               based on a standardized set of rules still in place today. Although the system
               stabilized from 1805 onward, Paris’ growth and densification caused frequent changes
               in the numbering, throughout the 19th century. Despite this instability, it is
               notable that residents quickly adopt the numbering system as a way of locating
               themselves in the city <ptr target="#denis_2015"/>.</p>
            <p>Our paper is structured into five sections. We begin with a literature review on
               geocoding strategies in historical spaces, with a focus on Paris (Section 2). We then
               present the directories editors’ conception of the city of Paris and the corpus
               constituted to study the dynamics of the Parisian urban fabric (Section 3). In the
               following methodological section, we explain how we apprehend the urban fabric
               through density analysis of distinct geolocated address points in directories
               (Section 4). We demonstrate that these address points serve as a reliable proxy of
               the Parisian urban fabric, allowing us to analyze urban sprawl, de-densification of
               the center, and local densification trajectories between 1822 and 1914 through a
               data-driven geographic approach (Section 5). Finally, we discuss the challenges of
               capturing urban margins and the choices made in transcribing and enriching Paris
               directories, highlighting best practices and emphasizing the role of data science in
               critically assessing this large digital source (Section 6).</p>

            <head>2. Literature review: Geocoding addresses in historical spaces</head>
            <p>If directory entries can be systematically located in urban space through addresses,
               enabling spatial and spatio-temporal analysis, it is necessary to translate the
               addresses into precise geographical coordinates — in short, to geocode them.</p>
            <p>Geocoding, whether automated or manual, is a standard data preparation step in
               quantitative social sciences that focus on the spatial dimension of phenomena.
               However, it can introduce significant bias in spatial analysis <ptr
                  target="#zandbergen_2009"/> and presents a methodological challenge for fields
               relying on statistical methods and large-scale, fine-grained data, particularly at
               the individual level, such as health research and historical demography <ptr
                  target="#delmelle_2022"/>. A notable example is the study of <ptr
                  target="#hedefalk_2018"/>, analyzing how geocoding strategies affect spatial
               analyses of the relationships between population density, proximity to wetlands, and
               mortality rates in Swedish parishes (1850–1914). Their study shows a significant
               underestimation of mortality and a weakening of statistical significance when the
               granularity of the geodata supporting the geocoding is coarser than that of the
               demographic data recorded at parcel level.</p>
            <p>While in many geohistorical studies geocoding is done manually, e.g. using GIS
               software, here we focus on its automation using software tools called <title
                  rend="quotes">geocoders</title>, which are the only reasonable option for handling
               large datasets. Geocoders are search engines capable of returning the geographic
               coordinates of a place from a textual reference to that place, such as a postal
               address, based on a reference geospatial database. Geocoding historical data presents
               its own challenges, as it often requires a database adapted to the period and region
               under study. There are three general strategies for historical geocoding, depending
               on the level of detail required, the scale of analysis, and the availability of
               geospatial data sources.</p>
            <p>One strategy involves either the direct use of contemporary on-the-shelf geocoding
               services such as Nominatim or ArcGIS <ptr target="#pearce_2018"/>, or the development
               of geocoding tools that leverage contemporary gazetteers and knowledge bases like
               Geonames or DBPedia <ptr target="#ahlfeldt_2016"/>. This is well suited to small
               datasets where the time gap between the historical data and the geocoder reference
               database is reduced. However, an extensive step of manual inspection and correction
               is often required to ensure consistent and reliable results, as the lack of
               synchronicity between the geocoder and the queries can lead to a high false positive
               rate. Some proposals incorporate heuristics to reduce uncertainty and errors, e.g. by
               reducing the search area considered for each query <ptr target="#daras_2015"/>.</p>
            <p>A second strategy is to build custom geocoders for historical data which combine
               multiple gazetteers, either loosely coupled <ptr target="#mertel_2021"/> or fully
               integrated in a single database <ptr target="#cura_2018"/>. Efforts are concentrated
               on creating a historical reference database for the geocoder, extracting data in
               historical sources like maps, or integrating existing historical geodatasets. The
               goal is to create a geocoding process that fits the case study to achieve better
               consistency while still being able to deal with large scale and fine-grained data.
               The main drawback being the cost of building the reference data, but these approaches
               tend to favor open data pooling and crowdsourcing to build large historical
               gazetteers <ptr target="#grossner_2021"/>.</p>
            <p>The third hybrid strategy aims to get the best of both worlds by coupling large,
               up-to-date geographic databases with specialized historical gazetteers. For example,
               to locate historical census addresses from 1901 in England and Wales, <ptr
                  target="#lan_2019"/> use a lower granularity historical gazetteer as a fallback to
               geocoding on the Ordnance Survey address database</p>
            <p>The dramatic instability of Paris address numbers over the 19th century precludes
               anachronistic geospatial references as a geocoding support and calls for the use of
               address geodatabases contemporary with the directories (see Appendix 8.1).</p>

            <p>Challenges arise with the Parisian directories corpus due to its construction from
               sources spanning over a long time period. Changes in political, technical,
               economical, and social contexts affect how companies edit directory collections and
               display their content. As a result, the internal organization of directories evolves
               over time, as does their social coverage. We present the corpus compiled for this
               paper (3.1.) and then show that editors had conceived Parisian space in terms of
               socio-economic functioning (3.2.).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Directory address lists typically follow three formats: alphabetical, by
                  profession, and by street (see Figure 2) to facilitate searching for readers of
                  the time. Paris directories list a wide variety of individuals: diverse merchants,
                  craftsmen, manufacturers, doctors, midwifes, lawyers, bankers, owners, annuitants,
                  etc. The lists and their content, however, changed over time. Until the late
                  1810s, alphabetical lists included prominent inhabitants, while professional lists
                  featured merchants. After that, alphabetical lists began to combine both
                  categories. From 1903 onward, the editors of the Didot-Bottin moved prominent
                  residents into a separate directory entitled <title rend="italic" xml:lang="fr"
                     >Bottin mondain</title>
                  <ptr target="#firmin-didot_1903"/>.</p>
               <p>We selected directories approximately five years to study urban sprawl and
                  densification. We assume this temporal resolution to be precise enough to capture
                  city-scale dynamics while keeping the dataset to a reasonable size. The selection
                  of specific years is however a compromise between methodological choices and
                  practical constraints, such as digitization quality or our desire to study a
                  common collection of directories, since they are more comparable with each other
                  than directories from different collections (see Appendix 8.2).</p>

               <p>Editors never explain their conception of Paris and its limits. As an example, the
                  prospectus for the directory published by Bottin in 1820 describes the
                  organization of the book as follows: <quote rend="inline">The Almanach du Commerce
                     presents three main divisions: 1° Paris; 2° French departments and colonies; 3°
                     foreign countries. The first division, Paris, alone occupies two-fifths of the
                     volume, and begins with lists of the capital’s merchants</quote>
                  <ptr target="#bottin_1820" loc="prospectus, our translation"/>. In a lengthy
                  paragraph, Sébastien Bottin explains the major changes he has made to the
                  nomenclatures of the lists and the cross-referencing systems, compared with the
                  lists published by Jean de La Tynna two years earlier, but he is silent on his
                  conception of the delimitation of Paris.</p>

                     généraux</foreign> wall before 1860 reveals the editors’ conception of Paris.
                  Figure 3 represents geolocated addresses in western Paris in 1855 and 1860. The

                  in 1855 on Figure 3). In this sense, editors did not conceive Paris in terms of
                  its administrative and fiscal boundaries, but in terms of its socio-economic
                  functioning. The important issue was to connect individuals in the city and from
                  the city with others who were part of wider networks by establishing lists, and
                  including, if necessary, individuals who lived or performed their activities

               <p>A single directory entry may contain several addresses, and the same address may
                  be found in many directory entries. For instance, when an entry contains a
                  separate manufacturing and sales location or, conversely, when the same
                  manufacturing location houses several manufacturers. As a result, the geocoding
                  process of entries locates all occurrences of the same address at the same
                  coordinates, resulting in many duplicated address points (see Appendix 8.3.1 for
                  an extended example).</p>
               <p>Since the study focuses on the evolution of the urban fabric using directories,
                  rather than the distribution of individuals in the city, we consider only unique
                  occurrences of geocoded addresses within each directory. To achieve this, we group
                  overlapping geocoded address points into a single point, retaining only distinct

                  project provides an opportunity for a heuristic knowledge discovery approach:
                  Starting from the hypothesis that geolocated addresses may correlate with the
                  urban sprawl and densification of Paris, we explore the various aspects of the
                  data that may bear witness to this dynamic.</p>
               <p>We prioritize geovisualizations to facilitate data exploration and understanding.
                  Our focus is on the evolution of the density of geolocated addresses over time and
                  at the city scale, deliberately setting aside the analysis of point patterns. We
                  chose not to delve on spatial patterns in the local configurations of all
                  geolocated address points as they are deeply tied to urban structures such as the
                  street network, which has already been extensively analyzed for Paris during the
                  19th century <ptr target="#barthelemy_2013"/>.</p>
               <p>Additionally, we opt for a discrete representation of densities rather than
                  estimating continuous spatial distributions, e.g. through kernel smoothing. First,
                  the results of these techniques may be less well understood from an interpretative
                  point of view. Indeed, regular tessellation <quote rend="inline">suggest the use
                     of an estimation process [...] in contrast, smooth contour lines give little
                     clue to this underlying estimation step</quote>
                  <ptr target="#carr_1992" loc="p. 231"/>. Secondly, as noted by <ptr
                     target="#evangelista_2018"/>, social spatio-temporal phenomena are typically
                  discrete information; in our case, they exist only where addresses are present.
                  Spatial smoothing techniques are likely to spread information in areas where there
                  are no buildings and addresses, generating cartographic artifacts which impair
                  visual understanding of the phenomenon. The edges of the city, which are a focal
                  point of our study, would be significantly affected as data points are scarce in
                  those areas.</p>
               <p>In order to have a stable framework for studying the evolution of geolocated
                  addresses, we create a hexagonal grid covering the maximal extent of Paris over
                  the 19th century, then bin geolocated addresses points in cells at each time step
                  to produce a series of 2D histograms whose cells are immediately comparable <ptr
                     target="#carr_1992"/>. The advantage of a hexagonal grid over a more commonly
                  used square grid is that the nearest neighbors in a hexagonal grid are
                  symmetrical. Indeed, the barycenters of neighboring hexagons are equidistant,
                  unlike those of a square grid, where diagonal neighbors have greater distances
                  than neighbors of the four cardinal directions. As Peuquet noted, <quote
                     rend="inline">radial symmetry makes this model advantageous for radial search
                     and retrieval functions,</quote>
                  <ptr target="#peuquet_1984" loc="p. 85"/> making it especially useful for
                  analyzing intra-urban density, given the center-periphery structure of this
                  spatial phenomenon.</p>
               <p>The drawbacks of this method are the same as those of the quadrats<note> The
                     quadrat method in spatial distribution analysis involves dividing the study
                     area into equal subunits (e.g. a square grid) to assess the distribution of a
                     phenomenon or population across these subunits (e.g. grid cells).</note>: It is
                  not sensitive to the relative position of the addresses within the cells, and the
                  densities created are sensitive to the resolution of the grid. The first
                  limitation is irrelevant in our case as we are not interested in exploring point
                  patterns. However, the second limitation is important because the aggregation of a
                  points pattern into area-based surfaces is always sensitive to the size of the
                  spatial entities <ptr target="#openshaw_1983"/>. The larger they are, the weaker
                  the spatial differentiation/concentration. In order to choose an appropriate grid
                  resolution, we proceeded iteratively by testing several cell sizes from 100 to
                  1,000 m (Figure 4, a). The average density of geolocated addresses across
                  different hexagon sizes at three different dates reveals continuous growth (Figure
                  4, b). Consequently, there is no particular hexagon size that should be
                  prioritized to measure urban density. Instead, the selection of one hexagon size
                  over another must be made qualitatively. After several iterations of size
                  parameter explorations, we settled on a threshold of 400 m, which appears to be a
                  good compromise. On the one hand, the grid remains quite fine, as a 400 m hexagon
                  represents a very small central district of Paris. On the other hand, it is wide
                  enough to ensure cartographic legibility.</p>

            <head>5. Urban sprawl and density of Paris (1822-1914)</head>
            <p>The data obtained from the digital transcription and enrichment of directories
               changes the analytical framework: 1) in terms of precision, with very fine spatial
               (address-level) and temporal (quasi-annual) resolutions; 2) in terms of scope, as the
               entire spatial and temporal evolution of the city can be apprehended over a century.
               In this section, we show how these changes enable us to build up a global panorama of
               socio-spatial dynamics of Paris. We examine the urban space drawn by the directories
               and the gazetteer used in the geocoder (5.1). We then present a synthetic overview of
               the urban sprawl and de-densification of central Paris between 1822 and 1914 (5.2).
               Finally, we show how the data-driven approach reveals differentiated urban dynamics
               (in space and time), providing the basis for new hypotheses and further research
               (5.3).</p>

               <p>We approximate the <q>numbered</q> space of Paris through the concave hulls
                  calculated from the address points of two atlases of the gazetteer. The resulting
                  areas are shown to scale in black in Figure 5, together with the administrative
                  boundaries of the city (in white) and the total mapped area (in gray). Both
                  atlases are working and communication tools of the Municipality, showing the
                  surroundings of the city for illustration purposes, and do not indicate any
                  numbers in these zones. Within the city, the space covered by numbers does not
                  cover the whole administrative area. The difference is noticeable between 1836 and
                  1888. At that date, only the outskirts of the fortifications are unnumbered, while
                  address points are rare in a wide band around the 1836 boundaries. These areas are
                  shown as built-up on the maps, but they are made up of large urban blocks that are
                  often devoid of information, suggesting that urbanization is still very partial,
                  or at least poorly recorded by the urban administration.</p>

                     compute the concave hulls (alpha-shapes with alpha=0.5) from the set of address
                     points in each map. The resulting form represents a <q>numbering front line</q>

               <p>Comparing address points extracted from the atlases with geolocated addresses of
                  directories allows cross-analysis of the areas covered by these two kinds of
                  sources. We focus on (1) the subsets of distinct addresses in the gazetteer for
                  the two atlases<note> The central points of the streets are counted in addition to
                     the set of address points (see Appendix 8.1).</note>, and (2) the distinct
                  geolocated addresses in the 1835 and 1890 directories. The sets of points in the
                  gazetteer and the directories can be compared by looking at their relative spatial
                  distribution (Figure 6). Each sub-figure (a, b, c, d) plots the ratio <formula
                     notation="tex" rend="inline">\( ρ_g/ρ_d\)</formula> of the density of
                  geolocated addresses in a directory <formula notation="tex" rend="inline"

                  (left: the Jacoubet 1836 atlas, right: the Municipal 1888 atlas). Values less than
                  1 indicate that the directory contains more geolocated addresses than the
                  gazetteer. This is possible because the geocoder prioritizes sources close to the
                  query date but can also retrieve results from a more temporally distant
                  cartographic source (see Appendix 8.1). For example, if an address from the 1835
                  directory is not found in the Jacoubet source, it may be geocoded using data from
                  the 1888 Municipal atlas. To help the reader, the main figures are accompanied by
                  the density maps of the geolocated addresses of the directory and the atlas
                  compared.</p>

               <p>Views (a) and (d) in Figure 6 show that the ratio between each directory and its

                  addresses in the 1835 and 1890 directories are geolocated (see Appendix 8.3.2).
                  The directories therefore are fairly representative of the density of the numbered
                  buildings, with less accuracy for the recently urbanized edges.</p>
               <p>A subset of addresses from the 1835 directory have been geocoded using the 1888
                  atlas, as shown in (b). However, there are very few of these directory addresses
                  compared with those of the atlas in 1888 (see density maps to the right in (b)).
                  Conversely in (c), the 1890 directory shows that the margins of Paris before 1860
                  are now largely present in the directory and are anchored in an area that is
                  probably much denser than in 1836 (green hexagons). The opposite dynamic can be
                  seen in the extreme center of the city. Indeed, there are fewer geolocated
                  addresses in the 1890 directory than in the Jacoubet atlas (c), and more addresses
                  in the 1835 directory than in the Municipal atlas (b).</p>

               <p>Figure 7 (a) reveals a panorama of the density of Paris through the cartography of
                  all geolocated addresses. The space is particularly dense in the vicinity of La
                  Cité and Saint-Louis Islands. On the right bank of the Seine (to the north), the
                  very high density is mainly included within the former boundary of the enclosure
                  of Charles V. On the left bank of the Seine (to the south), the densest areas are
                  those formerly included in the wall of Philippe Auguste, particularly in the Odéon
                  neighborhood and the Latin Quarter.</p>
               <p>The center-periphery gradient of urban density is also clearly visible from La
                  Cité. On the left bank, the gradient runs southeast along Mouffetard street to the
                  Saint-Marcel faubourg. From the Odéon neighborhood, the gradient is noticeable to
                  the west, along Saint-Germain boulevard. On the right bank, the center-periphery
                  gradient is sharper to the east of the dense zone than to the north and west. From
                  the dense center, the gradient runs eastwards from the Saint-Paul neighborhood
                  through Bastille to Saint-Antoine, along Faubourg Saint-Antoine street, and then
                  northwards to Charonne. A gradient is also noticeable from the Marais to
                  Belleville. In the years 1820–1850, these central-eastern areas were the most
                  densely concentrated in terms of workshops and factories. Although the
                  industrialization of Paris led to the establishment of large industrial
                  establishments from the 1850s onward all around the <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                     >Fermiers généraux</foreign> walls (much less in the west), the collective
                  manufactures remained concentrated in the center-east until the end of the century

                  (center-west), and in Batignolles and Épinettes neighborhoods (north-west), near

                  geolocated addresses. Sub-figure (b) shows the frequency of hexagons appearance
                  and disappearance. A hexagon appears when it contains geolocated addresses at time
                     <formula notation="tex" rend="inline">\(t+1\)</formula> while being empty at
                  time <formula notation="tex" rend="inline">\(t\)</formula> (and vice-versa for a
                  disappearance). New areas covered by directories were quite numerous until 1860,
                  with hexagon appearances representing between 12 and 20% of them (shown in (b)).
                  However, the variation from one date to the next reveals some noise during the
                  geocoding in areas outside the municipal boundary before 1860 (see discussion in
                  Section 6.1). Thereafter, appearances become less numerous, although new areas
                  continue to be occupied up to the mid-1870s. Meanwhile, less dense and more
                  peripheral areas also undergo erasure movements until the early 1840s, with
                  between 10 and 15% of hexagons disappearing<note> Sub-figure (b) in Figure 7 does
                     not confirm this interpretation, but suggests the possibility. The maps in
                     Figure 8 indicate that the peripheral hexagons, often characterized by low
                     density (as depicted in map (a) in Figure 7), are the ones that
                     disappear.</note>. This trend persisted until 1870, albeit with a significant
                  reduction.</p>
               <p>The center-periphery gradient persists throughout the study period (see Figure 7,
                  (c)), but it gradually diminishes over time. For instance, until 1855, the density
                  ranges from around 200 to 300 geolocated addresses per hexagon within
                  approximately 1 km of Notre-Dame cathedral, sharply declining beyond 2 km to
                  approximately 1 to 50 geolocated addresses per hexagon. Similar patterns are
                  observed until 1864, with slightly denser hexagons beyond 2 km from Notre-Dame.
                  Then, from 1870 to 1914, central areas experienced a slight decrease in density,
                  with hexagons within 1 km of Notre-Dame consisting of approximately 200 geolocated
                  addresses, while peripheral areas beyond 2 km became much denser. However, density
                  variations between hexagons remain significant, as evidenced by the notable
                  fluctuations of the thin lines in (c).</p>

               <p>We explore the overall picture in greater depth over time and space, in order to
                  identify the dynamics of urban density more precisely. To this end, we plot the
                  slope of the number of geolocated addresses per hexagon, normalized in space by
                  period in Figure 8. This representation provides two main spatial and temporal
                  reading levels. The first level refers to the whole city for a given period, and
                  the second to a specific segment of the city over several periods. In the
                  following subsections, we develop these two reading levels through case
                  studies.</p>

                  <head>Dynamics of urban density of Paris over the period 1822-1914. The slope S
                     describes the change in the number of geolocated addresses per hexagon between
                     two dates, divided by the length of the period noted δ(t). So, S = (Nh<hi
                        rend="subscript">t+1</hi> - Nh<hi rend="subscript">t</hi>)/δ(t), with Nh the

                     period corresponds to the centered-scaled value, where the mean and standard
                     deviation of slope are calculated from the set of hexagons contained in the
                     space for each period. The criteria for selecting one particular date over
                     another are linked to the availability of directory digital versions and the
                     desire to study coherent directories collections (see Appendix 8.2).</head>

                  <p>Given that hexagons are growing on average for each period, negative values
                     generally represent lower relative growths than hexagons with positive values
                     in Figure 8. As an example in the initial period (1822–1825), there is a trend
                     of greater relative growth of geolocated addresses in the city center compared
                     to the periphery, indicating a notable center-periphery gradient.</p>
                  <p>Some periods may be marked by general decline. This is particularly true of the
                     years 1900–1904, where the average slope is -0.222. The positive values of the
                     hexagons thus reflect a lower relative decline than those of the negative
                     values (in strong decline). The decline in the number of geolocated

                        of the initial slope values. We refer the wishing reader to the open access

                  <p>The general decline in 1900–1904 reflects editorial choices made by the company
                     that published directories during this period. Indeed, starting from 1903, the
                     editors of the Didot-Bottin initiated the creation of a separate directory
                     dedicated to prominent individuals, titled the <title rend="italic"
                        xml:lang="fr">Bottin mondain</title>
                     <ptr target="#firmin-didot_1903"/>. This new edition led to the exclusion of
                     individuals from the Didot-Bottin general directory studied here. The excluded
                     entries are varied, notably individuals designated as owners or annuitants, but
                     also deputies, ministers, or advisors at the Court of Cassation. Other
                     categories such as bankers, placement agents, and doctors remained in the
                     general directory. Thus, these people were not considered to belong to this
                     social echelon by the editors of the time, and/or they were deemed
                     indispensable to the list of actors in the socio-economic life of Paris,
                     appearing in both lists (the specific <title rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">Bottin
                        mondain</title> list and the general list).</p>
                  <p>The socio-spatial divide of Paris from west to east is well-known during the
                     20th century, notably thanks to historical studies of the <title rend="italic"
                        xml:lang="fr">Bottin mondain</title> conducted by Cyril Grange <ptr
                        target="#grange_1993"/>. However, the gradient of the social division of
                     Parisian space at the turn of the 20th century is clearly identifiable on the
                     1900-1904 map in Figure 8. The gradient is not entirely linear. It includes a
                     hyper-concentration (dark green hexagons on map) of prominent inhabitants in
                     the 8th arrondissement (south of Parc Monceau) and the 16th arrondissement
                     (Chaillot neighborhood). On the other hand, a continuum of affluent
                     neighborhoods is apparent in the city’s center-north (9th arrondissement),
                     center-southwest (in the 7th arrondissement between Saint-Germain and the
                     Invalides), and in the center near the Saint-Louis Island. Other areas are also
                     noteworthy, in particular the Petit Montrouge district in the south of Paris in
                     the 14th arrondissement. Indeed, the south of the district is wealthy (see
                     Appendix 8.4), whereas the concentration of affluent families is almost
                     invisible on the scale of the districts of Paris studied by <ptr
                        target="#grange_1993"/>. This is likely due to the fact that his study is
                     based on a sample of 4,500 addresses from the <hi rend="italic">Bottin

                     whereas the present study is based on all the addresses of the directories,

                  <p>Figure 8 lets us analyze the density trajectory of a city segment over time.
                     The data-driven approach offers two main advantages: 1) We do not predetermine
                     the study area a priori, e.g. by selecting districts or arrondissements; 2) the
                     dynamics of the area under study are examined in relation to the urban space as
                     a whole.</p>
                  <p>In the 1850s and 1860s, the west of Paris underwent significant street
                     development, leading to the emergence of new neighborhoods and increased urban
                     density in these areas. Indeed, while only 9.3% of Haussmann’s construction
                     expenditure was associated with the newly annexed area beyond the <hi
                        rend="italic">Fermiers généraux</hi>, most of the work was carried out in
                     western Paris, with the development of the Place de l’Étoile and the
                     Champs-Élysées, for example <ptr target="#faure_2004"/>. Street development is
                     well-documented in cartographic sources <ptr target="#andriveau-goujon_1868"/>
                     and particularly significant in the 16th arrondissement and the south of the
                     17th arrondissement, south of the railroad lines leading to the freight station
                     near Batignolles and the Saint-Lazare station (see Figure 3). However, the rate
                     and extent of the densification of this area are unknown.</p>
                  <p>This area has been entirely covered by hexagons since the mid-1850s (in
                     particular beyond the <foreign xml:lang="fr">Fermiers généraux</foreign> wall,
                     see Figure 8). Geolocated addresses show overall positive slopes from that
                     point until 1900, but the normalized slopes per period shown in Figure 8 only
                     exhibit consistently positive trends from the mid-1880s in the 16th
                     arrondissement (with the exception of the years 1864–1870). On the other hand,
                     they show positive trends from the mid-1850s onward for the southern part of
                     the 17th arrondissement (except for the period 1880–1885). Consequently,
                     compared to other parts of Paris that experienced densification during the
                     second half of the 19th century, the intensity of densification in the southern
                     part of the 17th arrondissement was significant enough by 1855–1860 to be
                     notable on a citywide scale. However, it was not until another three decades
                     later that densification in the 16th arrondissement became apparent, coinciding
                     with a period of deceleration in densification across the city.</p>
                  <p>Several factors contribute to understanding this difference in the pace of
                     densification in Paris. Firstly, large industrial establishments were set up
                     mainly in the north and east of Paris between 1850 and 1870. This partly
                     accompanied the urban growth and densification shown in Figure 8. Subsequently,
                     Haussmann’s work in central Paris involved the construction of new streets and
                     the reorganization of city blocks to accommodate new buildings. To achieve
                     this, the administration’s authority to expropriate property was extended in
                     1852. Between the end of that year and 1859, 2,236 houses were demolished by
                     expropriation in Paris, according to Haussmann himself. As a result, over time,
                     some of the city’s inhabitants migrated to more peripheral areas — notably to
                     the east — all the more so as rents of older constructions raised dramatically
                     in the 1850s (by over 50%). Lastly, the newly built-up areas of the north of
                     the 16th and south of 17th arrondissements are characterized by wide avenues
                     and a high concentration of Haussman-style buildings, which have a low built
                     density compared to other Parisian areas <ptr target="#larroque_1980"/>
                     <ptr target="#faure_2004"/>.</p>
                  <p>In addition, qualitative analysis of the geocoding quality of directory entries
                     in the years 1855–1860 reinforces the identification of the local trajectories
                     of the south of the 17th arrondissement. Figure 3 shows geocoding problems in
                     the western edge of the city. In 1855, some entries were incorrectly geocoded,
                     as in Jouffroy street, south of the railroad lines. All the addresses in the
                     directory refer to the <quote rend="inline">Passage Jouffroy,</quote> opened in
                     1845 and located in Montmartre. The densification dynamic between 1845 and 1850
                     observed by the two pink hexagons in Figure 8 is thus a geocoding bias. On the
                     other hand, the problem of distinguishing between the Jouffroy passageway and
                     street during geocoding is the same for the years 1855 and 1860. Consequently,
                     the calculation of space-normalized slope for this period — and subsequent
                     periods — is not altered by this geocoding bias, and the growth of the southern
                     17th arrondissement since 1855–1860 is historically dynamic.</p>

            <p>First, a qualitative assessment of the geocoding results for the 1845 directory
               enables us to elaborate on the challenge of accurately apprehending urban margins
               prior to the 1860 extension of Paris (6.1). We then examine the increasingly pressing
               issue of how data produced by third parties can be appropriated and properly reused
               in historical sciences, especially with the recent surge in open digital data from
               archival sources. This challenge is particularly significant when large volumes of
               digital data are generated through automated extraction and enrichment processes. We
               discuss two main questions: How and under what conditions can such digital sources be
               used effectively? (6.2) How can we understand them, assess their quality and their
               relationship with the original sources? (6.3)</p>

               <p>Examining the geocoding outcome and metadata of a specific directory enables a
                  qualitative and critical assessment of the process. We concentrate the evaluation
                  on the 1845 Didot directory because it was edited after the completion of the
                  Thiers wall, which created a new singular interface between the old and new
                  enclosure <ptr target="#firmin-didot_1845"/>.</p>
               <p>The table in Appendix 8.3.3 presents geocoding statistics for the 1845 directory,
                  organized according to the granularity level at which a match was found in the
                  gazetteer (at street or address-point). 94.6% of the geolocated addresses of the
                  directory are address-point. Looking at the contribution of the gazetteer’s
                  sources of the geocoder, 88.2% of them match with the 1836 Jacoubet atlas. These
                  high proportions of matching from the 1845 directory and 1836 gazetteer reveal
                  that the majority of addresses are located within the administrative limits of
                  Paris. The residual set of extra-muros geolocated addresses is very low: Only 172
                  are located outside of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">Fermiers généraux</foreign> wall
                  (0.009%).</p>
               <p>A detailed study of these specific geolocations reveals that only 40% are correct
                  (see the map in Appendix 8.3.3). They are mainly concentrated in the business
                  neighborhoods of Bercy and near Ivry station, as well as in a few places around
                  Grenelle-Vaugirard and Vincennes. In the north, they are concentrated in a few
                  streets in the neighboring municipalities of La Villette, Montmartre and
                  Batignolles-Monceaux. However, these last two municipalities have expanded since
                  the 1820s <ptr target="#frondizi_2018"/>. These front lines of extramural
                  activities are confirmed by the systematic manual examination of the 123 addresses
                  in the alphabetical list and interpreted by the geocoder as <q>localities</q> (see
                  the table in Appendix 8.3.3).</p>
               <p>To sum up, the alphabetical list of 1845 partially records activities in the inner
                  suburbs. A focus on these peculiar spaces would require leveraging complementary
                  sources, in particular the <foreign xml:lang="fr">Départements</foreign> section
                  of the Didot directory, which includes a short list of the main shopkeepers in
                  each municipality. It is a possible perspective because the SoDUCo pipeline chain
                  can be applied to new and similar sources.</p>
               <p>The case of the 1845 directory highlights the need for a critical analysis of the
                  edges of Paris up to the 1860s–1870s. In other words, the identification of
                  spatial patterns, as in the case of the 17th arrondissement study (see Section
                  5.3.2), requires to be confirmed by an in-depth qualitative analysis of the
                  geolocated addresses at the level of each directory entry, in order to discuss
                  what belongs to geocoding bias or to historical spatial dynamics.</p>

               <p>Four main choices had been made in the SoDUCo project to encourage the
                  re-appropriation of Paris directories data.</p>
               <p>The first is to consider very general named entity classes during the data
                  enrichment processes, specifically during the Named Entity Recognition (NER)
                  stage, in the content of a directory entry. Residents, shops, businesses and
                  institutions are all labeled as <q>persons,</q> descriptions of their professional
                  or commercial activities fall into a single class named <q>activity,</q> and their

                  entities are deliberately very broad in order to facilitate querying and
                  recombination of information. The objective is not to reconstruct — and therefore
                  impose — categorizations<note> For a discussion of categories and professional
                     declarations during the 19th century in France, see <ptr

                  would be considered useful a priori, by grouping institutions on one side and
                  physical individuals on the other, for example, while the boundary is absolutely
                  non-obvious historically and in the original sources. Moreover, enriching
                  directory entries by geolocation is useful for different uses of the sources, and
                  physical space is a shared and semantically neutral referential. However, the
                  geocoding process is not neutral either because it relies on specific cartographic
                  sources. We thus integrate all information relating to geocoding queries,
                  responses and internal geocoding quality metrics into the final data at the scale
                  of each address of the entries of directories.</p>
               <p>The massive, fine-grained data created by an automated pipeline makes it possible
                  to construct a specific data corpus a posteriori. It is then easier to build
                  different, evolving sub-corpora as research questions evolve. In practice, two
                  choices in data enrichment are crucial: 1) to preserve the link with the initial
                  source at the level of each directory entry, notably by referring to the digitized
                  source at page level; 2) to contextualize directory entries, i.e. to link each
                  entry to the type of directory list (alphabetical, by profession, by street), to
                  the directory itself, its year of publication and its belonging to a
                  collection.</p>
               <p>Re-appropriating data also involves developing differentiated and meaningful
                  accesses to data for different types of users. Indeed, the ways in which
                  information is sought from sources and how data is manipulated vary from one
                  audience to another. Four ways of accessing Paris directories data have thus been
                  developed (see Appendix 8.5). They also are complementary. For example, it is
                  useful to access the IIIF viewer at the same time as the datasets when studying
                  specific entries in a neighborhood.</p>
               <p>Finally, the original corpus created during the SoDUCo project mobilizes
                  heterogeneous sources (maps and plans) from numerous heritage institutions and
                  archive centers. It is implemented in the form of a geocatalog <ptr
                     target="#hersent_2023"/>, which makes it possible to bring together sources,
                  treatments and tools, intermediate results and various datasets produced<note>

                  </note>. The directory extraction and data enrichment processing chains are bricks
                  on which others can rely to better understand the construction of the data

                  original sources</head>
               <p>The critical historical assessment of the data follows a constant back-and-forth
                  process between the pipeline chain, data analysis, and the original source. The
                  methodology is therefore progressive, which is why we have chosen to produce
                  successive versions of the data in the SoDUCo project, with evaluation and
                  feedback to adjust the pipeline chain.</p>
               <p>This critical assessment is based on manual evaluations and on global metrics on
                  the dataset. For example, the study of the statistical distribution of the number
                  of entries per page in the alphabetical lists of each of the directories, which
                  are theoretically constant because these lists and their entries are particularly
                  systematized in their form and length (see Figure 2) let us identifying that the
                  image segmentation process was problematic for the directories of the years
                  1802–1828. The pipeline chain was transformed to take account of this problem, and
                  the evaluation of the following version of the data using this metric shows a very
                  significant improvement<note> For more information on this point, we refer the
                     reader to the presentations by the SoDUCo team at the 4th BnF/SoDUCo seminar,
                     available here: <ref
                        target="https://soduco.geohistoricaldata.org/soduco_bnf_seminars/"/>
                  </note>. The metrics need to be intellectually created in interdisciplinary
                  collaboration between <q>modellers</q> and <q>thematicians</q><note> We refer here
                     to the definition of Lena Sanders (2021), explaining how these categories can
                     be significant in describing the processes of interdisciplinary construction of
                     research and the roles of its actors, while being neither homogeneous
                     categories, nor closed with impermeable limits <ptr target="#sanders_2021"/>.
                     Indeed, the same person may take on the role of thematician or modeller within
                     the same project, depending on the context.</note> — in this case here between
                  computer scientists on the one hand, and historians and geographers on the other —
                  to be meaningful in terms of data usage and thematic questions. The conditions for
                  interdisciplinary work need to be put in place, in particular with modellers who
                  are receptive to thematic issues and thematicians who are technically capable of
                  constructing metrics to assess the quality of these data.</p>
               <p>The process of going back and forth finally makes it possible to qualify,
                  criticize, and understand the source of the directories. This is the case, for
                  example, in Section 3.2, where we show how the geolocation of entries ultimately
                  provides a better understanding of editors’ conception of Paris. Although the
                  directories of Paris have been used historically to study particular categories of
                  economic agents, such as art merchants <ptr target="#demaupeou_2013"/>, or ways of
                  socializing, as in the case of the study of the particular <title rend="italic"
                     xml:lang="fr">Bottin mondain</title>
                  <ptr target="#grange_1996"/>, this source was still largely unknown before their
                  digital transcription and enrichment for the long period of 1787-1914.
                  Transforming material into data requires an effort to understand it, to qualify
                  its own biases, its internal logic and its relationship with the society that
                  produced it.</p>

            <head>7. Conclusion</head>
            <p>The data acquired through the digital transcription and enrichment of directories
               enable the investigation of urban fabric at unprecedented scales. Following a
               data-driven approach we shed light on the extent of urban sprawl and de-densification
               of the city center, never before quantified over such a long period (1822-1914) and
               with such spatial and temporal precision across the entire city of Paris.</p>
            <p>Three main thematic findings stand out from our study.</p>
            <p>The de-densification of Paris was studied on a city-wide scale based on historical
               demographics — e.g. through analysis of de-populating dynamics <ptr
                  target="#bonvalet_1984"/> — or based on morphology, but on a micro-level such as
               building blocks <ptr target="#gribaudi_2009"/>. We show that the de-densification of
               the built-up hyper-center is notable on an urban scale from the 1870s onward, i.e.
               twenty years after the start of the large-scale works led by Haussmann.</p>
            <p>We identify the pace and relative magnitude of urban sprawl and densification on the
               edges of Paris. We show that data-driven geography is a relevant framework for
               studying the spatial trajectories of specific urban areas.</p>
            <p>Finally, we show that massive data cannot substitute for source effects. But when the
               latter are correctly identified, they reveal new historical findings, as in the case
               of affluent Parisian districts observed in the early 20th century and the non-linear
               west-east gradient of Paris, which features concentrations of affluent individuals in
               small and specific neighborhoods, as we shown in the case of the Petit Montrouge
               district in the 14th arrondissement. In this case, we demonstrated that results from
               data-driven approaches enable defining new places of investigations, from a social
               and spatial micro-history perspective <ptr target="#gribaudi_2014"/>
               <ptr target="#frondizi_2018"/>. In other words, our methodology links the often
               far-independent approaches of micro-history and large-scale studies.</p>

                  <head>8.1.1. Parisian gazetteer from four maps and atlases (1784-1888)</head>
                  <p>Large-scale city maps are one of the most valuable detailed topographic sources
                     for building cartographic representations of past urban landscapes. Once
                     georeferenced, they act as a geographical proxy, locating entities such as
                     streets, buildings, and addresses on the surface of the Earth. In order to
                     leverage historical maps as a geocoding basis for the city directories, we
                     gathered a gazetteer of address points and streets created within previous
                     digitization initiatives.</p>
                  <p>The resulting gazetteer contains around 136,500 geographic entities digitized
                     from four maps and atlases of Paris (Figure 9). 94% are address points with
                     their number and street name; the remaining 6% are named streets, approximated
                     by their halfway point. Each geographic entity is anchored temporally by a time
                     interval corresponding to the survey period of the source map, or to the
                     publishing date if the survey period is unknown. Thus, the information of the
                     gazetteer is time-dependent. Figure 9 represents the gazetteer and its entities
                     clustered in time according to the production periods of the four maps and
                     atlases. Each depicts Paris at different phases of its morphological evolution:
                     on the eve of the Revolution for the Verniquet atlas, in the 1830s after the
                     phase of national property subdivision for the Jacoubet atlas, before the
                     Second French Empire for the Andriveau-Goujon map, and after the major
                     Haussmanian transformations for the Municipal atlas.</p>
                  <p>The atlases focus on the area within the administrative boundaries of Paris,
                     i.e. within the <foreign xml:lang="fr">Fermiers généraux</foreign> limits
                     before 1860, and Thiers wall after that date. However, numbering inside the
                     administrative limits is only partial. In the Jacoubet atlas for example, the
                     zone between the boulevards and the <foreign xml:lang="fr">Fermiers
                        généraux</foreign> wall is mostly urbanized, yet address points are very
                     sparse. We are faced here with the discrepancies of these cartographic sources,
                     which combine multiple, heterogeneous administrative sources, possibly
                     partially out of sync with the exact historic reality of urbanization. In
                     addition, the suburbs of Paris prior to 1860 are not included in the current
                     state of the gazetteer.</p>

                  <p>Parisian directories are commercial editions, involving competition between
                     publishers, buy-outs over time and moments of editorial monopoly. We revealed
                     five main periods thanks to the inventory of directories <ptr
                        target="#baciocchi_2022"/>. The years 1780–1793 are those of the origins. It
                     was followed by the emergence of the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="fr"
                        >Almanach du commerce</title> (1798–1815). Competition was fierce, and
                     publications abounded until 1856, when the Firmin-Didot brothers bought the
                     Bottin publishing company. Thereafter, the period 1857–1890 was characterized
                     by the hegemony of the Didot-Bottin collection, before a new period of
                     competition began in 1891 and lasted until 1914.</p>
                  <p>The number of copies produced by editors grew through time. It shows how
                     directories were received and the importance of the enterprise: La Tynna
                     published 4,500 copies in 1816; Bottin 9,000 in 1840; Firmin-Didot brothers
                     18,000 in 1857, and 45,000 in 1878. The latter wrote in their 1857
                     introduction: <quote rend="inline">to judge the importance of such a
                        publication by a single material fact, one need only say that, for the

                  <head>8.2.2. Selection criteria of alphabetical lists in directories</head>
                  <p>At the beginning of the 19th century, alphabetical lists included prominent
                     inhabitants, while professional lists featured merchants. In 1817, editor La
                     Tynna alphabetically listed merchants but maintained a separate alphabetical
                     address list for each population. Consequently, the alphabetical lists used for
                     the study are not comparable in terms of social coverage before and after the
                     end of the 1810s. We could incorporate the professional lists spanning from
                     1787 to 1816 in our sub-corpus to extend the temporal scope of the study.
                     However, we have recently extracted the data for these lists and have chosen to
                     focus solely on the alphabetical lists, of which we have a more comprehensive
                     understanding.</p>
                  <p>The publisher Bottin merged both alphabetical lists (merchants and prominent
                     inhabitants). We wish to begin the study period in 1820, one year after
                     Bottin’s first publication and the first year for which we have a digitized
                     version. However, at that date, the alphabetical list of merchants in the
                     Bottin directory contained a system of cross-references to the pages of the
                     list by profession. During the NER phase, page references were identified as
                     street numbers, generating noise during the geocoding phase. Consequently, we
                     have decided to start the study period in 1822, when Bottin’s cross-referencing
                     system was no longer in use.</p>

                     For instance, the year 1830 lacks a suitable digital version, prompting us to

                     Additionally, we wish to study identical collections over time whenever

                     collections. For example, we have access to the Didot-Bottin collection from
                     1860 onward and we have chosen the year 1909 instead of 1910. Indeed, there is
                     no high-quality digital version for the 1910 Didot-Bottin directory, whereas
                     one is available for 1909 and yet a processed version of the 1910

                     presented in Figure 11. Three main points stand out in the table.</p>
                  <p>Firstly, the ratio of the number of addresses per number of entries is always
                     greater than 1 (see <formula notation="tex" rend="inline">\(a/e\)</formula> in
                     Figure 11), and mainly between 1.05 and 1.2, because individuals can have an
                     activity at several addresses. Two typical cases exist: On one hand, the
                     directory lists the place of manufacture and the place of sale of an
                     individual, or the various store units of an individual; on the other hand, a
                     store has two addresses because it is located at a crossroad and its storefront
                     faces two streets.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the geocoding of addresses is systematically higher than 89.1% – as
                     shown with ratio <formula notation="tex" rend="inline">\(ga/a\)</formula>. On
                     average 95.7% of addresses are geocoded, varying from 89.1% to 98.2%.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the geocoding of distinct addresses is very good. Indeed, the ratio of
                     distinct geolocated addresses per distinct addresses is between 0.966 and 0.99
                     (see <formula notation="tex" rend="inline">\(dga/da\)</formula> in Figure

                     edges between the pre- and post-1860 underwent dramatic changes, and the

                     typical borderline cases can be identified and summarized:</p>
                  <list type="unordered">
                     <item>
                        <hi rend="bold">Erroneous NER</hi>. Bad geolocations are linked to poor or
                        imperfect recognition of entities by the NER. This is easily identifiable
                        when the address text is made up of weird character strings or irrelevant
                        words. But it can be more difficult to detect when the false-address is
                        plausible enough to be associated with an address in the gazetteer. The
                        geocoder provides a procedure for excluding some identifiable cases (<hi
                           rend="italic">custom_catchall_alwaysvalid</hi> in Figure 12), but
                        incorrect parsing raises the question of how to handle complex address
                        descriptions, which can sometimes be fragmented into several directory
                        addresses.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi rend="bold">Incorrect street name in the directory</hi>. In few cases,
                        the directory itself provides incorrect information, which has an impact on
                        the geocoding processing (mainly spelling mistakes and typos).</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi rend="bold">Street absent in the gazetteer</hi>. Sometimes the gazetteer
                        is incomplete or inaccurate. Some streets, attested by their frequency of
                        appearance in a directory, are not present in the gazetteer (e.g. Napoléon
                        quay). In other cases, streets are present but without numbers. In this
                        case, the geocoding process may favor another gazetteer offering addresses,
                        even if the temporal consistency loses quality.</item>

               <p>Figure 8 shows that the density of geolocated addresses on five hexagons located
                  in the Petit Montrouge district, south of Paris in the 14th arrondissement, fell
                  sharply between 1900 and 1904 compared to the whole Paris area (green hexagons in
                  Figure 8). In order to better understand these spatial dynamics, we examine each
                  entry from the 1900 Didot-Bottin directory list in this district that is missing
                  from the 1904 list.</p>

                     Didot-Bottin list to be included only in the <title rend="italic" xml:lang="fr"

               <p>There are 222 directory entries corresponding to the 193 different geolocated
                  addresses in the study area (Figure 14). We analyze each entry to determine
                  whether or not it is possible that the disappearance of geolocated addresses
                  between 1900 and 1904 may be the result of the publication of the <hi
                     rend="italic">Bottin mondain</hi>, i.e. an individual no longer appears in the
                  general list because he or she has been included only in the <title rend="italic"
                     xml:lang="fr">Bottin mondain</title> by the editors.</p>
               <p>A previous study of the Didot-Bottin directories shows that the entries which
                  disappear from the general lists after 1903 are mainly those of individuals
                  designated as owners and annuitants, and to a lesser extent, those affiliated with
                  public administration, e.g. deputies, directors of an institution, etc. <ptr
                     target="#gravier_2024"/>. We therefore hypothesize that the 1900 entries
                  referring to owners, annuitants or churchmen are most likely included in the
                     <title rend="italic" xml:lang="fr">Bottin mondain</title> in 1904 (N=45
                  geolocated addresses, in red in Figure 14). However, this is impossible if they
                  refer to small merchants or craftsmen (N=120, in blue in Figure 14). For other
                  professions, such as intellectuals (N=19, in orange), this possibility remains
                  open.</p>
               <p>The cartographic result of this systematic qualitative study, presented in Figure
                  14, shows a significant north/south differentiation between the five hexagons in
                  sharp decline initially identified in Figure 8. Indeed, geolocated addresses
                  present in the 1900 directory and no longer present in 1904 mainly refer to small
                  craftsmen and merchants in the three northern hexagons (see blue dots in Figure
                  14), while they tend to be owners in the two southern hexagons (see red dots). The
                  decrease in the density of geolocated addresses in this district is probably due
                  to an important reorganization of the economic fabric in the north, combine with
