                     yearlong audit of the project. While scholarship in the field has focused on both
                     the
                     startup and sustainability stages of DH project lifecycles, far less attention has
                     been paid to fostering healthy project growth and self-evaluation during the
                     maintenance stage. After discussing the motivations for our audit and the methods
                     we
                     employ, this article offers five key observations and summarizes our responses to
                     them. Our hope is that other DH project teams will find that some of these
                     observations are applicable to their work and will then benefit from the responses

                     people are often difficult to locate due to the relative scarcity of these materials
                     and
                     the access barriers presented by brick-and-mortar archives (e.g., geographic, financial,
                     environmental, intellectual) [<a class="ref" href="#page2017">Page 2017</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rawson2009">Rawson 2009</a>]. The global pandemic exacerbated
                     such barriers, causing in-person research to be temporarily suspended and, as of this
                     writing, continually disrupted. Digital access is therefore more important now than
                     ever. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The Digital Transgender Archive (DTA) is a free online collection of trans-related
                     primary source historical materials and information on undigitized archival collections
                     held throughout the world. The goal of the project is to leverage an open-access digital
                     archive to mitigate barriers to research on transgender and gender non-conforming
                     people. When the DTA moved institutions in mid-2020, we chose this natural lull to
                     conduct the project’s first audit. Our aim was to thoroughly examine every aspect
                     of the
                     project to identify our strengths and areas for growth while charting a course for
                     continued development and vibrancy into the future. In preparation for this audit,
                     we
                     searched for published models, examples, or theorizations of auditing a digital project,
                     but we found little scholarship to guide our work. To contribute to this area, this
                     article presents a project report that shares the findings of our yearlong audit of
                     the
                     DTA. We begin with an introduction to the DTA alongside a discussion of existing
                     scholarship on Digital Humanities project lifecycles and evaluative procedures. We
                     then
                     highlight five key observations that the audit revealed and how we addressed (or plan
                     to
                     address) those observations. In using this observation/response structure, we offer
                     readers the distilled results of our audit in a format that we hope will be easy to
                     apply to other Digital Humanities (DH) projects. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">DH projects generally move through fairly predictable cycles, often including startup,
                     dissemination, maintenance, and sustainability (or abandonment) stages. Given that
                     cultural and institutional pressures guide digital humanities scholars towards
                     innovation [<a class="ref" href="#maron2014">Maron and Pickle 2014</a>], it is unsurprising that there is an abundance of
                     scholarship, resources, and workshops designed to aid digital humanists at the planning
                     and inception stages of a project’s life, leading some to suggest that DH scholars
                     “specialize in imagining and launching digital projects” [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2014">Rockwell et al., 2014</a>]. On the
                     opposite end of the project lifecycle are well-known concerns about the problem of
                     orphaned projects left to wither on the vine [<a class="ref" href="#meneses2019">Meneses and Furuta 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#miller2020">Miller and Taylor-Poleskey 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#smithies2019">Smithies et al. 2019</a>]. Projects have met more successful ends
                     when transitioned into being preserved as digital archives [<a class="ref" href="#carlin2018">Carlin 2018</a>]. Of course
                     maintaining an ongoing project exists as an alternative to ending or abandoning
                     projects. As an archive cataloging trans histories which remain ongoing, histories
                     often
                     inaccessible except through the DTA’s interventions, we have chosen to invest in
                     maintaining and developing the DTA.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Like many DH projects, the startup phase of the DTA, from approximately 2013 to 2018,
                     was a period of feverish growth. Following a model that will be familiar to readers,
                     the
                     DTA is a collaborative online aggregator of historical materials that are contributed
                     by
                     a range of cultural heritage institutions. Boosted by the support of a Digital
                     Innovation grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, the DTA initially
                     launched in January of 2016 while Rawson was a faculty member at the College of the
                     Holy
                     Cross. For the next several years, Rawson worked to build the collection with a dynamic
                     team of undergraduate students and, when funding allowed, Digital Archivist Nicole
                     Tantum. Software developer Steven Anderson, an external consultant funded through
                     small
                     internal grants, has also been key to our success as he is responsible for both the
                     preliminary development and continued maintenance of the site. During this initial
                     growth stage, we focused on deepening our collaborative networks and implementing
                     a
                     functional database that would have sufficient resources to attract researchers.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">As we invested more time and resources into the project, our collaborative network
                     expanded and the size of our collections grew. As of January 2022, we have 70
                     contributors from eight countries (Brazil, Canada, England, Ireland, Norway, Spain,
                     South Africa, United States). These collaborators represent a range of cultural
                     institutions––from grassroots archives and historical societies to university and
                     public
                     libraries––and most are primarily brick-and-mortar organizations. We currently have
                     approximately 8,800 items available on our site, a small percentage of which were
                     directly donated to the project and are not available for researchers to access in
                     physical archives. The project’s primary purpose is to increase the accessibility
                     of
                     trans history, which we accomplish through our centralized database of primary source
                     materials and our efforts to identify and include a wide range of materials fitting
                     under a capacious banner of pre-2000, non-normative gender practices. In other words,
                     our collections are not only focused on individuals who identify as transgender;
                     instead, we include documentations of any experiences relating to transgressions of
                     gender norms (in relation to particular cultural and historical contexts).</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">With our expanding collaborations and content, we became increasingly aware of the
                     responsibilities involved in maintaining this important resource. We attuned ourselves
                     to conversations in DH about orphaned projects and project sustainability, though
                     we
                     noted the lack of consensus among digital humanists as to what sustainability means
                     exactly [<a class="ref" href="#fenlon2020">Fenlon 2020</a>]. Within the unique challenges of the digital ecosystem,
                     sustainability may involve “continuity of funding, data preservation (including choice
                     of standards and longevity of data) and the need for flexibility in order to change
                     business models,” particularly as digital platforms transform or become obsolete
                     [<a class="ref" href="#zorich2003">Zorich 2003</a>]. Thus, building a sustainable project can mean maintaining an
                     organization or institution with evolving goals beyond the initial project, preserving
                     data and metadata internally for continued access and (inter)operability, or
                     transferring the project to the community so it can be adapted to stakeholders’ evolving
                     needs [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2020">Edmond and Morselli 2020</a>]. Yet, according to [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2020">Edmond and Morselli 2020</a>],
                     sustainable DH projects are often expected to be accessible to users long-term “without
                     further requirement of investment or resources from the original funder of the work.”
                     This model of sustainability centers around ongoing access without considering growth
                     and responsiveness to shifting contexts. As a result, recommendations for stagnating
                     long-term projects typically include renewed dissemination efforts and interdepartmental
                     collaboration to increase visibility [<a class="ref" href="#maron2014">Maron and Pickle 2014</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">While we found these discussions of the startup and sustainability stages of DH project
                     lifecycles to be quite helpful, we also observed that the maintenance stage has received
                     considerably less attention, perhaps because it is the least glamorous part of any
                     DH
                     project. As Ashley Reed notes, there remain many opportunities to discuss how to
                     maintain a DH project and keep it healthy and thriving [<a class="ref" href="#reed2014">Reed 2014</a>]. In order to prevent
                     project decay, a robust approach to the management and continuation of projects can
                     helpfully supplement attention to the startup and sustainability stages. However,
                     long-term collaborative projects may not always document or publish the critical
                     maintenance work they undertake after the first stage of dissemination. Therefore,
                     we
                     find ourselves in agreement with Edin Tabak that DH must better attend to issues of
                     project management and, moreover, develop models and principles specifically suited
                     toward our field [<a class="ref" href="#tabak2017">Tabak 2017</a>]. Attending to these issues is particularly important because DH
                     approaches change not only the ways scholars disseminate information, but also the
                     ways
                     “they work, the tools they build, the disciplines they connect to” [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2020">Edmond and Morselli 2020</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">With respect to the DTA, as we focused on developing and launching the platform and
                     meeting grant deliverables, we had little time to evaluate the project as it emerged.
                     Many of the DTA’s features, policies, and internal documents had not been reviewed
                     since
                     the first few years of our startup phase. In some cases, policies that had become
                     integral to the project over the years had never been formally recorded. The majority
                     of
                     the DTA’s materials have been processed by revolving teams of undergraduate students,
                     making it difficult to maintain consistent practices. These issues were exacerbated
                     by
                     the DTA’s move to Northeastern in fall 2020 and the complexities of working remotely
                     during the COVID-19 pandemic, as our previous model for workflow depended on a physical
                     lab space in which new team members were trained by veteran ones. Because crucial
                     process-based work went undocumented, it also could not be critiqued or modeled by
                     community stakeholders or fellow DH practitioners, which is a noted problem in the
                     field
                     [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2020">Edmond and Morselli 2020</a>]. Similarly, the movement from a physical lab space to a
                     digital environment made processing materials a less collaborative and efficient
                     experience, resulting in metadata that required additional review before it could
                     be
                     made public and demonstrating why project workflow must be sustainable across changes
                     in
                     platform [<a class="ref" href="#sheffield2020">Sheffield 2020</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">When Rawson began a new position at Northeastern University (NU) in the fall of 2020,
                     the move presented an ideal opportunity to hit pause on expanding the project and
                     instead conduct a robust audit in order to adapt to a new institutional environment.
                     The
                     audit was also well-timed from a project development standpoint because the DTA had
                     settled into collections development without conducting a thorough evaluation of our
                     site, our holdings, or our planned growth. In order to move toward future grants and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">We understand audits as comprehensive and evaluative analyses of data collected on
                     a
                     given project to gauge efficacy. Audits are common across many realms, and can be
                     particularly useful for digital humanists seeking to appraise a project’s success
                     and
                     plan for future development. In auditing the DTA, we evaluated the site’s goals and
                     the
                     degree to which it accomplishes those goals while also developing concrete strategies
                     for growth. Most importantly, we sought to ensure the DTA was adequately serving its
                     mission of making trans history accessible and identified ways to better serve that
                     mission. To conduct the audit, Rawson was able to enlist two NU Ph.D.
                     students––co-authors Eamon Schlotterback and Cailin Roles ––who led the audit as part
                     of
                     their 10-hour-per-week graduate research assistant positions. In order to
                     comprehensively audit the project, we decided to spend the full year on this work
                     (with
                     some of our time still focused on small-scale processing and supporting a 3-member
                     team
                     of volunteers)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e296">[1]</a>. Our goal was to assess every aspect of the project,
                     paying particular attention to scope, accessibility, usability (for researchers inside
                     and outside the academy), and outreach (especially social media presence). Because
                     Eamon
                     and Cailin were still gaining familiarity with the DTA and were thus uniquely positioned
                     to respond to the project from the perspective of a new user, our approach was broadly
                     structured to move from the outside in. Therefore, we pursued our audit through the
                     following steps: (1) we began with our outward facing presence, including social media,
                     static pages on our site, and reviews of the project; (2) we examined other projects
                     and
                     targeted areas for feature development; (3) we focused on the database and collection
                     scope by evaluating the status of our collaborations, researching new materials from
                     existing collaborators, and identifying gaps in our holdings; (4) we closely reviewed
                     our metadata and addressed areas of concern; and (5) we concluded by evaluating our
                     options for project workflow and lab space on campus.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Throughout each step of the audit, we also employed a series of checks to ensure that
                     the DTA site content and features aligned as much as possible with widely accepted
                     standards for accessibility. Specifically, we compared our practices to those
                     recommended in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" onclick="window.open('https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/'); return false" class="ref">Web Content Accessibility

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Since the DTA initially launched in 2016, there have been significant developments
                     in
                     the understanding of trans history and the language used to describe gender
                     nonconforming (GNC) people and practices. With renewed scholarly and public interest
                     in
                     trans identities, there has also been an increasing push to digitize trans-related
                     historical materials, in part due to dissatisfaction with the oversaturation of
                     materials relating to white trans women. Within this context, we spent a significant
                     amount of time during the audit evaluating the DTA’s scope to better adapt to the
                     shifting landscape of trans history.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">We were interested in interrogating scope on a number of levels, including: genre
                     of
                     materials; dates covered; race and ethnicities represented; trans identities
                     represented; and types of experiences documented. Among the elements of scope we
                     considered, race and ethnicity were particularly important to us. As VanHaitsma and
                     others have observed in reviewing the project, and as Rawson has discussed in interviews
                     and his own publications, the DTA’s holdings skew toward white U.S. and Canadian
                     subjects [<a class="ref" href="#vanhaitsma2019">VanHaitsma 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#bergen2016">Bergen 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rawson2018">Rawson 2018</a>]. This trend reflects a larger
                     concern regarding the lack of diversity in the digital humanities writ large. Per
                     [<a class="ref" href="#risam2015">Risam 2015</a>], many of the most developed digital humanities projects preserve
                     the writings and histories of well-known white men, individuals unlikely to be otherwise
                     forgotten. While our materials disrupt that trend by focusing on individuals whose
                     lives
                     have been largely relegated to the margins of history, it is also true that white
                     U.S.
                     and Canadian trans histories have been better preserved than any others, resulting
                     in
                     concerning racial inequities in archival representation.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">As one of extraordinarily few archives focused on trans experiences, it is critical
                     that
                     we attend to these issues of impact and access. Researchers interested in trans history
                     have had to negotiate a number of systematic challenges — including lack of
                     communication across archival institutions and the recent emergence and cultural
                     specificity of the term <em class="term">transgender</em> — that make it difficult to
                     determine where trans materials are held and what those materials are. Furthermore,
                     historical materials depicting people of color who transgress gender norms are even
                     less
                     likely to have been preserved or archived. Unless we pay careful attention to these
                     issues, it is all too easy for projects like the DTA to unwittingly reproduce a
                     narrative of trans history focused on the experiences of white North Americans and
                     Europeans.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">[<a class="ref" href="#vanhaitsma2019">VanHaitsma 2019</a>] further suggests that the DTA's holdings skew toward
                     transfeminine-related materials with a proportionally smaller number of transmasculine
                     materials. Such inequities in our holdings reveal the complexities of representation
                     in
                     a project guided by trans-affirming ethics. As we expand our collection of
                     transmasculine objects, we recognize that the differential representations of
                     transfeminine and transmasculine subjects is due in part to a visual regime that renders
                     trans men “invisibilized and ignored” and trans women “glamourized and vilified” [<a class="ref" href="#green2020">Green 2020</a>].
                     More images of transfeminine people can be archived and published in part because
                     of how transfeminine people have been spectacularized by a transmisogynist social
                     context [<a class="ref" href="#green2020">Green 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#kochrein2020">Koch-Rein et al. 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rodriguez2015">Rodriguez 2015</a>]. This is also complicated
                     by the fact that certain forms of trans visibility often further marginalize trans
                     people and lead to transphobic violence, which disproportionately targets trans people
                     of color [<a class="ref" href="#stanley2017">Stanley 2017</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#griffingracy2017">Griffin-Gracy et al. 2017</a>]. Although part of our audit was to
                     identify and fill gaps in our collections, simply adding items to fill a quota was
                     insufficient to our aims. The complex histories of racism and transphobia demanded
                     we
                     reevaluate the quality of the items we host.</div>

                     represented in the DTA, it was necessary to closely examine how and why we choose
                     to
                     represent people’s identities overall. Our audit began at the tail end of the summer
                     of
                     2020, when the United States was reckoning with its continued history of anti-Blackness
                     following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, which deeply informed our
                     work. The audit became an opportunity to renew our approach to archiving objects
                     depicting BIPOC, to learn from Black and anti-racist archival practices, and reconsider
                     how we frame historically significant objects depicting racism [<a class="ref" href="#antracoli2019">Antracoli et al. 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#blackwomenssuffrage">Black Women’s Suffrage n.d.</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#brathwaiteshirley2020">Brathwaite-Shirley 2020</a>].
                     Over the course of the audit,
                     we identified a number of gaps in the content we make available on our site, as well
                     as
                     issues with the DTA’s current representation practices, particularly regarding
                     marginalized groups we (three white settler academics) are not a part of. For instance,
                     the complexities of Two-Spirit identities and their inclusion on the DTA was a recurring
                     concern, one we realized could only be addressed through deeper collaborations with
                     Two-Spirit groups. Our work to address scope therefore became inseparable from our
                     ethical commitments to and work with BIPOC communities.</div>

                     possible. We approached this search for materials with two objectives in mind: 1)
                     to
                     identify new materials at institutions we have existing relationships with; and 2)
                     to
                     locate new institutions and collections for future collaborations.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Among our partnered institutions’ collections, we found over 300 items that were already
                     digitized and could be made available on the DTA, ranging from nineteenth-century
                     medical literature to 1960s glamour shots. Of these, we prioritized certain materials
                     for immediate processing based on gaps in our current holdings. For instance, materials
                     related to incarceration and GNC children became higher priorities, whereas drag show
                     programs were less pressing since we already have a preponderance of those items.
                     As we
                     filled some of the gaps in our collection, we sought opportunities to not simply add
                     items <em class="emph">depicting</em> marginalized individuals, but to prioritize
                     materials in which these subjects speak for themselves. These materials include items
                     such as oral histories with trans men and people of color, manifestos written by trans
                     women of color, and a collection of web resources related to Two-Spirit identities.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Our search for new partners was fruitful beyond our aims. At the start of our audit,
                     we
                     had 64 contributing partners, but we have since added five more to the DTA site and
                     identified an additional 15 that we plan to reach out to in order to form
                     collaborations.These new institutions include organizations with significant holdings
                     related to transmasculine individuals, Indigenous peoples of New Zealand, and Asian
                     Americans. Our goal in collaborating with more archives, especially community- and
                     trans- and BIPOC-led archives, is not only to make more items related to trans history
                     available online, but also to build mutually beneficial relationships with our partners.
                     Another result of these efforts is that we are currently pursuing funding for a
                     large-scale project that will allow us to work with our partners to digitize thousands
                     of pages of materials related to trans people of color, as well as improve our
                     anti-racist description practices through a BIPOC-led steering committee.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21"> Even six years since it went live, the DTA remains one of extraordinarily few archives
                     devoted to trans experiences, and many of our materials are only accessible to the
                     public through the DTA. Our position as one of the few freely available archival
                     resources on trans people necessitates that we expand our holdings to better represent
                     the full spectrum of trans experience and to continually strengthen our commitments
                     to
                     ethical representation. Like many long-term DH projects, our work over the years has
                     often focused on expanding the quantity of materials rather than quality of
                     representation. This is not uncommon — as [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam 2018</a>] discusses, DH projects
                     often “[equate] decolonization with the need for diversity in the field,” as if “the
                     mere addition of ‘diverse’ bodies will transform the practices of digital humanities”
                     and the traces of colonialism therein. Instead, as we evaluated the scope of the DTA,
                     we
                     also worked to strengthen and extend our relationships with BIPOC-focused initiatives,
                     pursue funding for projects to enhance access to trans BIPOC histories, develop
                     antiracist description policies, and enact more informed mechanisms of

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Assessing the DTA’s scope led us to larger questions about the ways we describe
                     materials hosted on the site. Since the project’s start, we have attempted to maintain
                     consistent descriptive practices by implementing a metadata application profile (MAP),
                     a
                     detailed document that outlines requirements and best practices for each metadata
                     element (e.g., Title, Subject Coverage, Description). However, over the course of
                     the
                     DTA’s history, a number of different people from different backgrounds and levels
                     of
                     archival experience have participated in processing materials, which has resulted
                     in
                     discrepancies in the metadata for different objects.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Although DTA materials are discoverable through metadata and the terms used within
                     the
                     materials, there were numerous inconsistencies regarding the usage of certain elements
                     and descriptive practices for trans identities and practices. For example, the most
                     commonly used term in subject coverage was “crossdressers,” though in many instances the
                     materials predated the term and it was unlikely the subjects represented would identify
                     with it. This practice was in contrast to our policy, which cautions against assuming
                     individuals’ identities without self-acknowledgement. At the same time, this policy
                     was
                     more consistently applied in regards to race and ethnicity, which meant that materials
                     focused on people of color were too often unmarked in the metadata. As a result, race
                     often became hidden or obscured while gender identity was frequently overdetermined.
                     Additionally, we noticed that in some cases, our metadata reproduced harmful language
                     practices from other institutions and that some items were published with little
                     description because team members were unsure how to interpret their content and account
                     for their complexity.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">Our policies regarding privacy, explicit content, and descriptive practices have always
                     been publicly available on the project site, and the DTA has been widely praised for
                     its
                     collaborative nature and continued accountability to the community [<a class="ref" href="#patterson2019">Patterson 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#shepard2020">Shepard 2020</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#sabharwal2021">Sabharwal 2021</a>].
                     In recognizing this strength and the benefits it has
                     offered to others, we saw an opportunity to further develop this dimension of the
                     project. Simultaneously, as the project has grown and we have received feedback, our
                     implementation of our policies has become more complex––for example, determining whether
                     exploitative or private materials should be public or how to address harmful
                     language––and we wanted to find a way to convey that complexity. In other words, we
                     needed to evaluate whether there were any gaps between our stated policies and our
                     everyday practices and to consider how we could make our internal processes even more
                     transparent for users.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">To get a better sense of what MAP and policy changes might be in order, we began by
                     evaluating our collections and compiling a list of metadata-related concerns and best
                     practices. Aware of our limitations as a U.S.-based team that is predominantly white,
                     we
                     researched the policies of a number of BIPOC-led digital archives, DH projects, and
                     social justice organizations. In addition, we found Antracoli et al.’s <cite class="title italic">Archives for
                        Black Lives in Philadelphia: Anti-Racist Description Resources</cite> to be a
                     particularly helpful resource [<a class="ref" href="#antracoli2019">Antracoli et al. 2019</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">In some cases, addressing metadata issues on the DTA required simply correcting typos.
                     Other issues necessitated case-by-case analysis and editorial flexibility. For example,
                     we reached out to an individual represented in our materials who changed his name
                     to ask
                     how we should refer to him when processing materials he created before the name change.
                     His answer — that we could either update his name or maintain both names — reflects
                     his
                     personal choice and is not determined by archival best practices, as can sometimes
                     be
                     the case with handling trans and GNC materials.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e435">[2]</a>
                     This example shows why it is important to consider not only whether data practices
                     are
                     consistent and (inter)operable but whether they are ethical and what impact they have
                     on
                     people. When possible, it is ideal to reach out to individuals represented in the
                     collections so that they can determine how they should be described in the metadata.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">We also expanded our project-wide policies to clarify our processes for describing
                     gender, race, ethnicity, and other identity markers. Though our metadata typically
                     adopts language already used in the materials and language known to be used by the
                     individuals represented, we often process items that cannot be neatly categorized,
                     such
                     as photographs with no extant context. The decisions we make in describing these items
                     may not be immediately clear to visitors of the site, which could make them difficult
                     to
                     locate or result in misunderstanding of historical terminology. Therefore, as we
                     evaluate ways to best represent individuals’ identities, we also turn a critical eye
                     toward harmful language practices in the archival field. We have sought to disrupt
                     racist and transphobic materials or descriptions by questioning whether to make
                     available compelling but ethically questionable items, adding critical framing to
                     descriptions of complicated items, and removing harmful descriptions and metadata
                     inherited from contributing institutions. To support our team members in describing
                     complex items, we began writing short reference documents that include language and
                     framing suggestions as well as contextual information to guide them through the
                     difficult and thorny process of respectfully and accurately representing trans and
                     GNC
                     subjects. We have also developed content warnings within the Description field for
                     items
                     with potentially harmful language and imagery.</div>

                     our
                     current descriptive practices. This work includes clarifying how fields like Spatial
                     Coverage become searchable so team members can apply it more effectively and updating
                     Subject Coverage examples to match the newest version of Homosaurus, the LGBTQ linked
                     data vocabulary we use to supplement the Library of Congress Subject Headings. While
                     in
                     the past the MAP has only been available to team members and contributors, we have
                     chosen to make the DTA MAP 3.0 publicly accessible on the project website, both to

                     how
                     the DTA has been utilized and engaged, often posting to our social media channels
                     items
                     that refer to the DTA and circulating these items among students working on the project.
                     At no point, however, did we formally track such qualitative usage, even though
                     measurable evidence of a project’s impact is critical for grant writing efforts.
                     Additionally, while the DTA’s mission is to make trans history more accessible to
                     a wide
                     public audience, we had no dedicated methods for evaluating users’ experiences in

                     the

                     the site or how to effectively search using those terms. Recognizing that the creation
                     of metadata is a highly subjective and political act and that trans-related terminology
                     is both personal and contextual, we describe individuals’ identities and practices

                     and knowledge building.” The DTA maintains three social media accounts––Facebook,
                     Twitter, and Instagram. Early in the audit, we determined that our social media posts
                     had a few shortcomings: they were inconsistently published, their contents were not
                     standardized, they varied in the amount of information provided, and they were not
                     always fully accessible. Further, our engagement with our followers was minimal, often
                     occurring only through responses to comments rather than proactive communication.
                     It was
                     unclear who our audience was or what they sought from the DTA on social media, which
                     made it difficult to foster a sense of community on these platforms.</div>

                     presence across all three platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram). To create
                     this
                     guide, we evaluated platform-specific analytics to identify our audience’s demographics
                     and track trends in post engagement. Next, we reviewed each platform’s accessibility
                     guidelines and discussed ways to ethically present materials addressing discrimination
                     and trauma. These data points allowed us to begin posting more accessible content
                     (e.g.,
                     providing alternate text to describe images, using CamelCase for hashtags) that was
                     better tailored to the interests of our social media communities. We also shifted
                     the
                     timing of our posts to our followers’ peak activity hours and developed a list of
                     important annual dates to ensure that we commemorate events important to our work.

                     their
                     academic background or level of experience with archival research. While the majority
                     of
                     our day-to-day work is focused on developing and expanding the database itself, there
                     are a series of static pages on the site that serve as important features of the
                     project. These include “About” pages explaining the history of the project, our team
                     and

                     DTA, a race and ethnicity research guide, a glossary, and a list of global terms.

                     practices. To eliminate inconsistencies in grammar and terminology, we devised and
                     implemented a

                     for the DTA’s copy. Though we decided to defer to the AP Style Book for many stylistic
                     decisions, we collectively established best practices for the specificities of writing
                     about sex and gender, topics often neglected by mainstream style guides.</div>

                     developed explanatory and instructional copy for certain features, such as the Map
                     tool.
                     Among the front-facing pages of the DTA, we identified a number of areas that required
                     more sustained care, such as the

                     pages. Rather than attempting a short-term, superficial revision during the first
                     phase
                     of the audit, the Glossary was significantly expanded by Roles and Schlotterback during
                     the spring 2021 semester. In addition to revising existing definitions to better
                     represent the complexities of trans experiences, Roles and Schlotterback identified
                     a
                     number of new terms to define, including the most commonly used words in DTA materials’
                     subject coverage, as well as historical terms like “female impersonators” and
                     “masquerading” that are less familiar to present-day readers. As we highlight in the
                     introduction of the revised Glossary, our goal in defining these terms is not to
                     prescribe a single, correct definition, but to clarify how the DTA understands and
                     uses
                     terms throughout the project. We view this page as a living document that will be
                     revised and expanded upon as needed, and we encourage DTA visitors to offer suggestions
                     for terms to add or clarify. As of this writing, revision of the Global Terms page

                     already proven to be tremendously insightful. In brief, we accomplished the following:
                     our project scope has been critically analyzed and we have identified areas for
                     intentional growth moving forward; more of our project documentation is written and
                     publicly available; our project values have been articulated and shared; many of our
                     static pages have been significantly revised; our social media presence is now more
                     consistent and purposeful; we have more qualitative and quantitative user data to
                     include in our grants; and we directly responded to reviews and feedback on the

                     process of auditing the DTA to be a highly effective time investment for a project
                     that
                     had passed through the startup phase and was just beginning to settle into ongoing
                     maintenance. While there is always some pressure to innovate and expand, spending
                     most
                     of our year auditing our work allowed us the space for genuine self-evaluation so
                     that

               <div class="endnote" id="d4e296"><span class="noteRef lang en">[1]  As a project executed during a pandemic, our audit of the DTA was a
                     completely digital process (in fact, the three of us have still never met together
                     in
                     person). Since we were unable even to consider whether it was desirable to establish
                     a dedicated lab on the Northeastern campus, we instead built a “digital lab,” both
                     to
                     facilitate work and to foster stronger team relationships and communication. We
                     worked entirely over digital platforms, including Zoom, Slack, Google Workspace, and
                     the DTA website itself.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e435"><span class="noteRef lang en">[2]  Although name authority records
                     often list variations of individuals’ names that they may have been known by or used
                     throughout their life, these variations are controlled under a single uniform name
                     and only the authorized name is displayed in a record. This subject’s preference to
                     maintain both names in a single record defies the logic of a name authority and shows
                     how, for some trans people, prior names should be treated as “dead names.” </span></div>

                     Analytics is often recommended to library, museum, and archives decision makers as

                     However, as [<a class="ref" href="#galbraith2016">Galbraith 2016</a>] has discussed, the fact that
                     Google Analytics data “belongs to Google and is housed on U.S. servers, where data
                     may be subject to the legislation of that country,” raises serious concerns about
                     user privacy, particularly for a trans-focused project. As the DTA and its user base
                     grows, we find ourselves reevaluating whether Google Analytics fits into our project
                     values.</span></div>
