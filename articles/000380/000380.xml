                <p>The Jesuit scholar, Roberto Busa, is often called the founder of humanities
                    computing. In fact, starting as early as 1949, he collaborated with IBM to
                    perform experiments using suites of punched-card machines. These punched-card
                    data systems—with their plug-board setups, clacking machinery, and flurries of
                    perforated rectangular cards—were developed for business accounting and
                    tabulating, and adapted for government censuses, defense calculations, archival
                    management, and information processing of all kinds. The first decade of
                    humanities computing can more accurately be described as an era of humanities
                    data processing—in the historically specific and contextually rich sense of the
                    term. This essay describes an ongoing collabroative project that aims to reverse
                    engineer that center in the attempt to understand better this important site in
                    the history of technology and humanities computing. </p>

            <p>In March 2015 I visited a gated courtyard building on a quiet street in Gallarate,
                Italy, the via Galileo Ferraris, no. 2.<note> This essay expands on material in my
                    2016 book <ptr target="#jones2016"/>. A version of the essay was delivered at
                    Loyola University Chicago, September 24, 2016, at a conference organized by Paul
                    Eggert and the Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities; the program
                    included Laura Mandell, Geoffrey Rockwell, and Ted Underwood, and I’m grateful
                    to all involved for their feedback. The essay also reflects valuable input from
                    a collaborative team formed in the years since, which in Autumn 2017 received an
                    NEH Level II Digital Humanities Advancement Grant (2017-2019): Howard Kaplan,
                    Julianne Nyhan, Marco Passarotti, Geoffrey Rockwell, Paolo Senna, Stéfan
                    Sinclair, and Melissa Terras. For that project, see: <ref target="http://avc.web.usf.edu/images/RECAAL/">http://avc.web.usf.edu/images/RECAAL/</ref>.</note> It had once extended
                into a larger building, now demolished. When I arrived that day the remaining
                building was covered in scaffolding and dust, in the process of being converted into
                a charity residence (<ptr target="#figure01"/>). But based on the address and some
                distinctive architectural features, I confirmed that it was the site of what’s
                usually considered the first humanities computing center. This was where the Jesuit
                scholar Father Roberto Busa created and supervised CAAL, the <title rend="italic">Centro per L’Automazione dell’Analisi Letteraria</title> — the Center for the
                Automation of Literary Analysis (or Literary Data Processing Center, as it was
                sometimes translated) — which operated there 1961-1967. What follows describes an
                ongoing effort to conceptually <emph>reverse engineer</emph> that center in an
                attempt to better understand this important site in the history of humanities
                computing. </p>

            <p>Reverse engineering is a method for learning about something by taking it apart. It’s
                often applied to lost, secret, or otherwise obscured technologies. You take apart a
                device or a component in order to learn how it was put together. It’s a kind of
                hands-on conjecture, a way provisionally to <soCalled>write the missing
                    manual.</soCalled> You work backwards from a given concrete object to
                reconstruct its possible abstract design, tinkering in pursuit of better
                understanding. As one introductory essay on the topic says: <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#varady1997">While conventional engineering transforms engineering
                        concepts and models into real parts, in reverse engineering real parts are
                        transformed into engineering models and concepts</quote>
                    <ptr target="#varady1997"/>
                </cit>. Those <soCalled>models and concepts</soCalled> are necessarily based on some
                degree of speculation and are bound to remain uncertain. Nowadays, reverse
                engineering involves software as well as hardware (both in targeted object and
                method). Even when applied to a physical object, the process is likely to employ
                both digital and physical, including materials different from those of the original
                targeted object — for example, extruded polymers from 3D printers, clay, or
                Styrofoam — as well as virtual models built in software, including immersive 3D
                models. In fact, the use of CAD/CAM systems (Computer Aided Design/Manufacture) has
                become the norm in reverse engineering of all kinds <ptr target="#varady1997"/>.</p>
            <p>Common in everyday prototyping, design, and manufacture, reverse engineering has also
                been associated with industrial or state espionage, as a way of modeling classified
                or proprietary devices or systems. The German Enigma machine of World War II, an
                electro-mechanical encryption/decryption device, is a famous example. In fact,
                classic cryptanalysis is itself a form of reverse engineering applied to systems of
                symbols, but also, as in the case of the Enigma, the machines used to process those
                symbols. Reverse engineering has affinities with a number of historical and
                conjectural practices applied to objects and systems obscured by time and whose
                contexts are lost, for example, textual criticism, which often requires a scholar to
                fill in gaps left by textual lacunae, lost witnesses, or blotted, foxed,
                overwritten, or otherwise obscured passages in manuscripts. </p>
            <p>The basic concept of reverse engineering is familiar in digital humanities, too, as
                part of the field’s emphasis on experiment, making, and prototyping.<note> Miriam
                    Posner has applied the term reverse engineering to the disassembling and
                    analyzing of digital humanities projects themselves <ptr target="#posner2014"/>,
                    the key question being <q>How Did They Make That?</q> She says she wanted to
                    give students a kind of <soCalled>field guide</soCalled> to digital humanities
                    projects by breaking them down into their component parts.</note> Jentery Sayers
                and others at the University of Victoria’s Maker Lab in the Humanities have created
                Kits for Cultural History, physical kits with reconstructed components arranged in
                wooden boxes, inspired by artists’ Fluxus kits (Fluxkits) of the mid twentieth
                century <ptr target="#sayers2015"/>. The kits depend on reverse engineering as one
                phase in the ongoing process of dismantling and reconstructing historical
                technologies and media in order to better understand their designs and cultural
                meanings. For example, one kit allows the user to assemble a Victorian-era
                skull-shaped electric-light stickpin, an early example of wearable technology. As
                Sayers says, the kits <q>fabricate their own evidence off the page for assembly</q>
                — the key phrase being <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#sayers2015">off the page</quote>
                    <ptr target="#sayers2015"/>
                </cit>, that is, in the lab or workshop, but also in the conceptual space beyond any
                available documentation. The kits <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#sayers2015">identify gaps in material culture and prototype the
                        absences for examination</quote>
                    <ptr target="#sayers2015"/>
                </cit>. You begin with already reverse-engineered parts and some limited forms of
                documentation— designing, milling, printing, or otherwise fabricating the components
                and putting together the kits in the first place, not just using them, is an
                important phase in the process — then reconstruct the historical object, or, we
                might more accurately say, construct models of the historical object. The kits
                assume that historical knowledge is always provisional, part of an ongoing process
                of analysis, disassembly, conjecture, and reassembly. The kits use digital as well
                as physical components, including .OBJ and .STL files (shared via GitHub) that allow
                for the 3D printing of tangible components. Investigators can 3D-print small
                translucent skulls and wire them to batteries, for example, thereby raising
                questions about Victorian power sources, fashion, and cultural attitudes.</p>
            <p>Reverse engineering is similarly important in media archaeology, which grapples with
                gaps, ruptures, and concealed, lost, or forgotten knowledge about media or
                platforms. The concept appears explicitly in the work of Wolfgang Ernst to describe
                a method of hands-on experimentation, as Jussi Parikka explains: <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#ernst2013">For Ernst media archaeology is not only a way of writing but
                        a method that has to do with reverse engineering. Hence his way of
                        approaching objects is not merely as a collector but as an amateur engineer
                        who opens, checks physically, tests, and experiments to learn how media
                        function. [In Ernst’s work] Foucault became employed as a technician, and
                        media archaeology incorporates DIY.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ernst2013" loc="12–13"/>
                </cit>Ernst believes that some media archaeologists have focused too literally on
                the recovery of lost or forgotten technologies, based on a reductive interpretation
                of Michel Foucault’s concept of archaeology. Rather than <term>techne</term>,
                Foucault emphasizes <term>episteme</term>, the conditions that constrain knowledge
                by determining what can be known <ptr target="#foucault1969"/>. For Ernst, it’s
                important that media archaeology, as <q>both a method and an aesthetics of
                    practicing media criticism,</q> be recognized as <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#ernst2013">a kind of <emph>epistemological</emph> reverse engineering</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ernst2013" loc="55"/>
                </cit> (my emphasis). <cit>
                    <quote rend="block" source="#ernst2013">Media archaeology understood as an analysis of
                        epistemological configurations (both machinic and logic) does not simply
                        seek a redemption of forgotten or misread media of the past, nor is it
                        confined to a reconstruction of the crude beginnings and prehistories of
                        technical media. Rather than being a nostalgic collection of “dead media” of
                        the past, assembled in a curiosity cabinet, media archaeology is an
                        analytical tool, a method of analyzing and presenting aspects of media that
                        would otherwise escape the discourse of cultural history.</quote>
                    <ptr target="#ernst2013" loc="55"/>
                </cit> The dual emphasis, on implicit epistemology and material particulars, allows
                for the study of media in multiple dimensions. This takes into account larger
                structures determining historical affordances and constraints, while, at the same
                time, as Lori Emerson has put it, offering a check on our speculations through the
                    <q>sobering conceptual friction</q> produced by the method itself <ptr target="#emerson2014" loc="xii"/>. </p>
            <p>Geoffrey Rockwell and Stéfan Sinclair have called for a media-archaeology approach to
                the study of Busa’s work, as part of <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#rockwell2014">technology development around mainframe and personal
                        computer text analysis tools, that has largely been forgotten with the
                        advent of the web</quote>
                    <ptr target="#rockwell2014"/>
                </cit>. They argue this will help us to question narratives of inevitable progress
                and to begin to <q>understand how differently data entry, output and interaction
                    were thought through</q> in the mainframe era. They have begun to experiment
                with software emulations of Busa’s punched cards and their encoding systems,
                extrapolating from these to speculate about the workflow into which the cards were
                fitted. In fact, details of this most fundamental aspect of Busa’s method remain
                obscure. </p>
            <p>The point is to grapple with what we don’t know about Busa’s practice, including
                roads he did not take, technologies from which he turned away but the existence of
                which still sheds light on what he did. In addition to raising questions about
                received narratives, media archaeology offers a way to study the component parts of
                a technological system in analytical detail and as assembled wholes, to construct
                arguments about the constraints and affordances that come with even apparently
                insignificant component parts of the system. In the case of Busa’s work, these
                include for example those iconic punched cards themselves, the key medium for data
                input, output, and processing. But they also include the printing capabilities of
                certain IBM machines, and the use of large-scale electronic calculating machines and
                early computers, and the new medium of magnetic tape, for example, which made for
                faster sequential processing of linguistic data at later stages, even when that data
                had originally been punched onto cards. For Busa, the use of punched-card data
                processing machines and room-sized calculators overlapped—as they did for many users
                at mid century. Each system must be understood in relational terms, within an
                environment combining multiple emergent with only partially displaced platforms. </p>
            <p>I’ve suggested elsewhere that a useful figure for what’s involved in reverse
                engineering technological systems can be found in the
                    <soCalled>exploded-view</soCalled> diagrams used by engineers and patent
                attorneys <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="32–33"/>. These visualizations are metaphors
                for the processes of disassembly/reassembly for which they also serve as practical
                tools. They represent the component parts of a system, such as the IBM relay switch
                illustrated in <ptr target="#figure02"/>, as if they were blown apart, hanging
                suspended in mid air, each part labeled and connected back to the ensemble of the
                whole. This kind of 3D exploded-view diagram is often said to descend from the
                famous notebooks of Leonardo <ptr target="#bogost2012" loc="51"/>. We encounter
                mundane versions today in instructions for assembling Ikea furniture or Lego kits,
                as well as in schematics of scientific instruments and inventions, sometimes in the
                form of 3D digital graphics programs. The exploded-view diagram is a visual
                technique for representing technology, a technique that has itself become part of
                the history of technology. </p>

            <p>The Busa Archive contains almost one thousand high-quality photos, about eighty of
                which specifically represent the center in Gallarate. As I mentioned above, the
                building that housed CAAL’s main workspace was demolished by 2012, as Google Earth
                and other sources confirm.<note> Laura Romanò, the architect in charge of the
                    renovation of the remaining square courtyard building, has generously located
                    photographs in a local archive of the exterior of the now-gone factory building
                    with the skylights, taken not long before its demolition. These corroborate the
                    birds’-eye view of the building visible before 2012 in Google Earth’s timeline
                    tool. Some questions remain about the details of just how the two buildings were
                    connected.</note> The photographs in the Busa Archive, with a few limited
                exceptions, show only the interior of that lost building, providing some evidence
                for the layout, machinery, and equipment in Father Busa’s lab (as he often called
                it). But we have to remember that those photos were commissioned and curated by Busa
                himself. Each is like an idealized diagram of the center, including its layout and
                workflow. When I visited the site in November 2017, a former punched-card operator
                and supervisor, Livia Canestraro Tonelli, showed me her personal snapshot of the
                lab’s interior, a much less formal view of the space than the commissioned photos
                depict. I was struck by the image of two young women in the right foreground looking
                straight at the camera, sitting side by side at the same IBM 024 Card Punch. In fact
                there are three such pairs of operators in the photo. This differs in significant
                ways from the look and feel of the Busa Archive photos, suggesting a more
                collaborative working environment than those official images imply. Signora
                Tonelli’s snapshot, shared with me half a century later on the site of the
                demolished lab, vividly illustrates what we still don’t know about the actual
                quotidian work of CAAL.</p>
            <p>This is just one example of the need to take into account social arrangements and
                human actors in their physical environments, as cultural archaeologists have always
                    done.<note> Although some media archaeologists have been concerned to
                    differentiate the method from archaeology proper, as Shannon Mattern suggests,
                    media archaeology might benefit from interpreting the term “archaeology” more
                    literally on occasion: <cit>
                        <quote rend="inline" source="#mattern2017">There is much to be gained ... by productively

                    </cit>.</note> Reverse engineering is effective as a method in so far as it
                challenges assumptions, opens up alternative histories or counter histories, reveals
                gaps in knowledge and experiments with filling them in, but with the seams showing,
                like the polymer fills in 3D prints of reassembled broken pottery. The process is
                iterative: any reverse-engineered model is designed to be questioned and perhaps
                displaced by subsequent models. It’s the exploratory, heuristic process of modeling
                that matters more than any given model, and the models are most useful at the limits
                of knowledge, at the edge of productive ignorance.<note> For a nuanced treatment of
                    the significance for humanities computing of models and modeling as <q>the

            <p>In those terms, what would it mean to reverse engineer the Center for Literary Data
                Processing as a whole, as a technological system? To begin, we’d have to start with
                the premise that technology extends beyond machinery to infrastructure and
                institution, and even to the epistemological conditions, premises, and designs that
                afford and constrain the system. The archival photographs, for example, show an
                array of components, beyond machinery and punched cards, including chalk boards,
                sorting tables, flowcharts and diagrams, floor plan, icons and decorative elements,
                and human operators. Each component was part of the system but each implies its own
                contexts, including the global institutional networks that were as important to the
                center as the IBM machines. In the remaining space of this essay, I’ll use a few of
                the photographs in the Busa Archive to sketch out some components of that implied
                system, and suggest how a more thorough application of reverse engineering might
                proceed.</p>
            <p>I start with a personal snapshot, along with two of the archival photographs (a
                larger selection is visible at <ref target="http://avc.web.usf.edu/images/RECAAL/">http://avc.web.usf.edu/images/RECAAL/</ref>): (1) my own snapshot of the
                exterior of the remaining building at via Galileo Ferraris, 2, taken March 2015,
                while it was undergoing renovation; (2) an image of IBM machinery’s being crated and
                removed from the site in 1966 or 1967, as CAAL was closing at that location; and (3)
                an image of the lab fully equipped and staffed with student operators in their white
                coats, presumably taken in 1966 in the now-demolished building <ptr target="#figure01"/>
                <ptr target="#figure03"/>
                <ptr target="#figure04"/>. So the sequence moves in reverse order, starting with the
                remnant building in 2015, going back to the moment 48 years earlier when CAAL was
                decommissioned, and then, perhaps only months before that, to a view of the full
                configuration of the Literary Data Processing system as if in operation, as it had
                been in that location for six years. </p>

            <p>That last-named photograph of CAAL in operation (<ptr target="#figure04"/>) can
                itself be read as a system diagram. Indeed, the photo was professionally taken and
                was likely staged by Father Busa as just such a diagrammatic tableau vivant. It was
                taken near the very end of the center in that form, at that location. In the diagram
                we see an array of components, from the peculiarities of the physical plant itself,
                to the signs and symbols with which it as decorated, to the human operators or
                    <soCalled>computers,</soCalled> most of them young women, who performed the
                processing, embodying what might once have been referred to as the <soCalled>human
                    factor</soCalled> of the data processing system. </p>

            <p>The building at via G. Ferraris, no. 2 was once a textile factory, so it had a long
                open-plan interior with a multiply peaked accordion-style roof with skylights to
                optimize natural light down on the line. It was donated for Busa’s use (that is,
                made available rent free) by a prominent local textile family with some additional
                financing from another industrialist. Gallarate had been a center of the textile
                industry for generations and Busa adopted the production-line layout for CAAL along
                with the building, with grey-metal four-footed IBM punched-card machines instead of
                looms and other textile processors. The scientific-industrial management model is
                clear in the layout. Textiles gave way to texts, woven fibers were replaced by
                skeins of words. It’s even possible that different kinds of punched cards were used
                to program Jacquard-style looms there at one time (though I have no evidence of
                this). The industrial plan shows in the details: the skylights, the power cables
                dropped from the ceiling alongside columns, the rows of small heaters with chimney
                pipes, even the open spaces around the edge of the room for worktables, where
                textual piecework could be done <soCalled>offline</soCalled> (punched-card sorting
                and concordance lemmatization), as well as the prominent station in a room to the
                side of the main lab space with a desk for Father Busa—a kind of manager’s office. </p>
            <p>That office also resembled a dais or altar. A number of photographs in the Busa
                Archive commemorate a formal visit by Cardinal Colombo for the inaugural dedication
                ceremony, and the back wall behind Father Busa’s desk eventually contained a large,
                colorful stained glass window with electric backlighting depicting a modernist head
                of Christ. That dominating icon is a reminder of the overarching importance of his
                Jesuit order and the Catholic church when it came to the conception and mission of
                CAAL. The decor of the lab reminds us of how industrial and religious cultures
                combined to create the infrastructure of Busa’s project. In some photographs you can
                see passages in Greek (one is Romans 11:36, for example) and Hebrew inscribed on the
                wall on either side of the stained glass window. Perhaps none of this is surprising
                in the lab of a researcher-priest. But the combination of cultural and industrial
                influences is important. Those scriptural passages, for example, can be read as
                religious alternatives to the inspirational workplace mottoes found all over IBM
                headquarters, the best known of which was the THINK sign, which Busa would have seen
                displayed everywhere while working in IBM in New York and Milan, including one
                prominently hung over the desk of the founding CEO, Thomas J. Watson, Sr., when Busa
                first met him in 1949 to propose the project and secure IBM’s support. </p>
            <p>It’s difficult to disentangle the industrial culture of IBM at the historical moment
                of its expansion into a global enterprise from the worldwide mission of the Jesuit
                order, which included the tradition of founding schools, for example. The student
                punched-card operators at CAAL were trained according to the IBM model, certainly,
                but many of them came straight from the local Catholic school, and during their
                two-year scholarships at CAAL they were required to take Theology and English
                classes while receiving hands-on training in data processing. Siegfried Zielinski
                has pointed out that the Renaissance Jesuit polymath, Athansius Kircher, S.J.
                (1602-1680), exploited a <q>worldwide network of clients and patrons,</q> and
                pursued his scholarship supported by the Jesuits’ <q>international network,</q> a <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#zielinski2008">system of religious faith, knowledge, and politics,
                        combined with the development of advanced strategies for the mise-en-scène
                        of their messages, including the invention and construction of the requisite
                        devices and apparatus</quote>
                    <ptr target="#zielinski2008" loc="118"/>
                </cit>. The same description could be applied to Father Busa’s work three centuries
                later. </p>
            <p>Besides grants from local industrialists, CAAL received some small grants from the
                Italian national government. But by far the chief financial support came from IBM.
                This flowed from IBM’s newly founded World Trade Corporation but also through IBM
                Italia in Milan, in whose borrowed offices Busa had originally started a precursor
                to the center in 1954, while solidifying his agreement with IBM. For CAAL, IBM
                provided free technical support, as well as the all-important endless supply of
                paper punched cards (often called simply <soCalled>IBM cards</soCalled> at the time
                in recognition of the company’s dominance of the worldwide market for them), and,
                through a system of annual points, essentially gave Busa the use of data-processing
                machines rent-free. It also made some additional financial contributions to keep the
                center running <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="113"/>. </p>
            <p>The photos in the Busa Archive sometimes reveal specific models of the machines, or
                their nameplates suggest they were trucked in directly from IBM Italia in Milan.
                Some show which source texts the operators used for input, and you can sometimes see
                the patterns on punched cards as they were passing through the machines. These
                machines were of course the key apparatus for the lab’s workflow. They were always
                used in suites to process decks of cards in series: punching, copying, sorting,
                printing, and collating. It’s of course impossible to tell from the photos every
                combination of specific models used over the years—another example of the need for
                conjecture and speculation. But they were mostly punched-card machines, starting
                with the IBM model 024 and 026 Card Punch (the only difference being that the 026
                had the capability to print onto the cards as well as punch holes in them), rather
                than large stored-program computers, although some additional processing was done at
                the company’s location in New York using the magnetic tape drive of the IBM 705 Data
                Processing System, for example. In general, histories of computing have tended to
                focus on well known large-scale machines that can be identified as ancestors of
                later computers, ENIAC, UNIVAC, and so on. This has led to an underemphasis on
                    <soCalled>normal</soCalled> technological practice during the early years of
                computing, such as the widespread use of technically out-of-date, lower-cost office
                machinery, several generations of which remained in operation in commercial,
                academic, and government settings for decades after the end of World War II. Indeed,
                it was 1962 before IBM’s revenues from stored-program electronic computers overtook
                its revenues from punched-card data processing systems <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="117"/>. Busa’s humanistic project was one example of the kind of uses to
                which punched-card machines continued to be put, well after the emergence of
                electronic stored-program computing. In this context, out of both design and
                necessity, the first humanities computing center could more properly be thought of
                as a humanities <emph>data processing </emph>center.</p>
            <p>The Busa Archive contains a diagrammatic flowchart for <q>Mechanized Linguistic
                    Analysis,</q> as it’s labeled (see <ref target="http://avc.web.usf.edu/images/RECAAL/">http://avc.web.usf.edu/images/RECAAL/</ref>). It was produced at IBM in New
                York in 1952, presumably for Father Busa’s first big demo in June of that year, nine
                years before CAAL was established in Gallarate. Initials at the top
                    (<soCalled>PT</soCalled>) suggest that the diagram was drawn by IBM’s Paul
                Tasman, Busa’s great collaborator for decades thereafter. The shapes of the boxes
                drawn on the chart are conventional, representing different operations at various
                stages in the process: documents (a rectangle with a wavy bottom edge), individual
                punched cards, stacks of punched cards, machine operations, and so on. The chart
                diagrams the process for creating the <title rend="italic">Index Thomisticus</title>
                as it was first conceived, 1949-1952.<note> Although he didn’t have access to this
                    flowchart, nor indeed to the later-established Busa Archive, Thomas Nelson
                    Winter published in 1999 an impressive summary of Busa’s workflow for the <title rend="italic">Index Thomisticus</title>, based largely on Busa’s own
                    published accounts, especially an important 1951 pamphlet <ptr target="#winter1999"/>
                    <ptr target="#busa1951"/>.</note> While this may tell us something about the
                later setup in Gallarate, the machinery and workflow were sure to have changed by
                1961. Comparing the 1952 chart to similar flowcharts from later decades and using
                Father Busa’s later accounts can help us to speculate about the setup at the center
                in the 1960s, but only provisionally, as part of the ongoing process of historical
                modeling. One thing evident in the 1952 flowchart is the human role, not just to
                operate the machinery but at key stages to hand-sort the cards. One stage labeled in
                the chart, set off by dotted lines, is <q>SCHOLAR WRITES ENTRY WORD LIST,</q> and in
                fact the lemmatization of words in the <title rend="italic">Index
                    Thomisticus</title>, as well as a number of other sorting tasks, not to mention
                simply carrying the cards from machine to machine between each stage, required human
                effort. <soCalled>Automation</soCalled> at the time (as today) remained a
                not-fully-realized ideal, a hybrid process involving the collaboration of human and
                machine. </p>
            <p>Despite the language on the flowchart, many of the human tasks at CAAL were
                undertaken not by a <soCalled>scholar</soCalled> per se, but by the young student
                apprentices who were also the machine operators. Most of them were young women. In
                the photographs we can see them in white lab coats at the keypunches, but also
                facing one another at tables off to the side, apparently sorting cards by hand. In
                1961, the operators worked in two four-hour shifts per day, punching and verifying
                the cards. The system was hierarchical and gendered, in line with the gendering of
                all data processing at the time. Three special operators were selected from among
                the ranks as supervisors <ptr target="#detollenaere1963"/>
                <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="124"/>. Chief among these was Livia Canestraro, who
                had been one of the earliest students in the training school, from before it was
                established at the via Ferraris site. In a recent interview conducted by Julianne
                Nyhan and Melissa Terras, she tells an interesting story of Father Busa’s attempting
                sometime in the 1960s to replace her with a young man, an attempt stopped by a
                rebellion among the students, including, she says, some of the minority who were
                men. She notes that she’s grateful for the opportunities she had, rare at the time
                for a young woman, but she still regrets the lack of a <soCalled>real
                    diploma</soCalled> from the Center, despite all her training and practical
                expertise; in the end, she says, she <q>was interested in women’s ... being able to
                    do the same tasks as men</q> — implying that the culture and workflow of CAAL
                did not support this ideal <ptr target="#nyhanforthcoming"/>
                <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="124"/>. After leaving the center she went on to work
                as an editor.</p>
            <p>Canestraro was the exception. There’s no evidence that any other women at CAAL held
                more senior roles, let alone crossed over to the scholarly side of the center’s
                organizational structure, which was located up the road at Father Busa’s Aloisianum
                college (named for Saint Aloysius Gonzaga). So there was a two-tiered structure:
                technical workers down at the factory, and scholarly or intellectual supervisors up
                at the college. Women were the usually invisible or anonymous laborers of all early
                computing, and many of the official archival photos are telling in this regard. The
                operators sit at the machines with their hands on the keyboards and their heads
                down, while suited male conferees or visitors stand around watching the
                demonstrations. Along with these photos, the transcripts of Terras's and Nyhan’s
                interviews with some of these women give us a more detailed, alternative story to
                complicate the received founding narrative <ptr target="#nyhanforthcoming"/>.</p>
            <p>The photos in the Busa Archive reveal CAAL’s odd mid-century aesthetic, a combination
                of the industrial and the homemade. Card-file cabinet doors along the side of the
                room appear to have been exuberantly hand painted. Abstract shapes drawn high up on
                the surrounding walls resemble puzzle pieces whose outlines contain characters from
                various languages, some recognizably Hebrew, Roman, or Greek. These may have been
                meant to invoke linguistics in general, or the idea of textual fragments, the
                partial and incomplete state in which all texts descend to us through history. They
                may also represent texts as deliberately <soCalled>blown to bits</soCalled> —
                exploded into their constituent signs, precisely the kind of atomization that was
                part of the automation of linguistic processing, the concordance- and
                abstract-making of the center. In this sense, the icons may represent language as
                bits of data to be processed.</p>
            <p>More immediately, I suspect they were meant to invoke the recently unearthed Dead Sea
                Scrolls, fragments of which CAAL had started working with at the time (There are
                photos in the Busa Archive showing arrays of some of those fragments that look very
                much like the drawings). That Dead Sea Scrolls work never resulted in a published
                index, due to personal problems on Busa’s part and the various competing interests
                in which the primary materials were entangled <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="163–65"/>. But the project offered Busa a new perspective on data processing and a new set
                of philological questions. It required transcripts—themselves not easy to come by at
                the time—to be marked up and customized punched cards for Hebrew and Aramaic texts,
                as well as the customization of machines so that the Hebrew-punched cards could be
                read right to left. The Dead Sea Scrolls work was a significant if relatively small
                project for IBM, too. The company capitalized on its sponsorship in the 1960s, as
                seen in one print ad touting the work under the headline of solving <q>literary
                    puzzles</q>
                <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="139–40"/>. </p>
            <p>Father Busa saw the work of CAAL as aspiring to a new kind of computerized philology.
                Philology is a term that carries a good deal of historical baggage <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="154–56"/>. For Father Busa it seems to have meant
                simply the study of natural language in its minute particulars and cultural
                contexts, and he believed that, through quantification, computing had opened up a
                    <soCalled>new dimension</soCalled> that made a qualitative difference <ptr target="#busa1990"/>. The philological remit of CAAL led to some work in machine
                translation, which was tied to the rise of Natural Language Processing.
                Experimentation in this area was widespread until the Automatic Language Processing
                Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report of 1966 determined that its funding should be
                curtailed. In 1954, at the moment Busa was first working to establish CAAL, IBM held
                a widely publicized demonstration of machine translation featuring a team of
                researchers from Georgetown University’s Linguistics group. An IBM 701 Defense
                Calculator was used to translate into English a group of Russian sentences, based on
                a limited set of syntax rules. As the press release put it, a
                    <soCalled>girl</soCalled> who didn’t understand Russian was deliberately chosen,
                so that she could mechanically punch the Russian sentences onto cards. The
                    <soCalled>electronic ‘brain’</soCalled> then <q>dashed off its English
                    translations on an automatic printer at the breakneck speed of two and a half
                    lines per second.</q> The press release also pointed out that the machine had
                interrupted its schedule of calculating rocket trajectories in order to address this
                    <q>new and strange realm,</q> as it called it, <cit>
                    <quote rend="inline" source="#jones2016">the human use of words</quote>
                    <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="110"/>
                </cit>.</p>
            <p>In the Cold War era, even humanistic research of this kind was likely to be defense
                work. At the beginning of the new decade Father Busa personally brokered an
                arrangement between the IBM-Georgetown group and both the U.S. Atomic Energy
                Commission and Euratom (European Atomic Energy Community, founded by treaty of
                1957), located in Ispra, about 30 kilometers northwest of Gallarate. Busa later
                recalled that he made the connection, as he said, <soCalled>on an exchange
                    basis,</soCalled> serving as liaison and facilitator of the arrangement <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="111–12"/>. He drew up on paper a formal agreement among
                the parties, with CAAL as a central node in the network thereby established. The
                student operators at Gallarate punched onto cards about a million words of
                Russian-language texts. The cards were then processed by the Georgetown-IBM system
                at Ispra. In return, CAAL appears to have received some funding from Euratom, and
                some of the punched-card operators were later hired at Euratom when they left CAAL
                    <ptr target="#jones2016" loc="111–12"/>. </p>
            <p>What Father Busa called the <soCalled>exchange basis</soCalled> through which he made
                this series of connections can be understood as a kind of educational or diplomatic
                exchange, in which CAAL’s students and its operating budget benefitted as a result
                of providing certain services. Indeed <soCalled>exchange</soCalled> also suggests
                the resources and currencies involved. But metaphorically, we might also say that
                Father Busa served as an <soCalled>exchange</soCalled> in the technological sense, a
                kind of switch or relay for traffic, as in a railroad or telephone exchange. Or the
                plugboard system of a data-processing machine, examples of which can be seen in the
                Busa Archive photographs. At mid century, manual matrix exchanges were still in
                widespread use, by which human operators could make complex series of connections on
                large plugboards by changing the configuration of wired plugs, a kind of hardwired
                programming. Some models allowed for the boards to be lifted out by a handle and
                carried by operators and installed in a new machine, so that a given configuration
                could be transferred. The first humanities computing center, CAAL, only existed at
                the site on the via Ferraris for about six years. In the 1960s, however, it served
                as a router for many such exchanges. </p>
            <p>I’m now collaborating with a team of researchers from four countries with the support
                of an NEH Level II Digital Humanities Advancement Grant (2017-2019), working with
                the University of South Florida’s Advanced Visualization Center to create immersive
                3D models of the site of Busa’s center and its machinery. These models will be
                integrated with a range of other materials: Geoffrey Rockwell and Stéfan Sinclair
                are experimenting with emulations of Busa’s process and workflow, as I’ve said, and
                Melissa Terras and Julianne Nyhan have already been reconstructing the history of
                Busa’s female punched-card operators, including conducting interviews with some of
                them. At the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, Marco Passarotti and
                Paolo Senna are working to digitize primary materials in the Busa Archive. The
                result of this collaboration will be a kind of virtual lab within which to
                experiment with reverse engineering the technologies and institutions that made up
                Busa’s famous (but only dimly understood) center and its work. </p>
            <p>Already a more nuanced and detailed understanding of CAAL has begun to emerge,
                challenging the simple founding narrative of humanities computing and shedding new
                light on today’s digital humanities and on issues of institutionalization, funding,
                and labor. Our modeling starts with the minute particulars of material technologies
                and extends to wider social and historical contexts. The first Center for Literary
                Data Processing was the product of strategic alliances, pragmatic arrangements, and
                social connections, as well as available machinery and material infrastructure, all
                framed by Father Busa’s Jesuit mission, academic notions of the humanities, and
                models of industrial productivity. Evidence of these system components can be found
                in the images and other documentation, from the floor plan of the now-demolished
                former factory, to the arrangement of machines on the floor, to the decks of punched
                cards flowing through it all by way of combined machine and human agency—including,
                centrally, but never exclusively and never in isolation, the agency of Father Busa
                himself. The via G. Ferraris, 2 remains an important site in the history of
                technology and the humanities, and it’s a site we’ve only just begun to
                understand.</p>
