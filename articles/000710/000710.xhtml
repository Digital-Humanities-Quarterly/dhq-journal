                     and soon became of major interest for the researchers of Antiquity. It is supposed
                     to
                     be “a study that identifies and relates a group of persons or
                     characters within a particular historical or literary context”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e214">[1]</a> As for
                     historical prosopography, K. Keats-Rohan canonically defines it as being“ about what the analysis of the sum of data about many individuals
                     can tell us about the different types of connection between them, and hence about
                     how they operated within and upon the institutions — social, political, legal,
                     economic, intellectual — of their time”

                     elite personalities of the past, on whom information is rich, it has nowadays turned
                     more and more towards the “normal people” of the ancient world, thus going into
                     the depths of the socio-economic fabric of societies, revealed through micro-networks

                     They have been scanned, annotated, enriched with metadata and compiled in the form
                     of
                     digital collections. Henceforward domain experts strive to inspect these collections
                     from multiple perspectives in order to understand their structure and inner
                     correlations. Yet, the most efficient ways of studying this new amount of digital
                     information still remain unclear. Traditional keyword or faceted searches rendering
                     list and table views allow approaching the collections in the spirit of a data
                     repository but they provide only little insight into patterns such as coverage,
                     interconnections, co-occurrences or dynamics over time. As a consequence, they are
                     often of only limited value, especially for exploratory data analysis. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Graph models are a promising complementary approach to the exploration of such
                     digital collections, by considering the data as a network of connected information
                     through nodes and edges. The edges represent relationships between the nodes and
                     their properties. By using graph models it is not only possible to apply network
                     analysis metrics and algorithms to investigate the characteristics of the given data
                     set. Furthermore, force-directed placement algorithms [<a class="ref" href="#fruchterman_reingold1991">Fruchterman and Reingold 1991</a>] allow generating visual layouts where highly
                     connected nodes are placed close together. Looking at these visualizations can help
                     theresearcher to spot hidden implicit structures such as ego-networks, cliques, and
                     central nodes which may point to historically relevant insights. </div>

                     and visualization. Prominent examples include Gephi [<a class="ref" href="#bastian_etal2009">Bastian, Heymann, and Jacomy 2009</a>], Cytoscape [<a class="ref" href="#shannon_etal2003">Shannon et al. 2003</a>] and Palladio (<a href="https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/" onclick="window.open('https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/'); return false" class="ref">https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio</a>). The advantage of these off-the-shelf
                     solutions lies in the fact that the graphs to be studied can be generated from any
                     data source, as they are imported via pre-formatted files. However, the spreadsheets
                     have to be structured and the considered data has to be limited in such a manner as
                     to answer certain predetermined research questions. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">As an example, the user may be interested in the people cited in a set of documents
                     and sets up the graph of all persons linked to the documents they are mentioned in.
                     If a cluster of persons stands out for their high number of coappearances, the user
                     may want to understand their family relationships, or learn more about the network
                     of
                     organizations and events they are connected to. However each follow-up graph requires
                     exporting specific data from the database, and preparing and importing further
                     spreadsheets. The resulting workflow is rather clumsy and not appropriate for
                     exploratory studies with open questions. Moreover, when dealing with evolving data
                     collections which are at times enriched or corrected, as is also the case with
                     Romans1by1, it is more advisable to work with visualisations directly extracted from
                     the original database and not via exported files that may become obsolete. </div>

                     community started turning in the last years to the use of graph databases, i.e.
                     dedicated database solutions where the information is from the outset inherently
                     stored in the form of a graph. These solutions also typically come with built-in
                     tools allowing the user to inspect their dataset in an interactive way via queries
                     and straightforward visualizations. The next section discusses the conceptual key
                     differences between traditional relational and graph databases, and presents several
                     projects where a graph database have already been successfully applied.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Relational databases, simply defined as databases structured to save and recognize
                     relationships between stored items, are extensively used in all scientific,
                     industrial and commercial domains, and they continue as such to this day because of
                     their efficient and non-redundant data storage and manipulation [<a class="ref" href="#rob_coronel2000">Rob and Coronel 2000</a>]. The relational database model organizes data into one
                     or more tables of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row, called
                     a
                     primary key. The tabular structure is a good choice for many list like
                     business-related records such as accounting or customer data management. However,
                     relationships between data elements are often poorly represented in such databases.
                     They have to be computed at query time by matching primary and foreign keys of all
                     rows in the connected tables. These operations have exponential costs in calculus
                     and
                     memory footprint, so that relational databases tend to struggle with computing
                     relationships efficiently [<a class="ref" href="#kleppmann2017">Kleppmann 2017</a>]. Moreover, the rigid schemas
                     of tabular data models makes it difficult to add new or different kinds of
                     relationships.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">On the other hand, graph databases use particular graph-oriented data models with
                     the
                     concept of nodes and edges to store connections directly alongside the data. Nodes
                     are the entities in the graph. They can hold any number of properties in the form
                     of
                     key-value pairs. Edges represent directed and named relationships between two nodes.
                     Like nodes, edges can also have properties. In most cases, these are quantitative
                     properties, such as weights, costs, or distances. It is important to understand that
                     a graph data model cannot capture fundamentally new information compared to a
                     relational data model. The key difference lies in the way data is organized and
                     accessed. Where relational databases use indexing through unique keys to model
                     relationships, graph databases, on the other hand, store edges through pointers
                     allowing to rapidly find the neighbours of a node. Graph databases are therefore an
                     efficient solution when dealing with volumes of highly connected data. As an example,
                     the following relational table-based and graph based data models implement the same
                     schema:

                        utterances used as a basis for analysis)</em>. Nonetheless, some of them must be
                     quoted for their role in the development of prosopographic research. So are <cite class="title italic">Prosopographia Imperii Romani</cite> (PIR), <cite class="title italic">Prosopography of the Byzantine World</cite> (PBW), and <cite class="title italic">Hellenistic Babylonia: Texts, Images, Names</cite> (HBTIN), which tend to focus
                     on specific and delimited time and place, and social class or categories of person.
                     Equally valuable however, is the <cite class="title italic">Lexicon of Greek Personal

                     tributary to the model suggested by John Bradley and his research group at King’s
                     College London, which marked the shift from narrative descriptions to information
                     on
                     persons as structured data (<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/factoid-prosopography)" onclick="window.open('https://www.kcl.ac.uk/factoid-prosopography)'); return false" class="ref">https://www.kcl.ac.uk/factoid-prosopography)</a>. Working mainly on the <cite class="title italic">Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England</cite> (PASE), Bradley
                     theorized the concept of prosopographical “factoids” – small pieces of data
                     about persons (name variants, occupations, places of residence, events in which they
                     played a role, personal and professional relationships, possessions, etc.) provided
                     by the sources, which are not exactly facts as we cannot verify their veracity ([<a class="ref" href="#bradley2005">Bradley 2005</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#bradley_short2005">Bradley and Short 2005</a>]). Factoid
                     prosopographers took these pieces of information and registered them into a
                     relational database that reflected their connections and relationships. One of the
                     main advantages of this model lies in the fact that it offers the opportunity to stay
                     true to the source – a necessity when we are sometimes dealing with inconsistent or
                     even antagonistic sources. </div>

                     that the database was built in order to be very user-friendly and adaptable to the

                     Romans1by1, we have to take into consideration two main factors: the texts are not
                     standardized in any form, the details they offer being altogether subjective and the
                     information is generally scarce. Nonetheless, a graph database brings forth the
                     possibility to visualize connections in a direct manner, which can constitute an
                     important advantage, especially for people who get in contact with the information
                     for the first time such as students or researchers unfamiliar with the area.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">At this point, the main outcomes of our research can be divided in three general
                     categories: source-connected, network-connected and diachronic distribution graphs.
                     The relation of a given person to the sources and how he/she is represented in
                     various texts is highly important, especially in the prosopography of Greek and Roman
                     non-elite characters. Going a step further than the factoid model, we textualize
                     individuals and individualize texts, meaning that the inscription itself - and the
                     “factoids” it narrates - become part of the individual’s ego-history <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e691">[2]</a>
                     Thus, the link between individual and source is rendered as more important than
                     initially imagined by traditional historiography. The network analyses refer to
                     individual networks, but it also allows researchers to compare and superpose two (or
                     more) persons’ networks, as well as to visualize and investigate “immaterial”
                     networks, connections between institutions, economic actors, etc. The diachronic
                     distribution graphs show quantitative and qualitative changes that occur over time
                     at
                     the scale of epigraphic habits, network patterns and individual movement, in a
                     certain region or micro-region. Correlating all these types of information and
                     visualizing them comes with great analytic gains, as it reveals a more complex
                     picture of the people we study and the fabric of their society.</div>

                     ingestion of information into a graph database model and their subsequent analysis
                     from a historian’s perspective can improve our knowledge and understanding of ancient
                     society. The first example is a selection of <em class="emph">all people attested in a certain
                        settlement - in our case Napoca, from Roman Dacia</em>. In the graph below, the
                     red nodes are our central entities, namely the attested people and the blue ones are
                     the sources. Thus, here we can see not only the number of attested people but also
                     the connection between them, as well as between them and the sources. Napoca was the
                     first urban settlement of northern Dacia, became a <span class="foreign i">municipium</span> under Hadrian and a <span class="foreign i">colonia</span>
                     during Marcus Aurelius’ reign ([<a class="ref" href="#ardevan1998">Ardevan 1998</a>, 61–65]; [<a class="ref" href="#voisian_etal2000">Voișian et al. 2000</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#diaconescu2004">Diaconescu 2004</a>, 117–121]). As
                     the administrative center of Dacia Porolissensis, it became the capital of the
                     province and the seat of the <span class="foreign i">procuratores</span>, both
                     praesidial (118/119-168) and financial (after 168). On the graphic representation,
                     we
                     have the chance to visualize the approx. 130 people of Napoca, their individual
                     networks and pinpoint collective sources, which attest a multitude of persons
                     implicitly connected. What is most striking at a first sight is an inscription
                     attesting multiple people, thus creating a network. We are dealing with the list of
                     members of the <span class="foreign i">spira Asianorum</span> (CIL III 870) from
                     235, a local association reuniting people from the province of Asia. We know that
                     the
                     association, besides its social and religious role, was also involved in commerce.
                     Unfortunately, no other member of the <span class="foreign i">spira</span> is
                     attested by a different inscription as well and the network remains circular.
                     Nonetheless, it tells us something about epigraphic habits: the source attesting a
                     network is an association list, a document typical rather to Greek epigraphy; Latin
                     commemoration or adulation habits imply rather small, often familial groups.</div>

                     Namely, we have concentrated on the people bearing a certain name, in a certain area.
                     The graph below lists all <em class="emph">people bearing the nomen Claudius/Clodius in Pannonia
                        Superior</em>. Here the interesting historical facts to take into account are,
                     besides the number of name bearers in itself, the possibility to see relations and
                     to
                     observe if more members of the same family/group bear this <span class="foreign i">nomen</span>. In this case, we again mostly see small networks, but what
                     strikes us in a few cases is the lack of explicit relationship between persons. For
                     example, in one instance (CIL III 4244) we have two soldiers, named Tiberius Calusius
                     Aplo and Tiberius Claudius Vanamius. The text explicates only the fact that Aplo is
                     the heir of the deceased Vanamius, without revealing other potential relationship.
                     Nonetheless, seeing them on an onomastic graph, the name similitude is much more
                     obvious the possibility that the two were actually close relatives. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">In the case of the previous two examples, migrating from table-form to graph has a
                     number of important and relevant aspects: first, we are able to see at a glance the
                     entirety of people and adjacent sources (inscriptions). Then, we have a clear and
                     immediate vision of the connections: in both cases we can easily observe that almost
                     none of the characters is attested by more than one source. This ascribes the
                     networks to very limited circumstances. Nonetheless, we do have a notable exception,
                     in the person of Tiberius Claudius Victorinus (AE 1998, 1049; AE 2003, 1353),
                     attested by two monuments. The man was a decurion of Savaria and we get to know him
                     and his family from his son’s epitaph and from his own funerary monument. So, we have
                     the representation of an elite family that doesn’t go beyond first degree blood
                     connections. Even so, it is interesting to note that he outlived his son, as well
                     that they preferred separate monuments (maybe connected to separate burial locations)
                     instead of a larger family monument. </div>

                     representation and give us an overview of the epigraphic situation.</div>

                     <span class="foreign i">milliaria</span>, and dedications made by the governor
                     alone. Only few inscriptions place him in a social context: the dedication for the
                     emperors’ health made by a religious association (ISM II 82), or dedications made
                     for
                     his own health by members of his staff and other minor officials (as it is the case
                     of Raesius Pudens, a <span class="foreign i">primiscrinius officina</span> - CIL
                     III 12370). So, what we get in this case is an important man, a local official, who
                     doesn’t necessarily manifest himself epigraphically at a personal level, doesn’t
                     dedicate to private deities and doesn’t associate family members to his acts, but
                     is
                     very present in the organization of the roads system from the province, as well as
                     in
                     the urban landscape building.</div>

                     discussion. We know Aquila from an inscription discovered at Solin (ancient Salona,
                     province of Dalmatia, in today's Croatia) and we learn that he was a merchant from
                     the province of Dacia, former decurion of Potaissa. The inscription was placed on
                     the
                     front of a sarcophagus. The text of the inscription reveals the person buried in the
                     sarcophagus: Valeria Ursina, daughter of Titus and wife of Aurelius Aquila. The
                     husband, who dedicates the monument, tells us that the deceased was an "incomparable"
                     wife and that they lived together for seven years without a single quarrel (CIL III
                     2086). The sarcophagus, simple as it may have been as an accomplishment, denotes the
                     status of the family in society, as obviously not everyone could afford such a
                     monument.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p40">Aquila, however, is also known to us from an inscription from Split (Spalatum, near
                     Salona). The two monuments have not been associated until recently [<a class="ref" href="#varga2016">Varga 2016</a>], and it was not known that we could reconstruct more of this
                     person's life from them. This second monument is also funerary, but this time a stela
                     - a gravestone. Here Aquila is in the role of 'most unfortunate father', as he was
                     burying his son, Titus Aurelius Apollonius, who died at the age of 33 at Sirmium (in
                     Lower Pannonia, now Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia). The young man had followed a
                     military career, most likely as a centurion in a military cohort in Pannonia. But
                     the
                     tomb is not only Aurelius Apollonius', Aquila also buried two friends here: Aurelius
                     Flavus, a Syrian merchant who died at 55, and Aurelius Lucianus. Of course, Flavus'
                     trade immediately brings to mind the other monument, to which we shall return.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">An exact family reconstruction is impossible, and we have to wonder whether this son
                     of Aquila is also the son of Valerius Ursina, or of a later wife of the decurion
                     relocated to Dalmatia. There are, however, several clues suggesting that he is the
                     son of Valeria. First, the name: the surname Titus is also that of the deceased
                     wife's father. Then the age, 33 at the time of death, and the fact that the father
                     was still fit, indicate the child was born in Aquila's youth. And finally, the lack
                     of a mother to co-dedicate this funerary monument suggests her total absence from
                     the
                     landscape, and thus the death prior to that of the son. At this point, we must
                     underline again the utility of a graph model, as the relationships, with or without
                     a
                     certain degree of ambiguity, appear visible, “clean”, and accurately connected
                     to the sources, thus making interpretation easier and more to the point. </div>

                     we know nothing else, as he is only attested here. Aurelius Flavus, however, appears
                     on another monument in the province of Dacia itself. In Dacia, at Apulum, our
                     character is attested with the same name and description as a merchant, Syrian by
                     origin, on a dedication to Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus. This dedication was
                     made together with another merchant, a Syrian as well, Aurelius Alexander.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">Aurelius Aquila, as decurion in Potaissa, was a member of the city's small local
                     elite. It should be pointed out that Roman municipal elites were often actively
                     engaged in local production and consumer markets, in commercial activities, lived
                     and
                     valued the same things as those who had a more or less similar economic position,
                     but
                     played no political role. At some point in his life, most likely while he was still
                     quite young, our man moved to Dalmatia. We don't know his reasons, but they could
                     be
                     varied, ranging from better business opportunities offered by the Dalmatian coast
                     to
                     family reasons. We don't know if he came here married, or if he met Valeria Ursina
                     in
                     his new province of residence, but it is certain that after a few years of marriage
                     the young woman died, leaving behind a son. The husband buries her with enough pomp
                     to mark the family's position in society, and after this point we don't know what
                     Aquila's life was like. We do know, however, that he remained in Salona and
                     maintained his business ties with Dacia. Some of these ties overlap with personal
                     ties of friendship. At one point, his and Valeria Ursina's son, a centurion in
                     Pannonia, dies at the age of just 33, in circumstances unknown to us. At this point
                     in his life we also find Aquila. But the Decurion honours not only the memory of his
                     son by erecting a monument, but also of two friends, one of whom, Aurelius Flavus,
                     a
                     merchant from Dacia. Flavus, although he bears a very Latin name, is a Syrian
                     merchant with connections in Dacia and Dalmatia, as the funerary monument shows.
                     Aquila is in charge of the memory of these two friends, which leads us to believe
                     that he also inherited them, at least in part, probably as a result of shared
                     business and capital.</div>

                     tributary to these recent developments. As the sources are scarce and practically
