                <p>This essay presents quantitative capture and predictive modeling for one of the

                    city-scale library usage and, by extension, as a window onto contemporary

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>In <title rend="italic">The Library Beyond the Book</title>, Jeffrey T. Schnapp
                    and Matthew Battles note the variety of data generated in contemporary libraries
                    this way: <quote rend="inline">Every time a book is taken off the shelf, a file
                        is downloaded, or a computer workstation is booted up, a story is told, and
                        cataloged, and filed away in a database. In this way, each act of reading in
                        the library broadcasts a handful of seeds, from which new growths of data
                        will either spring — or disappear into a forest of statistical noise</quote>
                    <ptr target="#schnapp2014" loc="126"/>. Schnapp and Battles highlight how public
                    libraries, like many institutions, are data-rich but information-poor; they
                    remind us that much of the content in library databases is left fallow from lack
                    of tools or budget or both; in turn, they challenge us to imagine new
                    architectures and algorithms for libraries when, in the age of search, we find
                    both literally and figuratively that <quote rend="inline">there is no
                        shelf</quote>

                        account of the distinction between browsing and search and the latter’s
                        success: <quote rend="inline">One reason Google was adopted so quickly when
                            it came along is that Google understood there is no shelf, and that
                            there is no file system</quote>

                <p>What follows is a report on one attempt to describe, and remedy, some aspects of
                    this condition. This essay is about one of the largest and longest running mass
                    reading programs of the past two decades, <title rend="quotes">One Book One
                        Chicago</title> (OBOC), sponsored by the 80-branch Chicago Public Library
                    (CPL) system since the fall of 2001. Our project works with anonymized CPL
                    circulation data from this program and data of several other types to ask with
                    tools of data science, can we capture and model some of the salient
                    relationships of texts, readers, and their environment, particularly when a city
                    assigns itself mass-mediated public interactions with literary works? The
                    Chicago Public Library’s goals with OBOC are civic as well as cultural, and
                    capturing the effects of the program at metropolitan scale might even show how
                    DH tools and methods might inform social policy. <quote rend="inline">Can cities
                        save the world?</quote> political scientist Benjamin R. Barber asked (and
                    answered affirmatively) in his 2013 study of city-scale planning experiments,
                        <title rend="italic">If Mayors Ruled the World</title>. Because of their
                    more manageable scale and integrated governance structures, Barber argues that
                    in both developed and developing nations cities have become <quote rend="inline"
                        >democracy's best hope</quote>
                    <ptr target="#barber2013" loc="3"/>. OBOC is a complex city-scale cultural
                    phenomenon and study of it offers a means of capturing and quantifying how
                    broad-spectrum civic programs have differential impact upon a heterogeneous
                    population. </p>
                <p>A major goal of the Reading Chicago Reading project (RCR) is to create open
                    source tools so that public librarians and digital humanists can experiment with
                    the kinds of predictive insight presently being generated by proprietary
                    software in the film and music industries and for mass market book sales <ptr

                            <ptr target="#ard2013"/>. </note> We have created the first instance of
                    such a predictive model, and in what follows we will report about how it works.
                    We also discuss findings and limitations of our data and methods to date. The
                    first half of the essay explains why CPL’s OBOC program is notable in itself and
                    conducive for modeling purposes, and the second half documents creation of our
                    models, their underlying data, and the results. To anticipate a bit, we chose
                    Chicago Public Library’s <title rend="quotes">One Book One Chicago</title>
                    program because its prior seasons constitute useful training data and its
                    current and future programs (i.e. different book selections) provide new data
                    for the model which can be tested for the same areas in the same city. Our model
                    predicts the annual circulation of a chosen book for every CPL branch; it is, as
                    far as we know, the first attempt to combine tools of literary sociology and
                    data science for city-scale prediction of this kind. Matthew Jockers noted with
                    regret just a few years ago that <quote rend="inline">[t]he conclusions we reach
                        as literary scholars are rarely <q>testable</q> in the way that scientific
                        conclusions are testable. And the conclusions we reach as literary scholars
                        are rarely <q>repeatable</q> in the way that scientific experiments are
                        repeatable</quote>
                    <ptr target="#jockers2013" loc="6"/>. But the Reading Chicago Reading project
                    captures the repeating traces of literary readership across a city by means of
                    public library data and several other forms of information. In this way, our
                    project offers an opportunity to formulate repeatable, testable, hypotheses
                    about real-world reading culture at city-scale.</p>
                <p>The Reading Chicago Reading project is also creating a growing archive about a
                    notable large-scale program of elective reading and related social media,
                    reminding us at the same time of the importance of documenting internet-mediated
                    cultural programs. The stakes are high: if born-digital and mixed digital/analog
                    phenomena such as the <title rend="quotes">One Book One Chicago</title> program
                    are not captured in a timely manner they are likely to pass beyond any practical
                    means of recovery by future researchers. Since reconstruction of
                    internet-mediated culture requires hardware and software beyond the means of all
                    but the most attentive and well-resourced archivers, <quote rend="inline">[t]he
                        first few decades of the online revolution are already set to be a dark ages
                        of sorts</quote>
                    <ptr target="#weber2016" loc="55"/>. This essay is one of several forthcoming
                    from project researchers and presents initial results of our practice of
                    combining multiple forms of investigation — time-series analysis, social media
                    analytics, location extraction from texts and maps, sentiment analysis, and text
                    measures — to analyze an ongoing program in one of the United States’ largest
                    public library systems. While <title rend="quotes">One Book One Chicago</title>
                    forms an opportune starting point, we expect that our models and techniques can
                    be applied to library holdings generally.<note>Visualizations, code notebooks,

                    requests, and the like are also possible), social media data (gathered via API),

                    the cultural pulse of a large city be captured quantitatively and modeled by way

                <head>Project description</head>
                <p>The <title rend="quotes">Reading Chicago Reading</title> project began in
                    discussions about the possibility of capturing and predicting library-sponsored
                    readership across Chicago by means of the OBOC program. It was apparent to the
                    project’s founders that the program resembled a repeating and repeatable
                    experiment – that is, each chosen OBOC book season represented a data probe into
                    library usage and, by extension, a window onto the elective reading behavior of
                    the patrons of a major American library system. The project’s motivating
                    hypothesis was that book checkouts per branch, combined with library branch
                    demographics, promotional activities, and chosen text characteristics would
                    constitute variables that could be used to predict patron response to future
                    OBOC books, and one of our key tasks has been to encode these variables into a
                    predictive model and use the modeling process to discover relationships between
                    them. A <q>one book</q> program is a repeating mixture of personal and
                    collective experience with some slow-changing variables (e.g. number of library
                    branches and general neighborhood demographics) as well as periodically-changing
                    input such as text features of the annual book selection (e.g. reading
                    difficulty and total word count) and publicity around the book, all of which
                    drives patron interest and potentially library branch checkout numbers. </p>
                <p>The <title rend="quotes">One Book One Chicago</title> (OBOC) program is also a
                    useful optic for observing how readers engage with texts in different ways
                    across quite variegated social space. Reading of course happens in a number of
                    modes, from silent reading of printed books in armchairs (a diminishing
                    practice, we suspect) to partially-solitary reading via electronic devices on
                    public transit or in coffee shops, to fully public reading and associated
                        <q>engagement</q> via blogging, posting on Goodreads and Amazon, and
                    participation in book clubs. People who read also like to talk about what and
                    how and why they read; they document books both good and bad, next choices,
                    reflections, recommendations, and the like.<note>And importantly, on Goodreads,
                        LibraryThing, and shared Zotero groups, people publicize taste in ways that
                        make their reading visible to social media analysis methods. As Nakamura
                        points out, <quote rend="inline">Goodreads invites readers to navigate not
                            in books but in its catalog, to create new catalogs, and to enjoy other

                    heterogeneous social spaces bleed over into complex media spaces. For example,
                    uptake of narrative through audio rather than sight is a rapidly growing
                    phenomenon, and the explosion of transmedia fanfiction and other forms of
                        <q>post-press</q> literature extend the reading and writing process ever
                        farther.<note>On audiobooks, see <ptr target="#rubery2016"/> and <ptr

                    mainstreaming of such programs. Book clubs have existed for decades, of course,
                    with roots in the United States reaching back to the first circulating libraries

                    discuss a literary work as a public, a book program seeks to create a virtual,
                    temporary, community for mass, but not similar, responses among people who might
                    not otherwise become entangled together in real (or virtual) life. Many CPL
                    patrons might read Saul Bellow’s <title rend="italic">Adventures of Augie
                        March</title> (fall 2011 OBOC season) or Jane Austen’s <title rend="italic"
                        >Pride and Prejudice</title> (spring 2005 OBOC season); perhaps a notable
                    fraction of the city’s population will take up the selected work in some manner
                    over the city’s season. But the result of this programming is not, and indeed
                    cannot be, the diffusion of a single opinion or the creation of consensus as if
                    participants were linked by a newsfeed or social media account pointed to the
                    same content. A city-scale book club, this is to say, fosters a different brand
                    of imagined community: a sponsored, and collective, experience moving together
                    in shared time but in the service not of homogeneity of intellectual outcome but
                    rather an improvisatory and unpredictable detachment from parochialism. In this
                    way, the community fostered by a library system’s one book program both
                    preserves, and departs from, what Anderson described as the normative uses of

                    witness <title rend="quotes">Open Data Book Clubs</title> in Canada, for
                    example, for which city data sets are assigned monthly; still other kinds of
                    collective library experience are indeed possible.<note>

                        should also note the growing variety of materials circulated to patrons.
                        Seattle Public Library, for example, created a wifi hotspot checkout program

                    literary fiction has formed the bulk of reading selections for programs such as
                    OBOC. Literary fiction was the standard against which other forms of reading was
                    measured in several NEA studies since the early 2000s <ptr target="#nea2004"/>

                        >Science</title> found that literary fiction, with its requirement of
                    attentive engagement with subjective states, unpredictable events, and complex
                    characters, revealed statistically significant benefits in measures of <quote

                    <ptr target="#kidd2013" loc="380"/>. In addition, literary fiction requires

                    The predominance of literary fiction in One Book One Community programs around
                    the U.S. bears this out. Helpfully, the Library of Congress has documented
                    hundreds of programs and their book choices across the U.S. as part of its
                        <title rend="quotes">Big Read</title> initiative. While the data is
                    incomplete in at least one major case (stopping at the 2007 season for Chicago’s
                    OBOC, for example), it lists over 2000 community programs and just over 860 book
                    choices stretching from Seattle in 1998 to Santa Monica in 2016. The most
                    popular book choices include predictable popular titles such as <title
                        rend="italic">To Kill a Mockingbird</title> (90 times), Bradbury’s <title
                        rend="italic">Fahrenheit 451</title> (50 times), Hosseini’s <title
                        rend="italic">The Kite Runner</title> (48 times), and Homer Hickam’s <title
                        rend="italic">Rocket Boys</title> (38 times). A second tier of popular
                    choices includes canonical classics such as <title rend="italic">Moby
                        Dick</title>, <title rend="italic">Pride and Prejudice</title>, <title
                        rend="italic">A Doll’s House</title>, <title rend="italic">A Long Day’s
                        Journey into Night</title>, and <title rend="italic">Frankenstein</title>,
                    but also a great deal of middlebrow fiction and nonfiction by the likes of
                    Barbara Kingsolver, Mitch Albom, Mark Haddon, Eric Schlosser, and Barbara
                    Ehrenreich. There is a marked presence of genre fiction, particularly science
                    fiction and thrillers; some unexpected choices might include Loudon County
                    Virginia’s selection of Nikki Giovanni’s poetry (2010), Richard Dawkin’s <title
                        rend="italic">The Selfish Gene</title> (by Kansas City, MO in 2008), and

                <p>We should also note, however, that the forms of difference readers may encounter
                    in the OBOC’s selected books’ represented worlds — social, ethnic, racial,
                    sexual, and the like — do not of course guarantee additional or positive
                    encounters with such difference in life. Chicago is a highly segregated city, as
                    it has been for generations, and this is reflected in the hard facts of
                    branch-area demography around the city. We are also aware of the notable fact,
                    quantified in Robert J. Sampson’s PHDCN research, that Chicago neighborhoods
                    with a higher density of community organizations tend to maintain that density
                    over time, in effect enabling residents in some parts of the city to wield
                    outsize influence in cultural impact (though spillover effects into contiguous
                    neighborhoods were also notable) [see <ref target="#sampson2012" loc="179–233"
                        >Sampson 2012, 179-233</ref>]. And reading for pleasure has a history; it is
                    not a practice evenly distributed across spaces and publics. As Elizabeth Long
                    noted in her study of book clubs in Houston, Texas, <quote rend="inline"
                        >American popular culture marks leisure reading by both class and

                <head>Why Chicago?</head>
                <p>The origin of the city-wide <q>one book</q> program appears to be in 1998, when
                    librarians Nancy Pearl and Chris Higashi at the Seattle Public Library sought
                    ways harness the collective energy of the many small book clubs scattered around
                    the city. They formulated their initial program as a question — <q>What if all
                        Seattle read the same book?</q> — and chose Russell Banks’ <title
                        rend="italic">The Sweet Hereafter</title> as the object of citywide
                    discussion groups in libraries and private homes. Pearl and Higashi reported the
                    idea at a meeting of the American Library Association, and by 2002 the ALA
                    distributed <q>how to</q> packets for library systems willing to try the new
                    idea. Nan Alleman at the Chicago Public Library read a <title rend="italic"
                        >Chicago Tribune</title> article about Seattle’s program and quickly
                    launched <title rend="quotes">One Book One Chicago</title> in the fall of 2001
                    with the city assigned to read together Harper Lee’s novel <title rend="italic"
                        >To Kill A Mockingbird</title>. CPL branches stocked hundreds of additional
                    copies of the book and discussions were scheduled throughout the fall in
                    branches across the city. The Chicago Public Library received extended press
                    coverage that enabled the idea to scale quickly.<note>

                </p>
                <p>Chicago city government was immediately committed to the program. Initiated with
                    fanfare by Mayor Richard M. Daley in the fall of 2001, and evolving in concert
                    with other major public projects like Millenium Park (completed in 2004), the
                    OBOC program is now a central node in cultural programming in Chicago. In the
                    wake of the first season, Mayor Richard M. Daley called Chicago’s public library
                    system a <quote rend="inline">community anchor</quote> and the <quote
                        rend="inline">heartbeat</quote> of its neighborhoods <ptr
                        target="#putnam2003" loc="38"/>. Daley’s comments in the program guide for
                    Willa Cather's <title rend="italic">My Antonia</title> (the OBOC choice for fall
                    2002) announced lofty civic goals: <quote rend="inline">One Book, One Chicago
                        cultivates a culture of reading and discussion by bringing our diverse city
                        together around one great book. Reading great literature inspires us to
                        think about ourselves, our environment and our relationships. Talking about
                        great literature with friends, family and neighbors can add richness and
                        depth to the experience of reading.</quote> OBOC seasons created a dramatic
                    impact in the city. In 2001-2, Harper Lee’s <title rend="italic">To Kill a
                        Mockingbird</title>
                    <quote rend="inline">was checked out of branch libraries more than eight
                        thousand times over the course of a few months. Bookstores sold thousands

                    <ptr target="#putnam2003" loc="51"/>.</p>
                <p>The program seemed to fulfill its mission of bringing new engagement into
                    metropolitan cultural events in the aftermath of the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks
                    and the inauguration of new conversations about citizenship and cultural
                    difference. Taking part in a shared narrative took on new meaning and amplified
                    a sense of collective purpose. When asked about the “One Book” program, a
                    15-year-old African-American student in Chicago told interviewers <quote

                    <ptr target="#fuller2013" loc="231"/>. Chicago’s program has been successful
                    close to twenty years now and continues, at the time of writing, with Elizabeth
                    Kolbert’s nonfiction book <title rend="italic">The Sixth Extinction</title> and
                    a city-wide theme of <q>Climate Change.</q> One Book programs have many benefits
                    and few liabilities for all involved: book publishers sell more books (since not
                    all city residents will wait to check it out from a branch library); public
                    libraries receive additional foot traffic and community relevance; citizens
                    become active in a civic experience with cultural capital. In a publicity
                    statement for the 2016-17 program centered on Barbara Kingsolver’s <title
                        rend="italic">Animal Vegetable Miracle: A Year of Food Life</title>, Mayor
                    Rahm Emanuel and CPL Commissioner Brian Bannon noted that the choice was
                    intended as a catalyst for city-wide conversations about food, politics,
                    heritage, and the environment. <quote rend="inline">From October through May
                        2017, One Book, One Chicago will explore a central theme — <q>Eat Think
                            Grow</q> — with citywide programming focused on cultural cuisine,
                        cooking, eating, sustainability and urban farming. From seed, to grocery, to
                        cookbook, to table — we’re discussing all the ways we relate to and
                        celebrate food. … Branch libraries host highlighted programs such as
                        culinary walking tours, urban gardening discussions, and food talks about
                        beer, bees, coffee and the Slow Food Chicago movement.</quote></p>
                <p>As elective literary reading and related events, OBOC participation is cast as a
                    means toward better historical and personal insight into the lives of others.
                    The ideal of a program like OBOC is collective practices of learning and
                    world-widening through mediated discussion of that reading as well as
                    participation in live events. The OBOC’s annual repetition makes it resemble a
                    city art biennial, and its overall experience is not unlike a fusion of book
                    clubs, continuing ed classes, social media updates, and TED talks. People
                    participate in a number of ways, not all centered on reading. In fact, the CPL
                    slogan that <quote rend="inline">the book is just the beginning</quote> is apt.
                    OBOC programming itself has changed over the past 15-plus years, shifting from
                    three-month programs centered on print book discussion <q>clubs</q> at physical
                    CPL branches to nine-month seasons for which the assigned book is just one
                    element, a teaser or <q>loss leader</q> as it were, for other civic initiatives,
                    many of them digital. Figure 1 shows just some of the dozens of events around
                    the city created in association with the 2018/19 OBOC book choice, Philip K.

                <p>The variety of activities and media shown in Figure 1 also reveals why a large
                    city-wide <q>One Book</q> program requires dedicated sponsors and culture
                    workers. In <title rend="italic">Making Literature Now</title>, Amy
                    Hungerford calls for attention to the non-profit organization employees and
                    public library staff who plan and implement experiences with contemporary
                    literature. These <quote rend="inline">evangelists of culture</quote>, as <ptr
                        target="#griswold2015"/> describe them, include Jennifer Lizak, CPL’s OBOC
                    director, and around her the wider set of Chicago Public Library community
                    outreach staff who create and facilitate programming across the city. Hungerford
                    writes that these <quote rend="inline"><q>neglected agents</q> of cultural
                        formation not only play a crucial role in the cultural field but also
                        constitute a set of actors for whom literary or artistic production matters
                        beyond the moment of ordinary consumption</quote>
                    <ptr target="#hungerford2016" loc="38"/>. Culture brokers play a shaping role in
                    the formation of the imagined community of a One Book program; but their choices
                    of texts, as Griswold and Wohl show, tend to be based on hunches about
                    demographic representativity (of authors, of branch behavior, of book topics)
                    and reports about past book group success elsewhere. Tools of data science have
                    not been an option. The decision-making process to make a Chicago Public Library
                    OBOC selection requires several months of meetings, involves multiple parts of
                    the library and the city bureaucracy, and is opaque to outsiders. As might be
                    suspected, choice of a One Book One Chicago text is not based on generalizable
                    criteria of sales, text length, genre, canonicity, or publication date. As we
                    saw above (and see <ref target="#appendix01">Appendix 1</ref>), CPL OBOC choices
                    since 2001 have been quite varied — and yet a few tendencies can be discerned in
                    most One Book programs nationwide: a tendency to favor living authors,
                    especially those able to present their work at public readings, and a tendency,

                <p>One of the challenges of digital humanities research is the assembly of
                    appropriate data sources. <title rend="quotes">Reading Chicago Reading</title>
                    combines data about people, about books, and about their interactions through a
                    public library system and associated social media. We bring together a diverse
                    set of data sources, each with its own history, complexities, and caveats. While
                    we can be sensitive to these nuances, algorithms by their nature cannot, and
                    consequently treat all data as equally valid and reflective of some real-world
                    quantity or property. Such limitations of our CPL data are therefore limitations
                    of our conclusions as well and need to be fully unpacked. We will be using the
                    terminology in Table 1 in this discussion and in the analysis below.</p>

                    <head>OBOC selections (2011-2016)</head>
                    <p>Since fall 2001, the One Book One Chicago program has selected over two dozen
                        books. (See the full list of titles in <ref target="#appendix01">Appendix
                            1</ref>.) Roughly half are novels, but the set also includes several
                        short story collections (O’Brien, Lahiri, Li), two novellas (Solzhenitsyn,
                        Cisneros) and two plays (Hansberry, Miller). Non-fiction and historical
                        works, especially those with a connection to Chicago, play a notable part in
                        the list (Dybek, Smith, Dyja, Wilkerson, and Kot). Most of the works date
                        from after World War II, and just under half from the past two decades.
                        Several OBOC book choices reflect the multiple communities in Chicago,
                        White, Black, Latino, and Asian; 18 of 29 (62%) authors are male. Our data
                        set encompasses books from seasons running 2011 to 2016 — the years for
                        which we have CPL circulation data. <note> Circulation data prior to 2011
                            was lost in a CPL software migration and is unrecoverable. </note> From

                    <head>Definition of an OBOC season</head>
                    <p>As noted earlier, CPL’s management of OBOC events has evolved over its nearly
                        20-year history. For the purposes of our project, the biggest discontinuity
                        appears at the very beginning of our data set. 2012 was the last year that
                        two seasons were held in one calendar year (i.e. fall and spring). <title
                            rend="italic">Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</title> in spring 2012 followed
                        directly on the heels of the <title rend="italic">Augie March</title> fall
                        2011 season. <title rend="italic">The Book Thief</title> was then featured
                        in the fall of 2012. The next selection, <title rend="italic">The Warmth of
                            Other Suns</title>, was launched one full year later in the fall of 2013
                        as CPL moved to a one-book-per-year schedule. In this case, at least, we
                        were presented with a problem of how to define an OBOC “season.” Our data
                        showed, for example, that the fall 2011 selection <title rend="italic">Augie
                            March</title> was still being checked out at a significantly higher rate
                        at many branches more than one year after its selection compared to the
                        months prior to its announcement as an OBOC selection — and all despite the
                        fact that another OBOC season and book had been launched in the meantime.
                        This finding suggested that a 12-month span was a reasonable choice for a
                        season length, even for the books chosen bi-annually. We therefore use
                        library transaction data over the 12 months following a book’s selection. As
                        a baseline for the circulation of a book prior to its OBOC selection, we use
                        the six months of city-wide transactions prior to the book's launch. The
                        reason for this choice is again contingent on circumstances beyond our
                        control: due to CPL’s data migration in mid-2011, we only have data for six
                        months prior to the launch of <title rend="italic">Augie March</title>. For
                        consistency, we define prior circulation for all the books in the same
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>The next question is how to define the season duration for each book. For
                        almost all seasons, the identity of the book remained secret until a defined
                            <q>launch</q> day, where a public announcement would be made by the
                        Chicago Public Library and (sometimes) the Mayor’s office. However, the
                        identity of the fall 2012 selection, <title rend="italic">The Book
                            Thief</title>, was leaked in newspaper reporting and then subsequently
                        confirmed by the Chicago Public Library in the spring of that year, making
                        the choice known for many months prior to the official launch. In this case,
                        we were confronted with a number of choices, none entirely satisfactory.
                            <title rend="italic">The Book Thief</title> data could have been
                        discarded. However, we were reluctant to do this as our set of seasons was
                        already limited by CPL data availability – losing 1/7th of the total
                        circulation data would have made our analytic tasks and modeling more
                        difficult and uncertain. We could have stuck with the <q>official</q> launch
                        date, and in fact, some of our early analyses were conducted in this mode.
                        Doing so, however, creates an uncharacteristic early <q>bump</q> in what
                        would be considered prior circulation for this title. In Chicago, <title
                            rend="italic">The Book Thief</title> became a popular summer reading
                        title well before its fall launch, a phenomenon that denied us a clean
                        demarcation of “before” and “after launch” circulation. By elimination,
                        then, we have chosen to use April 30, 2012 (the date the <title
                            rend="italic">Chicago Sun-Times</title> inadvertently “announced” the
                        next book) although its official launch by CPL was in September. A
                        consequence of this complexity is that this book has remained a stubborn
                        outlier in many of our analyses. One can see in Figure 2 below how <title
                            rend="italic">The Book Thief</title>’s circulation (label BT, blue line)
                        differs from the other six in its delay from our x-axis zero <q>launch</q>
                        point:</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The time series shown in Figure 2 allows us to grasp the effects of promotion
                        by CPL. One can see that in most cases after an initial burst of interest
                        (i.e. checkouts) created by the launch date, the checkout totals decline
                        sharply, for instance see <title rend="italic">Augie March</title> (green
                        line) and <title rend="italic">Animal Vegetable Miracle</title> (orange
                        line). Other books present different results in their city-wide checkout
                        totals: Dyja’s <title rend="italic">Third Coast</title> (yellow line) has
                        notable swings up and down, as does <title rend="italic">The Book
                            Thief</title>. Isabel Wilkerson’s <title rend="italic">Warmth of Other
                            Suns</title> (beige line) has no major launch-date “bump,” but
                        intriguingly keeps a steady background level of checkouts while also
                        increasing in circulation over the following year. (By contrast, OBOC books
                        typically witness overall declines in circulation after the launch
                        date.)</p>
                    <p>In future work we will examine in detail the meaning of these checkout
                        numbers, here totaled for all branches but capable of being disaggregated
                        and plotted for each CPL branch. We are interested in the differences in
                        checkouts over time per branch, of course, but one can see even with
                        city-wide totals that after official CPL launches, different OBOC titles
                        have different spikes of secondary or tertiary interest. What drives the
                        later increases in checkouts of these titles? Live programming and social
                        media, we suspect, are crucial factors: an author reads the book at a
                        library event or posts about it (Kingsolver for instance has a large social
                        media footprint), or other City of Chicago tie-in events note the book
                        and/or the season’s theme. In a forthcoming paper about the 2015-16 season
                        (Dyja’s <title rend="italic">The Third Coast</title>), we have correlated
                        records of CPL-sponsored events, checkout data, and social media about the
                        OBOC program (via Twitter API) to show in detail and at branch-level how the
                        social word of reading culture does and does not drive book circulation
                        totals throughout the city.</p>

                <head>Library checkout data</head>
                <p>We obtained two types of library data from CPL.<note> Note that these data sets
                        are subject to non-disclosure agreements, and we are not able to distribute
                        them. </note> As indicated above, we were able to obtain CPL transaction
                    data — a history of how individual volumes were processed in the library system.
                    Because of inconsistencies in how the data was queried, and a second data
                    migration occurring more recently, we have all transactions data for some books
                    and only checkouts for others. (The larger set of CPL transaction types
                    includes, in addition to checkouts and returns, inter-branch transfers,
                    renewals, book losses, and holds.) In our preliminary examination of this data
                    we found that all types of branch-level transactions were heavily correlated
                    with branch checkouts, and therefore we have used only checkouts in our analysis
                    below. Our circulation modeling is limited to paperback, hardcover, audio CD
                    copies as well as <q>book club in a bag</q> kits (see explanation below), and
                    these constitute the vast majority of patron transactions. Although we did have
                    e-book checkouts available, given that we are interested in analyzing
                    differences in checkouts between branches and given that virtual checkouts
                    cannot be associated with one branch, the analysis of e-book transactions is
                    outside of the scope of this paper. Data that would have been helpful to have
                    available is the information about readers participating in OBOC events after
                    purchasing their own copies of the books. We do know from early coverage of the
                        program<note>See <ptr target="#putnam2003" loc="51"/>.</note> that OBOC
                    selection does drive metro area bookstore sales of the title to some extent, but
                    a study of book purchasing behavior is beyond the scope of the present
                    study.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Library holdings data</head>
                <p>The second type of data is holdings data recording the number of OBOC books
                    available at each branch library. This data is a series of transactions
                    indicating when each OBOC volume was added to the inventory of a branch library,
                    or accessioned: volume ID, branch, and date. In theory, from this data we would
                    know how many books were on the shelf at each branch at the moment that the OBOC
                    book was launched. However, the holdings data that we have indicates only when a
                    book was added to the collection at a particular branch. In some but not all
                    OBOC events, branches assembled <q>book club in a bag</q> kits containing eight
                    copies of the chosen text for convenient single checkout. In some branches,
                    these were treated as a single unit and not accessioned until broken out of the
                    bags at the end of the OBOC season. In other cases, the books in the bag were
                    available for separate checkout. The inconsistent treatment of these club bags
                    meant that <q>holdings at the date of launch</q> is not a consistent
                    representation of how many books a patron might have seen at a given branch
                    during the season. Our compromise has been to count every copy accessioned by a
                    CPL branch, regardless of date, under the assumption that the moment of the
                        <title rend="quotes">One Book</title> event would by necessity be the moment
                    of peak holdings for the chosen title. This way, the “broken out” books are
                    treated uniformly for purposes of holdings calculations.</p>

                <head>Demographic data</head>
                <p>The Chicago Public Library has eighty branches scattered throughout a large and
                    diverse metropolis well known for its history of segregation. To understand how
                    different groups are participating in OBOC events, we need to associate
                    demographics with the branch transactions that form our core data. For important
                    privacy reasons, CPL – like other public libraries – does not retain patron
                    information associated with book circulation after a book has been returned. The
                    transaction data is therefore fully anonymous and there are not even
                    “pseudonymous identifiers” that could be used, for example, to identify accounts
                    that have participated in multiple OBOC events. In the absence of more detailed
                    information about branch library users, we use data from the U.S. Census
                    American Community Survey (ACS) for the area surrounding each branch. Census
                    data is aggregated by tracts containing approximately 4,000 individuals. We used
                    a simple geographical rule to associate tracts with branch libraries. </p>
                <p>Each of Chicago's 866 census tract was associated with the branch library in
                    closest geographical proximity, recognizing that this simple approach is only an
                    approximation of complex patron usage patterns. Technically, this rule was
                    realized through the construction of Voronoi polygons defined by the locations
                    of each branch. A Voronoi polygon is defined by n points {p1, .. p n} and
                    consists of n polygons {P1, …, Pn} where the points interior to polygon Pk are
                    closer to point pk than to any other point. Census tracts fully contained in a
                    particular polygon were assigned to the closest branch. Those that spanned
                    multiple polygons were assigned to all intersecting polygons on the assumption
                    that users equidistant from multiple branches might spread their visits across
                    these branches. </p>
                <p>Figure 3 shows these branches and their associated polygons. (Branch codes and
                    names are given in <ref target="#appendix02">Appendix 2</ref>.)</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Our analysis was complicated by the special status of three branches. One is
                    CPL’s iconic central downtown Harold Washington Library Center (branch code H0),
                    which is intended to serve the entire city and not just a single local
                    neighborhood (i.e. the Loop). Harold Washington Library Center is also host to
                    dozens of OBOC events every season, and always the highest profile ones (i.e.
                    author readings). The CPL system also has two <q>regional</q> library centers:
                    Woodson (branch code W1) and Sulzer (branch code S1), located on the city’s
                    south and north sides, respectively. As with Harold Washington, these regional
                    branches are intended to serve large segments of the city and not just an
                    immediate neighborhood area. We considered various methods of handling these
                    larger branches, including treating them on par with neighborhood branches,
                    thereby ignoring their special status and greater geographic reach. In the end,
                    however, we chose to treat these branches as having service areas overlapping
                    with the neighborhood system. Harold Washington is represented by city-wide
                    aggregate demographics and the two regional branches are represented as a
                    separate <q>system</q> of two polygons for the halves of the city that they
                    cover.</p>
                <p>With the assignment of tracts to branches complete, we could then calculate
                    aggregate demographics for each branch. The American Community Survey contains
                    approximately 180 variables reflecting a wide variety of social indicators,
                    including race, age, type of employment, average rent paid, commuting patterns,
                    and many others.<note>Our OBOC seasons span seven years in the history of
                        Chicago, 2011-2017, and the demographics of the city were certainly not
                        constant during that time. The ACS data we used is from 2015. Yearly
                        fluctuations in demographic composition of different neighborhoods before
                        and after that time are not reflected in our analysis.</note> To capture
                    large-scale demographic variation across branches, we used principal component
                    analysis (PCA) to create a set of projected dimensions capturing the largest
                    proportion of variance in the ACS data over our polygonal regions. The core
                    concept behind PCA is that a high-dimensional data set may have internal
                    regularities that make some dimensions essentially redundant. For example, it
                    may be that property values and rent are highly correlated. The data set needs
                    only to retain one of these features to capture information about the relative
                    wealth of different regions. PCA takes this concept one step further by creating
                    new dimensions that are linear combinations of the existing ones. Such projected
                    dimensions can be difficult to interpret, but they have the benefit of being
                    mutually orthogonal, meaning that they have no overlap in the aspects of the
                    data that they represent. From our PCA decomposition of the census, we
                    identified seven factors that account for 85% of the variation in the
                    demographic data. Of these, the first four account for 75%, meaning that if a
                    neighborhood is represented by just these dimensions, rather than the original
                    180, the demographic information will differ from the true value by no more than
                    25%. </p>
                <p>To gain an understanding of the consequences of these features for the library
                    regions, we performed unsupervised clustering of the branches based on their
                    demographic characteristics. We used the Partitioning Around Medioids (PAM)
                    algorithm [Kaufman 1990], which is known to be more robust to noise and outliers
                    compared to the more widely-used k-means algorithm. PAM is more
                    computationally-intensive than k-means, but for our small data set, this was not
                    a significant drawback. We explored various combinations of cluster counts and
                    selected features, using the silhouette metric to discriminate between the
                    different choices. Our final set of five clusters was created using the top
                    eight principal components and had an average silhouette width of 0.3. Figure 4
                    shows these clusters, and includes patterns perhaps familiar to students of the
                    segregated history of Chicago. A number of “near-north” neighborhoods with
                    higher property values are found in cluster 5. Surrounding them in cluster 2 are
                    diverse neighborhoods with many rental property units. Majority African-American
                    areas on the south and west sides of the city are grouped in cluster 4. Hispanic
                    areas are found mostly in cluster 3. Cluster 1 is the so-called <q>bungalow
                        belt</q> of historic ethnic neighborhoods, now occupied by a diverse mix of
                    residents, distinguished from some of the other areas by a higher rate of home
                    ownership — note the inclusion of Chicago’s Chinatown (CN branch) in this group.
                    The three regional libraries are treated as a single separate cluster for
                    analysis.</p>

                <head>Textual measures data</head>
                <p>Our last key data source is textual measures of the books themselves. In this,
                    our project differs from much prior work using quantitative methods of full-text
                    analysis in several ways. One major difference is the great heterogeneity of the
                    texts in our corpus: our text set contains both fiction and non-fiction, and
                    ranges from a modernist novel to short stories to a young adult title and (in
                    the non-fiction) from a food memoir replete with actual recipes documenting a
                    single year to the scholarly works of Wilkerson and Dyja covering decades of
                    U.S. history. The books in our set also vary widely in length, from 70,000 words
                        (<title rend="italic">Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</title>) to about 260,000 words
                        (<title rend="italic">Augie March</title>), and in other stylistic measures
                    such as type-token ratio and sentence length, as will be shown below.</p>
                <p>We should also note that all of the recent OBOC works are in copyright — indeed,
                    only Bellow’s <title rend="italic">Augie March</title> is more than 20 years
                    old. Because of the small size of our collection, it was possible to use text
                    extracted from ePub files. However, this would not be feasible at larger scale,
                    and the only option for full-text processing at scale is the Data Capsule
                    feature of the HathiTrust Research Center<note>
                        <ref target="https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc"
                            >https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc</ref>. </note> which offers
                    computational access to in-copyright texts. When we began our analysis, only
                    four of our seven selections were available in the HathiTrust digital library
                    data capsule: <title rend="italic">Augie March</title> (AM), <title
                        rend="italic">Book Thief</title> (BT), <title rend="italic">Kavalier and
                        Clay</title> (KC), and <title rend="italic">Gold Boy Emerald Girl</title>
                    (GB). We added additional files to the data capsule to complete the set: <title
                        rend="italic">Warmth of Other Suns</title> (WS), <title rend="italic">Third
                        Coast</title> (TC), and <title rend="italic">Animal, Vegetable,
                        Miracle</title> (AV). With these additions, it was possible to apply
                    non-consumptive analysis to all seven of works in Table 1 within the HathiTrust
                    data capsule environment.</p>

                <head>Analysis</head>
                <p>There are many kinds of analysis we might undertake with these various data
                    sources. In this article, we discuss our work to model normalized branch-level
                    circulation. Such a model will ultimately enable predictive insight into
                    correlations of city-wide book checkouts and city-wide OBOC book
                        promotion.<note> We have conducted some analysis of other aspects of our
                        data such as the time-varying patterns of circulation and the interaction
                        between promotion events and circulation, but we will not discuss these
                        results here. </note> Total circulation would seem an obvious, and
                    straightforward choice as a measure of popularity. However, we noted that CPL
                    OBOC book holdings varied widely across branches and a circulation value of 100
                    would have a very different meaning for a branch with 10 copies as opposed to a
                    branch with 50 copies. Checkouts per holding would have been a logical
                    alternative, but we found that some branches (typically smaller ones) had no
                    copies of some OBOC titles, rendering this statistic meaningless. Our
                    alternative normalization is to calculate circulation per thousand visitors.
                    Because we found visitor count to be very closely correlated with OBOC holdings,
                    this statistic closely tracks circulation per copy.<note> Indeed, library staff
                        confirmed that branch activity was a key factor in the distribution of OBOC
                        volumes across branches. </note> From the City of Chicago Data Portal we
                    obtained the visitor <q>gate counts</q> for all CPL branches for the year
                    containing the book’s launch. Visitor counts typically change less than 10% from
                    year to year, except when there is a major change to the physical plant such as
                    new construction.</p>
                <p>One plausible hypothesis regarding OBOC circulation might be that the book choice
                    is irrelevant to patron participation. One could imagine a relatively-stable
                    cadre of devoted readers with the time and inclination to pick up whatever text
                    CPL chose to promote for each season. This would lead branches to have
                    relatively stable OBOC checkouts over the seasons studied. We analyzed
                    circulation patterns to determine whether this hypothesis might hold. Figure 5
                    shows a visualization of normalized circulation at each branch for each book.
                    The seven columns are seven seasons of OBOC 2011-17 with the book title
                    abbreviation at the foot of the column. The colors given to the two-letter
                    branch codes in each column are the colors of the six clusters we described
                    above, based on demography of neighborhoods. Note that the y axis is a
                    logarithmic scale – so for example the lowest scoring branch (DO: Douglass, just
                    west of the Loop) for the AV text has 1/100th the circulation per 1k visitors of
                    the RO (Roden, in Norwood Park) branch at the top end of the scale. We see that
                    the branches vary widely in their OBOC circulation. We also see that relative
                    interest in the OBOC book is not consistent for a particular branch from season
                    to season. For example, the DO branch is at the bottom for <title rend="italic"
                        >Animal Vegetable Miracle</title> but closer to the middle of checkout
                    totals for <title rend="italic">Augie March</title> and <title rend="italic"
                        >Warmth of Other Suns</title>. The AL branch (Albany Park, in the northwest
                    of the city) has the most normalized circulation for <title rend="italic"
                        >Kavalier and Clay</title> but is near the bottom for <title rend="italic"
                        >Book Thief</title>. Clearly, the book choice matters, and different books
                    appeal to different audiences at different branches. This is perhaps not
                    surprising, but was important to establish at this phase of the study.</p>

                <p>To understand the interaction between demography and circulation in greater
                    detail, let’s examine a single book: Thomas Dyja’s <title rend="italic">The
                        Third Coast: When Chicago Built the American Dream</title> (2013) [TC, and
                    the selection for the 2015/16 season] in relation to the first three components
                    of our principal components decomposition. Figure 6 shows a scatter plot with
                    these results. PC1 corresponds (roughly) to property value, with lower (more
                    negative) values corresponding to wealthier neighborhoods. We see a linear trend
                    with some substantial outliers: for example, CH (Chinatown branch) below the
                    trend line — i.e. wealthier (and abutting the rapidly gentrifying south loop)
                    but with lower circulation, and ED (Edgebrook) above the trend, i.e. median
                    wealth but with higher circulation. Readers familiar with Chicago neighborhoods
                    might hazard guesses about this output: despite similar wealth figures,
                    Chinatown residents near the center of Chicago were less likely to read <title
                        rend="italic">The Third Coast</title> — a book centered primarily on north
                    and south areas of the city — than far-north residents in Edgebrook. Because of
                    the limited amount of data available we cannot trim these outliers, but instead
                    must recognize that any kind of linear model will be an inexact fit. A similar
                    observation can be made for PC3, which corresponds to a combination of the
                    renter/home-owner axis and age, with lower (more negative) values corresponding
                    to more owner-occupied housing and more residents above age 35.</p>

                <p>However, PC2 is different. With this feature, we do not see an overall linear
                    trend. Rather the extremes of negative and positive are lower, and peak
                    circulation occurs at values around zero. This component corresponds to a
                    race/ethnicity spectrum with Latinx communities on the negative end of the scale
                    and African-American ones at the positive end. We experimented with various
                    transformations of the PC2 variable and ended up with the following square

                    </mml:math> values is fit for each book, enabling us to determine how the
                    relationship between neighborhood demographics and circulation varies by
                    book.</p>
                <p> A range of different models was constructed with different subsets of the
                    demographic principal components. These models were evaluated on their ability
                    to account for the existing patterns in the data, yielding the closest fit to
                    the observed data. The best fitting model is described here and included four
                    independent variables: the branch-level holdings (“Holds” in the figures),
                    principal components 1 and 3 (PC1 and PC3) and the transformed version of
                    principal component 2 as described above (PC2X).<note> The model was fit using
                        the lmer method from the lme4 package in R. Full model output can be found
                        on the project website at <ref
                            target="http://cwi.cdm.depaul.edu/~rburke/circ/multi-level-norm.html"

                    </note> Coefficients in the fitted model provide a quantitative measure of the
                    relationship between the independent variables and the circulation, as impacted
                    by the choice of book. </p>
                <p>What we learn from this model fits well with intuition gleaned from the analyses
                    above, but sharpens it to identify specific aspects of the data. Figure 8 shows
                    the coefficients learned for the demographic attributes for each OBOC book —

                    general effect associated with dimensions 1 and 3 and much smaller one for the
                    (transformed) second component. In general, then, greater wealth and greater
                    homeownership and age are correlated with OBOC participation and the particular
                    book has a smaller effect. Interestingly, this wealth effect is enhanced most
                    substantially for TC, but diluted for GB and to a lesser extent, BT.</p>
                <p>The second demographic component, which in its transformed state corresponds more
                    or less to a white+other (at zero) vs black+hispanic axis, shows more dramatic
                    variation. The overall impact of this PC2X axis is not large compared to the
                    other components (7 checkouts per season vs 30-40), but the variation relative
                    to the book choice is more significant. Note Figure 8, and the PC2X results
                    (middle third of the figure): the between-book variation follows patterns that
                    we anticipated. As might be expected for a book about the Great Migration in
                    which Chicago’s African-American community plays a large part, WS reverses the
                    otherwise largely downward trend of the axis: that is, more copies of <title
                        rend="italic">Warmth of Other Suns</title> were checked out in libraries
                    with larger black+hispanic patrons. (To a lesser extent, <title rend="italic"
                        >The Book Thief</title> also shows this phenomenon.)</p>

                    number of books assigned to a particular library branch. As expected, there is a
                    strong general effect of approximately 3 checkouts per book: it is a more
                    involved process for a patron to check out a book not currently on the shelf at
                    the branch. Some books, however, show greater <q>shelf appeal</q>, and for some,
                    like WS, this effect is negative, suggesting that patrons were sufficiently
                    interested in this title that lack of branch copies was not much of a
                    deterrent.</p>

                    strong. Choosing a book for the OBOC program will typically add more than 300
                    checkouts for a typical CPL branch over the season. Different books have, of
                    course, different levels of general interest as shown in the book-specific
                    intercepts: BT, TC, and WS were more popular than average; GB had the lowest

                <head>Circulation Modeling, Part II</head>
                <p> This first stage of modeling highlighted the heterogeneity of the book choices
                    and of the OBOC patron audience. Books have clear differences in their overall
                    appeal and in their specific appeal to different patron groups. However, this
                    finding raises the question of what features of books cause them to appeal to
                    different audiences within the city. From the start, a motive of the project has
                    been to capture quantitatively, branch by branch and over time, the differential
                    appeal and impact of literary works. We considered various types of textual
                    features that might be extracted from our texts. However, we were confronted
                    repeatedly with the challenge of the differences between the texts such as
                    length, reading level, genre, and still other traits. We needed to identify
                    features sufficiently generic that they could be extracted from any text in our
                    set — but also for any future book — in order to begin modeling
                        <q>unannounced</q> books for city-wide checkout predictions. Based on our
                    discussions with CPL staff, we hypothesized that reading <q>difficulty</q> and
                    text length would be important indicators, with some patrons less likely to pick
                    up OBOC selections that overtly present greater reading challenges. </p>

                <head>Text characteristics</head>
                <p> There are many ways to calculate a <q>reading level</q> or degree of difficulty
                    for a text or set of texts. Conventional indices of difficulty cannot tell the
                    whole story, however, as they do not take into account the subject matter or
                    the organization of the text but rely on the surface characteristics such as the
                    occurrence or absence of <q>difficult</q> words or measures of sentence length
                    <ptr target="#dawkins1956"/>. Numbers do not automatically align with the actual reading
                    experience. For example, in our first efforts in modeling we noticed that the
                    dense and allusive <title rend="italic">Adventures of Augie March</title> scored
                    lower on some measures than the relatively simple prose of Li’s <title
                        rend="italic">Gold Boy Emerald Girl</title>. Such numerical findings in
                    isolation did not, we felt, make sense of the quite different reading
                    experiences involved. To address this, rather than rely on any single text
                    measure we created a combined measure using the following four text
                    attributes:</p>
                <list type="unordered">
                    <item>Average sentence length</item>

                <p>Our text measures were obtained by running a Python-based readability program on

                    on each sample. Then we averaged over the samples to produce the reading

                    aggregate of the other four measures. We first normalized each measure so that
                    the highest-scoring book has a value of 1 and the lowest a value of 0. Although
                    still based on surface level analysis of the text, we believe that this combined
                    measure captures more accurately a book’s difficulty. Figure 11 indicates that
                        <title rend="italic">The Third Coast</title> shows the highest average
                    sentence length, Dale-Chall Index score, and Type-token ratio, and has the
                    highest combined difficulty score. Both non-fiction works in our set, <title

                        Vegetable, Miracle </title> (AV), score higher in reading difficulty and
                    therefore stand apart from novels such as <title rend="italic">The Book

                <p>The nature of place and locality in narrative has generated a lot of exciting

                    clusters of residents had stronger interest in local titles than others, and
                    this suggested to us the value of this feature. Forthcoming papers will document

                <p>Because of the aforementioned findings about the importance of location in book
                    selection decisions, we were most interested in extracting places names from the
                    texts and establishing each book’s geographic locus. But disambiguating named
                    entities of any type, including place name references, is challenging, as <ptr
                        target="#evans2018"/> and others have noted. Our approach was to use the
                    output of the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER) 3.9.1 version <ptr
                        target="#finkel2005"/>, using the default model for location extraction
                    included in the parser. Although we were working with a scanned version of the
                    text included in a digital library, we found the accuracy of this parser to be
                    acceptable for this purpose <ptr target="#rodriquez2012"/>
                    <ptr target="#atdag2013"/>. Problems arose, however, when we tried to associate
                    toponyms extracted from the text with their geocoordinates. For example,
                        <q>Odessa</q> and <q>Paris</q> can be cities in Texas or in Europe.
                    Likewise, <q>Gold Coast</q> has a specific local meaning in Chicago, but is also
                    the name of several other places around the world. Our workflow made use of the
                    Google Maps API to resolve toponyms to latitude and longitude coordinates and,
                    as might be expected, without knowledge of the literary context of each toponym,
                    the system could not resolve such ambiguities correctly in many cases. A
                    particularly evocative example we encountered was the numerous references in
                        <title rend="italic">The Third Coast</title> to the once-famous <q>Mecca</q>
                    apartment building on the south side of Chicago (immortalized in Gwendolyn
                    Brooks’s 1968 book of poetry <title rend="italic">In the Mecca</title>). The
                    Mecca building was demolished decades ago to make room for the expanding campus
                    of Illinois Tech on Chicago’s south side, but Google Maps unsurprisingly locates
                    the place name in Saudi Arabia. Ultimately, this problem was solved by the
                    manual examination and correction of each extracted toponym in its textual
                    context together with the computed geolocation. <note> We have begun work on
                        processes to automate Chicago location checking. Reference works such as
                            <ptr target="#kaser2011"/> makes this, for our subject city at least, a
                        bit easier. </note>
                </p>
                <p>A further problem with toponyms is how they occur in a hierarchy of specificity,
                    with higher levels of the hierarchy resolved by the mapping API as centroids of
                    a region. For example, the place name <q>Russia</q> yields a latitude and
                    longitude pair placed in the middle of Siberia, which is geographically correct
                    in an abstract sense, but unlikely to be the part of Russia to which any
                    particular author is referring — and certainly not Chabon in <title
                        rend="italic">Kavalier and Clay</title> [KC], from which this example is
                    taken. This problem does not admit of an easy all-purpose solution. Our simple
                    expedient was to eliminate all place names with greater than <q>city</q> extent.
                    Our rationale here is that a text gains its geographical purchase from the
                    accumulated mention of specific locations, not from references to large abstract
                    entities. To produce our locality measures, we computed the distance from each location to a zero-point centered in the Loop in downtown Chicago and averaged these distances. So that local national distances are not swamped by transcontinental ones, we took the logarithm of the value and used this as our measure of the <q>distance</q> of the text from the city. We also experimented with a
                    version of the model in which this continuous distance value was replaced with a
                    simpler binary distinction between local (that is, Chicago-centered) texts (AM,
                    TC, WS) and non-local ones (AV, BT, GB, KC), also computed using the same
                    toponyms.</p>

                <head>Predictive Model</head>
                <p>Historical circulation models offer a great deal of insight into the patterns of
                    OBOC participation, as we have seen. To ask <q>what if</q> questions about books
                    that might be chosen in the future, however, we need a different kind of model.
                    This predictive modeling task builds on the work above, which allowed us to
                    identify the most important demographic variables and get a sense of their
                    predictive utility. In effect, we are seeking to replace the discrete individual
                    books in the prior model with descriptive variables that capture some aspects of
                    the books' contents as discussed above.</p>
                <p>As with our prior methodology, the model serves multiple purposes. The ability to
                    predict with some degree of precision indicates that the variables we have
                    chosen for the model do, in fact, capture regularities associated with branch
                    circulation outcomes. This helps us have confidence that the model is in the
                    right form and has the right variables in it. The predictions coming from such a
                    model may be useful to library staff in anticipating how different book choices
                    might engage different patrons across the city. Finally, and most importantly
                    for a digital humanities audience, the importance that the model assigns to
                    different features gives us a sense of the impact of different variables on the
                    final outcome. </p>
                <p>As above, the dependent feature of our predictive circulation models is
                    normalized circulation value: that is, checkouts at a given branch per 1000
                    visitors. As we have described above, the new independent variables are:
                    combined reading difficulty score, degree of promotion (i.e. number of events at
                    branches), and locality. The values are combined with the variables from the
                    earlier analyses: three demographic variables and the number of holdings. For
                    the first model, MPrior, we added the book’s prior circulation (previous 90
                    days) at that branch. With prior circulation as an input variable, we are
                    enabling MPrior to predict the impact of the library’s selection of a particular
                    book. What, in other words, is the change in circulation pattern induced by a
                    book’s selection? This is interesting to the library, since it may make less
                    sense to pick as a <title rend="quotes">One Book</title> selection a text that
                    many people would have read anyway. But it is also interesting for our purposes
                    since it reflects the impact of the <q>civic</q> motivation of the act of book
                    selection. The model without prior circulation (MCirc) is interesting to us for
                    a different reason: with this model, we predict <term>de novo</term> what the
                    match between demographic and book characteristics might say about a book’s
                    popularity at a given branch given a particular level of investment by the
                    library system (in promotions and book holdings). </p>
                <p>The model type we chose is a boosted regression tree, an appropriate model for
                    learning the relationship between a numeric output variable and a diverse set of
                    input variables.<note> The GradientBoostingRegressor class in Python’s
                        scikit.learn package was used with parameters optimized by grid search.
                    </note> Regression tree learning is a form of decision tree learning, where the
                    system builds a complex set of decision rules, each of which is a test against
                    the values of a particular feature. For example, the top level of a decision
                    tree might ask if the value of the PC1 variable is greater than 0.5, and if so,
                    the rules on one side of the tree are applied, otherwise a different set. The
                    power of the gradient boosting algorithm is that the system iteratively
                    determines which cases in the input data generate the most error and focuses
                    additional learning on getting these predictions correct. A typical boosted
                    regression tree model might contain hundreds of such rules, knitted together in
                    a complex pattern of choices. </p>
                <p>Our model was trained and evaluated using a cross-validation technique. In each
                    step of evaluation, one OBOC season was omitted and the model was trained on the
                    other six seasons. Then the model was used to predict the missing year and the
                    error calculated. This was repeated across all seven years, and averages
                    computed across all years. The average mean absolute error for MPrior was 0.017.
                    (Recall that all values were normalized between 0 and 1, including the
                    circulation.) This average of 1.7% corresponds to about 7-8 checkouts in a given
                    branch. The corresponding value for MCirc is 6%, or about 3.5 times as high.
                    This is not surprising as this model has much less information to work with.
                    However, it is still within 10% of the actual checkout total.</p>
                <p>As noted above, our primary interest in this paper is not in predictions per se,
                    but rather what the model tells us about the features under study. Figure 12
                    below shows the feature importance for different input features in MPrior. As
                    noted above, the tree itself consists of hundreds of choices in complex
                    combination; the feature importance is a statistic that reflects the overall
                    utility of a particular variable across all the predictions the system makes. It
                    does not offer any insight into the structure of the tree itself. The feature
                    importance values shown here are averages across all seven learned models, and
                    were relatively consistent across the different model runs.</p>
                <p>Figure 12 also shows that the importance of prior circulation is very high, which
                    is not surprising since it reflects the pre-existing interest of a particular
                    set of patrons in a particular text. The other variables in descending order of
                    importance are Holdings, Difficulty, PC1, PC3, PC2X, Promotion, and Proximity.
                    (Note that feature importance values are not probabilities and do not sum to
                    100%.) The <q>shelf effect</q> noted above (see Figure 9) is substantiated here.
                    The number of books allocated to a branch does indeed have an impact on patron
                    behavior over and above the prior interest indicated by patrons. Also, we see
                    that our combined reading difficulty measure contributes to the predictions.
                    Feature importance does not indicate the direction of influence, but from other
                    data we know that this influence is negative — i.e. the more difficult the book
                    by this measure, the fewer patrons will check it out. It is also worth noting
                    that, in general, reading difficulty measures track the fiction/non-fiction
                    genre divide, with non-fiction books generally scoring higher. At this point, we
                    do not have enough data to firmly disentangle the effects of reading difficulty
                    for this fiction/nonfiction distinction. Finally, we have the demographic
                    variables, especially the PC1 (property value) and PC3 (owner/renter) axes. At
                    lower levels of importance are the number of OBOC outreach events held and the
                    locality measure (<q>proximity</q>) of the text. </p>

                </figure>
                <p>Figure 13 contains similar importance values for MCirc, but now prior CPL
                    circulation is not considered. Here we see that the roles are reversed between
                    the set of demographic variables and the holdings/reading difficulty measure.
                    The prior circulation variable in MPrior is, to some extent, building in the
                    baseline appeal of the book to the patrons of a particular branch, and when this
                    variable is removed the demographic factors become a stronger element. In some
                    ways, this brings us back to one of our original research questions – namely,
                    the relationship between demography and OBOC participation. Here we see effects
                    of PC1, PC3 and PC2X similar to those found in the multi-level model. Once we
                    get past these effects, we have a consistent pattern relating holdings, reading
                    difficulty, promotional events, and proximity.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Our final model examined the impact of using a binary Chicago/non-Chicago feature
                    as our representation of a text’s locality rather than the quantitative
                    proximity values used in the other models. We call this model MBinary.
                    Interestingly, the average mean absolute error on this model was approximately
                    0.018, which is slightly but not significantly improved over the MPrior model.
                    Figure 14 shows the average error for the three models expressed in terms of
                    normalized circulation. </p>

                </figure>
                <p>Figure 15 shows the average feature importance for the MBinary model. The values
                    are very similar to those found in Figure 12, with the binary feature showing a
                    small, but non-negligible contribution to the model performance. The results for
                    MBinary are quite important as they demonstrate that high accuracy in toponym
                    attribution is not essential to making use of locality in circulation modeling.
                    It is sufficient to label a book simply as Chicago-connected or not, and we
                    expect that this will be possible without the manual effort required to achieve
                    high accuracy for each geographic label. </p>

                <head>Limitations</head>
                <p>The analyses above have some gaps that we hope to address in future research. For
                    instance, although the period in question has seen greater use of e-books by CPL
                    patrons, we have not yet included e-book checkouts in our analysis. (Because
                    e-book checkouts are not associated with particular branches, we would not have
                    been able to build them into branch-level circulation models.) However, e-book
                    usage is almost certainly correlated with neighborhood demographics and
                    therefore represents <q>missing</q> checkouts in certain areas. A similar point
                    could be made about book purchases. Chicagoans with the resources to purchase a
                    copy of the selected OBOC text rather than read a library copy are obviously not
                    represented in the CPL circulation data. Thus, we expect that our models
                    underestimate total OBOC participation, particularly in more affluent areas of
                    the city.</p>
                <p> A limitation in our analysis is the limited number of texts we were able to use.
                    80 branches and seven books constitute less than 600 circulation data points.
                    The texture of the model can be enhanced in several ways, however. One way would
                    be to obtain year-by-year demographic data for each branch rather than using a
                    single year’s census data to stand in for the whole time period. As it is now,
                    only 80 combinations of the demographic factors can appear, and therefore
                    interrelations between the factors are difficult to discern. In general, we
                    would not expect this to change the results much, but in neighborhoods
                    experiencing rapid or marked demographic change it would provide a more accurate
                    representation. </p>
                <p>Richer data can also be obtained by looking at additional books. We have obtained
                    the branch-level circulation data for 309 books chosen by CPL as recommendations
                    associated with each of the seven recent OBOC seasons (the <q>if you liked this
                        book, you might also like ...</q> feature that appears regularly on the CPL
                    website, on program flyers, and in branch libraries). These books were selected
                    by CPL for thematic or other similarities to the OBOC choices and therefore
                    provide an interesting, if idiosyncratic, control group: books that did not
                    receive the full promotional boost of the official OBOC selected texts but were
                    brought to the attention of patrons nonetheless. With these 300+ additional
                    texts, it would be possible to extend MCirc by adding a binary variable
                    distinguishing the <q>selected</q> vs <q>recommended</q> texts.</p>
                <p>Another limitation is working exclusively with in-copyright texts. Both the set
                    of seven recent OBOC selections and the extended corpus of recommended texts
                    contains many in-copyright works and therefore our text processing can only
                    occur, painstakingly, through the non-consumptive text processing capabilities
                    of the HathiTrust Digital Library. We have also found that many of the texts in
                    this extended data set are not held in the HathiTrust collection. For the works
                    that are present, working from scanned OCR-ed text entails significant
                    difficulties in calculating some of the text properties that we have relied on
                    in this analysis to date. We have discovered significant biases in the
                    calculation of reading difficulty. Most challenging is the determination of the
                    location/proximity variable, which in the end required manual checking — a
                    process that does not scale up to a larger corpus. This is one reason that the
                    MBinary model is of interest: we expect that assessing a simple
                    Chicago/non-Chicago placement of a text will be less error-prone than the
                    calculation of distances for each toponym, although the case of the <q>Mecca</q>
                    building is an important cautionary tale.</p>
                <p>As in other disciplinary contexts, merging data from heterogeneous sources is a
                    difficult task with no easy or standardized solutions. Each type of data —
                    branch demographics, library circulation (both checkouts and book holdings), and
                    book content — poses its own challenge for data curation, normalization, and
                    integration, many of which have been discussed above. One distinguishing feature
                    of this work has been our reliance largely on a relatively small number of
                    heterogeneous in-copyright texts. Thus, we do not have the advantage of
                    large-scale <q>distant</q> text processing where small errors in the
                    transformation pipeline can be expected to cancel each other out.</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>Our project has identified several challenges that will be of interest to
                    scholars in the digital humanities, particularly those working at the
                    intersection of text analysis, geography, and public data sets. Our original
                    goal to capture and predict mass literary events has largely been met. As
                        <q>capture</q>, we have created an archive of nearly a decade of multiple
                    media forms (and metrics for them) associated with a cultural program that has
                    engaged many thousands of people across a major American city for years. In
                    pursuit of <q>prediction</q>, we have produced a novel predictive model
                    integrating demographics, book content, and branch data to produce branch-level
                    predictions of book circulation. With this tool, we plan to generate
                    branch-level circulation predictions for book titles (OBOC program or not)
                    beginning in summer 2020. This will be reported in a future paper.</p>
                <p>While we expect this predictive model to be of use to CPL staff, it is important
                    to note that it has not been our intent (nor theirs) to optimize against such a
                    model in choosing books. One does not need data-intensive modeling to identify
                    books that circulate highly; for example, a good bet at any time would be
                    current best-sellers by authors with name recognition who have been highly
                    promoted by publishers. <emph>But maximizing circulation alone has never been
                        the primary goal of <title rend="quotes">One Book, One Chicago</title>.</emph> We expect that library
                    staff will continue to make OBOC text and theme choices as they always have,
                    through an in-depth process that considers an entire constellation of cultural
                    and socio-political factors. However, they will now be able to do so with the
                    help of an additional data source: for any given book, they will also be able to
                    calculate <q>what-if</q> scenarios for all CPL branches and consider different
                    levels and kinds of promotional activity.<note> We are in the process of
                        constructing a dashboard with interactive visualizations to support such
                        exploration.</note></p>
                <p>One of the key findings of our predictive model is that prior circulation makes
                    the largest predictive contribution for the circulation of OBOC selected works.
                    This is a measure, however, that will be unavailable for new books and
                    little-known or first-time authors. It is possible, as we have shown, to do
                    similar types of predictions without prior circulation data, but with
                    significantly lower accuracy. This is not a surprising finding, but our ability
                    to quantify the effect will enable library staff to reason about the tradeoffs
                    inherent in choosing works already circulating well in the local library-system
                    as opposed to <q>importing</q> choices from outside the system in the name of
                    expanding readers’ horizons.</p>
                <p>Additional work remains. One key question of interest to us is the interaction
                    between kinds of promotional events surrounding a given OBOC season, the sharing
                    and re-sharing of these events via social media, and subsequent specific branch
                    circulation outcomes. As shown in Figure 2, the time course of each book’s
                    circulation shows a variety of different patterns and temporal structures.
                    Preliminary analysis suggests that, as might be expected, there is a close
                    association between bumps in checkout numbers and branch events and social media
                    activity hosted by the library — but there are notable differences by branch and
                    type of event. However, analysis of this association for each of the eighty
                    branches remains to be done. We do not know, for example, how different types of
                    events impact circulation or whether an event at one library branch impacts
                    circulation at others. We are interested in linking the circulation and event
                    time-series data to the timeline of OBOC Twitter posts, many but not all of
                    which are related to specific OBOC events. We have already collected associated
                    Twitter and Goodreads data for several OBOC seasons and have developed
                    supervised text classification algorithms to isolate the OBOC-specific tweets
                    from unrelated content. This relationship between social media activity and
                    circulation is yet to be quantified, but will be the subject of a future
                    paper.</p>
