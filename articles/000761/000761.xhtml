                     which collects the biographical information of Nashville's Black population during the Civil War era. 
                     With over 18,500 entries, it offers fresh insights into the far-reaching viewpoints,
                     experiences, interpretations, and 
                     meanings surrounding the history of the free and enslaved Black builders of Nashville's wartime defenses 
                     and the defenders of the city and a nation free from chattel slavery. It is grounded
                     in work with this population's 
                     descendants and others working in local Black history and is, therefore, shaped by
                     many different perspectives. 
                     This article embodies the team's reflections on the collective decisions and conversations
                     between descendants, 
                     public and academic historians, computer scientists, and software developers working
                     together to provide open-access 
                     historical information that was locked away behind paywalls or difficult to access
                     on microfilm. These collaborations 
                     allow for an efficient, flexible exploration of the history that continues to impact
                     the lives of Black 
                     Nashville and the nation. These continuing conversations with local groups highlight how the
                     team's 
                     intentions and methodologies are shaped by and continue to shape the community-driven
                     approach to linked data.

                     Negley, the Civil War-era Union fortification built by enslaved and free Black people. Many
                     had self-emancipated from neighboring 
                     states, running toward Union lines in Tennessee and enlisting to help the war effort. Others were offered up by enslavers 
                     sympathetic to the Federal cause or hoping for an additional paycheck. Others still
                     were forced from homes and churches band into the  
                     building process by the military, while another group came voluntarily, motivated
                     by promises of wages. Together they were nearly 5,000 
                     strong and built the fort and all of Nashville's other wartime infrastructure. Shortly after, around 13,000 Black soldiers 
                     of the USCT defended Fort Negley and the city in the Battle of Nashville, one of the Civil War's 
                     final deciding conflicts [<a class="ref" href="#lovett1982">Lovett 1982</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#fitch1864">Fitch 1864</a>, 619–620]. Afterward, they and their descendants 
                     settled in the area, creating and participating in the city's oldest free post-war
                     Black neighborhoods and institutions. Today, many 
                     Black Nashvillians can trace their ancestry to this Fort Negley population.

                     two fields — digital humanities 
                     and public history — in important ways. By focusing on how centering the needs of
                     descendant communities shaped the eventual digital 
                     product and process, we offer insights for other digital public humanists, especially

                        project at the time of writing. In projects like this, with a white PI and a small,
                        white team working out of a primarily white 
                        private research institution in the Southern United States, partnering with Black descendants and public historians 
                        working with Black history, there has to be a shared understanding of the power imbalance
                        and lack of justice and parity in the past 
                        and present. Vanderbilt University was created during Reconstruction with the goal of mending the relationship between
                        
                        Northern and Southern states, yet it spent decades educating an elite who would uphold
                        and exacerbate the worst of the Jim Crow 
                        South.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e314">[2]</a> As an institution, Vanderbilt is still grappling with how to fully acknowledge and address 
                        its role in the persisting racial injustices impacting the Black Edgehill neighborhood
                        in which Fort Negley is located, 
                        as well as the wider city of Nashville. In efforts to rebuild trust between representatives of Vanderbilt 
                        and the local Black community, these issues had to be front and center of every collaboration.
                        Successful implementation of the project 
                        and creation of the database hinged on the shared understanding that locals must make
                        the decisions that best reflect their experiences, 
                        specialized knowledge, and needs, whereas academics at Vanderbilt whose ancestors are not present in the records must 
                        find ways to understand and implement those decisions that follow best digital humanities
                        praxis or communicate clearly ways these 
                        decisions aren't feasible and work toward finding acceptable alternatives.

                        have not been shared and how burdens have not been carried equally among us as a result.

                        then we need to 
                        think more carefully about whose history it is and how the “Black” label is being deployed. The approach to this historical 
                        database is Black-centered, because representations of Blackness that did not serve
                        white supremacy (such as builders with specialist 
                        knowledge, defenders with nation-shaping aspirations, or veteran communities creating
                        Black institutions) are the ones that have been 
                        suppressed. Black Tennesseans' ancestors are the ones missing from the overall existing
                        narratives, and we are creating the databank 
                        others can use to insert them and reinterpret our shared history in light of the new
                        information. The database addresses a problem the 
                        world experienced (slavery) and the ramifications we all still face together (continued
                        unfreedom, the global legacies of 
                        anti-Blackness, and the suppression of information related to this). This project
                        speaks to historical erasure and the horrors this has 
                        exacerbated in Black-majority nations as well as those with Afro-descended minority
                        populations around the world. In this way, the 
                        local becomes global, and local experts make the most valuable collaborators in uncovering
                        global processes.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p9">First, the Fort Negley descendant community is the central group at the heart of this project. They descend
                        from the 
                        builders and defenders of Fort Negley and Nashville during the Civil War — many of whom settled in 
                        Nashville and founded some of the earliest post-emancipation Black neighborhoods in Middle
                        Tennessee. Over 
                        multiple generations, the descendant community has always been the foundation of historical
                        knowledge about the fort and the Black 
                        laborers and soldiers. Given that historical written records often failed to preserve
                        Black lived experiences and instead echoed 
                        archival silences due to the racist structures of power surrounding the generation
                        and preservation of primary sources, Black families 
                        preserve their own histories in alternative ways: through oral and community traditions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e398">[4]</a> 
                        Specifically, historical scholarship around Fort Negley largely focused on white Tennessee military history 
                        of the Civil War. Outside of Bobby Lovett's work, little research was done on Black experiences surrounding the Civil War 
                        Fort Negley. However, via oral and community traditions, Black families passed down histories
                        about their ancestors 
                        through community elders that shaped how future generations remembered their past.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e435">[5]</a> 
                        The support of Nashville's chapter of the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society further 
                        promoted discovery and networking around the history of this local population.

                        to the physically imposing Fort 
                        Negley over generations, members of the descendant community created a deeply interconnected
                        circulation of knowledge about 
                        their ancestors. These histories played a large role in effecting change in the preservation
                        and the public history of Fort 
                        Negley. They also played a large role in the genesis of this database project: when land
                        adjacent to the fort was sold for 
                        development in 2017, determined descendants approached Sutton, who spoke at a Parks Board Meeting in favor of preserving 
                        the fort, for collaboration. This served as a very concrete example of how descendants
                        claimed a political role in determining what 
                        happened to their community's history, both discursively and materially. At the time,
                        Sutton, the project director, worked with the

                        there to help produce and distribute video oral histories of the descendant population.
                        These oral histories became the start of the

                        descendants chose which stories and evidence to highlight, and they had control over
                        the final edits. Their strategic deployment of

                        placed on Black cultural and material heritage. Each 
                        video displays intentionality in crafting a counter-narrative to the one that had
                        resulted in the land at the fort being sold.

                        Eleanor Fleming and Gary Burke. Fleming is a descendant of Ruffin and 
                        Egbert Bright, two enslaved men that federal officers pulled out of Scruggs' Place in Southwest 
                        Nashville and forced to assist in the construction of Fort Negley. Burke is a descendant of 
                        Private Peter Bailey from the United States Colored Troops (USCT), a veteran of the Battle of 
                        Nashville at the conflict at Granbury's Lunette and stationed at Fort Negley as part of the 
                        enduring federal presence in the city during Reconstruction. Fleming, who found her connection to the fort coincidentally 
                        by browsing the site's Twitter account when it released some of the names of the laborers,
                        spoke in the video for the

                        online rather than having to visit several archives, consult multiple formats, and
                        wrestle with multiple styles of 19th and early 20th 
                        century handwriting [<a class="ref" href="#hall2022">Hall 2022</a>]. Over the course of several years, Sutton consulted academics, descendants, 
                        and other Nashvillians in the local history community while planning and collecting
                        the skills and information necessary to create

                        the idea was twofold: (1) that we would accept 
                        data from the community and find ways to clean and link it through the historical
                        database software Spatial Historian; and (2) that 
                        we would allow the community to determine what sources were most necessary for this
                        database and what they needed to be accessible 
                        online from the sources. Sutton approached the project with the understanding that descendants who have already done
                        the 
                        work of tracing their ancestry knew best the pitfalls others would encounter. The
                        project also presumes that descendant voices must be 
                        centered in all interpretations of the site and its history. The database therefore
                        was created with the understanding that digital 
                        projects have ethical responsibilities to center this community as subject-matter
                        experts and generators of knowledge, rendering the 
                        process a co-creation.

                        time to create a two-part video for the <cite class="title italic">Fort Negley Descendants Project</cite> that includes slides with 
                        resources to help potential descendants know where to look and how to approach the
                        task of reconstructing the family tree. In part

                        intern of the project at the time, who is a Nashville local with many of the same last names in her family as are in the

                        Koonce instructed Sutton and the students working with the FNDP on the sources and places where most Black
                        
                        genealogists from Tennessee get stuck in their search, namely the “Brick Wall” of the 1870s: the dead end that the 
                        usual genealogical records hit prior to emancipation, when most Black Americans were
                        not listed as people in their own right, but 
                        among the material possessions of others. Her specialist knowledge and local connections
                        to descendants make her an invaluable advisor 
                        to the project and made it clear to Sutton that this project couldn't be a mere transcription project where the creators 
                        remove themselves from the end product — it had to have clear subjective goals in
                        order to be helpful for a specific audience. 
                        Therefore, the descendant community's needs shaped what data we accepted, how we collected
                        and cleaned it, how it was made searchable, 
                        and what types of information from the sources became centered.

                        in this endeavor, Sutton attended 
                        and spoke at the Nashville Conference on African American History and Culture, a conference
                        that brings together descendants, students,

                        and the 
                        terms are reflective of white supremacist understandings of Black contributions to
                        the war. This database is called “Builders and 
                        Defenders” rather than “Laborers and Soldiers” because it rejects the notion that enslaved and formerly enslaved Black 
                        Americans were the mere physical labor component of the Union, only doing as they
                        were instructed, and instead places them at the heart 
                        of the conflict. In contrast to “laborer”, the term “builder” encompasses planning creativity, architecture, soil science, 
                        masonry, engineering, and collaboration. It highlights the fact that most documentation
                        of slave labor renders absent the creativity, 
                        discovery, and knowledge that the enslaved brought to their work, for which enslavers
                        took credit. Similarly, we use the term 
                        “defender” rather than soldier “soldier” because the former describes someone who understands the stakes and is willing to
                        
                        risk everything they have, including their life, to defend their personhood, their
                        communities, and a nascent idea of freedom. Black 
                        defenders of the Civil War, whether enrolled in the military or not, were nation-builders.
                        “Soldiers” implies that they fought as 
                        hired hands for the old Union, which was at its heart just as plagued by racism as
                        the Confederacy and which benefited financially from 
                        the South's national and global export trade in products produced by enslaved people.
                        Defenders fought for a new Union without 
                        legalized slavery, where their descendants could have free lives, and they defended
                        this ideal with everything they had.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e635">[7]</a>

                        the time. The Visitor Center is a city-government public history hub for the education
                        and preservation of Fort Negley,

                        Fort Negley Park. Castillo was central to helping our team find and interpret many of the documents for the
                        
                        database and place them in their various historical contexts. She offered insights

                        in which they were originally created, and the complexities of military and local
                        government bureaucracies and organizations that 
                        often make data extraction challenging.

                        military created in the 1860s 
                        to keep track of the almost 5,000 enslaved and free Black people who worked on the
                        construction of Nashville's Civil 
                        War defenses. They are a complicated and unwieldy collection of documents consisting
                        of a ledger and then several smaller ledgers 
                        and lists collected by the white officers supervising the construction of each site
                        in the defense system, including forts, camps, 
                        batteries, trenches, and redoubts. Each ledger or list was compiled slightly differently,
                        and some overlapped with the main ledger, 
                        while others did not. Some were copied and altered, some were compiled, but there
                        seems to be no uniform reason for this and no 
                        standard approach that fits every entry. Many duplicate entries were able to be merged,
                        as they were the result of multiple scribes 
                        working on the ledgers, but there were just as many we could not merge because we
                        could not be sure that they were in fact the same 
                        person. Whenever there was lack of complete certainty, we kept both entries to avoid

                        from other sources previously unaccounted for 
                        in the data. For example, the transcriptions of military service records for USCT soldiers helped us find additional 
                        information about soldiers of the 12th regiment (members of the 12th served at Fort Negley and the Battle of 
                        Nashville, and historical sources state that many members of the 12th were former laborers
                        forced to enlist by Union 
                        officers) [<a class="ref" href="#stearns1864">Stearns 1864</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e746">[9]</a> Cross-referencing and linking these different datasets allowed new details about

                        ages and occupations, and their enlistment officers and locations. The majority of
                        the soldiers were local from Nashville 
                        and regional Middle Tennessee cities. However, the records also show a large geographic swath from places in the

                        experiences if they got sick or hurt and later died (including details about their
                        condition, residence, and marital status, 
                        occasionally, and the name and address of their spouse), records of their promotions
                        in rank, and sometimes papers about soldiers 
                        deserting. These records illustrate how the soldiers' lived experiences cannot be
                        historically characterized as a monolith or in a 
                        single, linear narrative. Rather, these documents illustrate that the laborers and
                        soldiers came from far-reaching places seeking 
                        freedom and safety behind Union lines and that their service in constructing Fort Negley and defending it in the 
                        USCT was animated and driven by a countless range of motivations, perspectives, and experiences.
                        While the fort was 
                        built in Nashville, its impact and significance reach far beyond the local. As the data about the geographies
                        of the 
                        soldiers and laborers illustrate, the history of the fort is connected to the southern
                        and northern states and, in turn, serves as a 
                        lens for understanding the US more broadly as a nation during and after the Civil War.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p23">With the data ingested, figuring out searchability was the next big hurdle. The team
                        consulted Koonce and a handful 
                        of descendants to clarify how they would search for their ancestors. We asked what
                        Black genealogists generally type into search 
                        boxes, what presumptions come with those searches, and what types of things they are
                        expecting or hoping to find. At meetings of the 
                        Nashville chapter of AAHGS, Sutton heard from the presenting members who reconstructed their 
                        family histories about pain points and where they struggled. From there it became
                        clear that we had to restructure the data to be 
                        people-first and relational. While the original Labor Rolls and other military documents
                        were created for economic purposes — to keep 
                        track of hours, for both payment and the possibility for reimbursement to Union-sympathizing
                        enslavers who voluntarily offered up the 
                        people they enslaved for Union labor — we could create our own categories for the
                        purpose of centering social history. We could 
                        determine how categories relate to one another and the rest of the data to help descendants
                        find out more about their ancestors. The 
                        accompanying website of the database contains a lengthy page explaining these choices
                        and the rationale behind them.

                        upon Dr. Jim Schindling's Spatial 
                        Historian software for constructing the database — an emerging technology platform
                        developed by Schindling which allows 
                        us to organize, ingest, and analyze identifying historical information, social networks,
                        and spatial patterns of people in the 
                        database [<a class="ref" href="#schindling2021">Schindling 2021</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#schindling2020">Schindling 2020</a>]. Spatial Historian is an indispensable technology for the 
                        aggregation of multivalences around the relationships, archival records, and experiences
                        of the Black laborers, soldiers, their 
                        families, and descendants throughout the database. The flexibility of Spatial Historian
                        allows us to customize the software interface 
                        according to the community's needs rather than according to how the documents were
                        created, or how documents might typically be 
                        organized for academic or institutional needs. The real benefit is that, without any
                        specialized technical training, we can filter 
                        lists of people by any of the attributes chosen by the community advisory board, easily
                        view personal and social connections, and 
                        create statistical outputs in the form of charts, maps, and spreadsheets.

                        Southeast and Midwest, but also from the Northeast, Canada, and even some Western states. This type of nimble

                        Most of our data has been shared with 
                        <cite class="title italic">Enslaved</cite> and their <cite class="title italic">Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation</cite> to be ingested

                        Nashville and the history of Fort Negley to participate in these linked networks, something that is of 
                        particular importance given that Nashville was a central hub for Black people shortly before, during, and after the 
                        Civil War, thereby linking the city with nearly every state east of the Mississippi River.

                        helping researchers reconstruct kinship networks. For example, those men who built
                        Fort Negley and were then coerced 
                        to join the 12th regiment of the USCT and fight in the Battle of Nashville would appear in search results

                        This decision was affirmed again after speaking with a descendant (who prefers to
                        remain unnamed in this article) of

                        histories, photos, and traditions 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#sc_n.d.">Soldier's Certificate No. 636,381 n.d.</a>]. Our team engaged in an iterative process with them, using their information and
                        the information in the 
                        database to help reconstruct Wilkes' biography. The document highlights many of aspects of Wilkes' life, 
                        such as his experiences as a free person in Ohio before the war, his service with the 15th Regiment of the 
                        USCT in Nashville, the soldiers who he served with and who later moved with him to Ohio, 
                        and some of the injuries he sustained. His record gave further insight into his life
                        and family after the war, including the names 
                        of his wife and children, as well as the details of his pension application in the
                        1880s. In addition to the pension record, the 
                        descendant generously shared with the team the oral histories their family passed
                        down across generations about Wilkes, 
                        along with photos of some of his children, who were also discussed in the pension
                        record. When the team provided a list of the fellow 
                        soldiers who had served with Wilkes and testified in his disability hearings in the 1870s, the descendant exclaimed that
                        
                        they recognized all those last names because they were the last names of their family
                        friends in Appalachian 
                        Ohio<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e947">[13]</a>. This shed light 
                        on the profound connection Wilkes had to the soldiers he served with in his regiment in the Battle of 
                        Nashville — many of whom traveled back to Ohio with him after the war and whose descendants are still 
                        close to this day. Cases like those of the Wilkes descendants confirm that builders who built together and defenders 
                        who defended together often became each other's families after the Civil War, creating
                        bonds that endured over multiple generations. 
                        Therefore, prioritizing relational data in the database helps descendants and other
                        researchers reconstruct some of the relationships 
                        that might otherwise have been lost, or provide valuable clues for other avenues to
                        explore.

                     conceptions of periodization and spatial issues than academically trained historians.
                     These differences in have led to many fruitful 
                     conversations about what should belong to the database, how to define the spatial/temporal

                     stakeholders and various communities who will rely on 
                     it. Initially the <cite class="title italic">Builders and Defenders</cite> database was conceived as a Civil War era project. Engaging with the 
                     local community has convinced us that the most urgent lessons to come out of the Civil
                     War with regard to Black Nashville are 
                     the ways in which the injustices of slavery extend beyond the end of the war into
                     the present. Descendants and local historians wanted 
                     easier access to more documentary sources that trace these continuities within their
                     families and communities through the 19th and 20th 
                     centuries, and many offered their own research and transcriptions to help us broaden
                     the database and make plans for the next phase(s) of 
                     the project. Below we will share three such conversations to show how the understanding
                     of self and community many of 
                     Nashville's Black descendants and public historians hold has pushed the temporal limits of
                     the database. The three 
                     conversations revolve around the Bass Street neighborhood, the Tennessee State Penitentiary records, and the records of the

                        historians in developing the project and challenging its temporal limits. Chuck Sherrill, a former state archivist and 
                        librarian at the Tennessee State Library and Archives, helped the team find additional sources. With a lifetime of 
                        experience in Tennessee genealogy and a past researching and writing about the people imprisoned at the Tennessee 
                        State Penitentiary from 1850 to 1870, he knew that information about many of the people reprsented in
                        our database was in 
                        those records, as Southern states controlled the formerly enslaved and continued to
                        extract forced labor from them through 
                        incarceration. Sherill's book, <cite class="title italic">Tennessee Convicts: Early Records of the State Penitentiary, Volume 2, 
                           1850-1870</cite>, provides an invaluable glimpse into the lives and experiences of the incarcerated
                        men and women in the southern 
                        prison before, during, and after the Civil War [<a class="ref" href="#sherrill1997">Sherrill 1997</a>]. His work is especially relevant to our project for a 
                        number of reasons. Following the Civil War, former enslavers in the South incarcerated
                        Black Americans en masse and exploited their 
                        labor through convict-leasing programs as a means of maintaining white supremacist
                        structures of power and racist hierarchies from the 
                        era of slavery. Sherrill's data from the Tennessee State Penitentiary reflects the broad historical 
                        patterns of Black mass incarceration after the Civil War: the percentage of Black
                        inmates in the state of Tennessee 
                        increased dramatically, from roughly 5% of the prison's population prior to the civil
                        war, to about 62% in 1869

                        in Nashville. Sherrill's book makes 
                        use of thousands of primary source material from TSLA, including prison ledgers, pardon requests, sentencing trial 
                        records, legislative reports, and more. Drawing upon these sources, Sherrill compiled a list of the incarcerated men and 
                        women and wrote detailed notes about their imprisonment. From these notes, we learn
                        about prisoners' family and social networks, 
                        where they were born and where they resided, as well as their ages, occupations, aliases,
                        and their experiences inside the prison, 
                        such as if they ever escaped or requested pardons. We also get a glimpse of the larger
                        occupation, the Civil War and 
                        Reconstruction-era politics at stake, and the ways in which Black people once more
                        became the locus of these conflicts: many 
                        pro-Confederate Tennesseans used their political power to send Black Civil War soldiers/veterans
                        to prison, while those sympathetic to 
                        the Union or to Black freedom used theirs to arrange for pardons.

                        through which to analyze slavery and freedom before 
                        and after the war, especially in relation to Fort Negley. For example, before the war, numerous individuals were imprisoned 
                        for “harboring slaves” — in other words, for helping enslaved men and women escape from slavery and gain
                        freedom. One such example 
                        comes from the prison record for James Peck, a twenty-five-year-old Black man convicted in Nashville, 
                        TN, who was imprisoned in 1857 for “harboring a slave” and released in 1863, when the city was under Union

                        Tennessee Central Railway (TCR) Museum's document collections. After reading about
                        the archaeological work happening at Bass Street in 
                        October 2021 and how former Black laborers and soldiers settled in Nashville after the war, Newton reached out 
                        to our team. He highlighted another potential direction of research overlap: the employee
                        records of the TCR. These personnel files 
                        started in the 1880s with the establishment of the railway, and Newton found numerous records of the African American 
                        employees who worked there. These connections grow further given the proximity between
                        the railway and the fort — the TCR is located 
                        only two and a half miles from Fort Negley and Bass Street in the neighborhood of Cameron-Trimble, another historically 
                        Black Nashville neighborhood created after the war. Furthermore, archaeologists found railroad artifacts
                        among the 
                        belongings of Fort Negley's veterans at Bass Street. However, the history of these records was fraught with
                        preservation 
                        challenges. A fire in the mid-twentieth century destroyed many of the employee records
                        and, more recently in March 2021, a destructive 
                        tornado that ran through Nashville destroyed parts of the TCR building [<a class="ref" href="#bryan2021">Bryan 2021</a>]. In an effort to protect 
                        and preserve as many records as possible, many of the TCR employees, volunteers, and
                        community members offered to house the records.

                        of the former laborers, soldiers, and their possible descendants after the war and
                        emancipation and into the post-Reconstruction South. In broad terms, this reflects
                        how the project has taken on new and expansive chronological significance. While it
                        initially began as a project focused on the wartime years and its immediate aftermath,
                        the new archival connections like the personnel records at the TCR, as well as the

                        long after the war and pushes the team to reconsider traditional historical timelines.
                        Exploring the TCR employment records has spurred the team to look to other areas where
                        potential connections might emerge – currently, we have begun the early stages of
                        exploring possible connections between former Fort Negley laborers and soldiers with
                        early Vanderbilt University staff and construction crews since the university was
                        founded and built in Nashville in the early 1870s (Conkin 1985), and the builders

                        information to trace how local patterns that manifested in slavery persisted into
                        the present once chattel slavery was made illegal. They showed the team how records
                        reflected these patterns and made the case that the information in the <span class="hi italic">Builders &amp; Defenders</span> database could not stop at the war's conclusion – it had to take into account the
                        failures of Reconstruction and the retrenchment of enslavers' values after the Federal
                        troops pulled out of the city, alongside the struggles and successes of, as W. E.
                        B. Dubois put it, Black self-Reconstruction (DuBois 1935). Alongside the valuable
                        information from the Bass Street descendants and archaeological site, the Tennessee
                        State Penitentiary record transcriptions, and the Tennessee Central Railroad Employment

                     We wanted to highlight that these ongoing conversations are crucial to the genesis
                     of a project that appeals to local understandings of self and of history. All humanities

                     created by a homogenous committee of lawmakers, and then there are the histories that
                     Black Tennesseans understand from breakfasts with grandparents, from the pulpit, and
                     hidden in plain sight (but often not formally recognized by the city or state) in
                     the physical landscape all around us. Too often these histories create competing narratives.
                     To build something that is useful and might matter, our team had to understand both
                     of these histories, and then collect the evidence for the second, and build an infrastructure
                     that made it searchable in ways that were recognizable to Black Nashvillians. It is
                     our hope that making the iterative process explicit can be helpful to those scholars

                     shared Civil War and Reconstruction history. As this article was written for a special
                     edition of <span class="hi italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</span> entitled “The Future of Black Digital Humanities,” we, the authors, would like to
                     add that we don't for a second presume that it is our place to prescribe any future
                     for Black DH. Rather, we can describe where this part of the field (collaborative
                     community-based digital archival intervention) looks to be headed and share our ways
                     of approaching the issues of positionality that inevitably are part of it. We come
                     to this space and make these observations as guests invited in for various painful
                     reasons: because structural racism barred entry to so many of the Black descendants
                     and local historians who would have wanted to do this work, because Black elders are
                     passing away faster than the community can preserve their stories, and because the
                     safety and longevity of sites and documents related to Afro-descended people are often
                     precarious and/or time sensitive. These points are crucial, but they do not mean that
                     we come to this space for only altruistic reasons. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">In the 1960s, James Baldwin wrote “Whatever white people do not know about Negroes
                     reveals, precisely and <span class="hi italic">inexorably</span>, what they do not know about themselves” (Baldwin 1962). We the authors have found
                     ourselves in Black DH because all the knowledge that we were not allowed to know has
                     created an intellectual poverty in the profession. With the uncovering and preservation
                     of information related to Black people, we uncover all of our histories. The work
                     reveals that the so-called historical objectivity we were trained to strive for is
                     nothing more than white colonizer subjectivity in disguise; a harmful illusion that
                     hides all we do not know about ourselves as people, and ourselves as a nation. This
                     means that the future of Black Studies will likely witness more scholars from non-Black
                     backgrounds (both racial and methodological) finding that their work is incomplete
                     and their data inconclusive without that which has been stripped and silenced.</div>

                     the power dynamics of whiteness, we believe that it is necessary to approach historical

                     the longstanding injustices perpetuated by archival silences. In turn, this transforms
                     the historical work we do to an actionable field for social change – one in which
                     the very communities who are central to and affected by the research, and are often
                     historically marginalized, become the key stakeholders and guides to scholars on how
                     to approach and conduct these projects. Rather than keeping findings within the boundaries
