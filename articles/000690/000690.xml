                <p>A consideration of the political meaning of software that tries to add greater
                    philosophical precision to statements about the politics of tools and tool
                    building in the humanities. Using Michael Oakeshott's formulations of the
                    "politics of faith" and the "politics of skepticism," it suggests that while
                    declaring our tools be morally or political neutral may be obvious fallacious,
                    it is equally problematic to suppose that we can predict in advance the
                    political formations that will arise from our tool building. For indeed (as
                    Oakeshott suggests), the tools themselves give rise to what is politically
                    possible.</p>

                <p>If it is true that our tool-building cannot define or predict the specific
                    political arrangements that may later arise, we should perhaps be most
                    circumspect not when we are tempted to imagine our efforts to be neutral, but
                    rather when we imagine our tools to be acts of "resistance" or outright
                    political activism.</p>

            <p>To speak of &quot;the politics of tools&quot; is to take the political nature of technology for
                granted, and rightfully so. If the generation of historians, literary critics,
                socio-linguistis, and philosophers who came up in the academy after Foucault are
                united by anything, it is the idea that most things are wrapped up in issues of
                power, and therefore cannot be said to stand outside the realm of the political in
                any way. Such is the case, therefore, with any sort of technology at all &#8212;
                from pencils to weapons systems &#8212; and it is the business of humanistic inquiry
                to make plain the precise ways in which, as Foucault himself put it, "power comes
                from everywhere" <ptr target="#foucault1990"/></p>
            <p>And yet digital humanities has often been accused of violating this central
                directive. Alan Liu offered this sobering assessment in 2012.</p>

                    <p>While digital humanists develop tools, data, and metadata critically [...]
                        rarely do they extend their critique to the full register of society,
                        economics, politics, or culture. How the digital humanities advances,
                        channels, or resists today's great postindustrial, neoliberal, corporate,
                        and global flows of information-cum-capital is thus a question rarely heard
                        in the digital humanities associations, conferences, journals, and projects
                        with which I am familiar. Not even the clichéd forms of such issues &#8212;
                        for example, "the digital divide," "surveillance," "privacy," "copyright,"

                        "execute" button on projects that amass the most data for the greatest
                        number, process that data most efficiently and flexibly (flexible efficiency
                        being the hallmark of postindustrialism), and manage the whole through ever

                        reflect on the relation of the whole digital juggernaut to the new world

            <p>Called now to be "woke” &#8212; in a metaphor that hearkens back to one of humanism’s
                more confident eras &#8212; digital humanities now struggles to articulate precisely
                how its work is properly political, and whether its commitment to "tools” is for
                good or ill.</p>
            <p>Liu’s essay was hardly the only &#8212; or even, in the wider scheme, the most
                significant &#8212; catalyst for subsequent soul searching.<a href="#fn1"
                    class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> And in some
                sense, Liu’s call for a closer critical alignment with cultural studies has been
                taken far more literally than he could have imagined. The cultural studies to which
                DH now finds itself in uneasy dialogue is not so much its later refraction in
                "political readings” of the artifacts of human history, but in the far more
                concretized politics of the 1968 academy &#8212; a world in which a seminar that
                could not place itself in clear relation to the workers’ councils was perhaps not
                worth holding at all (one is reminded of earlier scholar-activists like Korsch and
                Lukács). Stephen Greenblatt recalls a moment from the immediate aftermath of that
                period in which he was attempting to teach Marx with, one assumes, all the nuanced
                ambivalence one would expect from a competent scholar. <cit><quote rend="inline">I

            <p>Liu was not stating the problem so starkly, and yet great swaths of the digital
                humanities community now take the questions he posed with an urgency and immediacy
                that is entirely palpable. It is now routine to begin a digital humanities
                conference with a kind of litany in which the refugee and the immigrant are
                welcomed, heteronormativity is denounced, misogyny is rejected, assaults on human
                dignity (bullying, harassment) are banned, and (at least in Canada, Australia, and
                the U.S.) the stolen lands of the First Nations are acknowledged. Such desiderata
                are quite obviously commendable (if only in intention), but that such announcements
                might well precede a discussion of machine learning and metadata highlights the
                unease. We are haunted by the thought that a "woke coder” or a "leftist web
                designer” is simply someone who has not made up their mind whether to choose between
                Athens and Palo Alto. We wonder if the "politics of tools” is not an object of
                philosophical reflection on the less instrumental aspects of our endeavors, but, as
                in the <soCalled>double entendre</soCalled> of my title, an entirely pejorative
                description of our own political confusions.</p>
            <p>Michael Oakeshott would seem a very unlikely figure in this discussion. The late work
                I consider most germane to these matters, <title rend="italics">The Politics of
                    Faith and the Politics of Skepticism,</title> is not obviously a book about
                politics and technology at all, but rather a treatise on what he takes to be the
                "stylistic” extremes of modernity as enunciated wherever (and whenever) we find
                ourselves engaged in political activity.<note><p>The manuscript for <title
                        rend="italic">The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Skepticism</title>
                    was found among Oakeshott's papers after his death in 1990, and published
                    posthumously in 1996. It is not entirely clear when it was written, and while a
                    nascent form of its ideas may be detected in an essay from 1929 (<title rend="quotes">Religion and
                        the World</title>), I feel justified in considering it a &quot;late work&quot;.</p></note> It is
                perhaps wise to let Oakeshott himself speak on the essential nature of these
                extremes:</p>

                <quote rend="block"> In the politics of faith, the activity of governing is
                    understood to be in the service of the perfection of mankind. There is a
                    doctrine of cosmic optimism which, not from observation but as an inference from
                    the perfection of its creator, attributes an unavoidable perfection to the
                    universe. And there is, further, a doctrine in which human perfection appears as
                    a providential gift, assured but not deserved. But the idea of human
                    perfectibility characteristic of the politics of faith, so far from being
                    derived from either of these doctrines, is hostile to them both. In the politics
                    of faith, human perfection is sought precisely because it is not present; and
                    further, it is believed that we need not, and should not, depend upon the
                    workings of divine providence for the salvation of mankind. Human perfection is
                    to be achieved by human effort, and confidence in the evanescence of
                    imperfection springs here from faith in human power and not from trust in divine
                    providence. We may, perhaps, be permitted to encourage ourselves by believing
                    that our efforts have the approval and even the support of providence, but we
                    are to understand that the achievement of perfection depends upon our own
                    unrelaxed efforts, and that if those efforts are unrelaxed, perfection will
                        appear.<ptr target="#oakeshott1996"/></quote>
            </cit>
            <p>The politics of skepticism, by contrast, is "in every way the opposite:"</p>
            <quote rend="block"> [I]n the politics of skepticism governing is understood as a
                specific activity, and in particular it is understood to be detached from the
                pursuit of human perfection. [...] [I]n modern times, the politics of skepticism
                (regarded as an abstract style of politics) may be said to have its roots either in
                the radical belief that human perfection is an illusion, or in the less radical
                belief that we know too little about the conditions of human perfection for it to be
                wise to concentrate our energies in a single direction by associating its pursuit
                with the activity of governing. Human perfection (so the argument runs) may be
                evanescent, and, moreover, it may be a single and simple condition of human
                circumstances (though this may be doubted), but, even on those assumptions, to
                pursue perfection in one direction only (and particularly to pursue it as the crow
                flies, regardless of what there may be to do in the interval before we embrace it)
                is to invite disappointment and (what might be worse than the mortification of
                non-arrival) misery on the way. [...] The office of government here is not be the
                architect of a perfect manner of living, or (as faith understands it) of an improved
                manner of living, or even (as it turns out) of any manner of living at all. [...]
                The skeptic in politics observes that men live in proximity with one another and,
                pursuing various activities, are apt to come into conflict with each other. And this
                conflict, when it reaches certain dimensions, not only makes life barbaric and
                intolerable, but may even terminate it abruptly. In this understanding of politics,
                then, the activity of governing subsists not because it is good, but because it is
                necessary. Its chief office is to lessen the severity of human conduct by reducing
                the occasions of it.<ptr target="#oakeshott1996"/></quote>
            <p>Upon these two very brief extracts from a lengthy argument, several observations must
                be made.</p>
            <p>For Oakeshott, "governance" does not mean the particular establishment of
                constitutions, nation states, delineated systems of social order, the credos and
                platforms of political parties, or even philosophical meditations on governance as
                such. He has in mind not <cit><quote rend="inline">Who shall rule?</quote> (and by
                    what warrant), but rather <quote rend="inline">What shall government
                        do?</quote><ptr target="#oakeshott1996"/></cit> "Political activity" is
                conceived as the <cit><quote rend="inline">understanding and care of public
                        arrangements</quote><ptr target="#oakeshott1996"/></cit>. Thus Oakeshott
                puts forth these two forms (or better, "styles") of political activity as
                unrealizable ideals (in the Platonic sense) and as extremes that are neither found
                in unattenuated form nor without some mixture of the two occurring either
                simultaneously or in tension with one another in actual political practice. That is
                to say, we cannot locate in history a moment in which either tendency has entirely
                prevailed &#8212; and indeed, were such extremes to somehow manifest themselves
                fully, they would immediately appear as self-contradictory and logically incoherent.
                Yet at the same time, Oakeshott detects these two tendencies playing out, as a kind
                of <soCalled>concordia discours</soCalled> of the two styles, in the actual practice
                of political life over the course of the last five hundred years, as well as in the
                politics of his own day.<note><p>Oakeshott is quite insistent that these two tendencies
                    characterize political modernity. He does not, for example, align Aristotle's
                    notion of human flourishing (εὐδαιμονία) as a politics of faith alternative to
                    the politics of skepticism that may well have predominated in the Greek city
                    states (or at least, he does not mention what seems to me an obvious
                    antecedent). He nonetheless admits to various manifestations of the politics of
                    skepticism prior to the early modern period, and avers that such was perhaps the
                    predominant political attitude of medieval Europe.</p></note></p>
            <p>"Faith" and "skepticism" have obvious religious overtones, and Oakeshott does not
                deny that religion has been an important factor in modern political thought and
                practice (he even, at several points, describes the politics of faith as
                "essentially Pelagian"). But close examination of these two passages will confirm
                that while a particular religious view might help to enable one or the other, it is
                just as important to notice that religious worldviews &#8212; even very insistent
                and socially totalizing ones &#8212; might inform precisely <soCalled>one or the
                    other</soCalled> at any given moment. There are as many varieties of the
                politics of faith as there are interpretations of the word "perfection,"<ptr
                    target="#oakeshott1996"/> and there is nothing in either notion that requires an
                explicitly religious vision. When New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in 2012, sought
                to ban the sale of sweetened soft drinks that exceeded 16 oz in a serving (as a
                matter of public health), he might have been engaging in <soCalled>something
                    like</soCalled> the politics of faith. But among the many who accused him of
                instituting a "nanny state," no one suggested that he had spiritual salvation in
                mind. It is also not the case that either term falls neatly along the conventional
                axes of left and right. At the risk of summoning Godwin's Law, one might say that
                the Nazis horrifying vision of "human perfectibility" had much more to do with the
                politics of faith than its opposite (though, as Oakeshott would no doubt point out,
                the politics of skepticism is by no means absent from the on-the-ground politics of
                something like state fascism).</p>
            <p>Again, a brief summary hardly does justice to a complex, book-length argument. But it
                is perhaps enough to orient us toward the truly provocative idea that Oakeshott
                introduces into his discussion of the two poles, which is that no serious form of
                the politics of faith can emerge without the enlistment of technology:</p>

                <quote rend="block"> [In the early modern period], the power of government was also
                    being enlarged by the application of more efficient techniques, most of which
                    had already seen an apprenticeship in some other field of activity, in commerce
                    or in industry. Indeed, almost the whole apparatus by means of which governments
                    in our own day are able to exercise a minute control over the activities of
                    their subjects &#8212; the apparatus of banking and book-keeping, the records,
                    registers, files, passports, dossiers and indexes &#8212; was already waiting to
                    be exploited. Without ease of movement and communication, without a ready supply
                    of paper and ink, without all those reports and records which spring up whenever
                    paper, ink and human curiosity are joined, without a literate population,
                    without ready means of identification, without settled frontiers, without (in
                    short) a high degree of mastery over men and things, the prospects of the
                    politics of faith are nugatory; with them, there is little to stand in their
                        way.<ptr target="#oakeshott1996"/>
                </quote>
            </cit>
            <p>The analogy with our contemporary moment could not be more vivid. But Oakeshott's
                boldest thesis is that technology does not come to the aid of an emergent politics
                of faith, but rather creates the conception in the first place. Those who propose a
                new form of political activity do not realize its virtues <soCalled>and
                    then</soCalled> seize on the technological power that could bring it about, but
                instead discover a politics of faith precisely when, as in the early modern period,
                there is "a remarkable and intoxicating increase of human power" borne of
                technological innovation and expansion <ptr target="#oakeshott1996"/>. States do not
                discover the virtues of total surveillance and then look around for the means by
                which surveillance might be undertaken, but instead discover the entire conception
                of governance as a quest for human perfectibility because the technology of
                surveillance has appeared as a new affordance.</p>
            <p>At least two objections immediately arise.</p>
            <p>First: If it is true that technology is logically and temporally prior to the
                politics it enables, does it not therefore become "neutral?" And is this not like
                saying that guns are innocent of any ethical association with murder? There are
                arguments to this effect, of course, and they are often refuted simply by noting
                that while a pistol might well be used to drive a nail, its "intended use" suggests
                that ethical intentions are already inscribed in the object itself. Then again, the
                idea that technologies define the regime of political activity (as opposed to
                serving as the instrumental outcome of political goals) makes some sense of the
                numerous occasions in which individual technologists appear innocent of the horrors
                with which their inventions come to be implicated. Richard Jordan Gatling
                (1818&#8211;1903), among the more important figures in the development of the modern
                machine gun, offers a classic example. Having noticed that most soldiers in the
                American Civil War were dying of sickness and disease (as opposed to gunshots):</p>
            <cit>
                <quote rend="block"> It occurred to me that if I could invent a machine gun which
                    could by its rapidity of fire, enable one man to do as much battle duty as a
                    hundred, that it would, to a large extent supersede the necessity of large
                    armies, and consequently, exposure to battle and disease would be greatly
                        diminished.<ptr target="#wahl1965"/></quote>
            </cit>
            <p>Even if one accuses Gatling of outright moral stupidity, we are still left with the
                task of providing an account of his role in the creation of the modern screw
                propeller. That, after all, is an essential element of every nuclear submarine
                &#8212; a weapon capable of creating levels of suffering and catastrophe of which
                Gatling could not possibly have conceived. One could, indeed, multiply such examples
                endlessly. A graduate student with no other purpose save better soybean production
                invents Agent Orange. A researcher interested in studying learning, creates a tool
                (the IQ test) beloved of crazed eugenicists to this day. The first thing ever played
                over a loudspeaker to a crowd were Christmas carols; it wasn't long before Joseph
                Goebbels was among the first to realize its far more insidious capabilities. So
                while we cannot declare technology neutral, we can &#8212; at least in many cases
                &#8212; proclaim individual technologists to be, at worst, unwitting instruments of
                forces of which they are mostly unaware. "Technology is not politically neutral" is,
                in all such cases, a statement not about some individual mechanism, but about a
                record of instrumental usage pondered with a good deal of hindsight.</p>
            <p>Second: Do not such technologies serve the politics of skepticism equally? Yes, but
                here Oakeschott's identification of these two tendencies as distinctive of modernity
                becomes most legible. The ancient empires maintained their vast domains under arms
                and with what methods of surveillance they could muster. But in such technologically
                "primitive" circumstances, even the politics of skepticism cannot fully emerge. The
                Roman Empire (or the Persian, or the Han) could perhaps hope to avoid strife among a
                subjected people inconveniently occupying (and in many cases, constituting) the
                resources they hoped to exploit, but they could not &#8212; and over time, proved
                themselves largely unable to &#8212; develop a vision of, and a set of robust
                institutions for, the prevention of local conflict borne of nothing more than
                proximity (the imposition of peace for its own sake, or perhaps "peace as ideology"
                or as normative political calculus). As for the politics of faith: Even if the Roman
                imperial cult had had any aspirations toward human perfectibility (and it certainly
                did not), it is extremely difficult to imagine how that might have been efficiently
                maintained by Rome even in the less remote regions of the empire. Where no obvious
                means are available, no obvious ends can properly emerge. Yet late antiquity also
                sees the rise of Stoicism, Epicureanism, and eventually Christianity as popular
                forms of social and religious thought. And while none of these creeds (at least in
                their original, ideal forms) ever succeeds in formulating a concrete political
                vision, one could scarcely summon more incandescent instances in which the
                perfectibility of the human person is assumed.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is important to note that the question to which Oakeshott's thesis is
                directed is not primarily that to which the two tendencies offer themselves as
                solutions ("What shall government do?"), but rather as a way of explaining the
                ambivalence and ambiguity of modern political discourse. That we do not possess a
                clear scientific vocabulary with such terms as "right," "justice," "order,"
                "freedom," "democracy," "socialism," or, for that matter, "governance" (one could
                extend this list infinitely) is a function of the fact that all such terms are ever
                destined to serve two masters. Each appears &#8212; with radically different
                meanings &#8212; in both the politics of faith and the politics of skepticism.
                Attempts to specify them further with supposedly more precise adjectives &#8212;
                    <soCalled>"natural</soCalled> rights," <soCalled>"democratic</soCalled>
                socialism," <soCalled>"individual</soCalled> freedom" &#8212; only serve to deepen
                the rift. Nowhere is this more evident than in the term "social justice" as used in
                contemporary anglophone political discourse. Those more aligned with the politics of
                faith would very much like the adjective "social" to act as a useful clarification,
                and even perhaps to render the entire term slightly innocuous (who, after all, could
                object to a "just society?"). For those inspired by skepticism, though, the term is
                an obvious shibboleth suggestive of an entirely activist and progressive stance. For
                some, the term can only be employed with yet another qualification: "the social
                justice <soCalled>warrior"</soCalled> who takes up arms against all that is good and
                decent in a politics manifestly focused on what is traditional and sensible.</p>
            <p>It should surprise us not at all, though, to discover that our own political
                aspirations as academics &#8212; our desire to be politically relevant and
                politically engaged &#8212; is a technologically-enabled manifestation of the
                politics of faith. The humanities, and in particular, the humanities as it is
                practiced and taught in higher education, has seldom had any other goal than the
                cultivation of human "consciousness." And by "consciousness," we of course mean,
                quite unapologetically, "better" and "higher" consciousness. Other reasons might be
                summoned. "Good citizenship" is still frequently mentioned, and preparation for more
                concrete endeavors (law, business, medicine, or ministry) remains a sturdy rationale
                in some quarters. But all such teleologies only reframe the centrality of
                "consciousness" or "awareness" as ends in themselves. Art for art's sake (we can
                substitute any humanistic discipline we like for "art" in this venerable
                formulation) is perhaps a part of the calculation for some, but even the most ardent
                admirers of Shakespeare will surely see the absurdity of spending enormous sums of
                money in order to provide their children with four years of aesthetic rapture. If
                politics is our goal, the elitism of this proverb becomes self-refuting. Yet the
                study of literature and art, culture and history, philosophy and politics &#8212;
                even in their most narrow and specialized forms &#8212; can all be enfolded into the
                capacious realm of "consciousness." If the humanities has a politics, it is a
                politics that relies heavily on the idea of human perfectibility. Skeptics we may
                be, but we are not practitioners of the <soCalled>politics</soCalled> of skepticism.
                Perhaps in other times and places, it has been precisely the purpose of higher
                education to do nothing more than fecklessly maintain existing structures bent on no
                more noble purpose than maintaining order within an eternally defective human
                community. But the humanities in particular &#8212; understood in as broad a way as
                possible &#8212; has perhaps never known such an academy, or has known it only as
                its natural enemy.</p>
            <p>But it is not our "liberalism" that makes this assignation relevant. The humanities
                has certainly also known, in prior ages, a politics of faith with entirely
                "conservative" ends in mind. Humanistic education has very often been conceived
                precisely as a way of policing racial, religious, gender, and class boundaries with
                the quite obvious goal of "perfecting" those who are conceived as worthy of
                perfection, and who will perforce rule those less enlightened. Even the apparent
                move to popularize humanistic knowledge that prevailed in the first half of the
                twentieth century in both the U.S. and the U.K. <title rend="inline">(Great Books of
                    the Western World,</title> the launch of Penguin Books, <title rend="inline">The
                    Loeb Classical Library)</title> left no doubt as to who was properly in charge
                of perfection.</p>
            <p>The trouble, of course, is that the humanities are hardly the only manifestation of
                the politics of faith in modern society. For surely, one could not find a more
                luminous example of the politics of faith than Silicon Valley and all its works. We
                are subjected daily to its inexorable reframing of human desire and human potential
                &#8212; a torrent of "apps" and "sites" focused not merely on idle pleasures and
                diversions, but (more crucially) on "wellness;" on the virtues of being
                hyper-informed and aware of whatever occupies the instant; on the transhuman fantasy
                of the "quantified" self; on the essential excellence of various "balances"
                (work/life, self/other, body/spirit); on happiness in the fullest, and even the most
                ancient sense of the word; and, of course, "productivity" as a morally efficacious
                activity. Such bids for human perfectibility are irreducibly voluntarist in almost
                every sense of the term. In fact, they are so committed to the idea that our beliefs
                are entirely ours to choose without interference, that it is not even clear that
                those who are manifestly engaged in the manipulation of our desires and beliefs
                regard it as manipulation. Within the totalizing logic of the market, one
                experiences coercion as merely the marriage of two freedoms: the freedom to buy and
                the freedom to sell. That this will absolutely lead to the purchase of many more
                iPhones escapes no one at all; the only question is how to expand this logic further
                afield, so that more might come to know the salvation on offer. The anxious ethical
                dilemmas of former ages can be dispensed with in a phrase: "Don't be evil."</p>
            <p>Both visions are enabled by the same sources of power: the "banking and book-keeping,
                the records, registers, files, passports, dossiers and indexes." Or rather, by the
                "intoxicating increase" of their digital successors: the user profiles, digital
                signatures, and network graphs; the mining and the analytics; the ability not only
                to account for the present, but perhaps even to predict the future (the heretofore
                unattainable dream of every king). The "corporatization" of the university is, in
                fact, precisely this: a conception of the way we undertake political arrangements
                within the university now made available by data, metrics, a concern with measurable
                outcomes, and the (invariably digital) tools that have brought these affordances
                into view.</p>
            <p>Still, if the matter of 'how one uses the tools'' has any intelligibility at all (as
                a spectrum of ethical choices and options), that intelligibility lies mainly with
                the perfectibility one has in mind. And on this point, Silicon Valley and the
                humanistic academy are almost incommensurable paradigms. Where the one posits a
                genial and mostly circumscribed "wellness," the other repeatedly and eternally
                offers the same as speculation and question. One has a short attention span; the
                other remains irrefragably committed to the <soCalled>longue durée</soCalled>. One
                quantifies the self; the other complicates it and rediscovers it. One loves binary
                terms; the other approaches them archly and with suspicion. Voluntaristic
                conceptions of belief (says <soCalled>Humanitas)</soCalled> are just so many shadows
                on the wall of the cave; one can scarcely imagine a class in the humanities that
                does not begin with the observation of its fatuousness and propose a journey
                (however tortuous an inconclusive) upward. That it is not possible to discover
                    <soCalled>in the tools themselves</soCalled> some sort of political meaning that
                is ontologically prior to these commitments should perhaps not deter us from
                declaring them "not political neutral," but it should render a great number of
                common statements about the politics of tools at least banal if not tautological. It
                matters not at all that one might compose either <title rend="inline">Mein
                    Kampf</title>
                <soCalled>or</soCalled> the Sermon on the Mount using a word processor. It might
                matter a great deal that neither one, as a matter of historical fact, was produced
                with this particular technology. To speak of such matters is not to locate one means
                with two entirely different ends, but rather two means fully and distinctly defined
                by ends that are not entirely void of metaphysical similarity.</p>
            <p>None of this absolves digital humanities of anything. Even with radically different
                &#8212; and even opposed &#8212; teleologies in view, the fact that so many of our
                tools and techniques are handed to us by an industry with its own distinct politics
                of faith suggests, at least, a hardy vigilance. That we might merely advance and
                channel, and thus fail to resist, "today's great postindustrial, neoliberal,
                corporate, and global flows of information-cum-capital" remains a possibility. But
                the mere use of digital tools does not automatically forecast that failure, and the
                adumbration of a supposedly "activist" form of digital humanities work does not
                guarantee success. If that failure were to come, it could only come from a disavowal
                of the far grander aims of the humanities itself. Breaking "faith" with that vision,
                however ramified in its possibilities and articulations, would be devastating
                indeed. At the edge of that event horizon, digital humanities would not even succeed
                in being what its most bitter detractors imagine it to be. At that point, no one
                would be capable of asking the questions Liu asks, because "digital humanities" will
                have become something far worse than a paradox or an oxymoron. It will have become
                the quaint term of art once used by a benighted group who still believed that the
                humanities had purpose and meaning. On that day, the global flows of
                information-cum-capital &#8212; pursuing faith or skepticism as they please &#8212;
                will have presumably won.</p>
            <p>Oakeshott's formulation is extreme, because it suggests that the "intoxicating
                increase" of technological power is not some new affordance toward which the
                humanities may stand in some merely practical or instrumental way. On this account,
                one might say that the expansion of technological power created the digital
                humanities &#8212; making it not only possible, but conceivable. And following that
                thought to its conclusion, we find that the term "tool" is itself among the
                ambivalent and ambiguous terms of its political discourse, ever ready to be taken
                one way or another as one conceives or reconceives the nature of the humanities
                itself. Oakeshott, though, would claim a virtue in such ambiguity:</p>

                <quote rend="block"> Politics is a conversation between diverse interests, in which
                    activities that circumstantially limit one another are saved from violent
                    collision; and here, words (words, indeed, which have a continuous range of
                    meaning in which the extreme meanings are mediated to one another) may sometimes
                    serve our turn better than a scientific vocabulary designed to exclude all
                        doubleness.<ptr target="#oakeshott1996"/>
                </quote>
            </cit>
            <p>To ask "What is the politics of tools?” is to ask a question as rife with possibility
                &#8212; and confusion &#8212; as "What is justice?” or "What is democracy?” We sense
                that there are such things as justice and democracy, and we likewise suspect that
                tools "have a politics.” But as with justice and democracy, one might more
                profitably ask what underlies our deployment of tools as political
                interventions.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this is only to restate Liu’s complaint in slightly different terms.
                Certainly, nothing in the preceding discussion lessens the urgency of our need to
                avoid "just pressing the execute button” on our projects. Still, one must
                acknowledge that accurate assessment of the political meaning of our tools is no
                easy matter, and certainly not a simple matter of, as Liu put it, "scaling” our
                thinking about metadata into "thinking critically about the power, finance, and
                other governance protocols of the world.” If, in fact, it is true that our
                tool-building, while favoring a politics of faith, cannot define or predict the
                specific political arrangements that may later arise, we should perhaps be most
                circumspect not when we are tempted to imagine our efforts to be neutral, but rather
                when we imagine our tools to be acts of "resistance” or outright political activism.
                The former indicates a fallacy to which any humanist at all is hopefully alive; the
                latter, though, reflects a potentially more dangerous naiveté about the outworkings
                of power. Ethical thinking, political responsibility, and critique are undoubtedly
                obligations of the present. But thinking critically about the politics of our tools
                must surely also mean a certain skepticism toward the essential goodness of what we
                are doing. The future that awaits may well realize entire political formations on
                the basis of our endeavors; they may also, despite our best efforts and loudest
                protestations, turn our efforts to political ends entirely opposed to those for
                which we now long..</p>
