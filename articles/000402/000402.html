                  <p>The proliferation of tools that enable anyone to create visualizations of their
                     data, even with limited experience or skills, has made data visualization more
                     accessible than ever before. This is true in its use in both teaching and
                     learning, as data visualization has increasingly taken on an important
                     pedagogical role in the classroom and in scholarly research. However, with this
                     proliferation of tools there has been a concomitant awareness that visualization
                     needs to be employed through a critical lens that acknowledges its
                     constructedness as explanatory medium and as a product of situated knowledges.
                     Here, I describe one approach to teaching this notion of constructedness via a
                     framework oriented around information literacy, which encourages critical
                     engagement with data, the tools we use to interrogate them, and the
                     visualizations we design to represent them. I describe this approach through a
                     collection of “critical dichotomies” used to evaluate the
                     authority and value of visualizations, which are mapped to a subset of the core
                     information literacy competencies defined in the <cite class="title italic">ACRL
                        Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education</cite>. To put these
                     dichotomies into practice, I further describe an interactive activity called
                     “Choose Your Own Adventure, with Data
                     Visualization,” in which participants are given paper and markers to
                     create booklets in the style of <cite class="title italic">Choose Your Own
                        Adventure</cite> books and asked to consider the relationship between
                     active choices in the design process of a visualization and how a given
                     visualization is interpreted. In the process, I explore how this framework can
                     encourage us all, as critical practitioners of visualization, to think about the
                     practical relationship between data visualization and information literacy more
                     generally.

                     (2011), Johanna Drucker urged the adoption of new language to encourage scholars
                     to think about data, their visual representation, and the nature of our
                     interpretation of them in a discourse more inclusive of humanistic and
                     qualitative modes of inquiry: <em class="emph">capta</em>. “<em class="emph">Data</em> are <em class="emph">capta</em>,”
                     Drucker writes, continuing that data are “taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of
                     the phenomenal world, not inherent in it.” Whereas <em class="emph">capta</em>
                     are collected and parametrized in ways that depend directly upon the modes
                     through which we observe them – an act in which we ourselves are implicated as
                     collectors, reporters, and creators – <em class="emph">data</em> are often conceived as
                     existing a priori, waiting around somewhere to be observed. Thus, whereas
                     <em class="emph">data</em> presumes observer independence and absolutism,
                     <em class="emph">capta</em> acknowledges the situatedness and observer codependence
                     of the interpretive act. Reinterpreted through another frame, these sentiments
                     are echoed by scholars such as Catherine D’Ignazio and Hill et al. who write on
                     feminist perspectives on data, noting that feminist frameworks about the
                     situatedness of knowledge can be helpful for thinking about how we engage with
                     data and their representations as objective representations of reality [<a class="ref" href="#dignazio2015">D’Ignazio 2015</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hill2016">Hill et al. 2016</a>]. Zooming out further, such interrogations of the
                     social and technological pedigrees of objectivity and neutrality have been
                     increasingly found in other disciplines as well, such as science and technology
                     studies [<a class="ref" href="#daston2007">Daston and Galison 2007</a>], critical cartography [<a class="ref" href="#crampton2006">Crampton and Krygier 2006</a>], and critical race theory [<a class="ref" href="#gillborn2018">Gillborn et al. 2018</a>], to name a few.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Examined through these lenses, it appears there is no shortage of humanistic
                     inquiry into the privileged authority granted to objective expressions of the
                     phenomenal world that are pervasive in quantitative research, reinvigorated by
                     the data-dense environment of the current age. Moving from data to their visual
                     representation, then, requires few leaps to see the consequences that a
                     framework oriented around situated knowledge has on how we engage with the media
                     we use to interpret them. To think in these terms is to conceive of data
                     communicated in visually or graphically motivated form – a data visualization –
                     as constructed space, one in which the value of a visualization is inflected by
                     the cultural and political forces embedded within the design choices of its
                     creator and the interpretive act of the user. While we may perceive
                     visualizations as objective, complete, and authoritative [<a class="ref" href="#kennedy2016">Kennedy et al. 2016</a>], the reality is that they too are constructed, just
                     as the <em class="emph">capta</em> that underlie them are themselves. And yet, the
                     visualization still often stands for, in one-to-one identity, that which it
                     actually represents, as a statement of fact. As Drucker more recently notes
                     (2017), we continue to prioritize approaches to visualization that assume this
                     one-to-one correspondence: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           In a representational paradigm,
                           the relation between data and display is uni-directional, the data
                           precede the display, and the data are presumed to have some reliable
                           representational relation to the phenomena from which they have been
                           abstracted. The display functions as a surrogate for the data — which is
                           itself a surrogate, adequate or inadequate, for some phenomena. Simply
                           put, the display stands for the data, is a re-presentation of the data.
                           But visualizations are generally taken to be a presentation, a statement
                           (of fact, or argument, or process), rather than a representation
                           (surrogate) produced by a complex process…Instead, we should consider
                           that visualizations are usually representations (constructions) passing
                           themselves off as presentations (statements of self-evident
                           fact).
                            [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2017">Drucker 2017</a>]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> Understood in this way, objectivity in visual representation is thus
                     inherently compromised by the intervention of human hands; when the
                     visualization itself stands in as surrogate for that which is beneath it, what
                     results is the illusion that mediated knowledge is actually absolute if
                     interrogated and framed in the rightly-phrased way.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> These perspectives are not particularly new, but what is momentous is their
                     interrogation in those domains that are grappling with the role of the
                     computational and quantitative in the scholarly process – including digital
                     humanities. Across the humanities disciplines that have integrated computational
                     modes of analysis, data visualization (or information visualization) is an
                     increasingly dominant force, and as such it carries with it the requisite
                     challenges that accompany any new medium or discourse of analysis employed in
                     humanistic scholarship and teaching. Given visual representation conceived as
                     constructed space, how do we validate the authority and utility of visualization
                     as both process and artifact of research, especially with the proliferation of
                     tools that make creating data visualizations easy with minimal user
                     intervention? From a critical theory perspective, this is an important question.
                     To explore this question is to formulate a more holistic understanding of
                     visualization and its consequences in both theory and practice, one that
                     accounts for not only visualization in the methodological domain but also the
                     social, ethical, political, and epistemological ones [<a class="ref" href="#kennedy2016">Kennedy et al. 2016</a>]. In short, this means literacies in many forms that extend beyond the written
                     word – numerical, graphical/visual, information – that enable the individual to
                     critically engage with data, the tools that organize and engage with them, and
                     the visual representations we craft of them to facilitate interpretation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> Becoming critical practitioners of data and visualization in this way can happen
                     via many modalities and in many spaces. Perhaps surprisingly, I argue that
                     libraries are among those spaces that are naturally positioned to encourage this
                     kind of engagement, given their interest in information literacy, and libraries
                     can offer useful entry points for considering how such literacies around data
                     and visualization might be integrated into the curriculum. A clear example of
                     this is offered by the <cite class="title italic">ACRL Framework for Information
                        Literacy in Higher Education</cite>, which outlines six core frames or
                     competencies in information literacy around which libraries are encouraged to
                     provide support [<a class="ref" href="#acrl2016">ACRL Board 2016</a>]. These frames emphasize the
                     theoretical underpinnings necessary for handling information with a critical
                     eye, defining information literacy “as
                     the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of
                     information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued,
                     and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating
                     ethically in communities of learning.” Data, as one particular
                     expression of information, falls within the purview of information literacy [<a class="ref" href="#koltay2017">Koltay 2017</a>] – and by extension, I argue, as do those
                     representations based on data with which we commonly engage, including
                     visualization.

                     towards data- and computation-motivated modes of scholarly inquiry, exploring
                     what it means from the perspective of librarianship to critically engage with

                        constructed space</em> perspectives described above, two of these
                     prescribed frames emerge as being particularly significant. In the first of
                     these, <em class="emph">Authority is constructed and contextual</em>, the <cite class="title italic">Framework</cite> notes that the authority of information is a
                     product of many intersecting influences and may be fluid depending upon the
                     context in which it is created and used. Accordingly, mastery of this frame
                     indicates an understanding of “the need to
                     determine the validity of the information created by different authorities
                     and to acknowledge biases that privilege some sources of authority over
                     others, especially in terms of others’ worldviews, gender, sexual
                     orientation, and cultural orientations.” Meanwhile, the second frame,
                     <em class="emph">Information creation as a process</em>, emphasizes the idea that the
                     quality, meaning, and value of information is a product of the processes of
                     scholarship in which it is created. “Recognizing the nature of information creation,” this frame asserts,
                     “experts look to the underlying processes
                     of creation as well as the final product to critically evaluate the
                     usefulness of the information.” In this way, the <cite class="title italic">Framework</cite> offers a useful backdrop against which critical thinking
                     about information visualization can be taught.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In the Northeastern University Library, where support services are available to
                     researchers in the campus community around information visualization and design,
                     these basic concepts are taught and discussed through “critical
                     dichotomies” that can help guide our thinking about specific
                     design choices we make in the creative process of data visualization (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). These dichotomies are conceptualized as
                     modes of wayfinding for evaluating the design choices we make in the process of
                     creating a visualization, emphasizing the idea that design is an embodied
                     process, not merely an endpoint. By examining these dichotomies, I argue, we can
                     become better-equipped to critically dissect the meaning, value, and authority
                     of a particular visualization, following the guidelines of the frames described
                     above, given the contexts in which it is created and interpreted. These

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The first of these dichotomies is <em class="emph">proxy and artifact</em>, which
                     encourages design choices that principally reflect real observed changes in data
                     as opposed to those that suggest the appearance of patterns that are actually
                     artifacts of human perception. Research in cognitive science and psychology has
                     shown that human visual perception is susceptible to biases that can distort
                     what we see. Optical illusions, for example, achieve this effect of distortion
                     by taking advantage of the limitations and inaccuracies of human vision to
                     create mismatches between what the brain believes it is seeing and what it is
                     actually seeing. As a result, human eyes can be tricked into seeing shapes and
                     colors that are not physically present by merely combining elements of geometry,
                     color, and space to artificially alter the perspective that the brain constructs
                     in the process of perception [<a class="ref" href="#meirelles2013">Meirelles 2013</a>]. In the process of
                     designing a visualization, these effects can arise as well in ways we may not
                     notice. A good example is the use of perceptually non-uniform color palettes in
                     visualizations, especially with respect to the widely-used rainbow color scheme,
                     which can produce impressions of artificial boundaries between hues and
                     consequently artificial boundaries in data [<a class="ref" href="#borland2007">Borland 2007</a>]. In the
                     language of capta, the proxy/artifact dichotomy emphasizes the constructedness
                     of interpreted meaning in a visualization, especially when that meaning is
                     facilitated by design choices that prioritize approaches to visualization that
                     presume a visualization stands in as declarative presentation of the data that
                     precede it. In this sense, this dichotomy also maps to the frame <em class="emph">Authority
                        is constructed and contextual</em>, emphasizing the role that design can
                     specifically play in crafting the relative perceived authority of any given
                     visualization.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">The second critical dichotomy is <em class="emph">parsimony and diminishing returns</em>.
                     Modeled after Edward Tufte’s data-ink ratio concept, which argues that the
                     amount of ink in a visualization should change proportionately with changes in
                     the data that such ink represents [<a class="ref" href="#tufte2001">Tufte 2001</a>], this dichotomy
                     aims to remind us that not all design choices are made equal in their
                     contribution to a visualization. While the addition of data, ink, and complexity
                     to a visualization may be accompanied by a proportional increase in meaning,
                     value, and utility up to a certain point, there are additions to a design of the
                     type that yield no appreciable return in the efficacy of what it is trying to
                     communicate. Thus, <em class="emph">parsimony and diminishing returns</em> encourages an
                     economical understanding of data visualization, arguing that good design is a
                     careful balance between choices that maximize the message being communicated and
                     the aesthetics of the medium through which that communication occurs. Such a
                     framing encourages a tighter hermeneutical association between data and their
                     visualization by minimizing the space for purely positivist and representational
                     channels for crafting meaning in data. This dichotomy also points attention to
                     the notion of information creation as process, whereby the meaning and value of
                     a visualization is tightly coupled to the procedure by which it is created.

                     describes the wide range of scales and resolutions across which visualizations
                     operate in practical usage. In the language of Franco Moretti, this is also
                     understood as the relationship between distant and close reading of a text;
                     through visualization, we may switch between a close reading of a set of data
                     that emphasizes a high degree of detail in the data or a more distant reading
                     that emphasizes the bigger picture of patterns in the data [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>]. When we design a visualization, we must maintain
                     awareness of these different levels of understanding as the resolution at which
                     we communicate our message informs the ways in which that message may be
                     interpreted – put another way, the ways in which our data become crafted,
                     composed, and graphically motivated.

                     reassessment of objectives and assumptions in the choices we make. The final
                     critical dichotomy, which is <em class="emph">authority and bias</em>, maps primarily to
                     the frame of <em class="emph">Authority is constructed and contextual</em>. In this
                     dichotomy, we are reminded that there is no such thing as the singular
                     visualization, the best possible visual representation of a set of data.
                     Instead, any single visualization grabs only a differential slice of a larger
                     narrative, and it is incumbent upon us as practitioners of information design to
                     remember that for any one visual representation, there are many other
                     possibilities that have not been expressed. In this way, signatures of authority
                     and bias operate in tension with one another because a visualization is at once
                     a statement of information authority and the product of a design process that is
                     intrinsically biased by the motivations of the designer and interpreter.

                     This framework is built upon a set of design elements (i.e., preattentive
                     graphical elements and visual encodings used in visualization design, like
                     color, symbol, size, and length [<a class="ref" href="#ware2008">Ware 2008</a>]) from which
                     transformations, or manipulations of design elements, may be used to engender
                     narrative shifts, or ways the meaning or interpretation of a visualization can
                     be shifted. These transformations and shifts include typical manipulations
                     commonly seen in visualizations, such as skewing or truncating axes to
                     exaggerate or minimize trends, as well as less noticeable manipulations, like
                     the use of perceptually non-uniform color palettes to exaggerate effects in data
                     based on proportional design area (such as when coloring geographic or cadastral
                     maps). By examining how these manipulations occur organically in examples of
                     real visualizations seen in the academic literature and popular media, students
                     become better-equipped to recognize manipulations in the visualizations they

                     practical, and engaging ways. What does it mean to practically apply these
                     concepts in the process of visualizing data, and how do the impressions they

                     becomes possible to engage participants in discussion about how small changes in
                     design can result in significant changes in the meaning communicated by a

                     <a href="#table02">Table 2</a>, are taken from Tyler Vigen’s website
                     <cite class="title italic">Spurious Correlations</cite><a class="noteRef" href="#d4e551">[2]</a>, a
                     collection of visualizations that demonstrate humorous examples of variables
                     that appear to be correlated statistically but have no real-life causal
                     connection between them. After this, participants are asked to choose six to
                     eight outcomes from the narrative shift options provided, as well as two to
                     three different kinds of visualizations (for example, bar charts and line
                     charts) to use in constructing those narrative shifts. For each narrative shift
                     outcome, the participant draws out the different transformation step sequences
                     required to reach it, using the design transformation techniques presented.
                     Finally, once the sequential visualizations for each narrative shift outcome are
                     all created, the participants number the pages, fill in any page references
                     within the book structure, and assemble the book’s pages with a stapler.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">In the process of creating these books, participants are asked to think about the
                     design choices they commonly make when creating visualizations of their own as
                     well as the design elements they encounter in visualizations on a daily basis.
                     To guide this thinking, the following questions are asked as participants work
                     with their data:&#x2028; 
                     <ul class="list">
                        <li class="item">What patterns appear to be intrinsic to the sets of data being used,
                           and how do we validate the truthfulness of those patterns? 
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">What conclusions emerge organically from those patterns, and what
                           conclusions may be crafted? 
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">How do we confirm or dispute the validity of those conclusions? </li>
                        <li class="item">What knowledge do those conclusions impart, and how is that knowledge
                           motivated by the way the data are visualized? 
                        </li>
                        <li class="item">How can particular design choices be used to translate those patterns
                           into knowledge in a way that is faithful to the data themselves?
                        </li>
                     </ul> In this way, participants are encouraged to think of visualizations as
                     forms of dialogue rather than statements of fact – a nod to Drucker’s
                     characterization of the declarative nature of representational approaches to
                     visualization [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2017">Drucker 2017</a>]. When elements of design are
                     understood as the language and grammar used in expressing a narrative in
                     graphical form, it becomes easier to acknowledge the subjective nature of
                     visualization and representation.

                     small section from a completed book. In this example, two data sets are
                     selected: one about per capita consumption of whole milk in gallons from the
                     years 2000–2009, and another about the number of people killed by venomous
                     spiders over the same range of years. The book begins with an appeal to its
                     author: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p> Lo, brave traveler! The cosmic
                           guardians of data visualization have entrusted you with the task of sharing
                           their stories far and wide, spreading hope in the righteous use of
                           information design. To assist you on your journey along paths of perilous
                           design choices and misleading conclusions, the guardians have provided two
                           sets of data to be your lantern. Write these data on the following
                           page.
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> With this provocation, the participant is subsequently asked
                     to create the visualization paths for the book. In this example, the data about
                     venomous spider deaths is used to create a line chart. This line chart is then
                     manipulated by skewing the range of the y-axis, which leads to an outcome page.
                     Here, the outcome that results is a flattening of the variability in the data by
                     reducing the range of the axis, making it appear as though deaths due to
                     venomous spiders are low and invariable.

                     <cite class="title italic">ACRL Framework</cite> stated above. By physically
                     going through the process of manipulating simple visualizations and creating
                     their own books, participants are invited to reflect on the idea that
                     information creation is indeed a process, one that is mired in a complex
                     intersection of influences and biases that informs how a visualization may be
                     interpreted. Likewise, participants also see that authority is indeed
                     contextual, the value and meaning of a visualization being directly dependent
                     upon those influences and biases. By engaging with the medium of data
                     visualization through the ““Choose Your Own
                     Adventure”” activity, participants are encouraged to consider what it
                     means to be more critical practitioners of data visualization in these frames in
                     their own scholarship and daily lives. And in that process, thinking about data
                     as capta becomes an embodied act, particularly as participants explore what it
                     means to parse out the design process of a visualization in a way that makes the
                     visualization more self-aware.

                     fun for thinking about the critical choices they make when designing a
                     visualization. It also benefitted from the added bonus of providing participants
                     with something tangible to take away from the workshop, to which they could
                     refer in the future when designing their own visualizations. The only major
                     challenge to the activity is the often limited availability of time – at least
                     one hour is needed to provide plenty of space for creative expression and
                     critical assessment.

                     scholarship and teaching, there has been a concomitant increase in the
                     recognized importance of being able to engage with visualization critically.
                     Here, I described one approach to supporting this kind of critical engagement as
                     expressed through competencies in information literacy, leveraging the <cite class="title italic">ACRL Framework</cite>, a collection of critical dichotomies
                     for evaluating visualizations, and an activity that seeks to teach these
                     concepts in the format of a <cite class="title italic">Choose Your Own
                        Adventure</cite> book. Collectively, this approach emphasizes the active
                     role the individual plays in designing and interpreting visualizations,
                     encouraging students to interrogate what it means to conceptualize visualization
                     as a creative, constructive medium where representation is discursive rather
                     than absolutely defined.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Designing for data visualization in this way requires a holistic view of the
                     complex relationships that exist between all entities involved, including data,
                     representation (visualization), designer, and user. When considered as a complex
                     system of interactions and conversations between these entities, the design of a
                     visualization becomes an exercise in which we are actively engaged with the
                     discursive dimensions of data and information. This discursive dimension is a
                     reflection of Drucker’s definition of <span class="hi italic">capta</span>, which
                     emphasizes the ways in which we are fundamentally implicated in the construction
                     of data and their representation we may conventionally perceive as static,
                     absolute, objective, and authoritative. An understanding of these relationships
                     is essential for engaging holistically with visualization as a medium of
                     knowledge, and as a result, it is important to acknowledge the influence that
                     our conceptions of information, knowledge, and the relationship between them –
                     as evidenced by the critical dichotomies described above – impart to the design
                     process.

                     effectively teach core competencies around critical thinking in information
                     design, especially when framed around concepts in information literacy. As
                     information design is itself a creative act, pedagogical approaches that are
                     inherently creative and experientially oriented can play a significant role in
                     generating tangible, hands-on understanding of highly abstract concepts. In the
                     process, students can be encouraged to assess the ways in which they form
                     relationships between information and their representation, at the same time
                     tuning into the constructedness of data. By understanding visualization as a
                     medium for exposing these relationships, students can become better equipped to
                     be critical practitioners of all forms of visual representation, not only as
                     designers but also as consumers.
