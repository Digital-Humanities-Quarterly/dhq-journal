                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>The proliferation of tools that enable anyone to create visualizations of their
                    data, even with limited experience or skills, has made data visualization more
                    accessible than ever before. This is true in its use in both teaching and
                    learning, as data visualization has increasingly taken on an important
                    pedagogical role in the classroom and in scholarly research. However, with this
                    proliferation of tools there has been a concomitant awareness that visualization
                    needs to be employed through a critical lens that acknowledges its
                    constructedness as explanatory medium and as a product of situated knowledges.
                    Here, I describe one approach to teaching this notion of constructedness via a
                    framework oriented around information literacy, which encourages critical
                    engagement with data, the tools we use to interrogate them, and the
                    visualizations we design to represent them. I describe this approach through a
                    collection of <soCalled>critical dichotomies</soCalled> used to evaluate the
                    authority and value of visualizations, which are mapped to a subset of the core
                    information literacy competencies defined in the <title rend="italic">ACRL
                        Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education</title>. To put these
                    dichotomies into practice, I further describe an interactive activity called
                        <title rend="quotes">Choose Your Own Adventure, with Data
                        Visualization,</title> in which participants are given paper and markers to
                    create booklets in the style of <title rend="italic">Choose Your Own
                        Adventure</title> books and asked to consider the relationship between
                    active choices in the design process of a visualization and how a given
                    visualization is interpreted. In the process, I explore how this framework can
                    encourage us all, as critical practitioners of visualization, to think about the
                    practical relationship between data visualization and information literacy more
                    generally. </p>

                <head>From situated data to constructed visualization</head>
                <p>In <title rend="quotes">Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display</title>
                    (2011), Johanna Drucker urged the adoption of new language to encourage scholars
                    to think about data, their visual representation, and the nature of our
                    interpretation of them in a discourse more inclusive of humanistic and
                    qualitative modes of inquiry: <emph>capta</emph>. <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#drucker2011"><emph>Data</emph> are <emph>capta</emph>,</quote>
                    Drucker writes, continuing that data are <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#drucker2011">taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of
                        the phenomenal world, not inherent in it.</quote> Whereas <emph>capta</emph>
                    are collected and parametrized in ways that depend directly upon the modes
                    through which we observe them – an act in which we ourselves are implicated as
                    collectors, reporters, and creators – <emph>data</emph> are often conceived as
                    existing a priori, waiting around somewhere to be observed. Thus, whereas
                        <emph>data</emph> presumes observer independence and absolutism,
                        <emph>capta</emph> acknowledges the situatedness and observer codependence
                    of the interpretive act. Reinterpreted through another frame, these sentiments
                    are echoed by scholars such as Catherine D’Ignazio and Hill et al. who write on
                    feminist perspectives on data, noting that feminist frameworks about the
                    situatedness of knowledge can be helpful for thinking about how we engage with
                    data and their representations as objective representations of reality <ptr
                        target="#dignazio2015"/>
                    <ptr target="#hill2016"/>. Zooming out further, such interrogations of the
                    social and technological pedigrees of objectivity and neutrality have been
                    increasingly found in other disciplines as well, such as science and technology
                    studies <ptr target="#daston2007"/>, critical cartography <ptr
                        target="#crampton2006"/>, and critical race theory <ptr
                        target="#gillborn2018"/>, to name a few.</p>
                <p>Examined through these lenses, it appears there is no shortage of humanistic
                    inquiry into the privileged authority granted to objective expressions of the
                    phenomenal world that are pervasive in quantitative research, reinvigorated by
                    the data-dense environment of the current age. Moving from data to their visual
                    representation, then, requires few leaps to see the consequences that a
                    framework oriented around situated knowledge has on how we engage with the media
                    we use to interpret them. To think in these terms is to conceive of data
                    communicated in visually or graphically motivated form – a data visualization –
                    as constructed space, one in which the value of a visualization is inflected by
                    the cultural and political forces embedded within the design choices of its
                    creator and the interpretive act of the user. While we may perceive
                    visualizations as objective, complete, and authoritative <ptr
                        target="#kennedy2016"/>, the reality is that they too are constructed, just
                    as the <emph>capta</emph> that underlie them are themselves. And yet, the
                    visualization still often stands for, in one-to-one identity, that which it
                    actually represents, as a statement of fact. As Drucker more recently notes
                    (2017), we continue to prioritize approaches to visualization that assume this
                    one-to-one correspondence: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block" source="#drucker2017">In a representational paradigm,
                            the relation between data and display is uni-directional, the data
                            precede the display, and the data are presumed to have some reliable
                            representational relation to the phenomena from which they have been
                            abstracted. The display functions as a surrogate for the data — which is
                            itself a surrogate, adequate or inadequate, for some phenomena. Simply
                            put, the display stands for the data, is a re-presentation of the data.
                            But visualizations are generally taken to be a presentation, a statement
                            (of fact, or argument, or process), rather than a representation
                            (surrogate) produced by a complex process…Instead, we should consider
                            that visualizations are usually representations (constructions) passing
                            themselves off as presentations (statements of self-evident
                            fact).</quote>
                        <ptr target="#drucker2017"/>
                    </cit> Understood in this way, objectivity in visual representation is thus
                    inherently compromised by the intervention of human hands; when the
                    visualization itself stands in as surrogate for that which is beneath it, what
                    results is the illusion that mediated knowledge is actually absolute if
                    interrogated and framed in the rightly-phrased way.</p>
                <p> These perspectives are not particularly new, but what is momentous is their
                    interrogation in those domains that are grappling with the role of the
                    computational and quantitative in the scholarly process – including digital
                    humanities. Across the humanities disciplines that have integrated computational
                    modes of analysis, data visualization (or information visualization) is an
                    increasingly dominant force, and as such it carries with it the requisite
                    challenges that accompany any new medium or discourse of analysis employed in
                    humanistic scholarship and teaching. Given visual representation conceived as
                    constructed space, how do we validate the authority and utility of visualization
                    as both process and artifact of research, especially with the proliferation of
                    tools that make creating data visualizations easy with minimal user
                    intervention? From a critical theory perspective, this is an important question.
                    To explore this question is to formulate a more holistic understanding of
                    visualization and its consequences in both theory and practice, one that
                    accounts for not only visualization in the methodological domain but also the
                    social, ethical, political, and epistemological ones <ptr target="#kennedy2016"
                    />. In short, this means literacies in many forms that extend beyond the written
                    word – numerical, graphical/visual, information – that enable the individual to
                    critically engage with data, the tools that organize and engage with them, and
                    the visual representations we craft of them to facilitate interpretation. </p>
                <p> Becoming critical practitioners of data and visualization in this way can happen
                    via many modalities and in many spaces. Perhaps surprisingly, I argue that
                    libraries are among those spaces that are naturally positioned to encourage this
                    kind of engagement, given their interest in information literacy, and libraries
                    can offer useful entry points for considering how such literacies around data
                    and visualization might be integrated into the curriculum. A clear example of
                    this is offered by the <title rend="italic">ACRL Framework for Information
                        Literacy in Higher Education</title>, which outlines six core frames or
                    competencies in information literacy around which libraries are encouraged to
                    provide support <ptr target="#acrl2016"/>. These frames emphasize the
                    theoretical underpinnings necessary for handling information with a critical
                    eye, defining information literacy <quote rend="inline" source="#acrl2016">as
                        the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of
                        information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued,
                        and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating
                        ethically in communities of learning.</quote> Data, as one particular
                    expression of information, falls within the purview of information literacy <ptr
                        target="#koltay2017"/> – and by extension, I argue, as do those
                    representations based on data with which we commonly engage, including
                    visualization. </p>
                <p>In the Northeastern University Library, the competencies described in the <title
                        rend="italic">ACRL Framework</title> have become an integral component in
                    how concepts and principles in information design are taught in workshops,
                    lectures, and consultations. Given the university’s strategic orientation
                    towards data- and computation-motivated modes of scholarly inquiry, exploring
                    what it means from the perspective of librarianship to critically engage with
                    data visualization in increasingly interdisciplinary spaces has been a useful
                    exercise for collaborations with digital humanities researchers on campus. In
                    this paper, I describe how these elements of the <title rend="italic"
                        >Framework</title> manifest in my approach to teaching information literacy
                    through data visualization. I then describe one interactive activity I have
                    employed to teach these concepts that comes in the form of a <title
                        rend="italic">Choose Your Own Adventure</title> book, using data
                    visualization instead of prose as the medium of narrative. In the process, I
                    discuss the role that data visualization can more generally play in teaching
                    core competencies in information literacy.</p>

                    related to critical engagement with information sources more generally, it also

                    </list> When examined from the <emph>capta</emph> and <emph>visualization as
                        constructed space</emph> perspectives described above, two of these
                    prescribed frames emerge as being particularly significant. In the first of
                    these, <emph>Authority is constructed and contextual</emph>, the <title
                        rend="italic">Framework</title> notes that the authority of information is a
                    product of many intersecting influences and may be fluid depending upon the
                    context in which it is created and used. Accordingly, mastery of this frame
                    indicates an understanding of <quote rend="inline" source="#ACRL">the need to
                        determine the validity of the information created by different authorities
                        and to acknowledge biases that privilege some sources of authority over
                        others, especially in terms of others’ worldviews, gender, sexual
                        orientation, and cultural orientations.</quote> Meanwhile, the second frame,
                        <emph>Information creation as a process</emph>, emphasizes the idea that the
                    quality, meaning, and value of information is a product of the processes of
                    scholarship in which it is created. <quote rend="inline" source="#ACRL"
                        >Recognizing the nature of information creation,</quote> this frame asserts,

                        usefulness of the information.</quote> In this way, the <title rend="italic"
                        >Framework</title> offers a useful backdrop against which critical thinking
                    about information visualization can be taught. </p>
                <p>In the Northeastern University Library, where support services are available to
                    researchers in the campus community around information visualization and design,
                    these basic concepts are taught and discussed through <soCalled>critical
                        dichotomies</soCalled> that can help guide our thinking about specific
                    design choices we make in the creative process of data visualization (<ref
                        target="#figure01">Figure 1</ref>). These dichotomies are conceptualized as
                    modes of wayfinding for evaluating the design choices we make in the process of
                    creating a visualization, emphasizing the idea that design is an embodied
                    process, not merely an endpoint. By examining these dichotomies, I argue, we can
                    become better-equipped to critically dissect the meaning, value, and authority
                    of a particular visualization, following the guidelines of the frames described
                    above, given the contexts in which it is created and interpreted. These
                    dichotomies provide a theoretical foundation upon which practical design
                    considerations may be evaluated and through which a <emph>data as capta</emph>
                    perspective may be discussed.</p>
                <figure xml:id="figure01">
                    <head>Critical dichotomies in information visualization</head>
                    <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
                </figure>
                <p>The first of these dichotomies is <emph>proxy and artifact</emph>, which
                    encourages design choices that principally reflect real observed changes in data
                    as opposed to those that suggest the appearance of patterns that are actually
                    artifacts of human perception. Research in cognitive science and psychology has
                    shown that human visual perception is susceptible to biases that can distort
                    what we see. Optical illusions, for example, achieve this effect of distortion
                    by taking advantage of the limitations and inaccuracies of human vision to
                    create mismatches between what the brain believes it is seeing and what it is
                    actually seeing. As a result, human eyes can be tricked into seeing shapes and
                    colors that are not physically present by merely combining elements of geometry,
                    color, and space to artificially alter the perspective that the brain constructs
                    in the process of perception <ptr target="#meirelles2013"/>. In the process of
                    designing a visualization, these effects can arise as well in ways we may not
                    notice. A good example is the use of perceptually non-uniform color palettes in
                    visualizations, especially with respect to the widely-used rainbow color scheme,
                    which can produce impressions of artificial boundaries between hues and
                    consequently artificial boundaries in data <ptr target="#borland2007"/>. In the
                    language of capta, the proxy/artifact dichotomy emphasizes the constructedness
                    of interpreted meaning in a visualization, especially when that meaning is
                    facilitated by design choices that prioritize approaches to visualization that
                    presume a visualization stands in as declarative presentation of the data that
                    precede it. In this sense, this dichotomy also maps to the frame <emph>Authority
                        is constructed and contextual</emph>, emphasizing the role that design can
                    specifically play in crafting the relative perceived authority of any given
                    visualization.</p>
                <p>The second critical dichotomy is <emph>parsimony and diminishing returns</emph>.
                    Modeled after Edward Tufte’s data-ink ratio concept, which argues that the
                    amount of ink in a visualization should change proportionately with changes in
                    the data that such ink represents <ptr target="#tufte2001"/>, this dichotomy
                    aims to remind us that not all design choices are made equal in their
                    contribution to a visualization. While the addition of data, ink, and complexity
                    to a visualization may be accompanied by a proportional increase in meaning,
                    value, and utility up to a certain point, there are additions to a design of the
                    type that yield no appreciable return in the efficacy of what it is trying to
                    communicate. Thus, <emph>parsimony and diminishing returns</emph> encourages an
                    economical understanding of data visualization, arguing that good design is a
                    careful balance between choices that maximize the message being communicated and
                    the aesthetics of the medium through which that communication occurs. Such a
                    framing encourages a tighter hermeneutical association between data and their
                    visualization by minimizing the space for purely positivist and representational
                    channels for crafting meaning in data. This dichotomy also points attention to
                    the notion of information creation as process, whereby the meaning and value of
                    a visualization is tightly coupled to the procedure by which it is created.</p>
                <p>This dichotomy is followed by <emph>reductionism and holism</emph>, which
                    describes the wide range of scales and resolutions across which visualizations
                    operate in practical usage. In the language of Franco Moretti, this is also
                    understood as the relationship between distant and close reading of a text;
                    through visualization, we may switch between a close reading of a set of data
                    that emphasizes a high degree of detail in the data or a more distant reading
                    that emphasizes the bigger picture of patterns in the data <ptr
                        target="#moretti2013"/>. When we design a visualization, we must maintain
                    awareness of these different levels of understanding as the resolution at which
                    we communicate our message informs the ways in which that message may be
                    interpreted – put another way, the ways in which our data become crafted,
                    composed, and graphically motivated.</p>
                <p>Collectively, these first three dichotomies map to the <title rend="italic"
                        >Framework</title> frame of <emph>Information creation as a process</emph>,
                    highlighting the reality that the design of a visualization requires an ongoing
                    reassessment of objectives and assumptions in the choices we make. The final
                    critical dichotomy, which is <emph>authority and bias</emph>, maps primarily to
                    the frame of <emph>Authority is constructed and contextual</emph>. In this
                    dichotomy, we are reminded that there is no such thing as the singular
                    visualization, the best possible visual representation of a set of data.
                    Instead, any single visualization grabs only a differential slice of a larger
                    narrative, and it is incumbent upon us as practitioners of information design to
                    remember that for any one visual representation, there are many other
                    possibilities that have not been expressed. In this way, signatures of authority
                    and bias operate in tension with one another because a visualization is at once
                    a statement of information authority and the product of a design process that is
                    intrinsically biased by the motivations of the designer and interpreter. </p>
                <p>The concepts behind these dichotomies are taught in the Northeastern University
                    Library within a conceptual framework that discusses ways of building and
                    shifting visual narrative, as shown in <ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>.
                    This framework is built upon a set of design elements (i.e., preattentive
                    graphical elements and visual encodings used in visualization design, like
                    color, symbol, size, and length <ptr target="#ware2008"/>) from which
                    transformations, or manipulations of design elements, may be used to engender
                    narrative shifts, or ways the meaning or interpretation of a visualization can
                    be shifted. These transformations and shifts include typical manipulations
                    commonly seen in visualizations, such as skewing or truncating axes to
                    exaggerate or minimize trends, as well as less noticeable manipulations, like
                    the use of perceptually non-uniform color palettes to exaggerate effects in data
                    based on proportional design area (such as when coloring geographic or cadastral
                    maps). By examining how these manipulations occur organically in examples of
                    real visualizations seen in the academic literature and popular media, students
                    become better-equipped to recognize manipulations in the visualizations they
                    produce and encounter in their daily lives.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The use of real life examples of visualizations is a good starting point to help
                    students understand these concepts, but I have employed other more creative
                    strategies for enabling students to grapple with and apply them in direct,
                    practical, and engaging ways. What does it mean to practically apply these
                    concepts in the process of visualizing data, and how do the impressions they
                    leave behind in the design process inform interpretation of the final
                    visualization created? Put another way, what does it mean to create a
                    visualization that is self-aware, one in which the situatedness of its data (or
                    capta) is faithfully communicated? In one such strategy, I devised an activity
                    titled <title rend="quotes">Choose Your Own Adventure, with Data
                        Visualization.</title> In this activity, participants are asked to design
                    their own flipbook in the style of <title rend="italic">Choose Your Own
                        Adventure</title> books<note> The <title rend="italic">Choose Your Own
                            Adventure</title> series is based on a concept created by Edward Packard
                        and was originally published by Bantam Books.</note>, which are short novels
                    in which the reader is invited to follow multiple different possible storylines
                    based on prompts that follow branching page sequences. Using this format, it
                    becomes possible to engage participants in discussion about how small changes in
                    design can result in significant changes in the meaning communicated by a
                    visualization, especially when framed around the critical dichotomies described
                    above and their correlating interpretive shifts. </p>

                        <ref target="#table02">Table 2</ref>, are taken from Tyler Vigen’s website

                    collection of visualizations that demonstrate humorous examples of variables
                    that appear to be correlated statistically but have no real-life causal
                    connection between them. After this, participants are asked to choose six to
                    eight outcomes from the narrative shift options provided, as well as two to
                    three different kinds of visualizations (for example, bar charts and line
                    charts) to use in constructing those narrative shifts. For each narrative shift
                    outcome, the participant draws out the different transformation step sequences
                    required to reach it, using the design transformation techniques presented.
                    Finally, once the sequential visualizations for each narrative shift outcome are

                    within the book structure, and assemble the book’s pages with a stapler. </p>

                <p>In the process of creating these books, participants are asked to think about the
                    design choices they commonly make when creating visualizations of their own as
                    well as the design elements they encounter in visualizations on a daily basis.
                    To guide this thinking, the following questions are asked as participants work
                    with their data:  <list type="unordered">
                        <item>What patterns appear to be intrinsic to the sets of data being used,
                            and how do we validate the truthfulness of those patterns? </item>
                        <item>What conclusions emerge organically from those patterns, and what
                            conclusions may be crafted? </item>
                        <item>How do we confirm or dispute the validity of those conclusions? </item>
                        <item>What knowledge do those conclusions impart, and how is that knowledge
                            motivated by the way the data are visualized? </item>
                        <item>How can particular design choices be used to translate those patterns
                            into knowledge in a way that is faithful to the data themselves?</item>
                    </list> In this way, participants are encouraged to think of visualizations as
                    forms of dialogue rather than statements of fact – a nod to Drucker’s
                    characterization of the declarative nature of representational approaches to
                    visualization <ptr target="#drucker2017"/>. When elements of design are
                    understood as the language and grammar used in expressing a narrative in
                    graphical form, it becomes easier to acknowledge the subjective nature of
                    visualization and representation. </p>

                <p><ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref> provides the general process for creating
                    a book, and <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref> provides an example of a
                    small section from a completed book. In this example, two data sets are
                    selected: one about per capita consumption of whole milk in gallons from the
                    years 2000–2009, and another about the number of people killed by venomous
                    spiders over the same range of years. The book begins with an appeal to its
                    author: <quote rend="block" source="#private"> Lo, brave traveler! The cosmic
                        guardians of data visualization have entrusted you with the task of sharing
                        their stories far and wide, spreading hope in the righteous use of
                        information design. To assist you on your journey along paths of perilous
                        design choices and misleading conclusions, the guardians have provided two
                        sets of data to be your lantern. Write these data on the following
                        page.</quote> With this provocation, the participant is subsequently asked
                    to create the visualization paths for the book. In this example, the data about
                    venomous spider deaths is used to create a line chart. This line chart is then
                    manipulated by skewing the range of the y-axis, which leads to an outcome page.
                    Here, the outcome that results is a flattening of the variability in the data by
                    reducing the range of the axis, making it appear as though deaths due to
                    venomous spiders are low and invariable. </p>
                <p>In this way, participants are invited to engage with the two frames from the
                        <title rend="italic">ACRL Framework</title> stated above. By physically
                    going through the process of manipulating simple visualizations and creating
                    their own books, participants are invited to reflect on the idea that
                    information creation is indeed a process, one that is mired in a complex
                    intersection of influences and biases that informs how a visualization may be
                    interpreted. Likewise, participants also see that authority is indeed
                    contextual, the value and meaning of a visualization being directly dependent
                    upon those influences and biases. By engaging with the medium of data
                    visualization through the <title rend="quotes">Choose Your Own
                        Adventure</title> activity, participants are encouraged to consider what it
                    means to be more critical practitioners of data visualization in these frames in
                    their own scholarship and daily lives. And in that process, thinking about data
                    as capta becomes an embodied act, particularly as participants explore what it
                    means to parse out the design process of a visualization in a way that makes the
                    visualization more self-aware. </p>
                <p>This activity has been attempted twice, and both times it was received well
                    overall by participants, who found it to be an exercise that was both useful and
                    fun for thinking about the critical choices they make when designing a
                    visualization. It also benefitted from the added bonus of providing participants
                    with something tangible to take away from the workshop, to which they could
                    refer in the future when designing their own visualizations. The only major
                    challenge to the activity is the often limited availability of time – at least
                    one hour is needed to provide plenty of space for creative expression and
                    critical assessment. </p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p>As data visualization becomes an increasingly important and common tool in
                    scholarship and teaching, there has been a concomitant increase in the
                    recognized importance of being able to engage with visualization critically.
                    Here, I described one approach to supporting this kind of critical engagement as
                    expressed through competencies in information literacy, leveraging the <title
                        rend="italic">ACRL Framework</title>, a collection of critical dichotomies
                    for evaluating visualizations, and an activity that seeks to teach these
                    concepts in the format of a <title rend="italic">Choose Your Own
                        Adventure</title> book. Collectively, this approach emphasizes the active
                    role the individual plays in designing and interpreting visualizations,
                    encouraging students to interrogate what it means to conceptualize visualization
                    as a creative, constructive medium where representation is discursive rather
                    than absolutely defined.</p>
                <p>Designing for data visualization in this way requires a holistic view of the
                    complex relationships that exist between all entities involved, including data,
                    representation (visualization), designer, and user. When considered as a complex
                    system of interactions and conversations between these entities, the design of a
                    visualization becomes an exercise in which we are actively engaged with the
                    discursive dimensions of data and information. This discursive dimension is a
                    reflection of Drucker’s definition of <hi rend="italic">capta</hi>, which
                    emphasizes the ways in which we are fundamentally implicated in the construction
                    of data and their representation we may conventionally perceive as static,
                    absolute, objective, and authoritative. An understanding of these relationships
                    is essential for engaging holistically with visualization as a medium of
                    knowledge, and as a result, it is important to acknowledge the influence that
                    our conceptions of information, knowledge, and the relationship between them –
                    as evidenced by the critical dichotomies described above – impart to the design
                    process.</p>
                <p>Through creative activities like the one described here, it becomes easier to
                    effectively teach core competencies around critical thinking in information
                    design, especially when framed around concepts in information literacy. As
                    information design is itself a creative act, pedagogical approaches that are
                    inherently creative and experientially oriented can play a significant role in
                    generating tangible, hands-on understanding of highly abstract concepts. In the
                    process, students can be encouraged to assess the ways in which they form
                    relationships between information and their representation, at the same time
                    tuning into the constructedness of data. By understanding visualization as a
                    medium for exposing these relationships, students can become better equipped to
                    be critical practitioners of all forms of visual representation, not only as
                    designers but also as consumers.</p>
