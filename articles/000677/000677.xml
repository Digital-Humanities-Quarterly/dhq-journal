         <p>Along with the growth in Digital Humanities (DH) and Digital Scholarship (DS) as
                digital methods, resources, and tools for research, teaching and dissemination,
                interest in starting DH/DS centers as a means to support and sustain researchers and
                projects is fast increasing. There is a long history of successful DH/DS centers
                that accomplish these goals. Some early centers include Princeton and Rutgers’
                Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities (1991), The University of Virginia’s
                Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (1993), Brown University’s
                Scholarly Technology Group (1994) and ones at Oxford and King’s College London <ptr target="#fraistat2019"/>. For those leading these initiatives, it raises questions about the ways to
                engage possible stakeholders to develop support for a centre, apply existing models,
                secure funding sources, and many others. </p>
            
         <p>There have been various attempts to answer these questions and guide those wishing to
                start their own center. Efforts include workshops such as CNI-ARL’s one on planning
                a digital scholarship center <ptr target="#goldenberghart2016"/> and Flanders and Mylonas’ course at HILT <ptr target="#hilt2016"/>
            Intensive Learning and Teaching, 2016). To further aid nascent centers, centerNet <ptr target="#centernet2022"/>
                has developed a page of resources for starting and sustaining DH centers
                which includes articles, talks and documentation from existing centers.
                Additionally, in 2013, there was a discussion thread on Humanist about ways to plan
                for a DH center <ptr target="#mccarty2013"/>, <ptr target="#stumpf2013"/>, <ptr target="#unsworth2013"/>. Finally, successful DH/DS centers have
                published case study articles that provide insight into their experiences and ways
                that this might be replicated in other settings <ptr target="#bergstrom2016"/>, 
            <ptr target="#colletal2020"/>, <ptr target="#deroseleonard2020"/>, <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/>, 
            <ptr target="#miller2016"/>, <ptr target="#risametal2017"/>, and <ptr target="#rosenblumdwyer2016"/>. </p>
            
         <p>This article contributes to this discussion by examining the experiences of ten DH/DS
                centers in North America and discerning smart practices for those wishing to start a
                similar center. We can learn from those who are already involved in such centers and
                transfer these insights to others. Finally, this article will help advance the
                minimal knowledge base regarding the creation and sustainability of research and
                teaching centers in Digital Humanities and Digital Scholarship.</p>

        <div> 
           <head>Context</head>
           
         <p>There is much debate about the definition of DH and DS with the terms sometimes used
            interchangeably <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>. From a broad perspective, digital scholarship involves the “creation,
                production, analysis, or dissemination of new scholarship using digital or
                computational techniques, or both” <ptr target="#lewisetal2015"/>, allowing for both research and tool building. Digital humanities and
            digital social science is often included within this definition <ptr target="#lewisetal2015"/>, <ptr target="#miller2016"/>. At a more basic level, digital scholarship centers have
                a broader mandate than digital humanities ones which “are often specialized research
                centers led by a group of faculty and serving only select disciplines rather than a
                broad campus community" <ptr target="#lippincottetal2014"/>. </p>
           
           <p>Regardless of how defined, broadly speaking, according to <ptr target="#unsworth2007"/>, 
              these types of centres are cyberinfrastructure that include collections of
                expertise, equipment, and software, and generate economies of scale in terms of both
                resources and expertise. Echoing this, <ptr target="#zorich2008"/> argues that a
           	<!-- Reba, make sure you encode all of the quoted material with <quote>. If you do a search
           		 for the “ character that will help find the ones that may have slipped through. -->
              “digital humanities center is an entity where new media and
                technologies are used for humanities-based research, teaching, and intellectual
                engagement and experimentation. The goals of the center are to further humanities
                scholarship, create new forms of knowledge, and explore technology’s impact on
                humanities-based disciplines.” A center “implies a central (physical and/or virtual)
                area where a suite of activities are conducted by individuals dedicated to a common
                mission” <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. They create an anchoring space, bring technical expertise into one location,
              and provide for networking opportunities <ptr target="#colletal2020"/>. 
              Ultimately, these “[c]entres and laboratories, therefore, contribute
              to enhancing the visibility of the humanities on campus and beyond” <ptr target="#pawlickadeger2020b"/>. 
              They help create new digital resources and tools that develop benefits for
              the humanities community and beyond <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/>. </p>
           
           <p>It is difficult to identify a typical DH/DS center because there is no single model <ptr target="#miller2016"/>, 
              <ptr target="#prescott2016"/>, <ptr target="#sanders2019"/>. They are generally structured around the strengths and priorities of
              partners and institutions <ptr target="#bergstrom2016"/>, <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>, 
              <ptr target="#goldenberghart2016"/>, <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>, <ptr target="#mitchemrice2017"/>,
              <ptr target="#phillipsetal2020"/>. For example, centers might focus on service, research, pedagogy, or a
                combination of these activities. Others can be organized around a theme or
                discipline such as media studies or a single activity like digitization. Some
                centers might build tools and resources or host them <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>, 
              <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/>, <ptr target="#sample2010"/>, <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. 
              In terms of administrative homes, some centers are freestanding at the faculty or university level while others are part of
                existing departments or may even be their own department. Further, some might be
                support services and part of a library or computing services <ptr target="#prescott2016"/>. 
              The reporting structure is also dependent on the particular center. They
                might report to a variety of people, including a dean, provost, vice president or
                department chair. These reporting relationships may be formal or informal. It is
                also not uncommon for centers to change their administrative home and mandate over
                time <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. </p>
           
         <p>Regardless of focus and mission, a common set of activities can be identified which
                enable someone to receive advice and/or become a place where ideas can be developed
                and shared all to the end of developing new knowledge <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/>, 
            <ptr target="#prescott2016"/>, <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. These activities might

         <list type="unordered">
            <item>campus members such as faculty, staff, students, postdoctoral and faculty
                    fellows, and campus administrators. Researchers and staff might come from
                    various disciplines including humanities, social sciences, computer science,

            <item>people beyond the campus which can include visiting or international scholars

            <item>organizations such as museums, other research centers, and industry</item>
            <item>the general public and community groups <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>,

         </list>
           
         <p>Regardless of the types of services offered, these centers tend to have both physical
                and virtual presences. Some are more physical in nature when primary users are
                located close to each other while others are more virtual when their users are more
                geographically dispersed <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. The origin story for each center is different. Sometimes, a single
                occurrence, such as conversations with a senior administrator or funder who then
                offers money, prompts the center’s start. In other cases, similar activities are
                grouped together under an umbrella of DH/DS. Others are the result of a campus wide
                initiative to promote the humanities or digital scholarship. Further, some centers
                have their start as computing service/IT units which slowly over time offered
                support to digital humanities projects. An academic entrepreneur sometimes plays a
                role. In these cases, a faculty member may start a center to meet their research
                needs and then grows it to include other digital research programs. Finally, for
                others, the process is not linear as the center moves from a project to a program.
                This takes effort to gain buy-in from others on campus <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. 
                In many cases, a champion is needed to make the case for investments through
                staff allocation, funding, and project development <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>, 
            <ptr target="#lippincottetal2014"/>.</p>
           
         <p>While the primary study of digital humanities centers was conducted by <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>
            and supplemented by other studies <ptr target="#lewisetal2015"/>, there have been several case studies published which provide
                perspectives for other institutions interested in starting an initiative. One lesson
                focuses on the size of the center and its rate of growth. Many of the case studies
                start small and grow slowly <ptr target="#colletal2020"/>, <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/>,
            <ptr target="#mitchemrice2017"/>. In some cases, centers may begin with staff that are
                available locally <ptr target="#bergstrom2016"/>. As one example, in 1999, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the
                Humanities (MITH) started with a director and two research assistants and grew by
                2012 to include ten faculty and full-time personnel with another approximately dozen
                full- or part-time staff who were supported through grant funding, graduate
                assistantships, federal work studies, and internships <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/>. 
                Further, SUNY Oswego started with a computer scientist interested in DH and
                grew to several hires with administrative support and a program in DH for undergrads <ptr target="#colletal2020"/>.</p>
           
           <p>These examples also demonstrate that a common space for a center is the library <ptr target="#deroseleonard2020"/>, 
              <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/>, <ptr target="#risametal2017"/>. A library is seen to be an interdisciplinary space where
                faculty are accustomed to using technology and services there. It is a space that is
                well-visited and possesses technical infrastructure, software, and collections with
                expertise in metadata, copyright, data management, digital preservation, and project
                management <ptr target="#cox2016"/>, <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>. Librarians may also have the ability to bring
                different parties together through their relationships with faculty and researchers
                and a history of collaboration <ptr target="#cox2016"/>.</p>
           
           <p>These case studies also found that the timing has to be right <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>, 
              with a focus on an institution’s mission and strategic goals <ptr target="#mitchemrice2017"/>. 
              For example, the University of Utah found that an earlier incarnation
                of a digital scholarship center failed to gain a critical mass. At the same time, it
                dealt with budget retrenchment which caused the library to refocus efforts on core
                services. As a result, this center disbanded. The second time around proved more
                successful as the new center built on efforts in other parts of campus and developed
                key academic partnerships and shared ownership and investment <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>.
                The University of Kansas’ Institute for Digital Research in the
                Humanities <ptr target="#rosenblumdwyer2016"/> and Middle Tennessee State University <ptr target="#miller2016"/>
                also built on activities already under way. These efforts are collaborative,
                involving many stakeholders. For example, the University of Kansas’s center had
                three primary stakeholders which included the library, the College of Liberal Arts
                and Sciences, and the Hall Center for the Humanities, all providing financial
                support and guidance <ptr target="#rosenblumdwyer2016"/>.</p>
           
         <p>As part of starting activities, nascent centers gather information to determine the
                need for it and associated services. This includes seeking information from local
                stakeholders and outside experts and conducting an environmental scan <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>, 
                <ptr target="#deroseleonard2020"/>, <ptr target="#miller2016"/>. The University of Utah found that outside experts
                focused on the need for strong relationships with administration who could provide
                financial backing and political capital. Further, these individuals stressed that
                the new center’s mission should be shaped by local needs and strengths. This
                knowledge guided their efforts to start a center <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>. 
                Similarly, Appalachian State University undertook a gap analysis
                between what was presently being offered on campus and what was needed in order to
                determine key activities for the new center <ptr target="#mitchemrice2017"/>. 
                In addition, SUNY Oswego conducted a survey to determine the extent
                of DH/DS activities on campus and used the results to inform next steps <ptr target="#colletal2020"/>. 
                As a final example, Yale hired a design anthropologist to determine
                the needs for DH on campus which would then inform the design of a DH center in the
                library. To gather this information, the anthropologist conducted interviews with
                students, faculty, and staff from different backgrounds, held design workshops, and
                undertook benchmarking research with colleagues from other institutions <ptr target="#deroseleonard2020"/>.</p>

            <head>Methodology</head>
            
         <p>Through semi-structured interviews, ten center directors were asked a series of
                questions about their DH/DS center. An attempt was made to have a variety of
                representation from with Canada and the United States, size of institution and age
                of the center. The directors were all known to the researcher. The interviews were
                conducted primarily through zoom. Lasting about an hour, the interviews focused on
                open-ended questions that explored the center, its mandate and services, budget,
                staffing, center’s history, key factors of success, and challenges to being a
                center. These interviews allowed the researcher to explore topics more fully and
                deeply with probing follow-up questions while the participants reflected on their
                own experiences and emphasize those issues that are important to them. Analysis of
                documents and articles related to the centers supplemented the interviews. </p>
            
         <p>Data analysis involved a grounded theory approach that focused on the themes that
                emerged from the data. This analysis was broken into several steps. First, working
                from audio recordings and detailed notes, the data was organized, read, and coded to
                determine categories, themes, and patterns. Those categories were then tested for
                emergent and alternative understandings, both within a single interview and across
                all interviews. This was an iterative process, involving movement between the data,
                codes, and concepts, constantly comparing the data to itself and the developing
                themes <ptr target="#marshallrossman1999"/>, <ptr target="#mccracken1988"/>, <ptr target="#rubinrubin1995"/>. </p>

         <p>These centers have long histories supporting faculty, staff, and students at their
                institutions with the oldest being over 20 years old. During this time, these have
                not stayed static for many have undergone several iterations and name changes. By
                way of example, the Center for Digital Scholarship at Brown University started as
                the Scholarly Technology Group based in IT in 1994 and then moved to the library in
                2008. During this time, there have been several name changes to reflect its changing
                mandate. As another example, the Digital Humanities initiative (DHi) at Hamilton
                College was conceived in 2009 and received a Mellon Grant in 2010 to develop the
                center. While the primary focus was initially on the humanities, the initiative’s
                mandate was broadened in 2019 to become a suite of services available to the full
                campus. The transition came about after changes in senior management roles. Finally,
                the University of Saskatchewan’s Humanities and Fine Arts Digital Research Centre is
                now known as the Digital Research Center. The name change corresponded with a move
                from its faculty home to the library and reflects that the center is now focused on
                the entire university and less discipline specific. </p>
           
         <p>There are several different ways that these centers started. Some began around
                individual faculty projects who became faculty champions and generated support for a
                center. At Princeton, at the time of their tenure, a faculty member had materials
                for the archive and saw the potential for digital humanities at an institution where
                there was little. They had the vision and passion for creating a center and
                envisioned a unit which would undertake research with faculty members and train the
                next generation of humanities scholars. Consequently, the faculty member asked the
                provost for start-up funds and created buy-in from the chief information officer,
                faculty members, librarians and graduate students and started The Princeton Center
                for Digital Humanities. Another example is Ryerson University in Canada where two
                faculty members had a digital project and started the Centre for Digital Humanities
                informally. It became a formal research center when they needed space to house its
                activities. A third instance is at University of Saskatchewan where a faculty member
                who was at the time vice dean of Arts and Fine Arts wanted to create digital
                editions but needed space and equipment for graduate students to work. Several
                others wanted to collaborate with this person. Consequently, the participating
                faculty members received money for space renovations, equipment, and a staff member
                and started the center. </p>
           
         <p>Other centers started as a strategic direction for the institution. At Texas A&amp;M,
                a white paper was developed which outlined a vision for a digital humanities center
                and delivered to the Vice President Research who provided funding for space, a
                director and equipment. The initiative built on the strengths of faculty who were
                already doing research and getting grants in the area. Another example is the
                University of Nebraska where the university wanted to create <q>“programs of
                excellence”</q> in select areas which allow the institution to build world class
                expertise. Digital Humanities was argued to be one of these areas where the
                university could lead the world. The result was several cluster hires and a research
                center. Finally, CUNY had a provost interested in digital initiatives who provided
                support to the center start up and operations.</p></div>

            <p>Despite the different start up scenarios, these centers undertake some common
                activities. They all tend to offer consulting, access to technology (hardware and
                software), speaker series, workshops, and training for faculty and students. In some
                cases, these activities also go further to include project management, research and
                pedagogy support, grant writing assistance, seed grants, and others. They all have a
                virtual presence through a website, which has become especially important in this
                age of COVID-19. These centers also have physical spaces and offer work and meeting
                area for faculty, staff, and students.</p>
           
         <p>Many of these centers are physically based in the library. At Princeton, the physical
                space is seen as a place where people from different faculties can gather and meet.
                Echoing this, the University of Nebraska felt that the library was a neutral space
                where everyone can interact and have interdisciplinary conversations. Indiana
                University uses its physical space in the library to provide meeting space,
                consultation, access to equipment, scanning lab, and makerspace, and programing such
                as a summer incubator program. Understanding the important role that libraries play,
                the University of Saskatchewan and Hamilton College moved from their faculty home to
                the library and broadened their mandate to include the rest of campus. It is
                important to note that just because a center is based in the library, it does not
                mean that it is the administrative home for it. Ryerson University is based in the
                library but reports administratively to the Faculty of Arts. In other cases, the
                centers are located outside the library structure. For example, at Texas A&amp;M,
                the Center of Digital Humanities Research is in the liberal arts building with an
                administrative home in the College of Liberal Arts.</p>
           
         <p>Each of the centers had some focus on student development. At Hamilton, DHi supported
                undergraduate students to work with faculty through grants. This was successful as
                students developed skills that allowed them to get into graduate programs and find
                employment. This focus fits the mission of small liberal arts colleges <ptr target="#simonsnieves2019"/>. 
                Indiana University followed the same model to the same end, that is
                students gaining valuable skills that translated into employment afterwards.
                Princeton also found this benefit as they supported graduate students as fellows for
                their own research projects. In this way, they were creating the next generation of
                humanities scholars.</p></div>

         <p>It is difficult to quantify the number of staff that work in each center. The staff
                often include parts of librarians’ time and graduate and undergraduate students who
                work part time on faculty projects, training, and workshops. The number of staff,
                including students, can ebb and flow over time in response to budgets and
                priorities. For example, CUNY has had more students in the past but financial issues
                led to budget cuts and reduced number of students. </p>
           
         <p>Some of the centers are very small. At Texas A&amp;M, there are three people listed
                on the website, a director, associate director, and programmer. Additional grant
                funding allows for graduate and undergraduate research assistants. Some centers are
                larger with portions of more library staff’s time. In other cases, bigger hard
                budgets allow for more permanent staff. At Princeton, their budget allows for six
                permanent staff with approximately five graduate students as fellows who undertake
                their own research projects. There are other graduate student fellows who are
                project based with administrative responsibilities along with several undergraduate
                students.</p>
           
         <p>From an administrative perspective, the co-director model with a librarian and
                faculty member is common. University of Nebraska has been using this model since the
                center’s inception and Indiana University’s current administrative structure
                reflects this. Further, the University of Saskatchewan now uses this model after
                years of a single director/coordinator with their move into the library. There is
                often release from teaching for the faculty member to serve as director, thus
                reflecting the amount of time that coordinating a center takes. The director
                position was often part of the librarian’s job. In contrast, Ryerson University does
                not offer course release to the faculty director. Combined with a part-time project
                coordinator, this limits the ability of the center to be proactive in support of
                projects and workshops and its ability to recruit new fellows.</p></div>

         <p>Like the case for number of employees, it can be hard to measure funding levels for
                both cash and in-kind contributions. These centers are funded through a variety of
                models. At Indiana University, the center was funded initially as an experiment by
                the university president. The developers were base funded for the first several
                years but this was not sustainable. As a result, the funding model was changed over
                time. Now, the operational costs are provided by the Office of the Vice Provost
                Research along with several National Science Foundation, National Endowment for the
                Humanities, and other grants. In-kind funding is provided from the library for the
                library co-director and several graduate research assistants. The College of Arts
                and Sciences pays for the faculty co-director and two graduate research assistants.
                As another model, Northeastern shifted from grant funding to base budget but still
                uses grants to fund new features of development and temporary staff. This model
                helps reduce staff turnover, improves morale, and focuses attention on strategic
                activities because the center is not continually writing grants for base operations.
                As a final model, at the University of Nebraska, the center’s founding members,
                including departments and dean’s office, contributed to it financially. The English
                department provided funding for the faculty co-director; the library reallocated
                positions to the center and provided funding for the library co-director; and the
                dean’s office reconfigured a professor position into a DH position. By grounding the
                center in these major units, it became harder to dislodge it in financially
                challenging times. Princeton receives a relatively large base budget from the
                provost. There are some National Endowment for the Humanities grants but the center
                does not generally apply for grants to do projects. This means that there is a limit
                to the number of partners with whom it can work because there is no soft funding. On
                the other hand, this situation helps with staff recruitment and retention because
                the center can guarantee permanent positions.</p>
           
           <!-- Reba, once you've added the <q> encoding, the literal quotation marks can be removed. 
           		Another instance is below -->
         <p>In contrast, the University of Saskatchewan found that the use of soft, grant-funded
                dollars meant that the center <q>“limped along”</q>. This situation led to a crisis point
                at which point the library stepped in to provide stable funding. Ryerson
                University’s center is also in a position of little base operational funding. It
                relies primarily on soft money and in-kind contributions with internal and external
                grants and space, furniture, and computers. It is continually lobbying for some base
                budget for stability and ability to expand services. CUNY has also found that if it
                used grant funding for permanent staff positions then it was always writing
                grants.</p>

            Factors for Success
         </head>
           
         <p>The interviewees were asked to articulate the key factors that led to the center’s
                success. These factors focused on champions, partnerships, funding, targeted
                activities, their virtual and physical space, and the training and mentoring of
                students.</p>
           
         <p>Above all else, champions are key. These centers were founded by an individual or
                small group of people who had a vision for the center’s potential and were able to
                articulate it and convince partners, stakeholders, and senior administration to
                invest time and money. In the case of Princeton, the faculty lead saw the future of
                humanities at the university and convinced partners that a center was needed. In
                fact, the interviewee from Princeton said that it was hard to overstate the
                importance of the faculty lead in the center’s success. This individual was able to
                create strategic relationships and advocate for the center and continue this
                leadership over time. The center’s director and associate director have been able to
                create a strong culture where the staff believe in the importance of the work. As
                Indiana University found, the center struggled when it was effectively leaderless
                for several years. As a result, the new co-leads spent time rebuilding the program.
                With other centers, the universities wanted to be seen as an innovator in the area.
                Northeastern hired a director with a reputation in the community to make this vision
                a reality. The same was done at Nebraska with a cluster hire which grounded the
                center in DH research. At Texas A&amp;M, two faculty members wrote a white paper
                which led to funding for center start up. At University of Saskatchewan, a faculty
                member wanted space for students to work on their research project. Other
                researchers became interested and they secured funding to renovate a space and buy
                equipment. At Ryerson, the center grew out of two faculty members’ research projects
                and slowly over the years more projects became involved. The financial support for
                the DH center at CUNY came from the Provost, who had an interest in digital
                initiatives and scholarship. Finally, at Nebraska, the university wanted to invest
                in areas of excellence and DH was one area with potential to that end. </p>
           
         <p>Another factor focused on people, partnerships and institutional support. The
                interviewee from Princeton stated that they were able to recruit and retain people
                with key skills and passion for the work. A key partnership was with the library
                which often provided space and staff as Northeastern found. Saskatchewan also found
                that working the library to be critical. By being situated in the library more staff
                could be accessed and therefore more services offered. The interviewee from Brown
                echoed this by stating that the move to the library made sense since they became
                more of a champion and provided access to more staff. It is a natural place for a DH
                center that supports research since that is what a library does. The center at
                Northeastern also found that a partnership with another research center was key.
                This means that the centers’ research agendas supported and complemented each other.
                Relationships between center staff is also key to success. As the interviewee from
                Texas A&amp;M articulated, their staff worked well together, were excellent at their
                jobs, and engaged in their work. Another key to success is engaged faculty who grow
                to be a critical mass of individuals involved in DH as Saskatchewan determined. The
                interviewee from Ryerson echoed this by articulating that the community is more than
                just one particular project. </p>
           
         <p>These centers were also able to undertake their work with base budgeting with minimal
                soft money. As the center at Princeton found, the ability to function without soft
                money meant staff were more easily attracted and retained because they were hired on
                a permanent basis, as opposed to contracts. It is also a sign that the center had
                clear institutional support. They could hire smart people with a passion for the
                work. With base budgets allocated, it means that the grant funding that is secured
                can be used for new projects, temporary staff, and student positions as Northeastern
                articulated. As the interviewee from Saskatchewan reflected, soft money does not
                work and sustainable funding is needed. At Nebraska, each party that support the DH
                center contributes financial resources and staff time as a sign of their
                commitment.</p>
           
         <p>At the same time, the centers were able to set boundaries around the services and
                supports they were able to provide. They did not try to be all things to all people.
                The interviewee from Indiana articulated that they were ideally able to use internal
                offerings to situate themselves for external funding opportunities. With
                Northeastern, focusing the mandate and services that could be provided meant that
                there was time to do things well and be able to be a good mentor to students and
                faculty. As the interviewee from Northeastern recognized, there needs to be constant
                negotiation when demands exceed capabilities. Texas A&amp;M did comment that they
                felt that they needed to be everything to everyone, but quickly realized that they
                needed to focus on center activities to the exclusion of others. At Saskatchewan,
                they found that they tried to please everyone at the outset and bought equipment for
                research that in the end was not undertaken. They found that it would have been
                better to figure out who the actual users would be and meet their needs first. As
                the interviewee stated, it is not a matter of <q>“build it and they will come</q>.” </p>
           
         <p>Both virtual and physical space were keys to a center’s success. As Princeton’s
                center described, the physical space was a place where parties could be hosted and
                people from across faculties could talk. At Saskatchewan, the physical space created
                community. Ryerson also has dedicated space in the library with workstations and
                small meeting space. In Nebraska the library was seen as neutral space where people
                interact and have interdisciplinary conversations.</p>
           
         <p>Finally, the centers saw as one of their key functions the ability to train and
                mentor undergraduate and graduate students and early career scholars such as
                postdoctoral fellows to become the next generation of digital humanities scholars
                who got jobs and accepted into graduate programs. It was an opportunity to transform
                lives of the participating students as the interviewee from Princeton expressed.
                This was echoed by Northeastern which recognized that students benefit from the DH
                experience. Further, CUNY saw them as ambassadors for DH. At Princeton, one of the
                postdoctoral fellows is responsible for teaching an undergraduate course in DH, thus
                bringing DH into the classroom. At Indiana, by incorporating DH into the classroom,
                research skills and projects by students and faculty could be developed. These
                training opportunities often meant providing time and space for students to work
                with faculty members. This includes the summer incubator at Indiana which had six
                slots – three for faculty and three for students. These individuals were paired
                together and worked to develop a working prototype over the course of a one-week
                intensive session. Further, the Indiana center recognized the skills and expertise
                that students were developing with a title of <q>“method specialist”</q>. </p>
           </div>
           
         <div>
            <head>Challenges</head>
           
         <p>While these centers found many benefits and advantages to operating as centers, there
                were many challenges. For example, operating without base budgets meant that
                partnerships, staff, and projects are limited in nature. Ryerson realized that they
                are constrained in what they can do since they are not base funded. Unlike other
                centres, there is no course release for the director. The interviewee sees base
                funding allocation as a concrete sign of institutional support. The center at
                Princeton realized that they needed a particular expertise on staff but were not
                able to hire for it because there was no money in the budget. At Saskatchewan, when
                the center lost a soft funded staff person, it created a crisis point where either
                the center shut down or someone took it over. At that point, the library stepped and
                took responsibility for it and consequently was able to provide more services.
                However, in CUNY’s experience, base budgeting does not protect a center from
                financial cuts as dictated by the institution. Budget cuts then impacted the number
                of students who could be supported by the center. The budget is further impacted by
                the fact that universities cannot often pay technical staff enough in comparison to
                private sector wages as the center at Nebraska found.</p>
           
         <p>There is also the constant struggle around staffing. For some it is determining the
                right number of staff. In Northeastern’s experience, too small and the center risks
                missing key skills and expertise. Of course, growing too fast presents its own
                challenges. Northeastern grew by 50% over the past year and needed to find ways to
                do this in an effective way. In other cases, reliance on students means high
                turnover and working around their course work and dissertations. CUNY has found that
                there is always a feeling of retraining. At Nebraska, staff often find themselves
                spread thin and there is a need for additional people to lessen the stress. And of
                course, the time required to run these centers is intensive and often takes more
                time than allocated in a job description. The interviewee from Indiana was allocated
                approximately 50% of their job to the center but the work often bleeds over that
                time allotment. </p>

         <div>
            <head>Discussion</head>
            
         <p>Given the small sample size for this study, it is hard to generalize about DH/DS
                centers. However, some preliminary conclusions can be made. First, these centers
                show characteristics of many similar ones <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. These centers 
                offer a common range of activities and services with a combination of people, including researchers, librarians, technologists, students,
                postdoctoral fellows, and infrastructure, ranging from hardware, software and
                training <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>. However, they do not offer “everything under the sun” but rather have
                found that it is important to set boundaries around services and activities offered,
                complimenting that which is offered in other parts of campus <ptr target="#bergstrom2016"/>. 
                Funding often comes from the library, speaking to their active roles in these
                centers <ptr target="#bergstrom2016"/>. They also get budgets from a variety of places including academic
                departments, university administrative offices, grants, and endowments <ptr target="#goldenberghart2016"/>,
            <ptr target="#lewisetal2015"/>, <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. Ultimately, these centers are linked to their
            institution’s goals and mission <ptr target="#goldenberghart2016"/>, <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>.</p>
            
            <p>Having said this, it is clear that each center is unique and shaped by its context <ptr target="#goldenberghart2016"/>. 
               Some centers, such as Saskatchewan, Princeton and Ryerson, started in
               response to a faculty member’s research projects <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. 
               These individuals played a key role as champion for their center <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>, <ptr target="#lippincottetal2014"/>. 
               For some, this means that they are part of the library and offer
                services to more than students and researchers based in the humanities. This
                includes the centers at Hamilton, Northeastern, Saskatchewan and Brown. Others, such
                as Princeton, Ryerson, and Texas A&amp;M, are based in a faculty or department, even
                if they are still physically situated in the library. Further, other centers are a
                combination of the library and faculty as is the case with Indiana and Nebraska.
                This organization structure is reflected in the co-director model with someone from
                the library and someone from the faculty serving as directors, representing these
                important stakeholders <ptr target="#rosenblumdwyer2016"/>. Finally, given the nature of the institution, CUNY’s center is free
                standing within the graduate center. </p>
            
         <p>The differences between the centers can also be found in
                the funding envelopes. Some are funded through substantial base budgets from provost
                offices as is the case with Princeton and CUNY. This reflects the support that can
                come from senior administration. Other centers have hybrid funding models with cash
                and in-kind budgets flowing from the library, faculty and departments. This includes
                Nebraska and Indiana and demonstrates a broad base support for DH/DS at the
                institution. Another funding model focuses on base budgets from libraries like the
                case of Northeastern which reinforces the role of the library as a home for these
                centers. There is some evidence to suggest that those centers based in or associated
                with libraries might be in the best financial position <ptr target="#lewisetal2015"/> 
                and have more stability and ability to plan long term <ptr target="#cox2016"/>. 
                Finally, while it enjoys cash and in-kind funding for its activities, Ryerson
                is an example of a center that has not be able to convert this support to permanent,
                ongoing funding. It continues to lobby for this and is hopeful that it will
                come.</p>
            
         <p>These centers’ experiences speak to the importance of strong leadership during start
                up and operations. For example, the center at Indiana was almost leaderless for
                several years which meant that it struggled. It is now back on <q>“surer feet”</q> with a
                co-director model between the library and faculty. People with vision are needed to
                start a center, drive the process, and secure funding and administrative support <ptr target="#colletal2020"/>
               <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>, <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. They are able to gather together important stakeholders,
                often found among those already doing DH/DS at the institution, and funding. These
                partnerships and collaboration are important to created shared ownership and
                investment <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>. The Ryerson interviewee stated that by doing this, the stakeholders
                would be able to help each other out and express a common focus for the center. It
                is important that this vision be articulated for a broad audience. For example,
                Nebraska posted a document that outlined the ways in which the center was started
                and built on efforts already present at the university <ptr target="#edwards2005"/>. 
                Among these were decisions to make cluster hires in DH to broaden the
                research focus in the area on campus. Drs. Ives and Earheart <ptr target="#ivesearheart"/>
                wrote a white paper for the purpose of establishing a DH center at Texas A&amp;M
                which led to funds to start a center. Efforts such as these gain support from senior
                administration who also have their own vision for a center. Often, it is because
                they want the university to be seen as leaders in DH/DS. Northeastern brought in the
                present director to build the center and quickly establish a presence in digital
                humanities and scholarship. Advantages to strong leadership exist. In particular, it
                can mean that the center is better able to survive the inevitable transitions of
                people and mandate <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>. However, this is not always guaranteed as is the case for Hamilton where the
                center’s mandate and structure changed when senior management turned over.
                Ultimately, strong relationships with administration is needed along with financial
                backing and political capital <ptr target="#cummingsetal2020"/>. Otherwise, as the Ryerson interviewee expressed, it is a lot of work
                with few benefits.</p>
            
         <p>The interviewees also expressed the importance and advantages of at least some base
                budget with minimal reliance of grant funding. At the best case, a center would not
                be in the position of Ryerson where it is continually asking for funds and writing
                grants. Of course, these centers feel that they could always use more funding to
                hire staff and undertake more activities. With additional funds, Ryerson would be
                able to make the center coordinator position full-time which would mean that the
                center could undertake more outreach and project support. In Princeton’s case, they
                would hire a communication person. One advantage of some base budget is the ability
                to hire permanent staff which is good for morale. It also addresses some of the
                challenges of attracting and retaining staff when private sector salaries are often
                higher <ptr target="#goldenberghart2016"/>, <ptr target="#lippincottetal2014"/>, <ptr target="#zorich2008"/>.</p>
            
         <p>In terms of human resources, these centers tended to
                start small and offered services that could be supported by the staff and expertise
                available <ptr target="#bergstrom2016"/>. While they could often not offer competitive salaries and a clear career path
            for many staff <ptr target="#lewisetal2015"/>, <ptr target="#prescott2016"/>, they could offer non-monetary rewards such as time

                advantages to undergraduate and graduate students working in the centers, offering
                training and working on faculty research projects <ptr target="#goldenberghart2016"/>. 
                As these centers found, they gained valuable skills and employment and
                opportunities for further training after graduation. However, this reliance on
                students comes at a potential cost with constant turnover <ptr target="#lewisetal2015"/>. 
                CUNY experiences this and finds that they are continually training
                new students. In terms of leadership, while there are advantages to a focus of one
                faculty member as a guiding force over a long period of time, a center needs to be
                able to transition to new leadership <ptr target="#alexanderdavis2012"/>.</p>

   <head>Conclusion</head>
   
         <p>In conclusion, these ten centers are examples of ones which have successfully
                supported the faculty, staff, and students on their campuses. Their experiences
                provide insight into some of the primary services offered, staffing, funding, key
                factors for success and challenges and suggest some important implications for those
                wishing to start their own center. These results compliment the case studies
                highlighted above and reports on center start up written by other DH/DS centers
            <ptr target="#handsonludwig"/>, <ptr target="#miller2016"/>.</p>
   
         <p>First, it is important to have champions at the faculty,
                library and senior administration levels who can articulate a vision for the center
                and develop the important partnerships and collaborations needed to start and
                sustain a center. They need to collaborate with stakeholders, such as the library,
                other research centers, faculties and departments, and researchers, whose goals and
                objectives align with the center’s. As <ptr target="#fraistat2012"/> articulates, collaborative efforts are needed both within the center itself
                and with its partners. Part of the partnership building can be conducting an
                environmental scan and needs assessment to determine what is needed, what is
                available and who is interested in participating in the center <ptr target="#kirketal2017"/>. This information can be used to carefully evaluate the types of
                services, activities and programs which will be offered by the center. As these
                centers have found, it is often useful to start small and grow organically and not
                try to do everything at once.</p>
   
         <p>Second, in terms of budget, some level of base budget is
                beneficial. It provides certainty of funding from year to year and allows the center
                to hire permanent staff. These interviewees would caution heavy reliance on grants.
                They can be useful for new programming and experiments, but one might find
                themselves in a cycle of always needing to write grant applications.</p>
   
         <p>Third, graduate and undergraduate students and
                postdoctoral fellows are valuable resources for these centers and should be a part
                of any DH/DS center. There are many benefits to their involvement. They help advance
                faculty research, teach workshops and courses on DH/DS, provide project management
                in some cases and other activities. Just as importantly, the students and
                postdoctoral fellows gain valuable skills and expertise which leads to employment
                and further studies. The centers play an important role growing the next generation
                of humanities scholars and researchers.</p>
   
         <p>Of course, these implications for practice are not magic
                formulas for DH/DS center start up and operations, but rather smart practices
                gleaned from the experience of ten centers with many years successful operation
                supported by case studies and other research. They provide guidance to those who are
                investigating the possibilities of a DH/DS on their campus or looking to revitalize
                existing centers.</p>
