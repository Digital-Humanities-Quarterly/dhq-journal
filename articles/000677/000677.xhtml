                     methods, resources, and tools for research, teaching and dissemination, interest in
                     starting 
                     DH/DS centers as a means to support and sustain researchers and projects is fast increasing.
                     
                      For those leading these initiatives, it raises questions about the ways to engage
                     possible 
                     stakeholders to develop support for a centre, apply existing models, secure funding
                     
                     sources, and many others.  This article contributes to this discussion by examining
                     the experiences 
                     of ten DH/DS centers in North America and discerning smart practices for those wishing
                     to start 
                     a similar center.  Often started by faculty or administrative champions, the interviewed
                     
                     centers have a long history of operations.  They offer a suite of activities and services,
                     
                     ranging from consulting, training, access to technology, project support, and others,
                     with 
                     staff drawn from libraries, faculties, student ranks, and other locations.  These
                     efforts support 
                     teachers, researchers, and students in their efforts to undertake DH/DS projects. 
                     The centers are 
                     often funded through a combination of base budgets and soft money and may be based
                     in a library 
                     or faculty.  The paper concludes with implications for practice for those wishing
                     to start 
                     their own DH/DS center.</p>

                        that accomplish these goals. Some early centers include Princeton and Rutgers’
                        Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities (1991), The University of Virginia’s
                        Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (1993), Brown University’s
                        Scholarly Technology Group (1994) and ones at Oxford and King’s College London [<a class="ref" href="#fraistat2019">Fraistat 2019</a>]. For those leading these initiatives, it raises questions about the ways to

                        start their own center. Efforts include workshops such as CNI-ARL’s one on planning

                        has developed a page of resources for starting and sustaining DH centers
                        which includes articles, talks and documentation from existing centers.
                        Additionally, in 2013, there was a discussion thread on Humanist about ways to plan
                        for a DH center [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2013">McCarty 2013</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#stumpf2013">Stumpf 2013</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2013">Unsworth 2013</a>]. Finally, successful DH/DS centers have

                     <div class="ptext" id="p4">There is much debate about the definition of DH and DS with the terms sometimes used
                        interchangeably
                        (Kirk
                        et al., 2017). From a broad perspective, digital scholarship involves the “creation,
                        production, analysis, or dissemination of new scholarship using digital or
                        computational techniques, or both”
                        (Lewis
                        et al., 2015), allowing for both research and tool building. Digital humanities and
                        digital social science is often included within this definition
                        (Lewis
                        et al., 2015, Miller, 2016). At a more basic level, digital scholarship centers have
                        a broader mandate than digital humanities ones which “are often specialized research
                        centers led by a group of faculty and serving only select disciplines rather than
                        a
                        broad campus community"
                        (Lippincott
                        et al., 2014b). </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p5">Regardless of how defined, broadly speaking, according to
                        Unsworth
                        (2007), these types of centres are cyberinfrastructure that include collections of
                        expertise, equipment, and software, and generate economies of scale in terms of both
                        resources and expertise. Echoing this,
                        Zorich
                        (2008) argues that a “digital humanities center is an entity where new media and
                        technologies are used for humanities-based research, teaching, and intellectual
                        engagement and experimentation. The goals of the center are to further humanities
                        scholarship, create new forms of knowledge, and explore technology’s impact on
                        humanities-based disciplines.” A center “implies a central (physical and/or virtual)
                        area where a suite of activities are conducted by individuals dedicated to a common
                        mission”
                        (Zorich,
                        2008). They create an anchoring space, bring technical expertise into one location,
                        and provide for networking opportunities
                        (Coll
                        et al., 2020). Ultimately, these “[c]entres and laboratories, therefore, contribute
                        to enhancing the visibility of the humanities on campus and beyond”
                        (Pawlicka-Deger,
                        2020b). They help create new digital resources and tools that develop benefits for
                        the humanities community and beyond
                        (Fraistat,
                        2012)</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p6">It is difficult to identify a typical DH/DS center because there is no single model
                        (Miller, 2016, Prescott, 2016,
                        Sanders, 2019). They are generally structured around the strengths and priorities
                        of
                        partners and institutions
                        (Bergstrom, 2016, Cummings et
                        al., 2020, Goldenberg-­Hart, 2016, Kirk et al., 2017, Mitchem et al., 2017, Phillips
                        et al., 2020). For example, centers might focus on service, research, pedagogy, or
                        a
                        combination of these activities. Others can be organized around a theme or
                        discipline such as media studies or a single activity like digitization. Some
                        centers might build tools and resources or host them
                        (Cummings et al., 2020,
                        Fraistat, 2012, Sample, 2010, Zorich, 2008). In terms of administrative homes, some
                        centers are freestanding at the faculty or university level while others are part
                        of
                        existing departments or may even be their own department. Further, some might be
                        support services and part of a library or computing services
                        (Prescott,
                        2016). The reporting structure is also dependent on the particular center. They
                        might report to a variety of people, including a dean, provost, vice president or
                        department chair. These reporting relationships may be formal or informal. It is
                        also not uncommon for centers to change their administrative home and mandate over
                        time
                        (Zorich,

                     <div class="ptext" id="p9">Regardless of the types of services offered, these centers tend to have both physical
                        and virtual presences. Some are more physical in nature when primary users are
                        located close to each other while others are more virtual when their users are more
                        geographically dispersed
                        (Zorich,
                        2008). The origin story for each center is different. Sometimes, a single
                        occurrence, such as conversations with a senior administrator or funder who then
                        offers money, prompts the center’s start. In other cases, similar activities are
                        grouped together under an umbrella of DH/DS. Others are the result of a campus wide
                        initiative to promote the humanities or digital scholarship. Further, some centers
                        have their start as computing service/IT units which slowly over time offered
                        support to digital humanities projects. An academic entrepreneur sometimes plays a
                        role. In these cases, a faculty member may start a center to meet their research
                        needs and then grows it to include other digital research programs. Finally, for
                        others, the process is not linear as the center moves from a project to a program.
                        This takes effort to gain buy-in from others on campus
                        (Zorich,
                        2008). In many cases, a champion is needed to make the case for investments through
                        staff allocation, funding, and project development
                        (Kirk et al., 2017, Lippincott

                     <div class="ptext" id="p10">While the primary study of digital humanities centers was conducted by
                        Zorich
                        (2008) and supplemented by other studies
                        (Lewis
                        et al., 2015), there have been several case studies published which provide
                        perspectives for other institutions interested in starting an initiative. One lesson
                        focuses on the size of the center and its rate of growth. Many of the case studies
                        start small and grow slowly
                        (Coll et al., 2020, Fraistat,
                        2012, Mitchem et al., 2017). In some cases, centers may begin with staff that are
                        available locally
                        (Bergstrom,
                        2016). As one example, in 1999, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the
                        Humanities (MITH) started with a director and two research assistants and grew by
                        2012 to include ten faculty and full-time personnel with another approximately dozen
                        full- or part-time staff who were supported through grant funding, graduate
                        assistantships, federal work studies, and internships
                        (Fraistat,
                        2012). Further, SUNY Oswego started with a computer scientist interested in DH and
                        grew to several hires with administrative support and a program in DH for undergrads
                        (Coll
                        et al., 2020).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p11">These examples also demonstrate that a common space for a center is the library
                        (DeRose et al., 2020, Fraistat,
                        2012, Risam et al., 2017). A library is seen to be an interdisciplinary space where
                        faculty are accustomed to using technology and services there. It is a space that
                        is
                        well-visited and possesses technical infrastructure, software, and collections with
                        expertise in metadata, copyright, data management, digital preservation, and project
                        management
                        (Cox,
                        2016, Cummings et al., 2020). Librarians may also have the ability to bring
                        different parties together through their relationships with faculty and researchers
                        and a history of collaboration
                        (Cox,
                        2016).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p12">These case studies also found that the timing has to be right
                        (Cummings
                        et al., 2020) with a focus on an institution’s mission and strategic goals
                        (Mitchem
                        et al., 2017). For example, the University of Utah found that an earlier incarnation
                        of a digital scholarship center failed to gain a critical mass. At the same time,
                        it
                        dealt with budget retrenchment which caused the library to refocus efforts on core
                        services. As a result, this center disbanded. The second time around proved more
                        successful as the new center built on efforts in other parts of campus and developed
                        key academic partnerships and shared ownership and investment
                        (Cummings
                        et al., 2020). The University of Kansas’ Institute for Digital Research in the
                        Humanities
                        (Rosenblum
                        et al., 2016) and Middle Tennessee State University
                        (Miller,
                        2016) also built on activities already under way. These efforts are collaborative,
                        involving many stakeholders. For example, the University of Kansas’s center had
                        three primary stakeholders which included the library, the College of Liberal Arts
                        and Sciences, and the Hall Center for the Humanities, all providing financial
                        support and guidance
                        (Rosenblum
                        et al., 2016).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p13">As part of starting activities, nascent centers gather information to determine the
                        need for it and associated services. This includes seeking information from local
                        stakeholders and outside experts and conducting an environmental scan
                        (Cummings et al., 2020, DeRose
                        et al., 2020, Miller, 2016). The University of Utah found that outside experts
                        focused on the need for strong relationships with administration who could provide
                        financial backing and political capital. Further, these individuals stressed that
                        the new center’s mission should be shaped by local needs and strengths. This
                        knowledge guided their efforts to start a center
                        (Cummings
                        et al., 2020). Similarly, Appalachian State University undertook a gap analysis
                        between what was presently being offered on campus and what was needed in order to
                        determine key activities for the new center
                        (Mitchem
                        et al., 2017). In addition, SUNY Oswego conducted a survey to determine the extent
                        of DH/DS activities on campus and used the results to inform next steps
                        (Coll
                        et al., 2020). As a final example, Yale hired a design anthropologist to determine
                        the needs for DH on campus which would then inform the design of a DH center in the
                        library. To gather this information, the anthropologist conducted interviews with
                        students, faculty, and staff from different backgrounds, held design workshops, and
                        undertook benchmarking research with colleagues from other institutions
                        (DeRose

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14">Through semi-structured interviews, ten center directors were asked a series of
                        questions about their DH/DS center. An attempt was made to have a variety of
                        representation from with Canada and the United States, size of institution and age
                        of the center. The directors were all known to the researcher. The interviews were
                        conducted primarily through zoom. Lasting about an hour, the interviews focused on
                        open-ended questions that explored the center, its mandate and services, budget,
                        staffing, center’s history, key factors of success, and challenges to being a
                        center. These interviews allowed the researcher to explore topics more fully and
                        deeply with probing follow-up questions while the participants reflected on their
                        own experiences and emphasize those issues that are important to them. Analysis of

                        emerged from the data. This analysis was broken into several steps. First, working
                        from audio recordings and detailed notes, the data was organized, read, and coded
                        to
                        determine categories, themes, and patterns. Those categories were then tested for
                        emergent and alternative understandings, both within a single interview and across
                        all interviews. This was an iterative process, involving movement between the data,
                        codes, and concepts, constantly comparing the data to itself and the developing
                        themes (Marshall et al., 1999,

                        <div class="ptext" id="p17">These centers have long histories supporting faculty, staff, and students at their
                           institutions with the oldest being over 20 years old. During this time, these have
                           not stayed static for many have undergone several iterations and name changes. By
                           way of example, the Center for Digital Scholarship at Brown University started as
                           the Scholarly Technology Group based in IT in 1994 and then moved to the library in
                           2008. During this time, there have been several name changes to reflect its changing
                           mandate. As another example, the Digital Humanities initiative (DHi) at Hamilton
                           College was conceived in 2009 and received a Mellon Grant in 2010 to develop the
                           center. While the primary focus was initially on the humanities, the initiative’s
                           mandate was broadened in 2019 to become a suite of services available to the full
                           campus. The transition came about after changes in senior management roles. Finally,
                           the University of Saskatchewan’s Humanities and Fine Arts Digital Research Centre
                           is
                           now known as the Digital Research Center. The name change corresponded with a move
                           from its faculty home to the library and reflects that the center is now focused on
                           the entire university and less discipline specific. </div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div>
                        <div class="ptext" id="p18">There are several different ways that these centers started. Some began around
                           individual faculty projects who became faculty champions and generated support for
                           a
                           center. At Princeton, at the time of their tenure, a faculty member had materials
                           for the archive and saw the potential for digital humanities at an institution where
                           there was little. They had the vision and passion for creating a center and
                           envisioned a unit which would undertake research with faculty members and train the
                           next generation of humanities scholars. Consequently, the faculty member asked the
                           provost for start-up funds and created buy-in from the chief information officer,
                           faculty members, librarians and graduate students and started The Princeton Center
                           for Digital Humanities. Another example is Ryerson University in Canada where two
                           faculty members had a digital project and started the Centre for Digital Humanities
                           informally. It became a formal research center when they needed space to house its
                           activities. A third instance is at University of Saskatchewan where a faculty member
                           who was at the time vice dean of Arts and Fine Arts wanted to create digital
                           editions but needed space and equipment for graduate students to work. Several
                           others wanted to collaborate with this person. Consequently, the participating
                           faculty members received money for space renovations, equipment, and a staff member
                           and started the center. </div>
                        
                        
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div>
                        <div class="ptext" id="p19">Other centers started as a strategic direction for the institution. At Texas A&amp;M,
                           a white paper was developed which outlined a vision for a digital humanities center
                           and delivered to the Vice President Research who provided funding for space, a
                           director and equipment. The initiative built on the strengths of faculty who were
                           already doing research and getting grants in the area. Another example is the
                           University of Nebraska where the university wanted to create “programs of
                           excellence” in select areas which allow the institution to build world class
                           expertise. Digital Humanities was argued to be one of these areas where the
                           university could lead the world. The result was several cluster hires and a research
                           center. Finally, CUNY had a provost interested in digital initiatives who provided
                           support to the center start up and operations.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p20">Despite the different start up scenarios, these centers undertake some common
                        activities. They all tend to offer consulting, access to technology (hardware and
                        software), speaker series, workshops, and training for faculty and students. In some
                        cases, these activities also go further to include project management, research and
                        pedagogy support, grant writing assistance, seed grants, and others. They all have
                        a
                        virtual presence through a website, which has become especially important in this
                        age of COVID-19. These centers also have physical spaces and offer work and meeting
                        area for faculty, staff, and students.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p21">Many of these centers are physically based in the library. At Princeton, the physical
                        space is seen as a place where people from different faculties can gather and meet.
                        Echoing this, the University of Nebraska felt that the library was a neutral space
                        where everyone can interact and have interdisciplinary conversations. Indiana
                        University uses its physical space in the library to provide meeting space,
                        consultation, access to equipment, scanning lab, and makerspace, and programing such
                        as a summer incubator program. Understanding the important role that libraries play,
                        the University of Saskatchewan and Hamilton College moved from their faculty home
                        to
                        the library and broadened their mandate to include the rest of campus. It is
                        important to note that just because a center is based in the library, it does not
                        mean that it is the administrative home for it. Ryerson University is based in the
                        library but reports administratively to the Faculty of Arts. In other cases, the
                        centers are located outside the library structure. For example, at Texas A&amp;M,
                        the Center of Digital Humanities Research is in the liberal arts building with an
                        administrative home in the College of Liberal Arts.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p22">Each of the centers had some focus on student development. At Hamilton, DHi supported
                        undergraduate students to work with faculty through grants. This was successful as
                        students developed skills that allowed them to get into graduate programs and find
                        employment. This focus fits the mission of small liberal arts colleges
                        (Simons
                        et al., 2019). Indiana University followed the same model to the same end, that is
                        students gaining valuable skills that translated into employment afterwards.
                        Princeton also found this benefit as they supported graduate students as fellows for
                        their own research projects. In this way, they were creating the next generation of
                        humanities scholars.</div>

                        work part time on faculty projects, training, and workshops. The number of staff,
                        including students, can ebb and flow over time in response to budgets and
                        priorities. For example, CUNY has had more students in the past but financial issues
                        led to budget cuts and reduced number of students. </div>

                        funding allows for graduate and undergraduate research assistants. Some centers are
                        larger with portions of more library staff’s time. In other cases, bigger hard
                        budgets allow for more permanent staff. At Princeton, their budget allows for six
                        permanent staff with approximately five graduate students as fellows who undertake
                        their own research projects. There are other graduate student fellows who are
                        project based with administrative responsibilities along with several undergraduate

                        faculty member is common. University of Nebraska has been using this model since the
                        center’s inception and Indiana University’s current administrative structure
                        reflects this. Further, the University of Saskatchewan now uses this model after
                        years of a single director/coordinator with their move into the library. There is
                        often release from teaching for the faculty member to serve as director, thus
                        reflecting the amount of time that coordinating a center takes. The director
                        position was often part of the librarian’s job. In contrast, Ryerson University does
                        not offer course release to the faculty director. Combined with a part-time project
                        coordinator, this limits the ability of the center to be proactive in support of
                        projects and workshops and its ability to recruit new fellows.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p26">Like the case for number of employees, it can be hard to measure funding levels for
                        both cash and in-kind contributions. These centers are funded through a variety of
                        models. At Indiana University, the center was funded initially as an experiment by
                        the university president. The developers were base funded for the first several
                        years but this was not sustainable. As a result, the funding model was changed over
                        time. Now, the operational costs are provided by the Office of the Vice Provost
                        Research along with several National Science Foundation, National Endowment for the
                        Humanities, and other grants. In-kind funding is provided from the library for the
                        library co-director and several graduate research assistants. The College of Arts
                        and Sciences pays for the faculty co-director and two graduate research assistants.
                        As another model, Northeastern shifted from grant funding to base budget but still
                        uses grants to fund new features of development and temporary staff. This model
                        helps reduce staff turnover, improves morale, and focuses attention on strategic
                        activities because the center is not continually writing grants for base operations.
                        As a final model, at the University of Nebraska, the center’s founding members,
                        including departments and dean’s office, contributed to it financially. The English
                        department provided funding for the faculty co-director; the library reallocated
                        positions to the center and provided funding for the library co-director; and the
                        dean’s office reconfigured a professor position into a DH position. By grounding the
                        center in these major units, it became harder to dislodge it in financially
                        challenging times. Princeton receives a relatively large base budget from the
                        provost. There are some National Endowment for the Humanities grants but the center
                        does not generally apply for grants to do projects. This means that there is a limit
                        to the number of partners with whom it can work because there is no soft funding.
                        On
                        the other hand, this situation helps with staff recruitment and retention because
                        the center can guarantee permanent positions.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p27">In contrast, the University of Saskatchewan found that the use of soft, grant-funded
                        dollars meant that the center “limped along”. This situation led to a crisis point
                        at which point the library stepped in to provide stable funding. Ryerson
                        University’s center is also in a position of little base operational funding. It
                        relies primarily on soft money and in-kind contributions with internal and external
                        grants and space, furniture, and computers. It is continually lobbying for some base
                        budget for stability and ability to expand services. CUNY has also found that if it
                        used grant funding for permanent staff positions then it was always writing
                        grants.</div>

                        activities, their virtual and physical space, and the training and mentoring of
                        students.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p29">Above all else, champions are key. These centers were founded by an individual or
                        small group of people who had a vision for the center’s potential and were able to
                        articulate it and convince partners, stakeholders, and senior administration to
                        invest time and money. In the case of Princeton, the faculty lead saw the future of
                        humanities at the university and convinced partners that a center was needed. In
                        fact, the interviewee from Princeton said that it was hard to overstate the
                        importance of the faculty lead in the center’s success. This individual was able to
                        create strategic relationships and advocate for the center and continue this
                        leadership over time. The center’s director and associate director have been able
                        to
                        create a strong culture where the staff believe in the importance of the work. As
                        Indiana University found, the center struggled when it was effectively leaderless
                        for several years. As a result, the new co-leads spent time rebuilding the program.
                        With other centers, the universities wanted to be seen as an innovator in the area.
                        Northeastern hired a director with a reputation in the community to make this vision
                        a reality. The same was done at Nebraska with a cluster hire which grounded the
                        center in DH research. At Texas A&amp;M, two faculty members wrote a white paper
                        which led to funding for center start up. At University of Saskatchewan, a faculty
                        member wanted space for students to work on their research project. Other
                        researchers became interested and they secured funding to renovate a space and buy
                        equipment. At Ryerson, the center grew out of two faculty members’ research projects
                        and slowly over the years more projects became involved. The financial support for
                        the DH center at CUNY came from the Provost, who had an interest in digital
                        initiatives and scholarship. Finally, at Nebraska, the university wanted to invest
                        in areas of excellence and DH was one area with potential to that end. </div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p30">Another factor focused on people, partnerships and institutional support. The
                        interviewee from Princeton stated that they were able to recruit and retain people
                        with key skills and passion for the work. A key partnership was with the library
                        which often provided space and staff as Northeastern found. Saskatchewan also found
                        that working the library to be critical. By being situated in the library more staff
                        could be accessed and therefore more services offered. The interviewee from Brown
                        echoed this by stating that the move to the library made sense since they became
                        more of a champion and provided access to more staff. It is a natural place for a
                        DH
                        center that supports research since that is what a library does. The center at
                        Northeastern also found that a partnership with another research center was key.
                        This means that the centers’ research agendas supported and complemented each other.
                        Relationships between center staff is also key to success. As the interviewee from
                        Texas A&amp;M articulated, their staff worked well together, were excellent at their
                        jobs, and engaged in their work. Another key to success is engaged faculty who grow
                        to be a critical mass of individuals involved in DH as Saskatchewan determined. The
                        interviewee from Ryerson echoed this by articulating that the community is more than
                        just one particular project. </div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p31">These centers were also able to undertake their work with base budgeting with minimal
                        soft money. As the center at Princeton found, the ability to function without soft
                        money meant staff were more easily attracted and retained because they were hired
                        on
                        a permanent basis, as opposed to contracts. It is also a sign that the center had
                        clear institutional support. They could hire smart people with a passion for the
                        work. With base budgets allocated, it means that the grant funding that is secured
                        can be used for new projects, temporary staff, and student positions as Northeastern
                        articulated. As the interviewee from Saskatchewan reflected, soft money does not
                        work and sustainable funding is needed. At Nebraska, each party that support the DH
                        center contributes financial resources and staff time as a sign of their
                        commitment.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p32">At the same time, the centers were able to set boundaries around the services and
                        supports they were able to provide. They did not try to be all things to all people.
                        The interviewee from Indiana articulated that they were ideally able to use internal
                        offerings to situate themselves for external funding opportunities. With
                        Northeastern, focusing the mandate and services that could be provided meant that
                        there was time to do things well and be able to be a good mentor to students and
                        faculty. As the interviewee from Northeastern recognized, there needs to be constant
                        negotiation when demands exceed capabilities. Texas A&amp;M did comment that they
                        felt that they needed to be everything to everyone, but quickly realized that they
                        needed to focus on center activities to the exclusion of others. At Saskatchewan,
                        they found that they tried to please everyone at the outset and bought equipment for
                        research that in the end was not undertaken. They found that it would have been
                        better to figure out who the actual users would be and meet their needs first. As
                        the interviewee stated, it is not a matter of “build it and they will come.” </div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p33">Both virtual and physical space were keys to a center’s success. As Princeton’s
                        center described, the physical space was a place where parties could be hosted and
                        people from across faculties could talk. At Saskatchewan, the physical space created
                        community. Ryerson also has dedicated space in the library with workstations and
                        small meeting space. In Nebraska the library was seen as neutral space where people
                        interact and have interdisciplinary conversations.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p34">Finally, the centers saw as one of their key functions the ability to train and
                        mentor undergraduate and graduate students and early career scholars such as
                        postdoctoral fellows to become the next generation of digital humanities scholars
                        who got jobs and accepted into graduate programs. It was an opportunity to transform
                        lives of the participating students as the interviewee from Princeton expressed.
                        This was echoed by Northeastern which recognized that students benefit from the DH
                        experience. Further, CUNY saw them as ambassadors for DH. At Princeton, one of the
                        postdoctoral fellows is responsible for teaching an undergraduate course in DH, thus
                        bringing DH into the classroom. At Indiana, by incorporating DH into the classroom,
                        research skills and projects by students and faculty could be developed. These
                        training opportunities often meant providing time and space for students to work
                        with faculty members. This includes the summer incubator at Indiana which had six
                        slots – three for faculty and three for students. These individuals were paired
                        together and worked to develop a working prototype over the course of a one-week
                        intensive session. Further, the Indiana center recognized the skills and expertise
                        that students were developing with a title of “method specialist”. </div>
                     </div>

                     <h2 class="head">Challenges</h2>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p35">While these centers found many benefits and advantages to operating as centers, there
                        were many challenges. For example, operating without base budgets meant that
                        partnerships, staff, and projects are limited in nature. Ryerson realized that they
                        are constrained in what they can do since they are not base funded. Unlike other
                        centres, there is no course release for the director. The interviewee sees base
                        funding allocation as a concrete sign of institutional support. The center at
                        Princeton realized that they needed a particular expertise on staff but were not
                        able to hire for it because there was no money in the budget. At Saskatchewan, when
                        the center lost a soft funded staff person, it created a crisis point where either
                        the center shut down or someone took it over. At that point, the library stepped and
                        took responsibility for it and consequently was able to provide more services.
                        However, in CUNY’s experience, base budgeting does not protect a center from
                        financial cuts as dictated by the institution. Budget cuts then impacted the number
                        of students who could be supported by the center. The budget is further impacted by
                        the fact that universities cannot often pay technical staff enough in comparison to
                        private sector wages as the center at Nebraska found.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">There is also the constant struggle around staffing. For some it is determining the
                        right number of staff. In Northeastern’s experience, too small and the center risks
                        missing key skills and expertise. Of course, growing too fast presents its own
                        challenges. Northeastern grew by 50% over the past year and needed to find ways to
                        do this in an effective way. In other cases, reliance on students means high
                        turnover and working around their course work and dissertations. CUNY has found that
                        there is always a feeling of retraining. At Nebraska, staff often find themselves
                        spread thin and there is a need for additional people to lessen the stress. And of
                        course, the time required to run these centers is intensive and often takes more
                        time than allocated in a job description. The interviewee from Indiana was allocated
                        approximately 50% of their job to the center but the work often bleeds over that
                        time allotment. </div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p37">Given the small sample size for this study, it is hard to generalize about DH/DS
                        centers. However, some preliminary conclusions can be made. First, these centers
                        show characteristics of many similar ones
                        (Zorich,
                        2008). These centers offer a common range of activities and services with a
                        combination of people, including researchers, librarians, technologists, students,
                        postdoctoral fellows, and infrastructure, ranging from hardware, software and
                        training
                        (Kirk
                        et al., 2017). However, they do not offer “everything under the sun” but rather have
                        found that it is important to set boundaries around services and activities offered,
                        complimenting that which is offered in other parts of campus
                        (Bergstrom,
                        2016). Funding often comes from the library, speaking to their active roles in these
                        centers
                        (Bergstrom,
                        2016). They also get budgets from a variety of places including academic
                        departments, university administrative offices, grants, and endowments
                        (Goldenberg-­Hart, 2016, Lewis
                        et al., 2015, Zorich, 2008). Ultimately, these centers are linked to their
                        institution’s goals and mission
                        (Goldenberg-­Hart, 2016, Kirk
                        et al., 2017).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p38">Having said this, it is clear that each center is unique and shaped by its context
                        (Goldenberg-­Hart,
                        2016). Some centers, such as Saskatchewan, Princeton and Ryerson, started in
                        response to a faculty member’s research projects
                        (Zorich,
                        2008). These individuals played a key role as champion for their center
                        (Kirk et al., 2017, Lippincott
                        et al., 2014a). For some, this means that they are part of the library and offer
                        services to more than students and researchers based in the humanities. This
                        includes the centers at Hamilton, Northeastern, Saskatchewan and Brown. Others, such
                        as Princeton, Ryerson, and Texas A&amp;M, are based in a faculty or department, even
                        if they are still physically situated in the library. Further, other centers are a
                        combination of the library and faculty as is the case with Indiana and Nebraska.
                        This organization structure is reflected in the co-director model with someone from
                        the library and someone from the faculty serving as directors, representing these
                        important stakeholders
                        (Rosenblum
                        et al., 2016). Finally, given the nature of the institution, CUNY’s center is free
                        standing within the graduate center. </div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">The differences between the centers can also be found in
                        the funding envelopes. Some are funded through substantial base budgets from provost
                        offices as is the case with Princeton and CUNY. This reflects the support that can
                        come from senior administration. Other centers have hybrid funding models with cash
                        and in-kind budgets flowing from the library, faculty and departments. This includes
                        Nebraska and Indiana and demonstrates a broad base support for DH/DS at the
                        institution. Another funding model focuses on base budgets from libraries like the
                        case of Northeastern which reinforces the role of the library as a home for these
                        centers. There is some evidence to suggest that those centers based in or associated
                        with libraries might be in the best financial position
                        (Lewis
                        et al., 2015) and have more stability and ability to plan long term
                        (Cox,
                        2016). Finally, while it enjoys cash and in-kind funding for its activities, Ryerson
                        is an example of a center that has not be able to convert this support to permanent,
                        ongoing funding. It continues to lobby for this and is hopeful that it will
                        come.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p40">These centers’ experiences speak to the importance of strong leadership during start
                        up and operations. For example, the center at Indiana was almost leaderless for
                        several years which meant that it struggled. It is now back on “surer feet” with a
                        co-director model between the library and faculty. People with vision are needed to
                        start a center, drive the process, and secure funding and administrative support
                        (Coll et al., 2020, Cummings et
                        al., 2020, Zorich, 2008). They are able to gather together important stakeholders,
                        often found among those already doing DH/DS at the institution, and funding. These
                        partnerships and collaboration are important to created shared ownership and
                        investment
                        (Cummings
                        et al., 2020). The Ryerson interviewee stated that by doing this, the stakeholders
                        would be able to help each other out and express a common focus for the center. It
                        is important that this vision be articulated for a broad audience. For example,
                        Nebraska posted a document that outlined the ways in which the center was started
                        and built on efforts already present at the university
                        (Edwards,
                        2005). Among these were decisions to make cluster hires in DH to broaden the
                        research focus in the area on campus. Drs. Ives and Earheart
                        (nd)
                        wrote a white paper for the purpose of establishing a DH center at Texas A&amp;M
                        which led to funds to start a center. Efforts such as these gain support from senior
                        administration who also have their own vision for a center. Often, it is because
                        they want the university to be seen as leaders in DH/DS. Northeastern brought in the
                        present director to build the center and quickly establish a presence in digital
                        humanities and scholarship. Advantages to strong leadership exist. In particular,
                        it
                        can mean that the center is better able to survive the inevitable transitions of
                        people and mandate
                        (Zorich,
                        2008). However, this is not always guaranteed as is the case for Hamilton where the
                        center’s mandate and structure changed when senior management turned over.
                        Ultimately, strong relationships with administration is needed along with financial
                        backing and political capital
                        (Cummings
                        et al., 2020). Otherwise, as the Ryerson interviewee expressed, it is a lot of work
                        with few benefits.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">The interviewees also expressed the importance and advantages of at least some base
                        budget with minimal reliance of grant funding. At the best case, a center would not
                        be in the position of Ryerson where it is continually asking for funds and writing
                        grants. Of course, these centers feel that they could always use more funding to
                        hire staff and undertake more activities. With additional funds, Ryerson would be
                        able to make the center coordinator position full-time which would mean that the
                        center could undertake more outreach and project support. In Princeton’s case, they
                        would hire a communication person. One advantage of some base budget is the ability
                        to hire permanent staff which is good for morale. It also addresses some of the
                        challenges of attracting and retaining staff when private sector salaries are often
                        higher (Goldenberg-­Hart, 2016,
                        Lippincott et al., 2014a, Zorich, 2008).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p42">In terms of human resources, these centers tended to
                        start small and offered services that could be supported by the staff and expertise
                        available
                        (Bergstrom,
                        2016). While they could often not offer competitive salaries and a clear career path
                        for many staff
                        (Lewis
                        et al., 2015, Prescott, 2016), they could offer non-monetary rewards such as time
                        for independent research projects, space, titles, professional development
                        opportunities, new skill and knowledge development, and flexible work
                        (Goldenberg-­Hart, 2016, Lewis
                        et al., 2015, Lippincott et al., 2014a, Zorich, 2008). There are also clear
                        advantages to undergraduate and graduate students working in the centers, offering
                        training and working on faculty research projects
                        (Goldenberg-­Hart,
                        2016). As these centers found, they gained valuable skills and employment and
                        opportunities for further training after graduation. However, this reliance on
                        students comes at a potential cost with constant turnover
                        (Lewis
                        et al., 2015). CUNY experiences this and finds that they are continually training
                        new students. In terms of leadership, while there are advantages to a focus of one
                        faculty member as a guiding force over a long period of time, a center needs to be
                        able to transition to new leadership
                        (Alexander
                        et al., 2012).</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p43">In conclusion, these ten centers are examples of ones which have successfully
                        supported the faculty, staff, and students on their campuses. Their experiences
                        provide insight into some of the primary services offered, staffing, funding, key
                        factors for success and challenges and suggest some important implications for those
                        wishing to start their own center. These results compliment the case studies
                        highlighted above and reports on center start up written by other DH/DS centers
                        (Hanson
                        et al., n.d., Miller et al., 2008).</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p44">First, it is important to have champions at the faculty,
                        library and senior administration levels who can articulate a vision for the center
                        and develop the important partnerships and collaborations needed to start and
                        sustain a center. They need to collaborate with stakeholders, such as the library,
                        other research centers, faculties and departments, and researchers, whose goals and
                        objectives align with the center’s. As
                        Fraistat
                        (2012) articulates, collaborative efforts are needed both within the center itself
                        and with its partners. Part of the partnership building can be conducting an
                        environmental scan and needs assessment to determine what is needed, what is
                        available and who is interested in participating in the center
                        (Kirk
                        et al., 2017). This information can be used to carefully evaluate the types of
                        services, activities and programs which will be offered by the center. As these
                        centers have found, it is often useful to start small and grow organically and not
                        try to do everything at once.</div>
                     
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p45">Second, in terms of budget, some level of base budget is
                        beneficial. It provides certainty of funding from year to year and allows the center
                        to hire permanent staff. These interviewees would caution heavy reliance on grants.
                        They can be useful for new programming and experiments, but one might find
                        themselves in a cycle of always needing to write grant applications.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p46">Third, graduate and undergraduate students and
                        postdoctoral fellows are valuable resources for these centers and should be a part
                        of any DH/DS center. There are many benefits to their involvement. They help advance
                        faculty research, teach workshops and courses on DH/DS, provide project management
                        in some cases and other activities. Just as importantly, the students and
                        postdoctoral fellows gain valuable skills and expertise which leads to employment
                        and further studies. The centers play an important role growing the next generation
                        of humanities scholars and researchers.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p47">Of course, these implications for practice are not magic
                        formulas for DH/DS center start up and operations, but rather smart practices
                        gleaned from the experience of ten centers with many years successful operation
                        supported by case studies and other research. They provide guidance to those who are
                        investigating the possibilities of a DH/DS on their campus or looking to revitalize
