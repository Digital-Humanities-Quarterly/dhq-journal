         <dhq:abstract>
            <p>This essay takes as axiomatic that the subject of new media – which in other contexts
               we call the user, the reader, the writer (or in institutional contexts, the
               researcher, the teacher, the student…) – is a subject of language. This subject’s
               engagements with media and, by way of media, with other subjects, are determined by
               relations founded on language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the
                  <term>social bond</term> of discourse.</p>
            <p>I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital
               field, particularly as the field shifts towards a more unified disciplinarity and a
               more secure institutional footing, can be described in relation to the graphs of
               Lacan’s <q>four discourses</q> – of the University, Master, Hysteric, and Analyst. I
               conclude that deliberate reflection on structures of our research and pedagogy,
               mapped by the graphs, may lead us beyond the confidence games of the master and the
               University – on and by which our inquiries are founded and oriented, but also
               narrowed – to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose collaborations are more
               productive of new forms of knowledge.</p>

            <quote rend="block" source="#lennon2009">After fifteen years in which its cultural
               dominant was presentist prognostication, even a kind of bullying, the field has

               new media now understood as after all always already new. <ptr target="#lennon2009"/>
               <note>Lennon’s announcement was roughly contemporary with the first versions of this
                  text. That his intervention – which I had had the privilege of reading as a
                  submitted journal manuscript – is now more than three years out, without having
                  produced the bracing effect I imagined then it must have, is evidence of (I think)
                  not only the vexing belatedness of publishing (editing and revising cycles being
                  what they are), but also of the (more vexing) belatedness of critique of our rush
                  toward the always already new.</note>
            </quote>
            <p>The digital field’s preoccupation with presentism and futurism – and the periodizing
               that balancing between them requires (marking off <q>first</q> from <q>second</q>
               waves, <q>golden</q> from <q>silver</q> ages, and so on) – lends itself to fantasies
               of change that are familiar to anyone who has thought much about how we have got to
               where we are. But the temporalities of media, and in their own way – different from
               but dependent on the qualities of their objects – the temporalities of media
               disciplines, are more irregular than talk of ages and waves can encompass. As Lennon
               observes, the <term>always already new</term> figures <quote rend="inline"
                  source="#lennon2009">a more absorbent fold, perhaps</quote> than
                  <term>remediation</term>. Bolter and Grusin’s influential formulation of that
               concept entails a modern, progressive medial evolution, repeatable and accessible to
               measurement – and on that basis, accessible also to a progressive media theorization
                  <ptr target="#bolter1999"/>. In contrast, the always-already aims at experiences
               of change that are tangled in their way of marking time: looking ahead, but also
               visited by atavisms and negativities that make imagining what lies ahead a messier
               undertaking, subject to uncanny feedback systems.</p>
            <p>A case in point is represented by the two episodes that frame Lennon’s reflection on
               new media’s turn to historical reflexivity. The first of these is the publication
               during the 1990s of Michael Joyce’s critical writings on digital media and culture,
                  <q>untimely</q> in Lennon’s estimation and overshadowed by the attention given to
               Joyce’s hypertext fictions of the same period. The second is Joyce’s subsequent
               withdrawal from literary-critical circles whose other members imagined themselves to
               be following his lead – the significance of which, Lennon notes, may be discerned in
               the shocked silence with which that withdrawal has been met.<note>
                  <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#lennon2009">That the undisputed leader of an
                        emerging field might so decisively step back, on what might have been
                        considered the verge of something like victory, is apparently something of a
                        scandal for new media studies. The wrench that Joyce thus threw into the
                        perpetual motion machine of bureaucratic culture – his implicit demand that
                        we simply stop for a while – is not discussed at any length or in any depth
                        in any peer-reviewed published scholarship on Joyce's work currently on
                        record. That is understandable, of course, given that when I say Joyce
                        implicitly demanded we <q>stop,</q> I mean, of course, that he demanded we
                        stop speaking (and writing) with such consensually unadulterable zeal on our
                        topic of choice: an endeavor which, as most every reader of this essay will
                        know – for reasons I will therefore not bother to detail – is structurally
                        impossible</quote>
                     <ptr target="#lennon2009"/>
                  </cit>. The structural impossibility to which Lennon refers here is the imperative
                  within contemporary humanities (and no more than in the digital humanities) to
                  keep writing about, i.e., to keep on writing out, its navel-gazing habitus. To
                  keep on writing out, in other words, the university discourse that is its
                  characteristic form of self-understanding (see below).</note> Here, Lennon
               ingeniously traverses this disappearing act which continues to leave its mark.
               Joyce’s secession in or around 2004, he proposes, should be read not as a retreat
               from literary-critical dialogue, but an act of provocation directed at a culture of
               scholarship that had been too hastily constituted from Joyce’s precedent, and was
               unselfconsciously (and is still) spinning away from the complexities of that
               precedent. Lennon contrasts the <term>essayism</term> of Joyce’s criticism of this
               period – the errant, unfinished, and dissatisfied voice of his writing, more radical
               in its way of acting out than was his hyperfiction – with a more controlled and
               compact critical attitude that seems increasingly characteristic of American new
               media studies. <quote rend="block" source="#lennon2009">The reduction of Joyce to
                  hyperfiction author, in the new media studies scholarship that more or less
                  brackets Joyce’s critical project, is in fact nothing new as a disciplinary
                  gesture; rather, it is a repetition of the founding ruse of literary-critical
                  modernity, in what Clifford Siskin has called <q>novelism</q>: the generation,
                  from a heterogenous and yet unified (or combined and uneven) field of writing, of
                  the separate positions of the self-identified critic and her critical object,
                  produced by the writer. In the subordination of writing, a discourse and an
                  institution, to the (fabricated) research object <q>the novel,</q> modern
                  disciplinarity in the literary sphere naturalizes writing as mimesis – that is,
                     <emph>gives it a job to do</emph>, in determined opposition to the radical
                  self-reflexivity of writing as mass professionalization itself, in its capacity
                  simultaneously to expand and to contract the division of intellectual labor. <ptr
                     target="#lennon2009"/>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Joyce’s stopping out, Lennon surmises, was at least in part in response to his
               reduction to the role of its most important critical test case <ptr
                  target="#harpold2008" loc="6.01"/>. It was also (and I think this among the most
               important implications of Lennon’s reading of his framing episodes) an expression of
               dissatisfaction derived from Joyce’s earlier way of writing out his relation as
               critic to the objects of his criticism. Sacrificed in the field’s coalescing around
               the novelist mode of research is some of the raw productivity of writing and reading
               in the essayist mode. There, media are met in a more relational way, and without much
               assurance concerning what they make happen – in, as Joyce had observed, the <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#joyce1995">momentary awkwardness</quote> of an encounter
               with something that may be unprecedented <ptr target="#joyce1995" loc="219–26"/>. If,
               as Lennon proposes, new media’s discovery of an always-already-new temporality is a
               sign of its arriving at a position of more unified disciplinarity, this has involved
               setting aside the excesses of first wave theorists such as Joyce. That is a way of
               effectively focusing on the job at hand, but only at the cost of repressing some of
               its complexity, or the complexity of our imagining that there is a job or jobs, and
               not instead some aggregates of unfinished and uncompletable – <foreign xml:lang="de"
                  >unendliche</foreign>
               <ptr target="#freud1937"/> – encounters. Repressing, that is, styles of critical
               engagement that are less confident of their security and more anxious (or euphoric)
               about media’s inmixing of subjects and objects, which anxiety (and euphoria) Joyce’s
               essayist precedents brilliantly exemplified.</p>

            <head>Four Turns</head>
            <p>I want to give shape to this line of reasoning along four turns of language, which I
               draw from the graphs French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan named the <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#lacan1991a">four discourses,</quote> introduced in his
               XVIIth seminar, <title rend="italic">L’Envers de la psychanalyse</title> (<title
                  rend="quotes">The Other Side of Psychoanalysis,</title> 1969–70; <ptr

                     xml:lang="fr">l’envers</foreign> signifies several related but distinct
                  meanings: <q>other side,</q>
                  <q>reverse,</q>
                  <q>lining</q> (as in the lining of a garment), or – with a hint of scandal –
                     <q>underside</q> or <q>seamy side.</q> As Nobus observes, <title rend="italic"
                     >L’Envers de la psychanalyse</title> is the title given by seminar editor
                  Jacques-Alain Miller <ptr target="#nobus2005" loc="219n9"/>. Lacan’s original
                  title was <title rend="italic">La Psychanalyse à l’envers</title>, <title
                     rend="quotes">Psychoanalysis Upside-Down</title>
                  <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="12"/>.</note> The graphs figure (in the order in
               which I will discuss them) the discourses of the <emph>University</emph>, the
                  <emph>Master</emph>, the <emph>Hysteric</emph>, and the <emph>Analyst</emph>
               (Figures 5–8). Each describes relations of the linguistic foundations, subjects, and
               objects of knowledge in a different way, according to different structural relations
               of those elements. By extension, each of the graphs figures distinctive, but related,
               disciplinary practices, the efficiencies of which are characterized by these
               different structural relations. At the risk of disclosing the punch line before most
               of the work of setting it up, my claim is the four discourses describe the dominant
               effects of modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital
               field. The graphs’ descriptions of these modes demonstrate how it is that we got to
               where we are, and point toward other, I think more productive, paths of disciplinary
               practice.</p>
            <p>The graphs of the four discourses are highly formalized, and the typographic and
               terminological units they circulate have specific meanings in Lacan’s thought. Once
               these units are defined, the graphs operate on them with a notable directness and
               concreteness; they perform the relations they describe. (<hi rend="italic">Dēscrībō:
                  they write out these relations.</hi>) In this regard, the graphs are uniquely
               productive, in that they generate from determinate conditions of knowledge, new forms
               of knowledge. What I am after in this essay is a way, with the graphs of the four
               discourses also in hand, of taking hold of recent critical and teaching practices of

                  writer (or in institutional contexts, the researcher, the teacher, the student),
                  that this subject is a subject of language – in Lacan’s terminology, a speaking
                  subject. Whatever other aspects of the subject also may be marked – gender,
                  ethnicity, or biology, for example: all important considerations in their own
                  right – language is fundamental. This means something precise in Lacan’s thought:
                  not that the subject is inclined or capable of making use of language in the
                  everyday sense, but that it is only inclined to and capable of expressing itself,
                  indeed of being a subject at all, within relations imposed by language. (See, for

            </p>
            <p>Beginning with the introduction of the four discourses in Seminar XVII, Lacan
               amplifies discourse’s knotting of its interlocutors: discourse is now characterized
               as <quote rend="inline" source="#lacan1998b">a social bond [<foreign xml:lang="fr"
                     >lien social</foreign>], founded on language [<foreign xml:lang="fr"
                     >langage</foreign>]</quote> (1972–73, <ptr target="#lacan1998b" loc="16–17"/>).
               This formula echoes Saussure’s definition of language [<foreign xml:lang="fr"
                  >langue</foreign>] as a <cit>

                  <ptr target="#saussure1966" loc="13"/>
               </cit> but, crucially, shifts the locus of sociality from the abstract code of langue
               (the system of signs deployed in speech [<foreign xml:lang="fr">parole</foreign>]) to
               the material circulation of signifiers between speaker and addressee.<note>On the

                  substitution of <foreign xml:lang="fr">langage</foreign> for <foreign
                     xml:lang="fr">langue</foreign>), see <ptr target="#evans1996" loc="96–98"
                  />.</note> In this reading, the social bond is realized in a concrete, dynamic
               exchange in which subjects recognize each other and themselves according to
               (conscious and unconscious, present and past) relations of signifiers. Those
               relations are determinate; the sociality of the bond obtains, so far as Lacan is
               concerned, wholly in signifying operations, not in the conventions of langue or as a
               consequence of the positive content of speech.<note>That the social bond can be
                  strictly formalized in this way accounts for why Lacanian discourse theory has
                  been productively applied to a range of institutional, political, and pedagogical
                  situations in which problems of knowledge and agency are foregrounded. See for

            <p>Lacan builds the graphs of the four discourses within this material-relational schema
               of speech by mapping it onto circulations of four terms which are of particular
               significance in his teaching: S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>, the master signifier;
                  S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, the field of knowledge; $, the divided subject; and
                  <term>a</term>, the <foreign xml:lang="fr">objet petit a</foreign>. </p>
            <p>The master signifier (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>, <ref target="#figure02">Figure
                  2</ref>) orients the expression and reception of discourse <ptr
                  target="#lacan2007" loc="13"/>. In this role it is comparable to the famous <quote
                  rend="inline" source="#lacan1993">quilting point</quote> [<foreign xml:lang="fr"
                  >point de capiton</foreign>], the site of convergence in a signifying chain in
               relation to which the rest of the chain is situated, retrospectively and
               prospectively <ptr target="#lacan1993" loc="268"/>, <ptr target="#lacan2006"
                  loc="681"/>. We are familiar with the master signifiers of the digital field; as
               scholars and teachers we traffic in them and appropriate them to new ends: terms like
                  <term>avatar</term>, <term>home</term>, <term>interface</term>,
                  <term>screen</term>, <term>trail</term>, and proper names like Bush, Engelbart,
               Nelson, and so on. Our fluency in them is a sign of disciplinary competence, and the
               invention of new master signifiers a key to our professional success. Our speech is
               bound to contours introduced by S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>; we can’t imagine what
               we achieve in discourse without it <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="129–30, 188"/>.
               Consequently, Lacan accords this signifier<hi rend="subscript"> </hi>a special
               importance: there is no anchor of a discourse’s reference, or the subject’s position
               in the field of speech, except by way of S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>s cleaving off
               from other signifiers as their support and alibi <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="189"
               />. As Lacan envisages it, this is a strictly formal operation; whatever positive
               content S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> may be imagined to convey in other contexts is
               irrelevant to its function in this regard.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> (<ref target="#figure02">Figure 2</ref>) figures the
               battery of signifiers whose network constitutes the knowledge (<foreign xml:lang="fr"
                  >savoir</foreign>) transmitted by a discourse, in which S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >1</hi> intervenes as a point of reference, as the term that anchors the
               expression of knowledge. The temporality of the intervention is ambiguous. Strictly
               speaking, S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> may precede S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> as a
               mere aggregate of signifiers, gathered incidentally to the situation in which speech
               (an ordered chain of signifiers) comes to function as discourse (a social bond
               founded on language). S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>s intervention in S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi> makes it appear – that is, effectively makes it come to
               pass – that S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> specific to this discourse articulates an <cit>

               </cit>, for which S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> stands, retrospectively, as its
               support. In this way, S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> impresses order on the expression
               of S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, in relation to which the speaking subject recognizes
               itself and others by way of their adherence to S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, as a
               style or idiom of a shared vocabulary. When we identify ourselves as <q>new media

               <q>software studies</q>), we situate our speech within fields of knowledge (S<hi

               acknowledge the subjection of our speech to the relations of S<hi rend="subscript"

            <p>$ (<ref target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>) figures the split or divided subject. In
               Lacan’s thought, the speaking subject is said to be <term>split</term> by effects of
               language in two respects, in that what is possible for the subject to say is always
               at a remove from that to which speech can refer, and in that the aim of the speech
               act is always ahead of or behind what it signifies. </p>
            <p>The first dimension of this split follows from Saussure’s division of the sign into
               signifier and signified <ptr target="#saussure1966"/>. From the breakthrough of the

                  />.</note> Lacan insisted that this division be rigorously respected in
               psychoanalysis: anything that the subject communicates of its desires must be
               recognized as always-already destabilized by the non-coincidence of the signified
               with the signifier <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="227, 595–6, 712"/>, <ptr
                  target="#lacan2007" loc="33"/>. And more so: Lacan’s revision of Saussure’s

                  target="#lacan2006" loc="428"/> – upends semiology’s privileging of signified (<hi

            <p>The second dimension of the subject’s split in language is signaled in grammatical
               and temporal ambiguities of speech, as described by two related concepts which Lacan
               draws from the work of Roman Jakobson – the <q>shifter</q> – and Émile Benveniste –
               the distinction between the subject of the statement and the subject of the
               enunciation. A shifter [<foreign xml:lang="fr">embrayeur</foreign>] is a linguistic
               element whose meaning cannot be determined without taking into account that a sender
               and a receiver are engaged in an act of communication <ptr target="#jakobson1990"
                  loc="398"/>.<note>The term <term>shifter</term> was coined by Otto Jespersen in
                  1922.</note> There are many species of shifters <ptr target="#ducrot1979"
                  loc="252, 324ff"/>, but first and second person pronouns represent the plainest
               examples: the terms <q>I</q> and <q>you</q> designate a particular person – the one
               who speaks, or the one to or about whom is spoken – only in the context of a speech
               act. There, the shifter is associated with that person by convention (<q>you</q> =
               the woman to whom I speak; in Peircian terms, the shifter <q>symbolizes</q> her),
               while at the same time it points to her by virtue of an immediate, existential
               relation to the speech act; it concerns specific conditions of the speech act as well
               as she. (<q>You</q> = the woman to whom I speak here and now, in the scene of speech;
               the shifter <q>indexes</q> her. Jakobson calls shifters <cit>

                  </cit>.</note> For Lacan, the duplex aspect of the shifter is evidence of the
               relationality of discourse, particularly with regard to the speaker. When I speak of
               myself (<q>I speak</q>), the agent for and of whom I speak, and the signifier that
               figures that agent in speech are not ontologically coincident; the first person
               pronoun designates only a point of contact between this supposed agent and a
               signifier. Furthermore, the signifier and this supposed agent can only seem to
               coincide in that my speech is directed to an other (my addressee – <q>you</q> – but
               more concretely, another signifier, <hi rend="italic">ju</hi>:), in relation to which
               the signifier I (<hi rend="italic">aɪ</hi>) has meaning. (According to Lacan’s famous
               dictum, <quote rend="inline" source="#lacan1972b #lacan2007">The definition of a
                  signifier is that it represents the subject not for another subject but for
                  another signifier</quote>
               <ptr target="#lacan1972b" loc="194"/>
               <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="47–48"/>.) Moreover, because Lacan treats the shifter
               as an indexical <term>signifier</term>
               <ptr target="#evans1996" loc="182"/>, its notional reference, contingent on the
               structure of the speech act, is subordinated to patterns of the signifying chain.
               Whereas linguists treat the shifter as a special case in problems of linguistic
               reference, for Lacan the shifter (and especially the I of the first person)
               exemplifies the speaking subject’s fundamental destabilization ($) in the field of
               speech <ptr target="#lacan1958" loc="19 Nov. 1958"/>, <ptr target="#lacan2006"
                  loc="556"/>.</p>
            <p>Correlatively, Lacan radicalizes the implications of Benveniste’s distinction between
               the subjects of enunciation and statement <ptr target="#lacan1971" loc="223–30"/>.
               The statement [<foreign xml:lang="fr">énoncé</foreign>] is the chain of signifiers
               that appears to stand apart from the speech act in place of things and events to
               which the speech act refers. The subject of the statement is the agent designated (or
               implied to have been designated) thereby. The enunciation [<foreign xml:lang="fr"
                  >énonciation</foreign>] is the speech act as it takes place in the here and now of
               an utterance. Its agent exists only in the moment of the utterance, and is
               immediately thereafter eclipsed by the subject of the statement. It is the illusion
               of a continuous present in speech, Benveniste says, which sutures the temporal split
               between these subjects <ptr target="#benveniste1971" loc="227"/>. For Lacan, this
               split (<foreign xml:lang="fr">refente</foreign>) is another consequence of the
               determinate effect of the signifying chain as evidenced in the shifter <ptr
                  target="#lacan2006" loc="650"/>, which designates the subject of the enunciation
               (viz., associates that vanishing entity retrospectively with the subject of the
               statement) but does not signify that subject, in the way that Lacan understands
                  <q>signifierness</q> [<foreign xml:lang="fr">significance</foreign>] to mean a
               dynamic interplay of elements of the chain in the here-and-now <ptr
                  target="#lacan2006" loc="677, 764–65"/>. The subject <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >qua</foreign> speaking subject is therefore suspended between ($) the registers
               of the enunciation and statement <ptr target="#lacan1998a" loc="139"/>, <ptr
                  target="#lacan2006" loc="758"/>.</p>
            <p>The fourth term of the graphs, the <term>a</term>, is the glyph of Lacan’s <term
                  xml:lang="fr">objet petit a</term> – <q>the little a object,</q> considered by
               devotees of Lacan to be the most original and nuanced theoretical element of his
               teaching <ptr target="#evans1996" loc="124–26"/>, <ptr target="#miller1990"/>. For my
               purposes, <term xml:lang="fr">objet petit a</term> can be characterized as a thing
               excluded from discourse while also determining its structure. Partly real, partly
               imaginary, the <term>a</term> persists outside of the symbolic, a remnant of
               language’s parceling of the undifferentiated real into series of manipulable elements
               (signifiers), which the speaking subject combines and recombines in an (always
               unsuccessful) effort to bring the <term>a</term> into representation.<note> The
                  imaginary portion of the <term>a</term> distinguishes it from the brute real
                  object Lacan calls <q>The Thing</q> (<foreign xml:lang="fr">la Chose</foreign>,
                     <foreign xml:lang="de">das Ding</foreign>), which would be radically
                  inaccessible to the subject in any form. This distinction is less marked in the
                  later Lacan, where the real dimension of the <term xml:lang="fr">objet petit
                     a</term> is more emphasized <ptr target="#evans1996" loc="205"/>.</note> Thus
               Lacan describes the <term>a</term> as the object-cause of desire, urging on desire's
               expressions, which find their motive force in being unable to resolve
               <term>a</term>’s status within the field of language <ptr target="#lacan2001"
                  loc="207"/>.<note>
                  <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="696"/>, <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="108"/>. Lacan
                  characterizes the <term>a</term> in the graphs of the four discourses as a <term
                     xml:lang="fr">plus-de-jouir</term>
                  <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="107"/>: a pun in French (and a nod to Marx’s concept
                  of surplus-value) meaning both a surplus <foreign>jouissance</foreign> (some
                  quotient of the enjoyment of part-real, part-imaginary a that goads desire on with
                  its persistence), and no <foreign>jouissance</foreign> at all.</note> This is the
               impasse of desire disclosed by the psychoanalytic clinic: desire’s primordially
               extrinsic cause (<term>a</term>) can’t be brought into speech (S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >2</hi>), as an unmediated experience of the object-cause is forbidden to the
               speaking subject as such ($); it can only be named in absentia by retroactively
               pinning speech to a particular signifier (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>); language can
               convey no positive object that satisfies desire.<note> Thus the characteristic
                  (neurotic) objection, <q>No, that’s not it!</q> that shadows every object
                  presented to desire, memorialized in Charles Swann’s bitter riposte near the end
                  of Proust’s <title rend="italic">Swann’s Way</title>: <q>To think that I’ve wasted
                     years of my life, that I wanted to die, that I had my greatest love, for a

               </cit>, such that imagined satisfaction and its actual impossibility are inscribed
               within the same scenario. Satisfaction would have arrived in a real and lasting way,
               the neurotic imagines, if things had been <q>just-so,</q> if everything had lined up
                  <q>as it should have,</q>
               <q>if only</q> this or that had happened, etc. – if, that is, <term>a</term> could
               have been made to come forward by way of S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi>, which is categorically prohibited.<note> This dependency
                  of desire on the extra-linguistic object-cause (<term>a</term>) is why criticisms
                  of Lacan’s supposed structuralist orthodoxy, that he reduces human subjectivity to
                  mere operations of signifiers (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>, S<hi rend="subscript"
                     >2</hi>), are mistaken. His oft-repeated dictum <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#lacan1998c #lacan2006">there is no metalanguage</quote> (for example,
                     <ptr target="#lacan1998c" loc="74"/>, <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="691"/>)
                  does not mean that human experience is defined by and limited to the field of
                  speech, but in a way the opposite of this. The impossibility of a metalanguage
                  means that there is no position outside of language from which to fully represent
                  the experience of the subject, because the outside (<term>a</term> as real and
                  imaginary) is constitutive of the (speaking) subject as such ($).</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the graphs of the four discourses, these terms – S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>,
                  S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, $ and <term>a</term> – are slotted into four
               positions (<ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>).<note>The horizontal bars and
                  arrow shown in Figures 4–8 follow the original presentation of the graphs in
                  Seminar XVII (1969–70). In <title rend="quotes">Radiophonie</title> (the redacted
                  transcript of a 1970 interview on Belgian radio, <ptr target="#lacan2001"
                     loc="403–47"/>), Lacan introduces modifications to the graphs to which he had
                  alluded in Seminar XVII <ptr target="#lacan1971" loc="203"/>, adding a curved
                  arrow beneath the bars pointing in the direction opposite to the arrow above the
                  bars – that is, pointing back from production to the truth – and labels on the
                  arrow on the top, <q>impossibility,</q> and the arrow on the bottom,
                     <q>powerlessness</q> or <q>inability</q> [<q>
                     <foreign xml:lang="fr">l'impuissance</foreign>
                  </q>]. (See <ptr target="#nobus2005"/> and <ptr target="#verhaeghe1995"/> for
                  well-developed readings of these additions. I will address their relevance to my
                  applications of the discourses below.) Seminar XVIII (1971) reproduces the graphs
                  in nearly the same forms, with one notable change: the Discourse of the Master
                  (DM) is shown with arrows crossing from the lower left and right terms up to the
                  opposing terms on above the bars, and a dotted line drawn between the terms below
                  the bars (March 17, 1971). The new glyphs were added, we may presume, to emphasize
                  the indirection of relations between S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and a, $ and
                     S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, that the DM installs, also characteristic of
                  relations of the terms in the other discourses. Seminar XX (1972–73) reproduces
                  the <title rend="quotes">Radiophonie</title> versions of the graphs. The DM and
                  Discourse of the Analyst (DA) are repeated in new variants in Seminars XIX
                  (1971–71 <ptr target="#lacan2011"/>) and XXI (1973–74 <ptr target="#lacan1973"/>).
                  In Seminar XIX, the DA is shown with a left-pointing arrow under the bars <ptr
                     target="#lacan2011" loc="139"/>, to emphasize the determination of S<hi
                     rend="subscript">2</hi> by S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>. Later in the seminar
                     <ptr target="#lacan2011" loc="193"/>, Lacan substitutes for the positions
                     <term>agent</term>, <term>other</term> and <term>production</term>, the terms
                     <term xml:lang="fr">semblant</term>, <term xml:lang="fr">jouissance</term> and
                     <term xml:lang="fr">plus-de-jouir</term> (see above, note 14), presumably to
                  note the patient’s supposition of the analyst’s agency, and the productive effect
                  of the patient’s jouissance. In Seminar XXI, the DA is shown with arrows
                  traversing the bars, pointing up from the lower left, and down from the upper
                  right, perhaps to emphasize the rotation between terms that generates the
                  production, S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> (Nov. 20, 1973), as such a rotation was
                  implied in earlier variants. In this seminar, the DM is shown with the crossed
                  arrows and dotted line of the Seminar XVIII DM variant. It is hard to decide upon
                  the specific significances of these variations of the graphs. Lacan’s continued
                  manipulation of them is evidence of his putting them to work in different
                  conditions of his teaching.</note>

                        critic’s descriptions of the four discourses, Lacan seems not to have
                        written out the labels shown in <ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref> for
                        the attendees of his seminars. The apparent exception is <ptr

                        seminar’s editor. Neither the graphs nor the diagram of the positions appear
                        in an unofficial transcription of the seminar <ptr target="#lacan1972a"/>,
                        and that text, substantially different from the official version, indicates
                        that Lacan expected his audience simply to be familiar with the
                        graphs.</note>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>

            <p>Between the upper terms, the arrow figures the agent’s interrogation of the other.
               This may be a demand for recognition or satisfaction; in the most general sense, it
               is a pure event of discourse: a spoken provocation aimed at making something happen.
               As in other Lacanian mathemes that include this typographic element <ptr
                  target="#lacan2006" loc="428"/>, the horizontal bars on each side of the graph
               figure a breach between the upper and lower registers, in this case a refusal or
               ignorance on the part of the term above bar with regard to the term below the bar.
               Thus, the agent takes itself to be the instigator of the interrogation, but this is
               only apparently the case; the actual instigator of the interrogation (as the
               expression of a social relation) is the truth on which discourse is based <ptr
                  loc="62" target="#lacan2007"/>. Similarly, the other takes itself to be the
               definite target of the interrogation, but discourse actually aims at bringing the
               production forward into a social relation.</p>
            <p>With these definitions out of the way, let’s allow the graphs to
                  operate.<note>Prefatory to that which follows, I should say that I take seriously
                  Dany Nobus and Malcolm Quinn’s injunction that <cit>

                        account of the irreducibly obscure and not be used as means for producing a

                  such as this; that discourse in particular is adept at covertly shuttling the
                  master back to a controlling position, with all the impostures of understanding
                  that this entails, and which the simplicity (and extensibility) of the graphs may
                  seem to authorize. What I have tried to do is to allow the graphs to work in their
                  own way — like levers or pliers <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="169"/> — in relation
                  to the recent history of an emerging discipline: unsettled and unsettling, and in

                  not reduce the social bond of speech in the digital field to the mere quadratures
                  of four diagrams. Rather than circumscribing conditions of knowledge in the field,
                  it should, if I have been successful, demonstrate the instability and
                  uncompletability of those conditions, and show the way forward to more productive
                  expressions of them.</note>

                  5</ref>) is characteristic of research and pedagogy in their institutional
               settings, such as the university or the laboratory, in which practices of
               investigation, description, and indoctrination are dominant <ptr target="#lacan2007"
                  loc="31"/>. Because the disciplinary formation of knowledge in the digital field
               is among my primary concerns in this essay, I will begin with this discourse.</p>
            <p>In the DU, a field of knowledge (S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>) is the discourse’s
               agent, propped upon a master signifier (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>), the choice of
               which guarantees S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>s apparent consistency. Knowledge
               interrogates something outside of itself (S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >2</hi> → <term>a</term>), the incitements of which it wishes to appropriate to
               itself and to bring into closer association with S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>.
               Produced by this is the subject specific to the DU ($), divided along the fissure of
               its affiliation with institutional thought and its repression of other modes of
               relation to the object-cause (<term>a</term>). In this way, the DU expresses, by its
               single-minded devotion to investigation and truth-finding <ptr target="#lacan2007"
                  loc="105"/>, also a desire-to-not-know some aspects of the objects that trouble
               it, namely those which designate a relational framework of knowledge ($).<note>Thus,
                     S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> is related to a by the disjunction of the
                  impossibility <ptr target="#verhaeghe1995"/> of the former to capture the latter,
                  and $ is related to S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> by the disjunction of the
                  powerlessness of the master to escape effects of his insertion in the field of
                  speech. See note 18, above.</note> Interrogation under the DU may amount to little
               more than obstinate fiddling with terms of a defined lexicon (S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >2 </hi>/S<hi rend="subscript">1 </hi>), in willful ignorance of the
               irreducibility of desire ($). In its more supple forms, the DU acknowledges the
               master’s caprice and the subject’s split, but goes on about its business anyway, in
               hope of eventually arriving at another (a more authentic) form of mastery <ptr
                  target="#lacan2007" loc="63"/>.<note>Such forms of the DU view the master’s
                  impostures (see below) with cynicism or outrage, as they presume that all that
                  goes on beneath the bar (<ref target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>) could be rendered
                  inconsequential, were the interrogation to be stripped of historical accident and
                  expressed in <q>objective</q> terms. This is the DU’s typical mode of criticizing
                  the exercise of institutional and political power, for corrupting the honest,
                     <q>scientific</q> inquiry to which it imagines itself to be devoted. </note>
            </p>
            <p>The relevance of the DU to the present state of teaching and research in the digital
               field is marked in our labors to rigorously establish the field’s disciplinarity: to,
               in Lennon’s formulation, naturalize the writing out of critical desire as mimesis (
               S2 ), in place of something more unsettled ($ – which, ironically, is precisely that
               which the DU produces). Taxonomic and descriptive schemes of the finest granularity
               are the epitome of the DU’s aim to bury its troublesome object under a heap of
               positives. Consensus building and canon formation have this quality of beginning from
               definite <foreign xml:lang="la">a priori</foreign> (S1) by which to interrogate the
               eccentric term (<term>a</term>) so as to arrive at a scenario that seems to accrete
               out of the interrogation (S2 → <term>a</term>). Anthologies and archaeologies depend
               on such frameworks (Boluk 2009); crowdsourcing and folksonomies foreground the
               process of accretion and shuffle truth (S1) and product ($) a little behind. We
               haven’t yet our own brand of the DSM (<title rend="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical
                  Manual of Mental Disorders</title> – each revision of which represents the purest
               expression of the DU yet produced), but we have proliferating encyclopedias,
               anthologies, and textbooks. No accrediting professional organizations to determine
               best practices, but emerging cohorts of more voluntary, yet still disorderly, nature,
               which are sustained (S2 / S1) by master signifiers of exemplary resonance –
                  <term>Digital Hum</term>… <term>Electronic… Literature</term>… <term>O</term>… –
               and on which are founded collegial but also doctrinally distinct debates within the
               field (e.g., <ptr target="#gold2012"/>), which from another vantage we might read as
               the productive circulation of master signifiers within the DU’s quadrature.</p>
            <p>It’s not that consensus and canons, anthologies, archaeologies and folksonomies, and
               the like don’t have to be built, or that debates among practitioners about what is
               it, exactly, they do, don’t have to take place. These activities are essential to the
               development of a field, the consolidation of its research, and the training of its
               adherents, in short, to its formation as a discipline. In this regard, the DU
               operates with notable, even laudable, effect. It’s just that the DU isn’t efficacious
               only in the way that we might wish as we go about revising our research reports,
               forming working groups, lobbying our administrators for funding and hires, preparing
               our syllabi, and training our students. We recognize this on some level, and so we
               condition the products of our labors with forecasts of refinements and convictions
               that old problems will be resolved or set aside as no longer applicable under new
               conditions. Or, conversely, with convictions that the old problems may be better
               addressed under more expansive rubrics (<term>hypertext studies</term> and <term>game
                  studies</term> are thus drawn into the penumbras of <term>comparative media
                  studies</term> or digital humanities), and if we house their practitioners in
               already-established divisions of the university. (Matthew Kirschenbaum’s widely-cited
               2010 essay <title rend="quotes">What is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in
                  English Departments?</title> appears to have invited nearly as much normalization
               as the destabilization of its key terms <ptr target="#kirschenbaum2012"
                  />.<note>Kirschenbaum’s reprinted essay opens <ptr target="#gold2012"/> and
                  resurfaces (in its initial <title rend="italic">ADE Bulletin</title> version) in
                  most of the bibliographies of subsequent chapters of the collection.</note> In the
               present intellectual and educational funding climates in the United States, a
               strategic alignment of the digital field with the humanities is increasingly promoted
               as a method of reinvigorating the humanities, when it may be also a method of
               sequestering disruptive potentials of both the humanistic and the digital. One
               consequence of a Lacanian-discursive reading of the strategic alignment, via the DU,
               is that sequestration and disruption are unavoidable.) </p>
            <p>Missing from most scenarios of refinement or containment is an acknowledgement of
               persistent, even irreducible, impasses of language which may be expressed in a
               particular way in the digital field, may require their own, idiomatic, master
               signifiers and their own, idiomatic, strategies of interrogation (S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi>/S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> → <term>a</term>). Similarly,
               periodizing – i.e. temporalizing the field in a progressive mode that relegates first
               waves and golden ages to a historical past, or contrasts modest beginnings with
               new-found largesses of administrators looking for the Next Thing – may function to
               contain the presentness of these impasses. Losing sight of the perdurability of our
               dissatisfaction means giving up also the continuing advantage of our awkwardness.</p>

            <p>In the graph of the Discourse of the Master (DM, <ref target="#figure06">Figure
                  6</ref>) pure prestige and efficiency are paramount. Here, the master signifier
                  (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>) directs the interrogation of knowledge (S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi>). Confident of the unassailability of his agency (S<hi
                  rend="subscript">1</hi> → S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>), the master loses sight of
               the truth of his division ($) and the eccentricity of the object-cause that his
               efforts reveal (<term>a</term>).<note>Here and below I follow convention in referring
                  to the master in the masculine.</note> That his mastery is in the final analysis
               an imposture is irrelevant to him; he doesn’t care to know otherwise because his aim
               is to get something done in an authoritative mode <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="24"
               />. In the master’s mind, the DM is unrelentingly pragmatic, but its pragmatism is
               touched with a millenarian or apocalyptic style, barely holding off a crisis of faith
               which could be catastrophic to it. That’s why there’s something of the obsessional in
               the DM’s way of thinking that is comparable to the DU’s more classic obsessional
               everything-and-the-kitchen-sinking of reason, except that the DM’s compulsion is more
               aggressive because there is more at stake in this undertaking for the master than for
               the bureaucrat.<note>Verhaeghe observes that truth is the term that pushes the four
                  discourses beyond a conventional communications model of discourse, which would
                  confine the graph to those elements above the bar: for the DM, S<hi
                     rend="subscript">1</hi> → S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>
                  <ptr target="#verhaeghe1995"/>. For Freud and Lacan a quotient of the truth of
                  discourse is inaccessible to consciousness: the agent whose interrogation of the
                  other is propped up on truth doesn’t know all that it is saying, and doesn’t want
                  to know what it is (not) saying. Because the DM promotes mastery in place of
                  reflection on the social relation that is the actual basis of knowledge, this
                  discourse demonstrates more directly than the others the ironic sense of Freud’s
                  observation, <cit>

                     <ptr target="#freud1917"/>
                  </cit>. In the DM, S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>
                  are related by the disjunction of the impossibility of the former to circumscribe
                  the latter. $ and a are related by the disjunction of the powerlessness of $ to
                  gain access to a directly. See note 18, above.</note> Whereas the DU’s passion for
               detail is directed toward refinement and exhaustion, the DM is associated with
               predictions of radical transformation, bold ends and beginnings. When it is
               retrospective, the DM summons deep genealogies and traditions so as to prop up a
               brave or catastrophic future. </p>
            <p>Expressions of the DM in the digital field are traced in signifiers of the

            <p>Measuring the effects of these master signifiers is difficult.<note>That they have
                  persisted as master signifiers is evident in that the preceding paragraph can be
                  rewritten as a series of individual terms or short phrases, without attribution,
                  and still will be understood by students of the field: writing space, <q>end of
                     books,</q>
                  <q>convergence,</q> cybertexts, remediation, and so on.</note> Some have lost
               their ability to hold our attention, which may be the most reliable indication of the
               master’s general authority. Others persist in attenuated or negated forms, and this
               also may be a sign of their effectiveness, by a kind of inversion. Among Lennon’s
               targets in his 2009 essay are versions of bright new beginnings that have taken hold
               by way of rejections of the first wave’s recursive negativities in favor of more
               empirical and measured (e.g., less <q>theoretical,</q> less <q>bellettristic,</q>
               which is to say less essayist) practices of writing out the digital field.<note>Among

               master’s delight in transformation toward the rewards of the DU’s finer granularities
               doesn’t surprise – that is the classic trajectory of disciplinary formation – but
               it’s a little too easy to mistake the turn for progress or a refinement of one’s
               assumptions and methods. The DM’s penchant for bold ruptures and the DU’s devotion to
               evidence are not incompatible; both have the alibi of S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> to
               guarantee that we will figure out what we’re about once we get down to real work.
               What undercuts that guarantee is that a fundamental maladaptation of the subject to
               the cause of this work: ($ ◊ <term>a</term>); clever obscurantism and pellucid
               empiricism function as two faces of a single coin. </p>
            <p>But more generally, the mutuality of the DM and the DU is evidence of a principle
               that is clear in Lacan’s treatment of the discourses and which has to be kept in mind
               in any squaring off of the four: none operates in complete isolation from the others.
               If one can be said to dominate in a given situation, it is because the others travel

               one dimension: the more inflexibly S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> prevails, the more it
               limits what is knowable in relation to S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>, and the more
               difficult it will be to grasp the object-cause (<term>a</term>), as it will be more
               operationally estranged from the subject ($). This estrangement is more evident in
               the DM than in the other discourses because the fundamental fantasy
                  ($ ◊ <term>a</term>) is expressed in its underside, beneath the interpellation of
               knowledge by the master signifier <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="108"/>.<note> In
                  contrast, the elements of the fundamental fantasy ($ ◊ <term>a</term>) are
                  distributed differently in the other discourses. In the DU, for example (<ref
                     target="#figure05">Figure 5</ref>), the characteristic ratio of fantasy is
                  inverted and the dynamic of the lozenge is crossed out by a bar (<term>a</term> /
                  $), signaling that the two terms are more effectively divided from one
                  another.</note>

            <p>The graph of the Discourse of the Hysteric (DH, <ref target="#figure07">Figure
                  7</ref>) expresses a relation of dissatisfied and uncompleted inquiry. Here, the

               object-cause (<term>a</term>).<note>Here and below I follow convention in referring
                  to the hysteric in the feminine and her interlocutor in the masculine. The
                  hysteric’s essentially feminine relation to the (masculine) figures who have
                  authority over her desire does not preclude that either or neither of them may be
                  anatomically or culturally male or female <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="33"
                  />.</note> Her interpellation of the master produces knowledge in the form of new
               signifiers (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>/S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>), which take on
               the significance of symptoms of her relations to the master and the object-cause;
               fantasy ($ ◊ <term>a</term>) operates by way of by S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>s
               determination of S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>.</p>
            <p>It is easy to see why Lacan associates this structure of discourse with the
               hysteric’s characteristic styles of speech. Freud’s pathbreaking insight at the birth
               of the psychoanalytic clinic was that hysterical suffering, whatever its
               dysfunctions, communicates a truth ($ / <term>a</term>) of the hysteric’s situation
                  <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="73"/>. It would be incorrect to say that the
               hysteric cannot take hold of the conditions of her suffering, as she is perfectly
               capable of demonstrating these to one who cares to listen <ptr target="#lacan2006"
                  loc="34, 83"/>.<note> In her discourse, $ and S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> are
                  related by the disjunction of the impossibility of $ to represent her (divided)
                  desire to the (ostensibly indivisible) S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>. S<hi
                     rend="subscript">2</hi> and a are related by the disjunction of the
                  powerlessness of S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> to give voice to the a. See note 18,
                  above.</note> Her knowledge is, however, distinctly productive in a way in that it
               cannot on its own be brought to closure or stable reflection; hers is, says Lacan, a
               knowledge that doesn’t know that it knows itself (<foreign xml:lang="fr">un savoir
                  qui ne se sait pas</foreign>, <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="33"/>, trans.
               modified.), but which finds its expression in the presence of an other, the analyst
               who knows how to listen. </p>
            <p>A substantial body of work in the digital field is characterized by one of two styles
               of the DH. The first style resembles the subject Verhaeghe (ironically) terms the
                  <q>good</q> hysteric <ptr target="#verhaeghe1995"/>. She is devoted to the master,
               and acts as if expressions of her faith in him (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>/S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi>) are something in which he is deeply invested. She
               obscures her frustrations and measures her provisional satisfactions in the
               conviction that these labors will one day bring about the master’s enjoyment, and
               vicariously her own. The paradox lies in that the hysteric wants the master’s
               dissatisfaction – she seeks it, she lacks for it – in order that she may (also)
               desire <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="518"/>; <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="129"
                  />.<note>The hysteric’s characteristic question, <q>Am I a man or a woman?</q>
                  amounts to an inquiry into her relation to the object-cause of another’s desire.
                  In Lacanian terms, she sets herself up as the Other’s phallus, and calls on the
                  Other to show evidence of its castration ($), so that she may be the object that
                  repairs that lack <ptr target="#fink1997" loc="122"/>.</note> In the digital
               field, such devotion to the master’s enjoyment is expressed in visions of seamless
               immersion and the erasure of divisions between language and the real – which
               divisions, if we take Lacan seriously, must be understood to be uneraseable because
               they determine the subject <foreign xml:lang="la">qua</foreign> speaking subject
                  ($ / <foreign>a</foreign>; <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="712"/>). Early 1990s
               fantasies in this vein, of totalizing virtualities and <q>post-symbolic</q>
               communication now have been set aside, even by ardent proponents (e.g., <ptr
                  target="#lanier2011"/>), but related fantasies of transcendence are still vigorous
               in some strands of posthumanist thought. In actuality, they are only more exacting
               forms of subjection, the hysteric’s version of the master’s millennial breakout. In
               pop-cultural accounts of the technological singularity in particular (e.g., <ptr
                  target="#kurzweil2005"/>), the master’s imprint on desire is evident in the
               conviction that human self-interest, or the interest of an Other that recognizes
               humanity as its friend or enemy, must span the divide of the transformative
               event.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the second style of the DH resembles Verhaeghe’s <q>bad</q> hysteric
                  <ptr target="#verhaeghe1995"/>. She is uncooperative and openly frustrated with
               the master’s responses to her elaborate demonstrations. In this uncooperative mode,
               her style more nearly grasps her discourse’s dependence on S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >1</hi>, in that she presses the master to show his hand ($ → S<hi
                  rend="subscript">1</hi>) by way of innovating signifiers (S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >2</hi>) expressing her dissatisfaction. This style of the DH more openly
               acknowledges the efficacy of its structure, as it puts the master’s caprice to
               productive work, not as the DU would (conjecturing that eventually the effects of
               structure may be transcended), but by insisting on the irresolution of the hysteric’s
               desire.</p>
            <p>In the digital field, examples of this style of the DH include in particular those
               interrogations that openly confront the subject’s inmixing with her objects of
               analysis. Joyce’s criticism (1995, 2000, 2001), written in a voice I would
               characterize as unambiguously hysterical, is the type of this form of writing out
               that acts out the uncompletability of the critic’s desire – in Lennon’s terminology,
               writing out desire in the essayist mode, in contrast to the DU’s effort to situate
               critic and object on distinct registers, in the novelist mode. Other landmark
               examples include: Shelley Jackson’s dexterous stitchings of her fictional and
               critical personae (e.g., 1995, 1998); John Cayley’s (e.g., 2004, 2010), Loss Pequeño
               Glazier’s (e.g., 2002, 2006) and Talan Memmot’s (e.g., 2001) contributions to a
               digital poetics in which coding and coded voices are robustly inmixed; Stuart
               Moulthrop’s excursions in the garden and the library (e.g., 1991, 1999), which were
               more concerned with the relationality of hypertext writing and reading than their
               efficiencies; Mark Hansen’s intimate reflections on new media affectivity (2004,
               2006); Hayles’s method of <q>autocritography</q> (2002); and Ulmer’s invention
               methodologies of the <q>mystory</q> and <q>MEmorial</q> (1989, 1994, 2005). This is
               the style of interrogation I aimed to activate in <title rend="italic"
                  >Ex-foliations</title> (2008) by first, insisting that critics should hew closely
               to Roland Barthes’s original definition of the lexia in order to seize the term’s
               generative potential in hypertext criticism, as a name (S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>)
               for field effects (S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>) of reading <ptr
                  target="#harpold2008" loc="1.44"/>; and second, by associating these effects with
               what I termed the reader’s <term>historiation</term>, her conscious and unconscious
               recollection of her reading history. Or, to write this out in the style of the bad
               hysteric: a retrospective gathering signifiers in a dissatisfied present
                  ($ / <term>a</term> → S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>) – leading to further,
               unresolved dissatisfactions and further gatherings – is a way forward to new forms of
               knowledge, when this activity is directed at the one who cares to listen <ptr
                  target="#harpold2008" loc="1.55–1.56"/>. Such a generative writing out in the
               style of the DH need not dominate all aspects of the critical encounter. It may be
               expressed as a punctual interruption of a writing out in another discourse or style.
               The pattern of discourse is invariable (<ref target="#figure04">Figure 4</ref>), but
               the positions of the terms in play will be determined by specific provocations of the
               social bond. The key is to remain open to these provocations and their unsettling
               effects, even as disciplinary formations tend to dampen those effects.<note>

                  slips, melancholiac, from the assurance of the DU into the scene I have termed
                  (after Lacan) an inmixing of critic and object, and which I have associated with
                  the DH’s expression of endless dissatisfaction, he sends a message to (another

            <p>The graph of the Discourse of the Analyst (DA, <ref target="#figure08">Figure
               8</ref>) figures the social bond in the scene of the psychoanalytic clinic. Here, the

                  target="#lacan2007"/>, supported by the truth of the signifiers (S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi>) that the analysand presents to him. The analyst
               interrogates the analysand ($), prompting her to produce the master signifiers (S<hi
                  rend="subscript">1</hi>) that orient her speech and her suffering <ptr
                  target="#lacan2007" loc="172–73"/>.</p>
            <p>In the strictest sense, the analyst cannot occupy the place of the <foreign
                  xml:lang="fr">objet petit a</foreign>, as it is eccentric to the field of speech
               by which the analyst and analysand are united. But he may be supposed to occupy its
               place for the analysand, and this supposition is determinate of her coming to
               recognize, beyond the analyst, the master toward whom her speech is directed.<note>
                  We may say that in the DA, the <term>a</term> and $ are related by the disjunction
                  of impossibility because the analyst can only be supposed to occupy its place for
                  a time. S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> are related
                  by the disjunction of the powerlessness of S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> to anchor
                     S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> once and for all: no matter how forcefully S<hi
                     rend="subscript">1</hi> indexes the battery of signifiers (S<hi
                     rend="subscript">2</hi>), other signifiers may always be produced. See note 18,
                  above.</note> (Here, the analyst plays for the analysand the role of the
                  <q>subject-supposed-to-know</q> or <q>subject-supposed-to-knowledge</q> [<foreign

                  target="#lacan2006" loc="254"/>.) But the analyst must not confuse supposed
               knowledge with actual knowledge, as that would mean falling prey to effects of the
               counter-transference. The knowledge that founds their social relation is not in him
               but pertains only to the signifiers they exchange <ptr target="#lacan2001" loc="249"
               />, and he must remain skeptical of the authority invested in him, and even willing
               to surrender it when this is called for.<note>Operationally, this skepticism with
                  regard to the agent’s authority is the plainest distinction between the DA and the
                  DM, and is accounted for in the graph of the DA by its inversion, as in a mirror,
                  of the graph of the DM (see <ref target="#figure06">Figures 6</ref> and <ref
                     target="#figure08">8</ref>). Analogously, the DH’s demand for dissatisfaction
                  inverts the DU’s pursuit of closure (see <ref target="#figure05">Figures 5</ref>
                  and <ref target="#figure07">7</ref>).</note> In contrast to the hysteric’s classic
               partner, the obsessional, who matches her misdirections by stretching out the
               misrecognition of his own desire, the analyst presents the hysteric with an encounter
               wherein she can grasp the degree to which her knowledge (S<hi rend="subscript"
               >2</hi>) is oriented by S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>. Of priority here is the social
               relation of this encounter, founded on language, which is determinate of its effects.
               What the analysand says in this scene is, in an important sense, immaterial – her
               speech can be so much <hi rend="italic">blah blah blah</hi> and the analyst will
               encourage her to keep at it <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="275"/>; <ptr

            <p>If we accept that the DH, and more especially, discourse in the style of the
                  <q>bad</q> hysteric, points forward to new forms of knowledge (S<hi

               the most generative variants of this encounter will take place under the hysteric’s
               mandate to keep desire productive, specifically within a scene of interrogation in
               which the object-cause is understood to urge on her dissatisfaction
               (<term>a</term> → $), and her relations to master signifiers ($ → S<hi
                  rend="subscript">1</hi>) are recognized to found her speech. In other words, in
               the social relation of the analyst and the hysteric (DA → DH). </p>
            <p>In a nutshell, that is the diagnosis and the prescription that I propose here. But
               such a formula has important consequences for the future of our field, if that is to
               be as productive as it has been during the last two decades, and if a shift to a more
               unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing is not to come at the
               cost of a former uncompletability that made very interesting things come to pass.
               This is nowhere more true than in the social bond of our teaching. The graphs of the
               four discourses show us that the more productive pedagogy is not in the style of the
               master, which occludes the subject’s division and spits out as its remainder the
               object-cause of desire (S<hi rend="subscript">1 </hi>→ S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >2</hi> / <term>a</term>). Nor is it in the style of the University, which reifies
               the subject’s division by promising eventual mastery over desire (S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi> /S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> → <term>a</term>). Much like
               the neurotic’s just-so stories, that is just a form of temporizing. The more
               productive pedagogy is one that sustains desire by way of the
                  <term>hysterization</term> of the subject in response to something enigmatic, the
               operation of which is signaled in the field of speech <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >qua</foreign> social bond <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="33"/>. There, the place
               of the agent is not occupied by the digital object, its technical frameworks, or a
               conjectural entity supposed to <q>interact</q> with these things (a
               <term>user</term>) – but, more generally, by those aspects of the interrogation which
               take on the role of an enigmatic, generative element (<term>a</term>), to which we
               and our students respond, a little unnerved and uncertain. In the model of the DH we
               can grasp that the eccentricity of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">objet petit a</foreign>
               is foundational to the subject’s interrogation of the conditions of her knowledge. In
               the model of the DA, by way of its engagement with the DH, we can grasp a positive
               effect of this always-outsideness of the <foreign>a</foreign>: it can serve as the
               agent of the production of new and destabilized forms of knowledge – the DA as a
               disappearing act that leaves (behind) its mark <ptr target="#lacan2007" loc="23"

                  applying the four discourses to the humanities classroom <ptr target="#wegner2011"

                  scene to stable, well-measured disciplinarity, and consequently a turn away from
                  the messy uncompletability of <q>theory</q> and <q>cultural studies</q> – in which

                  is the dialectical productivity – and in that the scandalously theoretical
                  intervention – of Lacan’s formalizations of the discourses. I don’t think it a
                  stretch to propose that a retreat in the digital field, away from (imagined)
                  excesses of the first wave, might be gathered under a general trend in the
                  academy, marked by Wegner, of a turning from/repression of unsettled and
                  rigorously counterdisciplinary ways of thinking (and thinking about and performing
                  writing), in pursuit of regularized practices that insure greater disciplinary
                  unity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such an engagement of the DH and DA would be consistent with Joyce’s observation that
               our awkwardness may (still) be to our advantage. Dissatisfaction, befuddlement, and
               persistent misprision (the hysteric’s modes of relation) and a hesitation to be, or
               appear to be, confident of one’s reading of things (the analyst’s reflective
               response) need not be taken as evidence of lapsed knowledge; they may be
               acknowledgements of how the scene of knowledge is structured and carried through to
               its aims. If we profess from the position of supposed knowledge that our charges
               imagine for us, this will be most effective if we don’t take the supposition
               seriously, or not for long. We may foster supposition in situations in which this
               tends toward the building of foundations and the applications of lexicons (DM → DU):
               for example, instructing our students in the combinatorial play of the field’s master
               signifiers, which is a prerequisite for disciplinary competence. Such a tactic is in
               the short run disingenuous. But in the long run it may be productive of new
               signifiers if we, after a time, also renounce some of the authority invested in us,
               so as to desuppose the knowledge imagined to to be attached to that authority
               (DA → DH). We might call into question – even peremptorily, as is our due – master
               signifiers and the scaffolding built from them; perhaps even the notion of
               disciplinary competence itself. Shifting the scene of discourse from supposition to
               desupposition does not preclude speaking with conviction or making profitable use of
               the tools at our disposal (<q>consensus and canons, anthologies, archaeologies and
                  folksonomies, and the like</q>). <emph>But desupposing, not supposing, is the
                  impulse of a more innovative knowledge production</emph>
               <ptr target="#lacan1998b" loc="67"/>. It entails attending to, even signaling to our
               charges, our and their irreducibly relational engagements with the elements of the
               social bond. A lesson of the four discourses is that such an attending and a
               signaling must be initiated by more radical breaks with the master than readjusting
               our (or their) <foreign xml:lang="la">a prioris</foreign>. And that these breaks have
               to be perpetually renewed so that they don’t lapse into merely new variants of
               supposed knowledge.<note>In the audience during the first reading of this essay (see
                     <ref target="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</ref>) were a half-dozen or so
                  students in an undergraduate hypermedia course I was teaching at the time. Their
                  dismay in response to the parade of glyphs and graphs – operations of which were
                  implicit in the course’s method but which had not been shown as such until then –
                  and at being accounted as admirably bad hysterics, was evident. The first question
                  of the next class meeting was, <q>What do you mean when you say that you want to
                     turn us all into hysterics?</q> Which wasn’t, of course, what I had said. I
                  attempted to seize the edge of a teaching moment, replying that what I meant
                  should have been clear enough from what I had said, even though I hadn’t said it
                  in that way before. I proposed that a more productive way in which to frame the
                  question might be, <q>What do you want from us when you say, in our presence, that
                     we should be hysterized?</q> – which indicates that my desire should take the
                  hindmost role in the operation at hand, or that the interplay of their and my
                  desires should remain always unsettled. With all the benefits of hindsight, I see
                  now that this question, this <emph>what do you want from us?</emph>, is a version
                  of the demand I identified, what now seems ages ago, as the key problem of a
                  certain foundational moment of the digital field <ptr target="#harpold1994"
                  />.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We are committed, by institutional and professional conditions, to practices that
               tend toward the imperiousness of the DM and the recursive fiddling of the DU. But
               another of the lessons of the four discourses is that any one, two, or three
               discourses must operate in some relation to the others. Within a general economy of
               knowledge transmission, the primary stated goals of which are to <q>advance</q> the
               discipline and maximize the understanding of the scholar and the student, we could
               take such a lesson to heart and press the misdirections of imperiousness and fiddling
               to other, more relational ends. This means, along with the analyst, siding with the
               hysteric instead of the master, with the deliberate aim of getting her to grasp that
               what she wants (lacks) is the expression of the master’s desire (that which he lacks,
               but cannot have). And of making something come to pass thereby: new turns of the
               circuit of discourses and new master signifiers, in relation to which the hysteric
               and her master will be newly subjectified. (Doesn’t my description of the exemplary
               hysteria of Joyce’s early criticism, and Lennon’s accounting of Joyce’s withdrawal
               into spectrality as an act of provocation, imply that Joyce has, by his own admission
                  <ptr target="#joyce1995"/>; <ptr target="#joyce2001a"/>, played exactly this game
               of double-mindedness?)<note>Cf. <ptr target="#lennon2009"/>: <quote rend="inline"
                     source="#lennon2009">If we still want to consider Joyce's work a founding
                     moment in new media literary studies in the U.S., we will have to recognize the
                     radical untimeliness of, and at, that foundation: the extent to which the
                     negativity of Joyce's secession from this emergent field must be understood not
                     as the end of his influence in it, but in antinomian fashion, as its beginning
                     again.</quote> Doesn’t a shift in discursive structure from that of the DH to
                  that of the DA articulate this change of Joyce’s position within the mythology of
                  the field? If secession were understood to invite desupposition, then the family
                  romance built up around Joyce’s early hyperfiction, which has, for good or ill,
                  contoured the field from its inception <ptr target="#harpold2008" loc="6.01"/>,
                  might be (re)written (out) in a new and more productive form. </note>
            </p>
            <p>Playing at the tangle of those relations is neither a heroic nor a cynical response
               to the laws of desire; the hysteric and the analyst don’t aim to nullify the laws,
               only to recalibrate their effects, shaking loose the master’s confidence that he
               knows what he is talking about, and the bureaucrat’s determination that he will do
               even better – to, in other words, make something new come out of the laws of desire
               that confidence and determination might hide away ($ → S<hi rend="subscript"
                  >1</hi> / S<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> : <term>a</term> → $ / S<hi
                  rend="subscript">1</hi>). In a mode of rigorous relationality in which the
               irreducibility of the laws of desire is acknowledged, one can look ahead, along a
               path from the impostures of the DM and DU toward (and beyond) the impasses of the DH
               and DA. Such a change in our point of view would be endlessly unsettled and
               unsettling, and for that reason, of authentic consequence for our discipline.</p>

            <p>The graphs of the four discourses strip the social bond founded on language to its
               barest formalization. This enables us to grasp discourse as merely, but
               consequentially, an operation in which something new is made to happen within
               signification. That for Lacan this innovation takes place determinately, if not
               exclusively, in the concrete register of speech becomes clear if we associate the
               graphs of the four discourses with another famous Lacanian graph.</p>

                        as Lacan does not appear to refer thus to the divided subject (<ref

                           >2</hi>], which makes the substitution at work here somewhat clearer.) It
                        is possible to read an echo of the divided subject in this version of the
                        formula for metaphor – given that <quote rend="inline" source="#lacan2006"
                           >the definition of a signifier is that it represents the subject not for

                        primary function of the symbol here. As in the case of the variants of the
                        graphs of the four discourses (see note 19, above), Lacan during this period
                        revises the formulae to fit conditions of his teaching.</p>

               chain, and S the (general instance of the) signifier that is carried over into the
               product. The lower case <term>x</term> is the <cit>

               </cit> that completes the metaphor. <hi rend="superscript">I</hi>/s´´ figures the new
               signified that is induced by this operation (or something like a new signified; I
               will return to this in a moment).<note>
                  <ref target="#figure09">Figure 9</ref> shows a majuscule <q>I</q> in the position
                  of the numerator in <hi rend="superscript">I</hi>/<term>s</term>´´, as in <ptr
                     target="#lacan1966" loc="890"/>. In Fink’s translation, this character is shown
                  as an Arabic numeral <q>1</q>. Treating <q>I</q> as a Roman numeral would be in
                  keeping with uses of the character in other mathemes reproduced in <ptr
                     target="#lacan1966"/> (2006) – see for example, 55(42), 515 (428) and 819
                  (694); <q>I</q> = <q>1</q> in these cases appears to be a typographic convention
                  of Éditions du Seuil, the French publisher of Lacan’s canonical works. (See
                  however <ptr target="#lacan1998c" loc="176"/>, where an Arabic <q>1</q> is used as
                  the numerator in a variant of the extended formula.) In that reading, the
                  signified’s fractional form (<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<term>s</term>´´)
                  indicates its subordination to relations of the signifiers (S, S´<hi
                     rend="subscript">1</hi>, S´<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>; <ptr
                     target="#lacan2006" loc="459"/>). But one commentator <ptr target="#dor1998"/>
                  has interpreted the numerator (I) as a symbol for <q>l’Inconscient,</q> the
                  unconscious. This is a forced reading, but it is permissible in that the
                  subordination of the signified to the signifier is associated by Lacan with the
                  structure of primal repression: viz., the signified – which is no more than the
                  product of relations between signifiers – is driven below the bar of the
                  unconscious <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="595"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The full import of this diagram is evident only if we understand that Lacan conceives
               of the operation of metaphor in strictly formal terms; the relations between the
               signifiers involved (S – S´<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> – S´<hi rend="subscript"
                  >2</hi>) are differential and unmotivated with regard to their reference. Metaphor
               is merely, sufficiently <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#lacan2006">one word for another</quote>
                  <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="422"/>
               </cit>; an implied analogy between theme and phoros, or the new meaning intended by
               their association in this way – what, it seems safe to say, is usually meant when we
               speak of <q>metaphor</q> – is not of especial relevance to the efficacy of metaphor’s
               structure. Indeed, one might characterize as obdurate Lacan’s insistence that the
               substitution is in other respects without significance for the subject.<note> Cf.
                  Lacan 2006, 422–23; 756. <title rend="quotes">Metaphor of the Subject</title> was
                  written in response to a lecture by legal and rhetorical theorist Chaïm Perelman,
                  whose <title rend="italic">The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation</title>
                  Lacan claims to admire, but which he faults for reducing metaphor to a relation of
                  analogy <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="755"/>; <ptr target="#perelman1969"

            </p>
            <p>The reason for his unwavering formalism is this coda for the subject – that is, the
               subject <foreign xml:lang="la">qua</foreign> speaking subject, for whom the
               machinations of the signifying chain are of importance in and of themselves. (This
               subject is, we may remember, represented in the chain by a signifier for another
               signifier.) As shown in the expanded formula, metaphor is the substitution of a
               signifier (S) for one or more other signifiers (S´<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>, S´<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi>), such that their presence in the chain is elided and they
               are functionally driven below the bar of the signifier/signified doublet
                  (S / <term>s</term>; <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="594"/>). This produces a <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#lacan2006">new species of signification</quote>
                  <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="757"/>
               </cit> that preserves a phantom imprint of S´<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> and S´<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi> (perhaps this is figured in the double priming of s, which
               carries some residue of the elided signifiers?), and which is something new in the
               field of speech that did not exist before: a surplus (→ S<hi rend="superscript"
                  >I</hi>/<term>s</term>´´) derived from the mere associations of signifiers on the
               left side of the formula. Lacan refers to the element below the bar on the right side
               as a <q>signified,</q> but we may interpret it as something more evocative and
               uncompleted that accounts for metaphor’s role in Lacan’s thought during this period.
               First, <hi rend="superscript">I</hi>/<term>s</term>´´ is not, as Ed Pluth has
               observed, a <q>signified</q> in the strictly Saussurean sense – a concept associated
               with the acoustic image of the signifier – but something more like a <q>signified
                  effect</q> [<foreign>effet de signifié</foreign>] or <q>resonance</q> of
               signification generated by interactions of signifiers, which functions as if it were
               a signified <ptr target="#pluth2007"/>. <note>Fink describes this passage of the
                  signifier into the place of the signifier as a <q>titillating</q> release of some
                  of the jouissance stored in the matter of language <ptr target="#fink1991"
                     loc="20"/>.</note> This is how Lacan understands the production of meaning in
               the signifying chain, and primordially in the <q>paternal metaphor</q> that founds
                  Oedipus.<note>See note 8, above; <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="464ff"/>; and <ptr
                     target="#dor1998" loc="ch. 13"/>.</note> Second, because Lacan correlates this
               driving of a signifier below the bar with secondary repression (<foreign
                  xml:lang="de">Verdrängung</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="fr">refoulement</foreign>:
                  <ptr target="#freud1915"/>), metaphor’s production of a <q>new species of
                  signification</q> is homologous with repression’s production of new signified
               effects from the exclusion of signifiers from consciousness <ptr target="#lacan1998a"
                  loc="218"/>. At issue in both metaphor and repression as Lacan understands these
               operations is the brute productivity of signifying substitution, which is realized
               without regard to the positive content of the elements involved.<note> For general
                  treatments of Lacan’s concepts of metaphor and metonymy – which, after Jakobson,
                  Lacan takes to be the second major axis of meaning production in the signifying
                  chain – see <ptr target="#dor1998"/>, <ptr target="#fink1991"/>, <ptr
                     target="#pluth2007"/>, and <ptr target="#vanhaute2003"/>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Grasping metaphor thus as a purely formal operation of substitution and production,
               concretely realized in a specific scene of speech, we can see metaphor’s relevance to
               Lacanian discourse theory in two respects. </p>
            <p>
               <emph>First, metaphor constitutes a primary axis of the productivity of signification
                  within the social bond of language.</emph> There, relations between signifiers are
               determinate; the sociality of the bond obtains wholly in signifying operations. In
               the expanded formula of metaphor, the production of new signification emerges from
               the impertinence of the substitution, insofar as it leaves something behind.<note> In
                     <title rend="quotes">Metaphor of the Subject,</title> Lacan cites as an example
                  of the <soCalled>radical nature of metaphor</soCalled> the Rat-Man’s famous temper
                  tantrum in which he reduces his father to a series of signifiers for inanimate
                  objects – <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#freud1909">You lamp! You towel! You
                        plate!</quote>
                     <ptr target="#freud1909"/>
                  </cit>; <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="757"/>. The terms of the series qualify as
                  metaphor, Lacan observes, in that their semantic impertinences in and of
                  themselves effect a communication different from the nonsense they express
                  directly. This dimension of insult [<foreign xml:lang="fr">injure</foreign>], he
                  suggests, is the generative kernel of linguistic innovation: <cit>
                     <quote rend="inline" source="#lacan2006">
                        <q>The cat goes bow-wow, the dog goes meow, meow.</q> This is how the child
                        spells out the powers of discourse and inaugurates thought</quote>
                     <ptr target="#lacan2006" loc="757"/>
                  </cit>.</note> In the graphs of the four discourses, this impertinent product is
               returned to the circuit of the graph as a term of their subsequent turns: the truth,
               the agent, the other. This is the trace within the social bond of discourse’s
               perpetually-renewing innovation.</p>
            <p>
               <emph>Second, the graphs of the four discourses are not a <hi rend="underlined"
                     >metaphor</hi> of the social bond in the usual sense of the term
                     <q>metaphor.</q>
               </emph> For Lacan, the graphs express structures of the bond directly and concretely;
               they perform social relations of language. (They write out the social bond.) Putting
               the graphs to work – putting them through the turns I have described in this essay –
               demonstrates the instability and uncompletability of the bond, expressly in that
               putting them to work will generate new signifying effects. (Which will lead to
               further turns of the graphs, and so on.) </p>
            <p>Correlatively, mapping specific scenes of discourse to the graphs, if performed
               scrupulously, is not to make a metaphor of the graphs (i.e., a metaphor for the
               scenes of discourse), but to take them in hand (the scenes and the graphs) and to
               make something new come out of them that was not in evidence before.<note>See note
                  38, above.</note> To write this more precisely: the signifying substitution of
               each of the graphs for specific turnings of practice in and of itself (S / S´<hi
                  rend="subscript">1</hi> • S´<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> / x) should make something
               new (→ S (<hi rend="superscript">I</hi>/<term>s</term>´´)). The character of the
               product of each substitution ($, <term>a</term>, S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> or S<hi
                  rend="subscript">2</hi>) alone determines the efficacy of such a tactic.</p>
            <p>A further lesson of the discourses: to aim, merely but consequentially, at producing
               a response from the other is both the narrowest and most rigorous (DA:
                  <term>a</term> → $ / S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi>), and the most extravagant and
               indecent (DH: $ → S<hi rend="subscript">1</hi> / S<hi rend="subscript">2 </hi>), of
               methodological ambitions.</p>
