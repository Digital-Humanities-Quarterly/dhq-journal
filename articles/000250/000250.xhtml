                  <p>"The Ancient World in 19th-Century Fiction" is a lightly
                     revised version of a lecture delivered at the first meeting
                     of the Digital Classicists Association. The intent of the
                     lecture, in accordance with the invitation to deliver it,
                     was to introduce literary "macroanalysis" in the context of
                     the ancient world and offer some exploration of how the
                     ancient world is represented in the nineteenth-century literary
                     imagination.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p1">My primary objective in this paper is to introduce some methods
                  that fall under the umbrella of what I call
                  "macroanalysis." Despite my title, I’m not going to be
                  drawing any grand conclusions about the ancient world. My hope
                  is that by sharing these approaches I will stimulate some
                  thought and give classicists a comfortable and familiar footing
                  onto which I can introduce some foreign methodologies

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2"> A couple of years ago, a small group of us in the Stanford
                  Literary Lab became interested in literary geography, and we
                  began work on a research project to map the places that appear
                  in a corpus of 3500 19<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century
                  novels.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e178">[1]</a>
                  Obviously this work cannot be done by hand, or, more accurately,
                  it cannot be done quickly and easily by hand. It turns out that
                  this is not a simple problem to solve computationally either. We
                  faced two primary problems. 
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">First was the problem of <em class="emph">identification</em>. How could
                  we use computers to accurately identify place-names in novels?
                  The obvious approach of using gazetteers proved problematic. In
                  one gazetteer we consulted, <cite class="title italic">Providence</cite> was a place and so was <cite class="title italic">Hope</cite>: These may be places, yes, but
                  they are also something else. Simply running a search for all
                  places in the gazetteer that also appeared in the fiction would
                  have yielded far too many false positives.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">Second was the problem of <cite class="title italic">ambiguity</cite>;
                  place names are ambiguous. <cite class="title italic">Charlotte</cite>, for example, is used only as a first
                  name in our corpus and never as a city. <cite class="title italic">Florence</cite> is almost always a character but
                  occasionally a city in Italy. <cite class="title italic">Charlton</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Denver</cite>,
                  <cite class="title itallic">Albany</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Hastings</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Belmont</cite>,
                  <cite class="title italic">Gresham</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Wilmington</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Woodstock</cite> are all in our corpus, and all more
                  commonly used as last names than as cities. A second problem of
                  ambiguity is that place names are often reused in different
                  locations: <cite class="title italic">Richmond</cite> is both a town
                  in southwest London and a city in Virginia. <cite class="title italic">Dartmouth</cite> is a city in England, the U.S., Canada,
                  and Australia. <cite class="title italic">Georgia</cite> is both a
                  U.S. state and a country in Eastern Europe.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">To tackle the first problem of identification, we scrapped the
                  gazetteer in favor of Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER is a
                  Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that identifies places using a trained statistical
                  model that is sensitive to semantic and syntactic information in
                  the text. NER is not perfect; it sometimes thinks that Florence
                  the character is Florence the city, but we devised a way of
                  muting that problem of place ambiguity using a technique called
                  topic modeling.

               <div class="ptext" id="p6">Topic modeling is a complex process that cannot be explained in
                  detail here. I have written a useful explanation on my

                  For now, you can think of books like plates that you fill up at
                  a buffet full of topics, and in this case the topics are
                  places. Imagine that Jane Austen and Herman Melville wandered
                  into an imaginary buffet, but instead of choosing to fill their
                  plates with peas and fish they chose the settings for their
                  novels: so, Melville might choose a helping of New
                  England and a bit of South Pacific, Austen a ladle of London and
                  a smidgen of the English Midlands. The topic modeling process
                  has a way of identifying and measuring these textual features as
                  they exist within their individual plates and within the
                  "buffet" as a whole.

                  identify and disambiguate the place names in the corpus. This
                  topic modeling method works because when a writer sets a book in
                  a particular place that writer tends to mention other places
                  that are geographically related. An author writing about
                  Ireland, for example, might mention Dublin, Galway, and Belfast.
                  Another author writing about Belfast, Maine, is not likely to
                  also mention Dublin and Galway and so the machine learns that
                  Belfast, Ireland is different from Belfast, Maine.

               <div class="ptext" id="p11">These clusters show that topic modeling can be used as an
                  effective way to identify collocated place names and thereby aid
                  in place-name disambiguation by giving us a general sense of the
                  regions being talked about in the corpus. I found during this
                  research that my conception of place needed to be a bit less
                  geographic in nature and a bit less specific than what we had
                  first imagined. That is to say, a bit less about Giza and more
                  about Egypt, less about Crete and more about Greece. In
                  retrospect this all seems very appropriate. In writing <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite> James Joyce was not, after
                  all, trying to write an atlas of Dublin. Joyce wanted to capture
                  the essence of the city.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e338">[5]</a>
                  And so, as it happens, the places this method identified did not
                  necessarily have to be places you could find on a map: heaven
                  and hell were both represented in the corpus, as were Mars,
                  Venus and Earth. More important than these outliers, the
                  technique provided a tractable means of disambiguating different
                  places with the same names: <cite class="title italic">Georgia</cite>, for example, could appear inside a topic about
                  the American South, as well as in a topic of countries in
                  Eastern Europe (see figures 7 and 8).

                  (colored in red) and +1 is positive sentiment that is colored
                  green; 0 is neutral and yellow. The scoring here is based in

                  opinion/sentiment words for English collected by Bing Liu of the

                  history of tensions between the landed and tenant classes. What
                  was interesting about these correlations was that they varied
                  dramatically depending on author nationality. So, for example,
                  in novels written by Irish authors, the tenant landlord theme
                  was correlated with representations of Ireland. When only
                  English authors were examined, the statistical correlation
                  dropped to a level indicating no correlation whatsoever. What
                  this suggests, then, is that it is the Irish authors and not the
                  English authors who are fixating on the tenant landlord
                  situation within a specifically Irish context. Put into plain
                  terms: English authors, when talking about Ireland, tend to

                  <em class="emph">drinking</em> were highly correlated. When I
                  examined the data for Irish authors alone, however, I discovered
                  that there was not such a high correlation. The Irish wrote
                  about Ireland and the Irish wrote about drinking, but the two
                  things were not generally written about simultaneously. Seeing
                  this, I naturally expected to find that it was the English
                  authors who were tending to write about the two things
                  simultaneously. I was wrong. How then could
                  <em class="emph">drinking</em> have been correlated with
                  <em class="emph">Ireland</em> at the level of the whole corpus? It
                  turns out we have the temperate Puritans to blame. It is the
                  American authors who most closely associate <em class="emph">Ireland</em>
                  with <em class="emph">drinking</em>. Indeed, in American books where
                  <em class="emph">drinking</em> is a dominant theme,
                  <em class="emph">Ireland</em> is the place most frequently mentioned.
                  Also closely associated is the theme of <em class="emph">Sin and
                     Repentance</em>! So, at least in terms of this corpus, it
                  would seem that a good deal of the blame for the stereotype of
                  the hard drinking Irish sits squarely on American shoulders.

                  correlations to deeper interpretations about the specific books
                  in the corpus or the specific writers, and this movement between
                  scales is precisely what I am advocating in my book, <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite>. Instead of rehearsing
                  those arguments here, I want to conclude with an observation of
                  a more general nature. First a warning about the very sort of
                  research I am engaged in: we need to keep in mind that this type
                  of macroanalysis only reveals the larger, general tendencies in
                  the corpus. The most we can say at this scale is that certain
                  things tend to occur more often, or less often, than others;
                  what we capture here are the general tendencies within the
                  corpus. Having said that, I would also note that it is equally
                  problematic to speak only of particulars. In other words, it is
                  just as dangerous to move from distant readings to specific
                  conclusions as it to move from close reading to general theories
                  of literary history. Just as we would not expect an economist to
                  generate a sound theory about the economy based on the behavior
                  of few workers in his or her neighborhood, I don’t think we can
                  generate sound theories of literary history by reading only a
                  few books.

                  we took two approaches to this problem. First, we removed
                  from our consideration all places whose ambiguity we
                  identified as especially pernicious. Second, we ranked the
                  places that the tagger had identified from most to least
                  frequent. We skimmed off the top 1000 places, which
                  accounted for more than 85% of all mentions of all places
                  that the NER tool had detected. We then divided these into
                  four groups of 250 places and each of us, that is myself,
                  Ben Allen, Cameron Blevins, Ryan Heuser, identified and read
                  a random sample of 25 sentences in which each place occurred
                  (we wrote a simple query script for this). If a given place
                  occurred more than 12 times as a last name or other noun, or
                  if the word changed the place to which it referred more than
                  12 times, we marked down the place in a blacklist. We were
                  left with about 650 places we could trust.
