            <p>Poetic writing for programmable and network media seems to have been captivated by
               the affordances of new media and questions of whether or not and if so,
                  <emph>how</emph> certain novel, media-constituted properties and methods of
               literary objects require us to reassess and reconfigure the literary itself. What if
               we shift our attention decidedly to practices, processes, procedures — towards
                  <emph>ways of writing</emph> and <emph>ways of reading</emph> rather than dwelling
               on either textual artifacts themselves (even time-based literary objects) or the
               concepts underpinning objects-as-artifact? What else can we do, given that we must
               now write on, for, and with the net which is itself no object but a seething mass of
               manifold processes?</p>
            <p>Part one of the essay presents a brief analysis of recent experiments in <q>writing to be found</q> with Google, making some
               claim that such writing may be exemplary, that its aesthetic and conceptual
               engagements are distinct, and that there is something at stake here for <soCalled>the
                  literary</soCalled> or rather for certain practices of literary art. After very
               brief discussion in part two of some broader implications of writing with the Google
               corpus and its tools, part three addresses more examples of writing to be found, and
               introduces a collaboration with Daniel Howe, <title rend="italic">The Readers
                  Project</title>, many processes of which engage with <q>writing to be found</q>
               <soCalled>in</soCalled> Google and making use of its tools.</p>

            <p>In order to begin to write this essay, I set out to make some appropriate use of what
               I have come to think of as <q>writing to be
                  found</q>. Originally I had thought that this would be by way of simply
               beginning to write, embarking on my usual process of writing while checking,
               periodically, to see whether the sequences of words that I was in the midst of
               composing were still <q>found</q> in the corpus and
               then at what point they became <q>not yet
                  found</q>.<note>Throughout this essay I refer to the Google
                     <soCalled>corpus</soCalled>, implicitly treating the inscribed text that is
                  addressed by the Google indexing engines as if it were a body of material similar
                  to or commensurate with other textual corpora such as might be compiled into a
                  particular author’s corpus or the corpora put together and studied by corpus
                  linguists such as the Brown Corpus, the Corpus of Contemporary American English,
                  the British National Corpus, the American National Corpus, etc.</note> How many
               words would I have to add, composing my syntagmatic sequences, before they were not
               found in the corpus of language to which the Google search engine gives me access,
               before they were, perhaps, original sequences? How difficult would I find it to
               produce unfound sequences? Would I be able to continue to write as I usually write
               once I was aware that, at some perhaps unanticipated moment, the words I write are
               suddenly penetrating and constituting the domain of sequences that are not yet found
               in our largest, most accessible corpus of written English?</p>
            <p>There have proven to be many questions raised by any and all of my attempts to engage
               with these processes and their contexts. Moreover, I remain convinced that many of
               these processes may be productive of significance and affect, to an extent that will
               allow aesthetic, not only critical, practices some purchase. </p>
            <p> This way of working with language is enabled by unprecedented, convenient and
               articulable access to the network, a world of language, a media-constituted diegesis,
               that is still <soCalled>powered</soCalled> – as the contemporary technologically
               inflected usage would have it – by text, by encoded representations of inscription,
               in what we usually call writing. The net is still largely composed from all the
               privileged instantiations of our languages’ singular materialities that we, as
               irrepressible language-makers, have so far written to be found. </p>
            <p>By which I mean to make it clearer, that when I write with these processes, I’m both
               writing, and writing with Google.<note>Whenever I use the word
                     <soCalled>with</soCalled> in this context, my intention is to highlight the
                  underlying, now chiefly archaic, sense of <soCalled>against</soCalled> that was
                  once more active in the Anglo-Saxon preposition, although we do still both work
                  and fight <emph>with</emph> others. This negative apotropaic inclination of
                     <soCalled>with</soCalled> is preserved by contemporary English in words like
                     <soCalled>withhold</soCalled>, <soCalled>withdraw</soCalled>,
                     <soCalled>withstand</soCalled>.</note> Is Google my collaborator? Does Google
               become the space within which I write? I want to make it clear that I don’t consider
               myself necessarily to be writing in the space of the network nor collaborating
               (directly) with other artists. At this point, I also want to make it clear that I do
               not consider myself to be using Google, not, at least, in the usual way that Google
               is used for gathering instances of language by search. I’m not refashioning myself as
               a Flarfist.<note>
                  <term>Flarf</term>, the coinage attributed to Gary Sullivan, is a name for a
                  practice of poetic writing. There exists a <soCalled>Flarf(ist)
                     Collective</soCalled> of writers, mostly poets, who have exchanged and
                  published work under its aegis. (See the Flarf feature in the excellent online
                     <ref target="http://jacketmagazine.com/30/index.shtml">
                     <title>Jacket Magazine</title>, Jacket 30, July 2006</ref>) Wikipedia describes
                  its aesthetic as <quote rend="inline"
                     source="http://jacketmagazine.com/30/index.shtml">dedicated to the
                     exploration of <soCalled>the inappropriate</soCalled>
                  </quote> (as of: Feb 16, 2011) and this seems right to me. It’s a significant
                  poetic movement of the late 20th, early 21st century for which, personally and
                  critically, I have a high regard. However, Flarf is now also closely associated
                  with methods of composition that make extensive use of internet searches engines
                  since they are, clearly, well-adapted for gathering large amounts of
                     <soCalled>inappropriate</soCalled> linguistic material. The association is
                  unfortunate since there are many, many other ways to explore the inappropriate and
                  gather relevant exempla. The identification of Flarf with Google-mining is,
                  itself, inappropriate Flarf. At this point in my argument, my aim is simply to
                  contrast the Flarfist use of Google-as-grab-bag versus a sustained aesthetic
                  engagement with the cultural vectors that Google both offers and denies.
                  Engagement at the level of computation may be a key to making and maintaining this
                  distinction.</note> I’m not casting a faux-puerile, post-everything, absurdist net
               over the net using the net, gathering glittering detritus, spectacular disjuncture,
               in endless anti-syntactic listlings. I’m not composing searches in order to find the
               language for what I’m making. I’ve got my language already, one way or another. I
               just want to know whether it’s found or it isn’t. The Flarf-poetic approach is –
               although this is only a small part of Flarf – a détournement of the affordances that
               Google offers us as a portal to text on the network. My <q>writing to be found</q>, on the other hand, is in itself a way of
               writing that is shaped by the way that Google is shaped, by the way in which Google
               curves the space of the network. And Google does also, in a sense, write with me:
               constraining, directing, guiding, and, especially, punctuating my writing. </p>
            <p> It occurs to me, broadening the scope of these experiments’ relevance, that Poetic
               writing for programmable and network media seems to have been captivated by the
               affordances of new media and questions of whether or not and if so, how certain
               novel, advanced, media-constituted properties and methods of literary objects require
               us to reassess and reconfigure the literary itself. What if we shift our attention
               decidedly to practices, processes, procedures – towards ways of writing and ways of
               reading rather than dwelling on either textual artifacts themselves (even when
               considered as time-based literary objects) or the concepts underpinning such objects
               as artifacts? What else can we do, given that we must now write on, for, and with the
               net which is itself no object but a seething mass of manifold processes? Google
               itself signals the significance of process since Google both is and is not the net.
               Google is not the inscription that forms the matter of the net. Google is merely
               (almost) everyprocess (not every<hi rend="italic">thing</hi>) that makes it possible
               for us to find and touch and consume what was always already there in front of us. </p>
            <p>When you collaborate you are more or less obliged to get to know your collaborator.
               Getting to know Google better, in a practical sense, as a collaborator, is one of the
               most interesting results to emerge from even the relatively simple and preliminary
               processes that have been set in train. </p>
            <p> This is probably the moment to introduce some details of the procedures with which I
               am writing. First, a classical epithet via Montaigne in John Florio’s translation, <cit>
                  <quote rend="inline" source="#montaigne1910">The Philosopher Chrisippus was wont
                     to foist-in amongst his bookes, not only whole sentences and other long-long
                     discourses, but whole bookes of other Authors, as in one, he brought Euripides
                     his Medea. And Apollodorus was wont to say of him, that if one should draw from
                     out his bookes what he had stoln from others, his paper would remaine blanke.
                     Whereas Epicurus cleane contrarie to him in three hundred volumes he left
                     behind him, had not made use of one allegation.</quote>
                  <ptr target="#montaigne1910"/>
               </cit>
            </p>
            <p>Process: Write into the Google search field with text delimited by quote marks until
               the sequence of words is not found. Record this sequence. Delete words from the
               beginning of the sequence until the sequence is found. Then add more words to the end
               of the sequence until it is not found. Repeat. Each line of the resultant text
               (although not necessarily the last line) will comprise a sequence of words that is
                  <q>not yet found</q>. At the time of composition
               these lineated sequences of words had not yet been indexed by Google and were thus,
               in a certain (formal) sense, original:</p>

            <p>I was induced to explore this way of writing by the remarks of a philosopher and
               cognitive scientist, Ron Chrisley, at a workshop on Neuroesthetics.<note>European
                  Science Foundation (ESF) workshop: <title rend="italic">Neuroesthetics: When Art
                     and the Brain Collide</title>, Sept 24-25, 2009, IULM, Milan, Italy. <ref

               </note> In discussing robotic perception, he was making some use of the concept of
               the <soCalled>edge of chaos</soCalled>. I understood this phrase
               loosely as referring to a threshold of information processing, the point at which an
               artificial cognizer can no longer assimilate – typically by compression or by rule
               formulation – the information that comprises its inputs. Somehow, to me, this
               suggested or rhymed with that moment in our now common encounters with search engines
               when what we are looking for is not yet found, when it could still be anything,
               because, as yet, it is nothing to the corpus. It isn’t there. It isn’t in any way
               predictable. It’s still maximal, raw information in Shannon-Weaver’s sense – the edge
               of chaos that we are about to make, literally, readable.</p>
            <p>Since I have some practical experience with Markov models for text generation, I also
               pretend to recognize this as a closely related phenomenon.<note>Markov models,
                  processes, chains – named for the Russian mathematician, Andrey Markov (1856-1922)
                  – provide formal descriptions for systems with a finite number of elements in
                  successive states. Using such a model, we only have to know the relative frequency
                  of the elements in a system in order to be able to generate further sequences of
                  these elements, probabilistically, that will be, as it were, characteristic of the
                  system. These models can be applied to language, taking any distinct linguistic
                  element – letter, phoneme, syllable, word, phrase, etc. – as the units being
                  considered. A sequence of n elements considered as a unit is known as an ngram or
                  n-gram. A three-word phrase may be treated as an n-gram and if we search for such
                  a phrase, double-quoted, in Google, we get a <soCalled>count</soCalled> that can
                  be used as a relative frequency for that phrase within the domain of the
                  Google-indexed internet <soCalled>corpus</soCalled> of linguistic tokens.
                  Refinements of such purely statistical language models are now proven to be
                  remarkably powerful, and underlie, for example, much automated translation. The
                  existence of the Internet-as-corpus and its Google search boxes puts such
                  linguistic modeling in the hands of everyone. Google and its rival service
                  providers are aware of non-venal uses for this data. Recently there was a short,
                  rather dismissive piece on the Google labs: <ref
                     target="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/">Books Ngram Viewer</ref> in the
                     <title>London Review of Books</title>
                  <ptr target="#diski2011"/>. A <title>Science</title> article is referred to that
                  describes work underlying the Ngram viewer in more detail <ptr
                     target="#michel2011"/>. Another contextually relevant discussion of Markov
                  chains can be found in Noah Wardrip-Fruin, <title rend="italic">Expressive
                     Processing: Digital Fictions, Computer Games, and Software Studies</title>
                  (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2009) 203-05 <ptr target="#wardrip2009" loc="203–5"
                  />.</note> If we think of Google as giving us access to a vast Markov model, I
               believe I am right in saying that as I build up my sequences of words delimited by
               quotes and test them after adding each word, I am testing the model’s ability to be
               able to find me an n-gram where n is equal to the number of words in my sequence.
               Non-zero results mean that there are probabilities to play with. Not only is it the
               case that other people before me have produced instances of this sequence of words,
               but an n-gram model, constructed from the Google corpus, would also have some chance
               of generating my search phrase. However, once I’ve reached an unfound sequence, the
               model breaks down. I’m at the edge, and I may also, perhaps, be about to extend, by
               some minuscule amount, the readable, the unchaotic territory of the textual, perhaps
               even that of the literary. I’m about to write, and to add my own writing to the
               corpus.</p>
            <p>And then suddenly it gets interesting. I was just writing, and now I’m writing with
               Google and beginning to wonder what that means. Google is where we search for
               language and for forms of all kind that are made from language, including aesthetic
               forms. It’s become our default portal to the default corpus. It is not yet all
               writing but we feel that we are close to the historical moment when the extraordinary
               possibility – Ted Nelson’s Docuverse – has become an actuality for, at least, a major
               portion of the existing textual corpus of writing in English. Already, I wager, we
               type our searches into Google expecting that it will find anything and everything
               that we might expect to be found in the world of letters, of conventionally inscribed
               textuality. What do I mean by that? I mean at least all of those sequences of words
               that have been written by authors who are known to us. All of the writing that is
               known, all of the writing that will have been found. And much besides.</p>

            <p>The two singularly lineated sentences above are made with a slightly different
               process, a retreat from the not yet found sequence – at the time this was, for
               example, <q>The purpose of this writing is to address
                  an</q> – to the longest sequence that was still found in the accessible Google
               corpus. Although the sentences are original to me they are expressed in phrases that
               can be shown to be plagiarized from the corpus. They have all already been
               written.</p>
            <p>For we do seem to be addressing something like the palpable, objective edge of
               authorial originality. <q>The purpose of this writing
                  is to address</q> was always unoriginal before I set out. When I wrote, <q>The purpose of this writing is to address an</q>,
               the indefinite article made me an author.</p>
            <p>Those of us who are educators will be aware of the way that Google and other search
               engines are used as simple detectors of student plagiarism. Type the suspected
               sentence into Google and it is very likely to find the source from which it may have
               been copied. Writing to be found with Google reveals, however, the singular, perhaps
               unprecedented nature of its, Google’s, co-authorial authority. By definition Google
               changes shape. As we’ve said before, it’s a process. By providing access Google seems
               to <emph>be</emph> the corpus of reference while remaining a protean manifold of
               processes that continually reconfigure themselves while crawling over
                  <emph>our</emph> networked body of language (the actual corpus), even unto the
               edge of chaos, finding new readable things and indexing them relentlessly and
               swiftly, remarkably swiftly. Less than three hours after I’d posted my not-yet-found
               texts to the netpoetics blog, they were suddenly found.<note>See <ref

               </note> Thus, taking the same text and putting <emph>it</emph> through the same
               procedure produced an entirely different text and a new measure (or textual
               visualization) of my originality.</p>

               although the second iteration of the process reduces the number of unfound sequences
               in this initial extract; for the entire supply text, the second iteration actually
               increased the total number of unfound sequences from 17 to 21.)</p>
            <p>This potential for iteration was not only expected but it was something with which I
               desired to experiment, using it to produce a series of texts, evolving over time in
               relation to the findableness of their constituent sequences of words.</p>
            <p>But imagine my surprise when I tried the procedure again and found it regenerating
               the earlier version. My new, original writing was no longer found. I could see it
               there in the corpus (at netpoetics) but as far as Google, the <q>index of reference</q>, was concerned it was, apparently, no
               longer there. I could not yet have produced it. Uncanny. But easily explained by my
               arbitrary access, at the first instance of checking, to Google servers that had
               already published the indexing of their busy spiders. Later, I had been less lucky:
               my client must have connected to other servers (I have no obvious control over this)
               onto which the new indexes had not yet propagated. Google had temporally denied my
               originality, my authority. It had changed the shape of my authorial persona. I wasn’t
               writing with it. It was writing with me, against me, withholding what I thought I had
               inscribed.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Two</head>
            <p>Why hadn’t I considered this before? Why don’t we think of it now, and then more
               often? As a culture, we are in the seemingly ineluctable process of handing over the
               digitization and indexing of our entire surviving published textual legacy to Google,
               in order for them to include that part of it which they have not already indexed. I,
               we, have no idea how they are going to index our literature or how their indexing of
               it might change over time. On the other hand there is considerable evidence of
               uncertainty and inconsistency.<note>Apart from specifics discussed here, I will cite
                  two sensational socio-political examples. Firstly, there is Google’s dubiously or
                     <emph>un</emph>principled accommodation of Chinese state censorship as a
                  Chinese language news provider in February 2004, as an investor in the Chinese
                  search site Baidu, by voluntarily blocking politically sensitive searches in
                  January 2006, and its subsequent <emph>purportedly</emph> principled retreat from
                  the Chinese search <soCalled>market</soCalled> in 2010. See <ptr
                     target="#battelle2006"/>; <ptr target="#watts2010"/>; <ptr
                     target="#bosker2010b"/>. </note>
            </p>
            <p>I should of course mention in passing that there are already and will likely remain
               some checks and balances to Google. So far, the other internet search engines have
               access to most of the same corpus, and they do not index this corpus in the same way.<note>
                  <p>For one simple example, Microsoft’s <title>Bing</title> treats line endings
                     differently. Line endings (carriage returns, etc.) don’t break sequences as
                     they do for Google. For neither engine however, is this a recognition of
                     differences or distinctions that might be significant for poetics. The fact
                     that we can be fairly certain that differential treatment of line endings is
                     technical <emph>in the service of commerce</emph> rather than poetic or, for
                     example, rhetorical, speaks volumes concerning Google as an engine of mis- or
                     undirected culture formation. Its undoubtedly <q>powerful</q> forces are self-trammeled by concerns to which Google is
                     strategically blind and to which we, as producers of culture with other
                     motivations, seem already to have become blind. If we fail to start noticing
                     these motivated distinctions now, it will soon be too late since they will
                     cease to exist. In the ontology of software if a object is not implemented, it
                     cannot have instances.</p>
                  <p>A further note on line endings: It is interesting to remark that although line
                     endings break word (or token) sequences in Google’s indexing of web pages –
                     chiefly html or html-derived content – token sequences are <emph>not</emph>
                     broken by corresponding punctuation or tagging when Google indexes the
                     predominantly pdf-derived content of Google Books. This is simply one example
                     of many conditions demonstrating that when you search these two domains, you
                     search them differently with no explicit signal of this fact. The underlying
                     software is taking away any care that you might have had for the way in which
                     you are searching. If your relationship to the corpus is transactional and you
                     understand the nature of the underlying contract, this is fine. My point is
                     that now, when you search Google, you increasingly treat it as if you are
                     searching all of inscribed culture. Once again, this is fine, if you realize
                     what you are doing – research that is abbreviated, shorthand, provisional, or
                     pragmatic for example – and yet after having qualified your understanding of
                     the scope of the Google corpus, do you also take responsibility for your
                     failure to know any details of the procedures by which it undertakes the search
                     on your behalf, <emph>how</emph> that search addresses the corpus, the manner
                     in which the results are delivered, and so on?</p>
               </note> Without huge investment we could all write and set up our very own search
               engines. Nonetheless it is remarkable the degree to which Google has become, as I
               say, initially the search engine of reference and now in some sense the reference of
               reference. This is so obvious to us that it has become banal to point out that
               whatever Google is, it may be the most remarkable and significant agency for cultural
               change on the planet.</p>
            <p>Of course, the scholars amongst us (and within us) will defer. We cannot rely on
               anything that the folksonomic internet provides, although relying, admittedly
                  <soCalled>by default</soCalled>, is exactly what all of us having access actually
               do. Neither can we defer from Google in the same way that we defer from Wikipedia, on
               the basis of what it <soCalled>contains</soCalled>. Google is not Wikipedia and, in a
               sense, it does not contain anything. Practically and in other critical senses, it
               stands between us and Wikipedia while also providing – in so far as it indexes all
               the writing that can be found – much of the material from which Wikipedia is built.
               Wikipedia is something that arose contemporaneously with the Googlization of
               everything but is more a symptom than a cause. Whatever Google is, is a problem that
               remains to be addressed, and written with.</p>
            <p>Here is one brief working statement of what Google is becoming or what it may already
               be: <emph>Google is the preferred or default agency to which our existing
                  institutions of cultural production and critique delegate the symbolic processing
                  of our inscribed material culture in exchange for unprecedented access to the
                  results of that symbolic processing.</emph> I am, of course, bracketing all the
               important questions concerning what exactly is handed over to Google for processing,
               how is this done, who owns it, and where it is – all of which are irreversibly
               complicated by the fact that any answers will be radically different
                  <soCalled>before</soCalled> and <soCalled>after</soCalled> these processes that
               were already in train long <soCalled>before</soCalled> any actual exchanges – such as
               agreements to digitize libraries – were made explicit, let alone regulated in any
               publicly agreed and articulated manner.</p>
            <p>Let’s say it again in more polemical terms. We hand over our culture to Google in
               exchange for unprecedented and free access to that culture. We do this all but
               unconscious of the fact that it will be Google that defines what
                  <soCalled>unprecedented</soCalled> and <soCalled>free</soCalled> ultimately
                  imply.<note>And ultimately or more accurately: whoever or whatever
                     <emph>owns</emph> Google.</note> As yet, we hardly seem to acknowledge the fact
               that this agreement means that it is Google that reflects our culture back to us.
               They design the mirror, the device, the dispositive, as the French would put it. They
               offer a promise of <soCalled>free</soCalled> access in many senses of that word
               including zero cost to the end-using inquirer and close to zero cost to the
               institutions that supply the inscribed material culture that Google swallows and
               digests. But Google does not (some might here add <said>any longer</said>) conceal
               the fact that this free access does come at a cost, another type of cost, one that is
               also a culture-(in)forming cost: Google will process all (or nearly all) this data in
               order to sell a <soCalled>highly-cultivated</soCalled> positioning of advertisements.
               The deal can’t go ahead without this underlying engine of commerce and
               commercialization. In a sense, Google is the predominant global corporation a major
               proportion of whose capital is literally cultural capital. Now, what was already a
               huge backing investment is being freely augmented by the traditional investors in
               this market of culture, the universities in particular. Bizarrely, these
               institutional investors are not asking for shares in the business, or rights to vote
               on the board. All they seem to want is to have what they <emph>already</emph> had,
               but processed, indexed, reformed and reflected back to them, to us, in, as I say, a
               manner that allows many of us unprecedented access.</p>
            <p>This is not, primarily, an essay about Google, and the situation was and is far more
               complicated than this polemical outline suggests. Google did, after all, emerge from
               the <emph>popular</emph> culture that was born on the internet itself, long (in net
               history terms) before institutions began to contribute to this culture to any
               significant extent. Thus the initial cultural capital that Google amassed may be seen
               as fairly won, and the access that Google provided to a suddenly vast,
               ever-accumulating resource was truly unprecedented, rendering the culture of the net
               useable, manageable, findable, beyond all expectation.<note>See note 16 below. Daniel
                  C. Howe adds, <quote rend="inline" source="#howe2011">Of course Google
                     automatically/procedurally indexes our pages/content, yet makes it illegal or
                     at least, they would claim, a violation of their terms of service for us to do
                     the same to them.</quote>
               </note> We learned quickly that <soCalled>unprecedented access</soCalled> meant that
               Google was better than any other agency at managing the <soCalled>more than ever
                  before</soCalled> of everything that is digitally inscribed, the exponential
               increase in information. But now this simple, if overwhelming, quantitative fact is
                  <emph>all</emph> that we and our institutions know with any surety. We know that
               Google will deal with the scale of it all, and manage it all better, and give more of
               it back to us,<note>Daniel C. Howe adds, <quote rend="inline" source="#howe2011">in tiny
                     droplets</quote>, that are regulated by: Google.</note> but we may never know,
               unless we ask or demand, exactly <emph>how</emph> they do this or how they <emph>will
                  or will not</emph> do this in some speculative future when they have already
               disposed of the problems of processing it all, displacing it all, continually
               rendering it back to us through manifold devices with post-human artificial intelligences.<note>
                  <p>The fact that we accept – pragmatically, gratefully – Google’s indexing of the
                     corpus represented by inscribed textuality on the internet is the sign, I
                     believe, of an order-of-magnitude shift in the scale of the cultural archive
                     and our engagement with it as humans. I provide brief remarks on these issues
                     here, acutely aware that they deserve extensive and detailed consideration.</p>
                  <p> In a sense the world and the <soCalled>knowledge</soCalled> or
                        <soCalled>culture</soCalled> that is in it – call it
                        <soCalled>content</soCalled> – has not and will not change. Human life is
                     what it is. Nonetheless we tend to agree that our ability to archive this
                     content in order to make it recordable and manipulable has radically changed
                     during the modern period. Scholars of the age of Francis Bacon began to lose
                     hold of any sense that they might read and thus know
                        <soCalled>everything</soCalled>. In the maturity of print culture, we have
                     long ago lost sight of being able to read or <soCalled>know</soCalled>
                     everything in a particular discipline, let alone
                        <soCalled>everything</soCalled>
                     <emph>per se</emph>. However, we were wont to believe that all inscribed
                     textuality might be collected in libraries or traditional archives and that, at
                     the very least, a <q>union catalogue</q>, the
                     product of human labor, would be able to give us access to any necessary
                     article of knowledge, with universities curating and signaling the originality
                     of purported contributions to this sum of content. However, just as the
                     efflorescence of print made it literally impossible to read everything, the
                     explosion of content-creation that is enabled by programmable and networked
                     media now makes it literally impossible for humans to <emph>index</emph>
                     everything in their archives. Humans are already, now, not able to create a
                     catalogue of the articles of culture that they have, collectively, created.</p>
                  <p> Instead, humans write software, processes that will index these archives.
                     These processes will reflect human culture back to its maker-consumers and
                     consumer-makers. This is already what Google does for us. At first it seemed
                     that the company did this almost gratuitously, more or less as a function of
                     Silicon Valley utopianism and naivety. Now this intensely, importantly cultural
                     service is fundamentally skewed and twisted by commerce, by a requirement to
                     generate advertising revenues that are dependent on the most advanced forms of
                     capitalism. These circumstances may have been all but inevitable, but the time
                     for decisions has come. What computational processes do we want to create and
                     have running for us, in order to index or otherwise represent for us the
                     contents of the cultures that we are making? </p>

            <p>So now all my writing to be found has been recast in the light of this shared,
               would-be universal engagement or struggle with Google to retrieve or reform culture.
               And immediately, as in the work of writing digital media that underlies these
               remarks, I return to specifics with a heightened awareness of their potential
               significance, especially as critique of these relations.</p>
            <p>For example, in the course of investigating writing to be found, it occurred to me
               that any material that is quoted in a text from a well-known, and therefore much
               indexed, source will emerge very differently in the procedures outlined above. It
               seems that in what may be standard original composition, you can expect sequences of
               words that you are writing to be found to be unique after about five words, depending
               on diction. However, arbitrarily long sequences of words recalled or quoted from many
               texts, like the English Bible in one of the standard translations, will already and
               will always be found ... by Google. The conceptualist in you might want to test this
               to some absurd aesthetic extreme, typing all of Genesis into the Google search box
               delimited by quotes and discovering thousands of hits. I didn’t get this far although
               I made attempts with lengthy sequences until I noticed, in light grey type, the
                  legend:<note>Saturday Oct. 7, 2009.</note>
               <quote rend="block" source="#undocumented">
                  <q>what</q> (and subsequent words) was ignored
                  because we limit queries to 32 words.</quote> I hadn’t noticed or been aware of
               this limitation before. And I am still unsure about when and how it was instituted.
               How long had this been a Google limitation? Who decided it was needed and why? Why 32
               words? It’s clearly not surprising that this limitation exists. The point here is
               that it gets in the way of using or, in my case, writing <emph>with</emph> Google in
               the way I believed would be interesting and might lead to further aesthetic or
               critical cultural production. What if I wanted to continue with what I had hoped and
               planned to do? Google’s got indexes to my language, my culture. Even if they might
               not reasonably be expected to give me all the tools I might need or want to explore
               this material, why should they constrain or reform the tools that they do appear to
               give me in ways that seem to me to be arbitrary or, at least, unrelated to my own
               concerns? These questions are already important but not as important as they will
               become. When Google indexes all books, which institutions will keep track of when and
               why they change their search algorithms, let alone endeavor to influence Google’s
               decisions in such matters?<note>Clearly, my underlying argument resonates with
                  traditionalist Humanities anxieties about scholarship and the effects on
                  scholarship of the tools and resources which Google has suddenly provided <ptr
                     target="#nunberg2009"/>. However, I am not so much concerned with the
                  preservation of cultural standards. I am entirely content that institutions should
                  change. I just don’t think that such change should be at the whim of
                  unacknowledged, ill-considered, and venal forces. The cultural vectors opened up
                  by Google will only ever be able change our institutions coherently and
                  generatively if they remain susceptible to the values and standards of
                     <emph>all</emph> our institutions, not only our mercantile and marketing
                  institutions.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Never mind, for my immediate purposes at least. Conceptually, I can imagine what the
               search results would have been for absurdly long sequences from famous texts and how,
               using writing to be found procedures for lineation, texts that quoted or plagiarized
               such material (let’s say, writing to be found punctuating certain texts of Kathy
               Acker or Pierre Menard’s <title rend="italic">Quixote</title> or Kent Johnson’s
                  <title rend="italic">Day</title>),<note>Daniel C. Howe suggests additional
                  reference to Jonathan Lethem, ‘The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism,’ Harper's
                  Magazine February 2007 <ptr target="#lethem2007"/>. More recently there is also
                  the novel-as-manifesto-of-appropriation: David Shields, <title rend="italic"
                     >Reality Hunger: A Manifesto</title> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010) <ptr
                     target="#shields2010"/>. The work of the late American novelist Kathy Acker was
                  known for its techniques of appropriation not to say plagiarism. In the story
                     <title rend="quotes">Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote</title> Jorge Luis
                  Borges imagines a French writer, Menard, who is so able to immerse himself in the
                  earlier work that he <soCalled>re-creates</soCalled> it word for word. Recent
                  gestures in the realm of Conceptual Poetics are relevant here. Kenneth Goldsmith’s
                     <title rend="italic">Day</title> consists of a straightforward transcription of
                  the Sep 1, 2000 issue of the <title rend="italic">New York Times</title> within
                  the format and design of a standard 836-page book <ptr target="#goldsmith2003"/>.
                  In a further conceptual gesture, Kent Johnson appropriated this work as his
                     <soCalled>own</soCalled> with the connivance of Buffalo-based small press
                  Blazevox by simply pasting over all references to Goldsmith, replacing them with a
                  Johnson overlay. I possess a copy of the altered book, signed by the (latter)
                  publisher.</note> would be chopped up where they are <soCalled>original</soCalled>
               and then bulge out where they incorporated what is already found, as the <q>If I write, quoting ...</q> example above
               demonstrates. (Menard’s <title rend="italic">Quixote</title> would be all
                  <soCalled>bulge</soCalled>.)</p>
            <p>I say <said>never mind</said>, but remain disturbed. A productive engagement had been
               interrupted by a (ro)bot from Porlock and now this seems as if it will be
               characteristic of writing and working <emph>with</emph> Google, re-energizing the
               Anglo-Saxon origins of that preposition. In fact, of course, it is a function of
               encoded properties and methods that are designed to reassert, where and whenever
               necessary, the underlying purposes of the Google engine which is, as we recall, to
               dispose of culture and propose advertisements based on this disposal. Google asserts:
                  <said>You don’t need more than 32 words in your queries in order to determine what
                  you want and what interests you. Making something that requires longer searches
                  will simply skew our data and make it harder for us to know what you want.</said>
            </p>
            <p>Despite Google’s assertion, I keep searching. Now my collaborator, Daniel C. Howe,
               and I keep searching. We’ve already, like many others, come up against another
               important limit. If you search too much or too fast (even manually I found), then
               Google’s engine thinks you might be a process (as <emph>it</emph> is) and that you
               might be making automated queries. This produces the same threat to Google’s
               underlying purpose, the threat of skewed analytical data. However, to us it seems as
               if we are simply retrieving access to our own linguistic culture. Usually, we are
               simply mining the corpus that Google makes accessible – in an unprecedented manner –
               for <soCalled>natural language data</soCalled>. In writing to be found, I seek out
               the chaotic edge of what is being written and is soon to be found by myself and
               others, the edge of what literary culture acknowledges to be attributable
                  authorship.<note>I could, of course, do this in other domains using the resources
                  of other institutions but the thought of what this would mean is overwhelming – a
                  life-changing shift into research on natural language, with single-minded devotion
                  to finding or building the databases one would need. Google promises me an
                  accessible corpus and even tells me that it is always already mine and everyone
                  else’s – in good net-utopian terms – but then denies me service at crucial moments
                  when I am beginning to build a poetic.</note> Isn’t this a legitimate engagement
               with what Google promises us? Shouldn’t these admittedly or purportedly poetic
               queries be accepted as a part of the culture with which they also engage?</p>
            <p>As a matter of fact we continue to write programs that generate automated queries and
               it is strange that Google – itself a vast conglomeration of processes – rejects them
               as such. Shouldn’t Google be prepared to pass judgment as to whether a process is an
               innocent cultural address to its services rather than assume that any automated
               inquiry is an attempt to undermine or deflect it from its prime, commercial
                  objective?<note>Extracts from Google’s Terms of Service, supplied by Daniel C.

               </note> Returning to a concrete example that engages related concerns with poetics
               and the author function, I realized that using the Google search query’s
                  <term>not</term> prefix (a minus sign) I might search for sequences of words from
               well-known texts (delimited by quote marks) that would be found in the corpus but in
               places where they were not associated with their well-known
                  <soCalled>authors</soCalled>. I used this negatively qualified version of the
               procedure described above, testing successively longer sequences and aiming to find
               the longest sequences that also satisfied the essential condition of <emph>not</emph>
               being attributed to the famous author. This produces a text that, paradoxically, is
               collaged from phrases that are quoted from arbitrary internet unknowns but which,
               when linked together, will compose a famous text. Before supplying an actual example,
               I want simply to point out that the program I write to undertake this entirely
               legitimate essay in conceptual poetics generates a large number of test searches even
               for a brief text and it will find itself frequently blocked by Google’s suspicion of
               and ultimate denial of my own process’s high cultural intentions.<note>The following
                  text is based on a short piece by Samuel Beckett that eventually became, as a
                  final text in English, three fragments from <title rend="italic">How It Is</title>
                  <ptr target="#beckett1964" loc="31"/>. I searched Google for successively longer
                  sequences of double-quote-delimited words from these fragments with the
                  qualifiers: -Beckett -Beckett's -Beckett’s (with prime and apostrophe) looking for
                  pages on which the sequences occurred but are not associated with Beckett. Links
                  to selected pages that I found current on Saturday Feb. 15, 2010 have been added
                  to the relevant word sequences in the constructed passage above. They are not,
                  that is, quoted from Beckett. Most of these links still work, but some are now
                  broken and others may, of course, break over time.</note>

            <p>This is Beckett, three fragments from <title rend="italic">How It Is</title> which
               also correspond to the final part of a short prose work he originally published in
               French as <title rend="italic">L’Image</title>. But it is also possible to assert
               that is <emph>not</emph> Beckett but rather something that I have written together
               with Google, where we have conspired to calculate a maximal syntagmatic association
               with Beckett’s texts while ensuring that these sequences are attributable to others,
               often many others, and we do this in a manner that can be established by a
               contemporary form of citation. It is a relatively nice problem to consider whether
               this text infringes copyright. I might claim, for example, that it is not copied,
               that it’s not even the same text, especially given that I have transcribed it with
               quotation marks around the phrases. A copyright expert might assert that it was
               created by a mechanical process, that it is the product of a procedural but regular
               form of transcription and is, therefore, a copy, to which I would have to reply that
               a great deal of personal thought and significant indeterminate and unmediated human
               labor also went into its making. The piece certainly challenges the Beckett estate’s
               moral rights in respect of the text’s integrity and its association with the author’s
               name. In US law these rights are not established. In any case, I may both justly
               claim fair use, and also perversely propose that my first-cited example was actually
               derived from the following entirely original collage composed from fragments found to
               have been written on the internet:<note>In actual fact, I made this text by first
                  alphabetically sorting the gathered sequences and only then rearranging them as
                  little as possible in order to provide some kind of relatively coherent
                  diegesis.</note>

            <p>Clearly a lot more could and will be done with the procedures of writing to be found
               including with this latter variation in which one rediscovers how much of what has
               been written has already been written. Google makes all of this possible and Google
               also stands in the way of these unanticipated essays. One very significant reason to
               continue to work in this way is precisely to reveal how Google and other similar
               agencies will reform what they pretend to enable, and how our existing institutions
               that support writing as a cultural practice will relate to the profound reformations
               that must ensue.</p>

            <p>The <soCalled>writing readers</soCalled> within a major collaborative project in
               digitally mediated literary art are underpinned by the critical, contemporary,
               quietly hacktivist natural language processing and research initiated in <q>writing to be found</q>. <title rend="italic">The
                  Readers Project</title> incorporates <q>writing with
                  Google</q>, and it also proposes performative reading as, perhaps, exemplary
               of how we may write in this, our future. The collaboration, with Daniel C. Howe,
               produces literary objects that have an extensive computational dimension and will,
               typically, be realized as screen-based or projected works, for both private viewing
               and reading, and more public exposure in installations with distributed multi-media
               and/or mobile displays. As such, they are, in the relatively small world of writing
               digital media, examples of a variety of work whose real-world instantiations take
               some place either in the screen real estate of net-based or personal computer-based
               art, or in the mediated gallery space of digital art. Even the computational aspects
               of this work have become amenable to critical attention in these days of codework,
               expressive processing and/or critical code studies.</p>
            <p>However – and this may not be the best news for an already over-extended critical
               community examining aesthetic objects that have still to prove themselves in any
               wider cultural forum – crucial reading strategies that are already encapsulated in
               our projects, in our quasi-autonomous readers, are derived from precisely the kind of
                  <q>writing with Google</q> that I have outlined
               above. In other words, one of the more interesting dimensions of these readers is
               that they are, in significant measure, the result of natural language research and
               processing undertaken in, arguably, a socio-politically implicated dialogue with our
               predominant new devices of cultural reflection and disposition. Of course, the
               readers also have other inclinations and ambitions (apart from any jostling entry
               into the world of digital art). They may simply wish to offer themselves to
               open-minded literary critical readings such as are often applied to the literary
               avant-garde. You can read them as poetry or as a poetics. What I am suggesting,
               however, is that they may also be read for the way that both they and their making
               reads and writes with newly mediated culture, with Google in this instance.</p>
            <p>This is a final point, a vector for both literary poesis in digital media and for its
               critical reception, but I must conclude the point with its illustration. Here are
               three readers from the project, moving through and <soCalled>reading</soCalled>, in
               some sense, an underlying text, a prose poem of my own, <title rend="quotes">Misspelt
                  Landings</title>.<note>This preliminary piece from <title rend="italic">The
                     Readers Project</title> may be accessed from <ref
                     target="http://thereadersproject.org"
                  >http://thereadersproject.org</ref>.</note> There is a mesostic reader that finds
               and highlights words containing letters (which it capitalizes as it finds them) in a
               phrase beginning <q>READING THROUGH ...</q>, and
               there are two other readers: one that tends rightwards and downwards in the
               conventional vectors of human reading while deviating occasionally, and one that
               seems to wander while surrounding itself with a halo of erased or faded text. What is
               far from obvious is that these readers, all of them, chose their next word to read
               (and hence their deviations) on the basis of simple but quite effective research on
               the usage of these words in the corpus to which Google gives us access, however
               reluctantly. An important aspect of the way this and other pieces from <title
                  rend="italic">The Readers Project</title> are deployed is that, for each such
               manifold display, the readings of all the live readers are separately broadcast to a
               server, a feed to which you may subscribe by accessing a URL with a browser and with
               other clients under development. Subscribed to a particular reader, you may read
               along with it and see clearly the textual path it has chosen, according to its
               particular reading strategies.</p>
            <p>In simple terms these readers check the proximate neighboring words of the word they
               have just read and they <soCalled>know</soCalled> – from the results of their
               writers’ struggle with Google – whether or not any or all of those proximate words
               will represent likely natural language phrases.<note>
                  <p>There is a great deal that could be written about <title rend="italic">The
                        Reader Project</title>: about how it operates and engages literary
                     aesthetics from a critical or theoretical perspective, most of which would not
                     be entirely relevant to the present discussion. However, it may be worth noting
                     and commenting briefly on this sense of <q>proximate</q>. A proximate or neighboring word may be one that is
                     contiguous with a reference word. In linguistics, such a word, for example,
                     collocates with the reference word if it follows it in the line of the syntagm,
                     in the metonymic dimension as Roman Jakobson called it. Another notion of
                     proximity – in the complementary metaphoric dimension, that of replacement –
                     would see words such as synonyms or antonyms as (virtually) proximate to
                     particular words of reference in the text. However, proximity or neighborhood
                     may also be defined, in <title rend="italic">The Readers Project</title>, in
                     terms of the <emph>typographic</emph>, and this neglected dimension of
                     textuality reveals itself, in our aesthetic analyses, as vital to if not
                     constitutive of reading. (Typography is not, perhaps, neglected as a
                        <emph>graphic</emph> art but it is, arguably, neglected as an art of
                     reading, as a literary art, <foreign xml:lang="la">sensu stricto</foreign>.)
                     Specifically, readers in the project currently have access to databases of
                     information about all the actual word pairs in a text that they are
                        <soCalled>reading</soCalled> combined with any (and all) third words
                     existing in the text. Clearly the vast majority of these three-word
                     combinations will not occur anywhere in the text itself as contiguous syntagms.
                     These sequences of three words we call <term>perigrams</term> to distinguish
                     them both from <term>bigrams</term> and <term>trigrams</term> in standard
                     Markov analyses. Once we have derived a text’s perigrams, we then use Google to
                     find counts for their frequencies in the internet corpus, and (for the moment)
                     discard any perigrams with zero counts. This allows the readers to follow the
                     standard syntagmatic line but to check arbitrary typographically neighboring
                     words to see whether they would form a perigram that occurs in the natural
                     language of the Google-accessible corpus. If they do, a particular reader may
                     be allowed to follow the alternate syntagmatic line of reading that it has
                     discovered in its typographic neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>Clearly <q>proximity</q> may be redefined in
                     accordance with other features of linguistic items, including, for example,
                     orthographic features. Thus the <soCalled>mesostic</soCalled> reader mentioned
                     above, looks for words containing particular letters and considers them <q>proximate</q> if they contain a letter that it
                     requires to read-while-spelling. In point of fact, the current mesostic reader
                     takes further cognizance of physical typographic proximity and also what one
                     might call the relative <q>perigrammatic
                        proximity</q> (just described) of two words that it might be about to
                     read, for example, and that both contain the letter it needs to spell. It will
                     prefer to read a word that is more proximate in the maximum number of
                     dimensions.</p>
                  <p>For a more extensive methodological and computational introduction to <title

               </note> Daniel C. Howe and I are the writers of these readers and we, along with
               other coded processes, struggled with Google, sending queries to its
                  <soCalled>books</soCalled> domain to see how many instances of thousands of
               three-word phrases had already been inscribed as writing to be found and how
               frequently they had been inscribed in the net’s textual corpus, if at all.</p>
            <p>Many of you reading this will understand that this is far from being an entirely
               novel approach. However, although our readers may seem to be following a simple
               Markov chain, the actual processes and models deployed in <title rend="italic">The
                  Readers Project</title> conceal some significant differences to a standard Markov
                  model.<note>See above. A normal Markov model applied to language is only concerned
                  with the syntagmatic dimension of language and takes no account of any typographic
                  structure that it may have. The above definition of <term>perigrams</term> in
                     <title rend="italic">The Readers Project</title> takes some account of
                  typography and thus complicates the standard Markov model.</note> More importantly
               and finally, these readers were written with processes that hacked near-live
               statistical data out of the Google-indexed internet corpus of all the inscribed
               cultural material that can be found. Writers of readers like these could not have
               made anything approaching their capabilities until very recently, or not without
               huge, institutionally-maintained resources. We were and are able to make these
               readers remarkably up-to-the-minute in their model-driven analyses of the texts that
               they were written to read. They know what they need to know about the latest writing
               to be found on the net in their domain. This knowledge was mined iteratively from the
               language that we all gave over and continue to give over to Google and, in so far as
               Google was uninterested in or threatened by the queries we needed to make in order to
               gather our readers’ simple knowledge, that knowledge is the result of a fascinating
               struggle that – for this reader at least – is a model in micro-procedure of the
               struggles that we must all undertake as our institutions of culture pass over their
               care and disposition to all those strange engines of inquiry that may suddenly reject
               our search for writing. They reject our queries for reasons that we may not entirely
               comprehend. Not yet and perhaps, not ever.</p>
