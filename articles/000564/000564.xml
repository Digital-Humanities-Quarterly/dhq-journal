                <p>Described by the author as a <soCalled>morphing book</soCalled>, John Miles
                    Foley’s <title rend="italic">Oral Tradition and the Internet: Pathways of the
                        Mind</title> is an ambitious project that extends from the textual to the
                    digital. Through a nonlinear reading, the book illustrates and explains to
                    readers the various similarities and potential interactions <quote rend="inline"
                        >between humankind’s oldest and newest thought technologies.</quote> Without
                    traditional organization, the book invites readers to jump from section to
                    section much like the way one might peruse a website — and in fact was paired
                    with the accompanying Pathways Project website (currently offline). The nodes as
                    Foley calls them (small chapters arranged in alphabetical order) cover a variety
                    of topics, utilizing the authors prefix appended terminology (such as tAgora and
                    ewords) including thought experiments that challenge our conception of what
                    constitutes a text. The argument lies therein: a nontraditional and nonlinear
                        <soCalled>book</soCalled> reveals the tension and dynamic relationship
                    between oral tradition and Internet technology.</p>

                <p>John Miles Foley’s book, <title rend="italic">Oral Tradition and the Internet:
                        Pathways of the Mind</title>, resists the idea of a book. Its
                    self-referential introductory sections draw towards the main underlying idea —
                    the Pathways Project website, an exciting, ambitious, and somewhat overstretched
                    attempt to illustrate the linkages between Oral Tradition (OT) and Internet
                    Technology (IT). Such resistance, along with the inability to access the
                    Pathways Project seven years after the author-creator’s passing, gives the book
                    a feeling of a past relic of scholarship, echoing Marshall McLuhan’s <title
                        rend="italic">The Medium is the Message</title> in its of-the-moment
                    importance paired with an overzealous effort to make sense of the ensuing
                    culture of a new technology. Foley’s work, however, preempts criticisms by
                    refuting its presence as a <soCalled>solution</soCalled>; instead, like the
                    wiki-based website of the Pathways Project itself, encouraging others to
                    constantly interact with the text (all versions of it) and layer new meaning and
                    insights into the corpus. Ironically, or perhaps poetically, the stasis with
                    which the book text (and the tAgora) exists seems to undermine many of the
                    interesting decisions Foley made when constructing the book as a
                        <soCalled>provocation</soCalled> meant to stimulate dialogue. Also, while
                    the author cites Walter Ong to invoke the idea that <quote rend="inline">the
                        conversation is never over</quote>
                    <ptr target="#foley2012" loc="26"/> the current discourse around the Internet
                    indicates that there are too many conversations about too many other things — in
                    other words, the conversation has been passed by and muffled by digital
                    noisiness elsewhere. Still, revisiting the text and the remnants of the Pathways
                    Project provides a fascinating view into how literary scholarship can be both
                    ill- and well-equipped to grapple with Internet culture.</p>
                <p>Rather than take a traditional linear approach, the author encourages the reader
                    to hop around the text as if it were a web page (which it was in the past).
                    Responding to several anticipated questions in a <title rend="quotes">Questions
                        and Answers</title> section of the preface, Foley explains that the most
                    important manner through which readers navigate the text is the one they
                    themselves choose — not linearly and not the purely pragmatic alphabetic <title
                        rend="quotes">Table of Nodes</title> with titles that read like blog posts
                        (<title rend="quotes">Excavating an Epic</title>, <title rend="quotes"
                        >Indigestible Words</title>, <title rend="quotes">Impossibility of
                        tPathways</title>, etc.). In this way, the <soCalled>morphing
                        book</soCalled> as he describes it serves as a marker for how the Internet
                    can simultaneously feel like it gives the reader (or perhaps participant) more
                    agency even as the content itself is curated specifically for a certain kind of
                    reading. I myself was particularly intrigued by several sections for what they
                    alluded to but did not directly address.</p>
                <p>The node on <title rend="quotes">eWords</title> (Foley utilizes e-, o-, and t-
                    prefixes for electronic, oral, and textual respectively, as in ePathways,
                    oWords, tAgora, etc.) references ever so briefly texts that live primarily on
                    the Internet through which users <quote rend="inline">find their way through a
                        constellation of pathways constructed and used not by a single person but by
                        a group (Distributed Authorship)</quote>
                    <ptr target="#foley2012" loc="99"/>. What Foley says without actually saying it
                    is that there exists a new genre of literature, different from both the oral
                    epic poem and the written text novel, that can be co-authored by a vast expanse
                    of writers and navigated in a variety of ways — and in fact the navigation of a
                    text can in fact be part of the <soCalled>writing</soCalled> process itself. He
                    is talking about electronic literature and games. It is for this reason I found
                    it odd that Foley did not choose to include e-lit titles or specific games, or
                    in fact the fields of Digital Literature/Media Studies and Game Studies
                    themselves. While it feels easy to criticize this omission in 2019 now that
                    there exist such widely popular choose-your-own-adventure media like <title
                        rend="italic">Black Mirror</title>’s <title rend="quotes"
                        >Bandersnatch</title> that lives on a streaming service (Netflix), it is
                    still odd given the vast array of digital objects that existed well prior to
                    publication. Perhaps, ironically, that points to a refusal to accept such media
                    objects as part of the greater canon — a refusal that continues preventing
                    Western academia from accepting oral literary traditions from <title
                        rend="italic">Other</title> parts of the world as being worthy of literary
                    study, something Foley himself should know given his prolific career focusing on
                    oral traditions.</p>
                <p>Such a blind spot seems most glaring when in a wandering section on the
                    hypothetical <title rend="quotes">Museum of Verbal Art</title> the author uses a
                    tongue-in-cheek tone to note how <soCalled>high-traffic</soCalled> exhibits
                    featuring <soCalled>elite</soCalled> authors like Chaucer <quote rend="inline"
                        >require a bit of face-lifting to acknowledge oAgora dimensions of their
                        artistry</quote>
                    <ptr target="#foley2012" loc="153"/>. He immediately goes on to clunkily add,
                    still in a somewhat cheeky manner that: <cit>
                        <quote rend="block">Similar woes have beset the Curators of Eastern Art,
                            whether Indian, Oriental, or Arabic. Not only do texts like the <title
                                rend="italic">Mahabharata</title> stem from oral traditions, it
                            seems, but some of them also appear to have <soCalled>lesser</soCalled>
                            kin still alive today in folk tradition. And this is to say nothing of
                            Middle Eastern Art, in particular the Judeo-Christian Bible — both Old
                            and New Testaments — with its roots firmly planted in the realm of the
                            spoken, embodied word. <ptr target="#foley2012" loc="153"/></quote>
                    </cit></p>
                <p>It is an odd section that utilizes the thought experiment of a <title
                        rend="quotes">Museum of Verbal Art</title> to point out the absurdity of
                    freezing oral tradition for prestige’s sake and how a focus on tAgora and not
                    oAgora would lead to the loss of the museum’s accreditation. It is especially
                    odd that Foley chose not to highlight the Qur’an (given its more pronounced oral
                    identity) or pre-Islamic Arabic poetry as his examples of Middle Eastern Art.
                    Even his sardonic choice of the word <soCalled>lesser</soCalled> seems
                    counterintuitive to the possibilities of studying oral literature (or folktales,
                    fables, and folk art). Regardless, the indication is that such a museum, or any
                    type of monument to oral literary works, would be best if it existed in the
                    digital realm (or with ePathways) where it can navigate the terrain between
                    orality and textuality more smoothly. Yet the section becomes even more
                        <soCalled>meta</soCalled> when you consider that this hypothetical now
                    exists solely in a textual object. The stasis in which <title rend="italic">Oral
                        Traditions and the Internet</title> lives contradicts so many of its
                    insights, but even if the wiki were still digitally alive and active, I have my
                    doubts that the other issues would be able to stimulate enough dialogue to
                    rectify the cultural oversights.</p>
                <p>John Miles Foley’s work through the past several decades shows an intellectual
                    who significantly built upon the early orality scholarship of Milman Parry and
                    Walter Ong while extending the field into the 21st century digital paradigm.
                    Unfortunately, even with its self-awareness, the book’s ipseity as a stagnant
                    artifact that is no longer supported by its web-based counterpart is further
                    exacerbated by the unusual omissions above-noted from the conversation. That is
                    certainly a shame, for if Foley were still with us today <emph>perhaps</emph>
                    the wiki would grow to more accurately grapple with the distinct differences of
                    oral traditions and the Internet — astutely commenting on the similar nature in
                    which certain cultural objects (such as Ibo folktales a la <title rend="italic"
                        >Things Fall Apart</title> or the Arabic epic oral poem <title rend="italic"
                        >Sirat Bani Hilal</title>) are excluded from literary canonization, instead
                    of buoyantly touting their supposed kinship. Or Foley could also be dismayed by
                    the current state of the Internet not having actually helped the conversation to
                    continue (per early, overly optimistic scholarship), consumed instead by the
                    overwhelming volume of so many other deafening conversations. Conversations, I
                    might add, that increasingly not oral — instead taking place in ePathways such
                    as online social media or various online journals. Readers interested in such
                    topics may be better served by looking at scholars such Angela Haas (who engages
                    in cultural and digital rhetorics) or Mark Turin’s <title rend="italic">World
