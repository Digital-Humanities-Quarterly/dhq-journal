                  <p>To immerse and engage her learners in the particularly difficult topic of WWII Paris,
                     a French instructor, with assistance from the university libraries and digital
                     humanities lab, embarked upon distinct yet iterative digital projects that allowed
                     students to connect with course material through critical making. Starting with
                     digital mapping and moving to 360° virtual reality video projects, instructor,
                     librarians, and students stitched together fragments of the past to further their
                     collective experience of this historical period via immersive technology. Students’
                     work was founded upon feminist maker pedagogy and an ethic of care that allowed them
                     to step into others’ perspectives and preserve a cultural memory that future students
                     will build upon.</p>

                     in
                     Paris during World War II? In fact, how can both the instructor and her students from
                     an
                     American university understand a past that none of them lived in and that happened
                     far
                     away? To teach a course on WWII Paris confronts the educator with challenging
                     epistemological and pedagogical questions. Referring to the six facets of understanding
                     by <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mctighe2011">#mctighe2011</a></span>, how can students feel empathy for and gain perspective

                     temporally, psychologically — from themselves? How can one find the words to talk
                     about
                     the ineffable Shoah? Finally, how can one expect them to imagine the German occupation
                     of a city to which some of them have never been?</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">To address these questions, the instructor, librarians, and students collaboratively
                     developed a series of digital projects to archive and spatially locate the fragmented
                     stories of Paris-based Holocaust survivors. The instructor, Mélanie Péron, shared
                     strong
                     friendships and working relationships with several living survivors, to whom she
                     introduced her students. In turn, her students became acquainted with these individuals
                     from the fall of 2019 into the spring of 2020 as they worked on their respective
                     narratives. The course culminated in a week-long stay in Paris, during which students
                     met these individuals in person. Librarians, Vickie Karasic and Meaghan Moody, partnered
                     with Mélanie and her students through their development of digital projects founded
                     on
                     critical making and feminist pedagogy. Using mapping and immersive technologies,
                     students created social artifacts intended to live on well after the course. More
                     importantly, they fostered collective experiences that overcame the differences of
                     place
                     and time to understand themselves, others, and cultural issues.</div>

                     [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011a">Ratto 2011a</a>] articulates in his foundational article on the subject, defining it as “a
                     mode of materially productive engagement that is intended to bridge the gap between
                     creative physical and conceptual exploration” [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011a">Ratto 2011a</a>, 252]. Critical making overlaps and
                     shares practices with art and design, including critical design [<a class="ref" href="#dunne2005">Dunne 2005</a>], but
                     departs in its focus on the process over the product. [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011a">Ratto 2011a</a>] further highlights
                     that critical making entails the thoughtful and engaged communication between makers,
                     the destabilization of power differentials, and the creation of connections between
                     theory and practice. Perhaps above all, [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011a">Ratto 2011a</a>] articulates as key to critical
                     making the investment of self and care in the process to bear a responsibility in
                     the
                     project’s enduring existence: “Ultimately, critical making is about turning the
                     relationship between technology and society from a ‘matter of fact’ into a ‘matter
                     of
                     concern.’ I see this as requiring personal investment, a ‘caring for’ that is not
                     typically part of either technical or social scholarly education” [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011a">Ratto 2011a</a>, 259]. For our
                     purposes, then, critical making entails both the collaborative production of digital
                     cultural artifacts and, more importantly, the fostering of human connections that
                     are
                     brought about by, and live through, these technological objects beyond this project.
                     Our
                     focus on authentic concern, interconnection, and personal investment also aligns with
                     tenets of the feminist ethics of care. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Because of the intensely personal and poignant nature of the course, it was critical
                     to
                     embrace the feminist strategy of an ethics of care as its cornerstone. As [<a class="ref" href="#hooks1994">hooks 1994</a>]
                     has argued, “To teach in a manner that respects and cares for the souls of our students
                     is essential if we are to provide the necessary conditions where learning can most
                     deeply and intimately begin” [<a class="ref" href="#hooks1994">hooks 1994</a>, 13]. As spots were limited in the course, first-round
                     students had to answer essay questions followed by an interview for the second round.
                     Through this process, Mélanie and the students got to know one another, and she learned
                     about their motivations for participating in the course. She gave priority to
                     first-generation and/or low-income students for whom the trip was covered by financial
                     aid and the opportunity to travel abroad was the first one and might be the last.
                     On the
                     first day of class, an important convention was introduced to the class. The students
                     and the instructor were to address each other on a first-name basis. The linguistic
                     familiarity translated into the creation of a genuine, fostering, and co-constructive
                     community. Students were also given weekly, extensive personalized feedback and support
                     throughout the course, as they engaged both with this complex and tragic period of
                     history and in direct communication with survivors. </div>

                     ethics of care as a “psychological logic of relationships” [<a class="ref" href="#gilligan1982">Gilligan 1982</a>, 73] that denotes a
                     “connection between self and others which is articulated by the concept of
                     responsibility” [<a class="ref" href="#gilligan1982">Gilligan 1982</a>, 74]. Students were invited as collaborators into the class, and they
                     were tasked with creating digital projects that preserved survivors’ histories. We
                     asked
                     students to exercise care and empathy for these individuals and worked to cultivate
                     this
                     capacity through discussion, activities, and feedback. Elaborating on [<a class="ref" href="#hooks1994">hooks 1994</a>] and
                     [<a class="ref" href="#macedo2018">Macedo and Freire 2018</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#accardi2010">Accardi 2010</a>] writes, “And what makes care feminist is that
                     it sees students as whole human beings, not vessels to be filled with information
                     and
                     knowledge. It sees learners as people with thoughts and feelings that they bring to
                     the
                     classroom, and which, in turn, affect how they learn” [<a class="ref" href="#accardi2010">Accardi 2010</a>, 44]. Students were not merely
                     absorbing this history and translating it into digital projects but rather were in
                     dialogue with survivors and the instructor while aligning their own understanding
                     and
                     experiences to those of the survivors — requiring vulnerability, awareness, and
                     emotional work. For example, a creative writing project involved two parts over the
                     course of the semester: first, students wrote, weekly, a chapter of a fictional
                     character’s memoirs living in Paris during the German Occupation, the testimony of
                     which
                     aimed at showing a human facet of history; after this, students wrote under imposed
                     constraints inspired by post-memory writers, in particular Georges Perec. The list
                     of
                     constraints included writing a text about a chosen number, writing a list of memories
                     starting each sentence by “I remember,” and picking a letter from the alphabet and
                     writing a text made of words excluding that letter. The objective here was for students
                     to experience the difficulties faced by the survivors to tell their stories and to
                     give
                     shape to the voids and the silences left by history. At the end of the semester,
                     students were asked to compile their pieces in any order; the ultimate constraint
                     involved embedding one final page – a new creation of their choosing – in the very
                     middle of the collected work. This new page acted as the cylindrical mirror in an
                     anamorphic construction through which scattered and disparate fragments regain a shape
                     and therefore a meaning invisible until then. In every single case, the anamorphic
                     page
                     revealed to the students that, unbeknownst to them, the story of their fictional
                     character was a portal through which they discovered a piece of themselves or
                     rediscovered a piece of their own narrative. In other words, the creative writing
                     project mirrored what the historical digital projects were meant to achieve.</div>

                     describes archivists as “caregivers, bound to records, creators, subjects, users, and

                     survivors, the instructor, librarians, and with one another. In the classroom, students
                     from varied backgrounds bonded over the course discussions and projects, and these
                     bonds
                     continued to strengthen while in Paris. The well-traveled students kindly and
                     unassumingly helped their classmates ease into the exotic experience. They also
                     problem-solved, griped, shared joy and sorrow, and made things together, while
                     contributing to the growing body of Shoah archiving taken on by the instructor. </div>

                     pedagogical modes of inquiry and critique into practice. [<a class="ref" href="#cipolla2019">Cipolla 2019</a>] writes,
                     “Introducing ‘making’ as a pedagogical tool into a feminist classroom highlights the
                     importance of moving beyond the critique. Feminist makers critique, but they also

                     on their projects. Making informed by feminist pedagogy encompasses making that is
                     rooted explicitly in care and connection: “it pays attention to the politics of care and
                     vulnerability; and it touches at all points, on the embodied and interconnected
                     experience of beings in living systems” [<a class="ref" href="#cipolla2019">Cipolla 2019</a>, 262]. Through feminist maker
                     pedagogy, students learn not only how to use tools but also to ask deeper questions
                     about those tools and how they are using them. In turn, making prompts students to
                     ask
                     new questions and explore a concept through a different modality. Students also grow
                     to

                     embraced this outlook in particular with our reliance on the feminist strategy of
                     intuition, which [<a class="ref" href="#accardi2010">Accardi 2010</a>] describes as “valu[ing] the inner voice, that quiet way

                     knowing” [<a class="ref" href="#accardi2010">Accardi 2010</a>, 17]. Accordingly, the project and the way Mélanie engages with her students
                     stem from serendipity, intuition, and instinct — all of which defy simple definition
                     and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"> With our theoretical groundwork laid, we can further expand on the choice of
                     technologies for our project; namely, immersive technologies. While the instructor
                     has
                     experimented with a variety of digital tools and methods in her courses, this article
                     focuses primarily on the creation of 360º recordings that were embedded into a digital
                     map and experienced on a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD). We selected
                     VR
                     as our medium for this project for several reasons. First, VR often provides for more
                     engaging learning objects: “Virtual reconstructions […] help students understand
                     cultures, histories, and artifacts that are physically, temporally, or culturally
                     distant. While it may be difficult for American students to visit Notre Dame, extended
                     realities can help them experience it in a way that more traditional media cannot”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ocallaghan2020">O’Callaghan 2020</a>].
                     While in the HMD, the user is immersed in a 360º simulation in which they can look
                     in
                     any direction and visit distant places and times. Not all Mélanie’s classes are able
                     to
                     visit Paris, but through VR, they can stand in a park in Paris, view people walking
                     around them, become aware of the spatial distance between the various elements
                     surrounding them, and listen to fragments of their conversations. VR brings the user
                     closer to the real experience than simply reading about it, hearing a description,
                     or
                     viewing a video clip. It may not only combine all these modalities but also includes
                     a
                     focused environment and a first-person perspective. This capability feels especially
                     invaluable in light of the still unfolding COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of
                     safe
                     travel. VR also makes private spaces more accessible. Anyone can visit a public park
                     but
                     perhaps not a personal residence or a fragile environment. Further, VR and 360º
                     recording technology, in particular, can serve as archiving tools to preserve a place
                     at
                     a point in time. Imagine being able to revisit your childhood bedroom or your
                     grandparent’s house exactly as they looked when you were a child. This was the effect
                     we
                     wanted our students to experience.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">With VR technologies, we can also integrate additional data and engagement
                     opportunities. For example, [<a class="ref" href="#lueck2020">Lueck and Panich 2020</a>] describe an XR (extended reality)
                     project to illustrate Native Ohlone history at Santa Clara University: “Further, the
                     technology provided an additional representational layer allowing students not only
                     to
                     analyze what is present in the commemorative landscape but also to reveal the histories
                     that have been effectively erased from our campus, such as unmarked mission cemeteries” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#360tours">#360tours</a></span>
                     . In this case, students digitally annotated 360º recordings with critical
                     interpretations of their campus’s history, which aren’t represented on the current
                     physical sites. In this way, VR technologies enable users to create multimodal learning
                     experiences with layered, immersive stories. There is also growing evidence to suggest
                     that VR can impact visioning and transcultural understanding. For example, [<a class="ref" href="#mills2020">Mills et al. 2020</a>] created La République, an educational VR experience that shares the lives of four
                     Parisians living in the same quarter. The experience follows these individuals
                     throughout their days at work and at home and in public and private contexts. They
                     found
                     that the project “led to a clear shift in students’ understanding of Parisian culture”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mills2020">Mills et al. 2020</a>, 756]. Of note, they saw that after the VR experiences, students who had not
                     previously been to Paris scored similarly to students who had been to Paris before
                     in
                     being able to “imagine their potential role as active participants in Parisian life” [<a class="ref" href="#mills2020">Mills et al. 2020</a>, 757]. The project attempts to enable students to experience feelings of presence, which
                     [<a class="ref" href="#delapena2010">de la Peña et al. 2010</a>] describe as “the sense of being in a place” [<a class="ref" href="#delapena2010">de la Peña et al. 2010</a>, 294] and argue

                     to “empathize with her in a deeper way.” Immersive technologies have become a very
                     popular creation tool for consciousness raising and social justice work. For example,
                     many projects center issues of race [<a class="ref" href="#hyphenlabs">Hyphen-Labs. n.d.</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#smith">Smith n.d.</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#hostileterrain">Hostile Terrain n.d.</a>]

                     understandably receiving criticism. Acknowledging that empathy awareness raising
                     projects are often well intentioned, [<a class="ref" href="#nakamura2020">Nakamura 2020</a>] argues that VR “is identity tourism
                     for the 21st century, but with a difference. This time, the kinds of bodies that are
                     on
                     offer are not just exotic, racialized and gendered avatars that users can take on
                     recreationally and temporarily” [<a class="ref" href="#nakamura2020">Nakamura 2020</a>, 54] and that VR “reproduce[s] racial violence in the
                     name of reducing it” [<a class="ref" href="#nakamura2020">Nakamura 2020</a>, 51]. The temporary “owning” of another’s body and experiences
                     is problematic in that you cannot automate real and genuine connection with another
                     human being. One cannot really understand what it is to live in a refugee camp by
                     wearing a VR HMD for a few minutes. [<a class="ref" href="#nakamura2019">Nakamura 2019</a>] suggests, “If you want to decolonize
                     VR, I think we need to look at how to give resources to communities to produce VR

                     with the survivors, which she spent years cultivating. The survivors also provided
                     guidance throughout the process. In one case, the 360º recording was created in the
                     presence of a survivor, Rachel Jedinak who guided us around key locations. In her
                     written memoir, Jedinak echoes what we hope VR can provide the viewers. She explains
                     that when she finally found the strength to go back to the neighborhood of her
                     childhood, in 1997, “[she] reconstructed the places, the streets, the routes, and the
                     map now has its shape and lines, wrapped around Duris Street. [Her] past regains its

                     informed how students filmed locations described in the text. The recordings were
                     also
                     presented to the survivors, who offered feedback and answered students’ questions.
                     This
                     input was then integrated into the final product and proved invaluable because students
                     learned from these interactions and subsequently adapted their approaches. Our project

                     tragedy of the Holocaust. We also do not see this project as a means to an end but

                           interactive digital map of WWII Paris. First, we purchased a vintage 1940 paper map
                           on
                           eBay for 5 euros and both scanned and georectified it. Then, we created an Omeka<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e565">[2]</a> site to host the digital map and its ancillary

                           rounded up on July 16, 1942, and taken to a velodrome located in West Paris before
                           being
                           sent to concentration camps. It would not trigger the same understanding of history

                           showing them on the map where the velodrome stood. Once they see how close it was

                           visible, further supporting Modiano’s palimpsest metaphor. As a matter of fact, upon
                           logging into the map, for a few seconds, one can witness different layers overlap,
                           the

                           understanding. The visualization of the underlying imbricating process also illustrates

                           during part of the war before being interned, deported, or hidden. In July 2019, Rachel
                           took the instructor to her childhood neighborhood and walked her through the terrible
                           day of July 16, 1942, when the French police arrested her with her mother and sister.
                           Unlike their mother, the two young girls were fortunate to escape from the
                           Bellevilloise, where Jews were held before being bused to the Vélodrome d’Hiver. Using
                           a

                        returning from Paris, they had two weeks to finalize their projects. The final grade

                           came back from deportation. Through his memories as a five-year-old boy and the objects
                           that belonged to his loved ones, he takes the reader to the Parisian places and personal
                           realms which delineated his childhood. After the text was discussed in class, students
                           were divided into four cross-section groups. Each chose one particular place described
                           in the book that they wanted to film with a 360° camera in Paris. </div>

                           proved to be very accessible for new users. Most immersive technologies have a steep
                           learning curve and require lengthy periods of time for the creation process. We had
                           only
                           a week in Paris and a full program, of which the 360° project was just one part. [<a class="ref" href="#lueck2020">Lueck and Panich 2020</a>] recommend “modest contributions” and a more “incremental process” that
                           enable “more care, more caution, and, ultimately, a more collaborative framework going
                           forward” [<a class="ref" href="#lueck2020">Lueck and Panich 2020</a>, para. 5]. Our project benefited from this approach as well as it allowed the
                           students enough time to grasp the technology, to make and fix mistakes, to get feedback,
                           and to edit their projects. </div>

                           then
                           editing the recordings (Appendix C). Once in Paris, over the course of four days,
                           students filmed and edited a raw version of their videos. Through the creation of
                           the
                           documentaries, students were in dialogue with Cohen’s text, interpreting and capturing
                           the space through his words. The use of 360° cameras enabled students to reconstruct
                           these spaces — albeit transformed by time — more authentically for viewers, providing
                           them with an impression of how these spaces impacted the author. This created a dynamic
                           triad of author, students, and viewer in which all have agency. On the one hand, the
                           author’s narration accompanied the 360° video and determined filming locations; on
                           the

                           select
                           clips to show the author later that week. The group that filmed the itinerary that
                           Marcel Cohen took to visit his mother awaiting deportation in the Rothschild Hospital
                           wanted to be creative. They originally shot a clip, in which one of them posed as
                           his
                           mother. However, due to its potentially triggering nature, we asked them not to demo
                           this clip. When we met the author at his home, he asked Mélanie to read aloud excerpts
                           he had selected from his book and other personal documents, explaining he was passing
                           his voice onto her. At that moment, Cohen directly invited <em class="emph">us
                              </em>into <em class="emph">his</em> story and willingly became an active participant in
                           <em class="emph">our</em> project — coming full circle. He then generously answered
                           our questions and agreed to put on the Oculus VR headset and watched the first video,
                           filmed in the Parc Monceau, one of the places to which he seldom goes back. After
                           an
                           initial reaction of wonder, the little-boy-turned-old-man was visibly moved, removed
                           the
                           headset, and thanked us. He did not want to see more. This moment was a reminder that
                           our use of immersive tools comes with ethical responsibilities. As much as this virtual
                           spatial translation can lead to a deeper understanding of the text by the reader,
                           one
                           must bear in mind it can also trigger anxiety in the subject/author of the text.
                           Following this encounter, the “creative group” agreed on their own “it would not be
                           right” to keep their acting scene. This decision-making was an example of how the
                           students gained perspective and empathy and grew through the heuristic process. </div>

                           This realization became clearer after the poignant meeting with the author, in which
                           the
                           group was immersed in his home, his hospitality, and his feedback. Once again, students
                           became active collaborators of the course since the recordings were eventually embedded
                           on the digital map dedicated to the author’s life during the war and will be used

                        or
                        effectiveness of the technology to their project objectives (Appendix D). A survey
                        on
                        Google Forms was administered by the instructor to students via email in the fall

                        — of
                        the digital map. Most students found Omeka and Neatline effective for telling their

                        comments, “When you put on the VR goggles, it feels as though you are being placed in

                           A
                           city of love, light, intelligence, art, history, and culture. But I now see a new
                           Paris.
                           The love and the light are not gone though. They are intermingled with a sort of
                           darkness. I had never before noticed any of the plaques on the schools or buildings
                           when
                           walking around Paris. I surely have walked past them before, but I was never looking
                           for
                           them. And so I never saw them. Now, I have something to look for. I am equipped with
                           this knowledge to be able to see both the light and the dark. And it’s not just in
                           Paris. I’m sure there is light and dark everywhere in the world. It just takes a little
                           extra effort to uncover some of the hidden truths. I hope, as someone who is tasked
                           with
                           passing down the stories of the individuals we met, I do a great job at helping others
                           to see such things as well. Not only did I discover a new Paris, but it was as though
                           I
                           almost discovered a new me. Maybe not a new me, but I was able to see things about
                           myself I hadn’t seen before.  <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#davis2020">#davis2020</a></span></p>

                        look the way an archaeologist looks. And it’s by way of such a gaze – such an
                        interrogation – directed toward what we see that things begin to look at us from their
                        concealed spaces and bygone time. (...) The destruction of beings does not mean they
                        are
                        departed. They’re here, they are indeed here: here in the flowers of the fields, here
                        in
                        the birches’ sap, here in this tiny pond where lie the ashes of thousands dead

                     the
                     fabric of time and space which enables the participants and anyone accessing their
                     products to connect with a distant past and a faraway place. Like Medusa, the Shoah
                     petrifies and like Perseus, one needs a shield to confront it. The projects became
                     the
                     shields the instructor and the students forged in order to approach a frightening
                     part
                     of history and draw personal lessons from it. The back-and-forth movement between
                     past
                     and present, historical narratives and individual testimonies, national and personal,
                     reading and making encouraged them to not only <em class="emph">consider </em>the time
                     period but also to <em class="emph">be considerate</em> towards those who lived it. It
                     enabled them to feel empathy towards people and a time they could not <em class="emph">hear</em> at first. Their endeavors put on the map the unheard stories of invisible
                     strangers, stitched together scattered narratives, and weaved an infinite constellation
                     connecting that past to our current present. They learned to take into consideration
                     the
                     humanity of others, to recognize themselves in others and others in themselves. A
                     philanthropic knowledge they can further apply to other invisible, voiceless individuals
                     from other places who live around us today.</div>

                     but
                     care, tinkered with the stories of strangers were all at once curators, cartographers,
                     printmakers, videographers and, most importantly, <em class="term">critical
                        makers</em>, who benevolently participated in Klarsfeld’s collecting of voices As [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011a">Ratto 2011a</a>] emphasizes that “there is an important need for critical makers that can
                     reintegrate technical and social work and thereby innovate both” [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011a">Ratto 2011a</a>, 258], we hope that
                     enabling students as makers in this course, which is one of praxis, bridging the theory
                     and the practice, has prepared them to take such a sociocultural and innovative approach
                     to their own future endeavors. </div>

                     long time seem as big as entire cities. As you grow up, you realize that it was only
                     four or five streets, a dozen places and the school in the center. My childhood was
                     spread out over several maps. I had to find the little girl from the Bellevilloise
                     to
                     go back to the one of my early years. The most intimate, probably because it was the
                     happiest. All my memories were trapped, like those Christmas ornaments where you can,
                     through the glass, watch the snow fall indefinitely. Together we reconstructed the
                     places, the streets, the routes, and the map now has its shape and lines, wrapped
                     around Duris Street. My past regains its geography” [<a class="ref" href="#jedinak2018">Jedinak 2018</a>, 23–24]. </span></div>

                     Omeka, a free, flexible, open-source web-publishing platform is often a popular
                     choice in library- or museum-related projects for displaying digital collections and
                     exhibitions. In our case, Omeka provided a platform that would let us interlink
                     images, descriptions, and videos while also incorporating the digital map as a main
                     feature of the site. </span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e567"><span class="noteRef lang en">[3]  Neatline, an add-on or “plugin” to Omeka,
                     developed by Scholar’s Lab at UVA, allows scholars to tell stories with maps, images,
                     and timelines. After testing several digital mapping platforms, Neatline allowed for
                     the customization and integrations we wanted our map to display and enabled us to
                     have multiple participants working on a project at a given time.</span></div>
