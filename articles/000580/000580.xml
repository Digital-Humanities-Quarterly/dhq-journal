                Paul Eve discusses various cases of digital technology in the analysis of literary
                studies and examines how digital tools influence literary interpretation. Martin
                skillfully navigates the complex landscape of digital methodologies, offering
                readers a holistic view of the transformative influence of literary analysis.</p>
            <p>The progress of contemporary technology, particularly AI, has transformed the
                conventional methods of literary research into digitization, from traditional close
                reading and logical reasoning. Notably, the rise of digital humanities avails
                literary history of research with digital maps and social networks. To extend the
                research line along that vein, Martin Paul Eve has crafted a timely book to present
                the merits and drawbacks of computational approaches and technical analysis
                integrated into literary exploration. Quite different from the prior works on
                digital humanities, this book contributes to literary criticism by embracing both
                proponents and critics, highlighting a more impartial presentation of the cutting
                edge of digital humanities in literary research.</p>
            <p>Martin Paul Eve describes the rise of a new paradigm for the humanities in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Digital Humanities and Literary Studies</hi> [Eve 2022]. He
                presents a comprehensive review of current research on digital literature and
                establishes the necessary basis for conducting a more extensive exploration of the
                field in the years to come. Beyond depicting the influence of digital technology on
                writers, visualization, mapping, and literary history, Martin provides his unique
                recommendations and apprehensions regarding the advancement of digital humanities.
                He examines the impact of digital literary studies, both in the past and ongoing, as
                their potential future contributions. He calls on readers to recognize the
                advancement of digital humanities within the field and to prioritize improving
                researchers’ computer skills to enable more comprehensive and efficient literary
                analysis.</p>
            <p>The book has five sections after an introduction: authors and writing, space and
                    visualization,<anchor xml:id="OLE_LINK1"/> maps and place, distance and history,
                and a thought-provoking conclusion on “ethical digitalism.” Martin delves into the
                historical context and future possibilities of digital humanities development in the
                introduction. In doing so, he succinctly encapsulates the central theme of each
                section, providing readers with a lucid understanding of the emerging literary
                studies paradigm in the digital humanities sphere and a holistic conceptualization
                of his book. </p>
            <p>Chapter 1 presents a range of methods for digitally quantifying literary style, known
                as stylometry or digital stylistics. By the software named “Delta,” a system for
                calculating the frequency of words, he uncovers the potential possibilities of
                stylometry in relation to authorship and understanding of literary genres. That
                approach makes it feasible to conduct multi-textual comparisons, resulting in a more
                profound appreciation of the authors’ works. It becomes evident that a combination
                of close and distant reading is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both
                authorship and the book. Taking the book
                <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Evolution </hi>[Heldén and Jonson 2014] as a
                case study, Martin continues to provide a brief account of computer-generated
                writing to show that the purpose of digital practice isn’t to generate seemingly
                objective data as a substitute for traditional narrative and argumentation, but
                rather to maintain the fundamental function of interpretation and elaboration in
                literary studies. </p>
            <p>Chapter 2 turns to space and visualization. While acknowledging the limitations of
                visualization in understanding textual differences, he agrees that visualization can
                help us understand textual and intertextual developmental changes and plot
                connections. He provides a glimpse into a scarcely examined illicit digital
                subculture, which creates a unique form of visualized typographic aesthetic artwork.
                That opens the doors to a new era of interpretation centered on the graphs, maps,
                and trees of digital humanities and the textual exploration of visualized digital
                artifacts. </p>
            <p>Chapter 3 focuses on place and maps. Martin argues the spatial shift in literary
                criticism directs our attention toward how the structure of literary texts can shape
                our perception of space. In this way, we successfully convert space, plot, and
                authority into symbolic visual representations. Taking Matthew Sangster’s project,
                    <hi rend="italic">Romantic London,</hi> as an example, Martin explores the
                relationship between Romantic poetry and place. The deployment of maps and timelines
                significantly amplifies readers’ comprehension of the novel. Indeed, digital
                humanities practice intertwined with mapping literary and historical texts has
                become a trend powered by the advancement of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
                Consequently, literary mapping has blossomed into a substantial subdomain within the
                field of digital humanities. </p>
            <p>Chapter 4 explores the impact of digital technologies on analyzing literary and
                digital media history. By reemphasizing “distant reading,” a concept often
                associated with large-scale literary history, Martin stresses that digital methods
                must not be presented as apolitical. Instead, they are more connected with diverse
                perspectives, including postcolonialism, disability, race, gender, and class
                dimensions. Through the lens of digital technology, it becomes feasible to question
                secondary literary criticism and existing assumptions to propel the humanities
                forward. Finally, Martin concludes the book with the prospects for developing
                digital methods and their far-reaching implications for literary studies in the
                contemporary era. <anchor xml:id="OLE_LINK44"/><anchor xml:id="OLE_LINK43"/></p>
            <p>Martin addresses the benefits and difficulties of digital humanities' progress in
                literary criticism. He argues that integrating digital methods with traditional
                close reading facilitates a deeper appreciation of literary works and fosters a
                broader understanding of their significance within the context of longer literary
                histories. Although he suggests that the combination of distant and close reading
                presents a novel way of interpreting texts, he fails to provide an in-depth
                exploration of the specific methods needed for successfully integrating close and
                distant reading into analyzing literature with digital tools. Rather than focusing
                on the theory and practice of digital humanities, he presents profound possibilities
                for interpreting literature with digital methods such as delta analysis, kernel
                density estimate, visualization, etc. However, some of the digital tools discussed
                in his book might be obsolete when the book reaches readers because the evolution of
                artificial intelligence agents specializing in natural language generation has been
                extraordinarily swift. He would have never imagined that ChatGPT and its ilk hold
                revolutionary potential for computing in the coming years. Moreover, the book’s
                analysis and examples are limited to works written in English and overlooks the
                realm of multilingual digital humanities practices in a global context. </p>
            <p>Despite the limitations, this book still provokes literary scholars to reconsider the
                approaches to integrating digital methods with conventional literary criticism, and
                assess how digital humanities might change the definition of canonical works and
                literary theories. This book also serves as a valuable resource for individuals
                interested in comprehending digital humanities and specializing in literary
                research. As digital methods challenge practical literary criticism, Martin Paul
                Eve’s <hi rend="italic">Digital Humanities and Literary Studies</hi> offers
                supplement methods and innovative approaches to literary criticism in the digital
                era. Meanwhile, the ongoing progress of digital practices within literary studies is
                captivating and contentious. </p>
