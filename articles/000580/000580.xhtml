               <div class="ptext" id="p6">The progress of contemporary technology, particularly AI, has transformed the
                  conventional methods of literary research into digitization, from traditional close
                  reading and logical reasoning. Notably, the rise of digital humanities avails
                  literary history of research with digital maps and social networks. To extend the
                  research line along that vein, Martin Paul Eve has crafted a timely book to present
                  the merits and drawbacks of computational approaches and technical analysis
                  integrated into literary exploration. Quite different from the prior works on
                  digital humanities, this book contributes to literary criticism by embracing both
                  proponents and critics, highlighting a more impartial presentation of the cutting
                  edge of digital humanities in literary research.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p7">Martin Paul Eve describes the rise of a new paradigm for the humanities in <span class="hi italic">The Digital Humanities and Literary Studies</span> [Eve 2022]. He
                  presents a comprehensive review of current research on digital literature and
                  establishes the necessary basis for conducting a more extensive exploration of the
                  field in the years to come. Beyond depicting the influence of digital technology on
                  writers, visualization, mapping, and literary history, Martin provides his unique
                  recommendations and apprehensions regarding the advancement of digital humanities.
                  He examines the impact of digital literary studies, both in the past and ongoing,
                  as
                  their potential future contributions. He calls on readers to recognize the
                  advancement of digital humanities within the field and to prioritize improving
                  researchers’ computer skills to enable more comprehensive and efficient literary
                  analysis.</div>

                  and a thought-provoking conclusion on “ethical digitalism.” Martin delves into the
                  historical context and future possibilities of digital humanities development in the
                  introduction. In doing so, he succinctly encapsulates the central theme of each
                  section, providing readers with a lucid understanding of the emerging literary
                  studies paradigm in the digital humanities sphere and a holistic conceptualization
                  of his book. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p9">Chapter 1 presents a range of methods for digitally quantifying literary style, known
                  as stylometry or digital stylistics. By the software named “Delta,” a system for
                  calculating the frequency of words, he uncovers the potential possibilities of
                  stylometry in relation to authorship and understanding of literary genres. That
                  approach makes it feasible to conduct multi-textual comparisons, resulting in a more
                  profound appreciation of the authors’ works. It becomes evident that a combination
                  of close and distant reading is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both
                  authorship and the book. Taking the book
                  <span class="hi italic">Evolution </span>[Heldén and Jonson 2014] as a
                  case study, Martin continues to provide a brief account of computer-generated
                  writing to show that the purpose of digital practice isn’t to generate seemingly
                  objective data as a substitute for traditional narrative and argumentation, but
                  rather to maintain the fundamental function of interpretation and elaboration in
                  literary studies. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p10">Chapter 2 turns to space and visualization. While acknowledging the limitations of
                  visualization in understanding textual differences, he agrees that visualization can
                  help us understand textual and intertextual developmental changes and plot
                  connections. He provides a glimpse into a scarcely examined illicit digital
                  subculture, which creates a unique form of visualized typographic aesthetic artwork.
                  That opens the doors to a new era of interpretation centered on the graphs, maps,
                  and trees of digital humanities and the textual exploration of visualized digital
                  artifacts. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p11">Chapter 3 focuses on place and maps. Martin argues the spatial shift in literary
                  criticism directs our attention toward how the structure of literary texts can shape
                  our perception of space. In this way, we successfully convert space, plot, and
                  authority into symbolic visual representations. Taking Matthew Sangster’s project,
                  <span class="hi italic">Romantic London,</span> as an example, Martin explores the
                  relationship between Romantic poetry and place. The deployment of maps and timelines
                  significantly amplifies readers’ comprehension of the novel. Indeed, digital
                  humanities practice intertwined with mapping literary and historical texts has
                  become a trend powered by the advancement of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
                  Consequently, literary mapping has blossomed into a substantial subdomain within the
                  field of digital humanities. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p12">Chapter 4 explores the impact of digital technologies on analyzing literary and
                  digital media history. By reemphasizing “distant reading,” a concept often
                  associated with large-scale literary history, Martin stresses that digital methods
                  must not be presented as apolitical. Instead, they are more connected with diverse
                  perspectives, including postcolonialism, disability, race, gender, and class
                  dimensions. Through the lens of digital technology, it becomes feasible to question
                  secondary literary criticism and existing assumptions to propel the humanities
                  forward. Finally, Martin concludes the book with the prospects for developing
                  digital methods and their far-reaching implications for literary studies in the
                  contemporary era. <a id="OLE_LINK44"><!--This comment is a hack.--></a><a id="OLE_LINK43"><!--This comment is a hack.--></a></div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p13">Martin addresses the benefits and difficulties of digital humanities' progress in
                  literary criticism. He argues that integrating digital methods with traditional
                  close reading facilitates a deeper appreciation of literary works and fosters a
                  broader understanding of their significance within the context of longer literary
                  histories. Although he suggests that the combination of distant and close reading
                  presents a novel way of interpreting texts, he fails to provide an in-depth
                  exploration of the specific methods needed for successfully integrating close and
                  distant reading into analyzing literature with digital tools. Rather than focusing
                  on the theory and practice of digital humanities, he presents profound possibilities
                  for interpreting literature with digital methods such as delta analysis, kernel
                  density estimate, visualization, etc. However, some of the digital tools discussed
                  in his book might be obsolete when the book reaches readers because the evolution
                  of
                  artificial intelligence agents specializing in natural language generation has been
                  extraordinarily swift. He would have never imagined that ChatGPT and its ilk hold
                  revolutionary potential for computing in the coming years. Moreover, the book’s
                  analysis and examples are limited to works written in English and overlooks the
                  realm of multilingual digital humanities practices in a global context. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p14">Despite the limitations, this book still provokes literary scholars to reconsider
                  the
                  approaches to integrating digital methods with conventional literary criticism, and
                  assess how digital humanities might change the definition of canonical works and
                  literary theories. This book also serves as a valuable resource for individuals
                  interested in comprehending digital humanities and specializing in literary
                  research. As digital methods challenge practical literary criticism, Martin Paul
                  Eve’s <span class="hi italic">Digital Humanities and Literary Studies</span> offers
                  supplement methods and innovative approaches to literary criticism in the digital
                  era. Meanwhile, the ongoing progress of digital practices within literary studies
                  is
                  captivating and contentious. </div>
