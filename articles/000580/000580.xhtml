                  <p>In <span class="hi italic">Digital Humanities and Literary Studies, </span>Martin Paul
                     Eve discusses various cases of digital technology in the analysis of literary studies
                     and examines how digital tools influence literary interpretation. Martin skillfully
                     navigates the complex landscape of digital methodologies, offering readers a holistic
                     view of the transformative influence of literary analysis.</p>
                  
                  </div>
               
               
               
               
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p1">The progress of contemporary technology, particularly AI, has transformed the
                  conventional methods of literary research into digitization from traditional close
                  reading and logical reasoning. Notably, the rise of digital humanities avails literary
                  history of research with digital maps and social networks. To extend the research
                  line
                  along that vein, Martin Paul Eve has crafted a timely book to present the merits and
                  drawbacks of computational approaches and technical analysis integrated into literary
                  exploration. Quite different from the prior works on digital humanities, this book
                  contributes to literary criticism by embracing both proponents and critics, highlighting
                  a more impartial presentation of the cutting edge of digital humanities in literary
                  research.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Martin Paul Eve describes the rise of a new paradigm for the humanities in <span class="hi italic">The Digital Humanities and Literary Studies</span> [<a class="ref" href="#eve2022">Eve 2022</a>]. He
                  presents a comprehensive review of current research on digital literature and
                  establishes the necessary basis for conducting a more extensive exploration of the
                  field
                  in the years to come. Beyond depicting the influence of digital technology on writers,
                  visualization, mapping, and literary history, Martin provides his unique recommendations
                  and apprehensions regarding the advancement of digital humanities. He examines the
                  impact of digital literary studies, both in the past and ongoing, as well as their
                  potential
                  future contributions. He calls on readers to recognize the advancement of digital
                  humanities within the field and to prioritize improving researchers’ computer skills
                  to
                  enable more comprehensive and efficient literary analysis.</div>
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">The book has five sections after an introduction: authors and writing, space and
                  visualization, maps and place, distance and history, and a thought-provoking conclusion
                  on “ethical digitalism”. Martin delves into the historical context and future
                  possibilities of digital humanities development in the introduction. In doing so,
                  he
                  succinctly encapsulates the central theme of each section, providing readers with
                  a
                  lucid understanding of the emerging literary studies paradigm in the digital humanities
                  sphere and a holistic conceptualization of his book. </div>
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">Chapter 1 presents a range of methods for digitally quantifying literary style, known
                  as
                  stylometry or digital stylistics. By the software named “Delta”, a system for
                  calculating the frequency of words, he uncovers the potential possibilities of
                  stylometry in relation to authorship and understanding of literary genres. That approach
                  makes it feasible to conduct multi-textual comparisons, resulting in a more profound
                  appreciation of the authors’ works. It becomes evident that a combination of close
                  and
                  distant reading is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both authorship
                  and
                  the book. Taking the book <span class="hi italic">Evolution </span> [<a class="ref" href="#held%C3%A9n_jonson2014">Heldén and Jonson 2014</a>] as a
                  case study, Martin continues to provide a brief account of computer-generated writing
                  to
                  show that the purpose of digital practice isn’t to generate seemingly objective data
                  as
                  a substitute for traditional narrative and argumentation, but rather to maintain the
                  fundamental function of interpretation and elaboration in literary studies. </div>
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">Chapter 2 turns to space and visualization. While acknowledging the limitations of
                  visualization in understanding textual differences, he agrees that visualization can
                  help us understand textual and intertextual developmental changes and plot connections.
                  He provides a glimpse into a scarcely examined illicit digital subculture, which creates
                  a unique form of visualized typographic aesthetic artwork. That opens the doors to
                  a new
                  era of interpretation centered on the graphs, maps, and trees of digital humanities
                  and
                  the textual exploration of visualized digital artifacts. </div>
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">Chapter 3 focuses on place and maps. Martin argues the spatial shift in literary
                  criticism directs our attention toward how the structure of literary texts can shape
                  our
                  perception of space. In this way, we successfully convert space, plot, and authority
                  into symbolic visual representations. Taking Matthew Sangster’s project, <span class="hi italic">Romantic London,</span> as an example, Martin explores the relationship
                  between Romantic poetry and place. The deployment of maps and timelines significantly
                  amplifies readers’ comprehension of the novel. Indeed, digital humanities practice
                  intertwined with mapping literary and historical texts has become a trend powered
                  by the
                  advancement of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Consequently, literary mapping
                  has
                  blossomed into a substantial subdomain within the field of digital humanities. </div>
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">Chapter 4 explores the impact of digital technologies on analyzing literary and digital
                  media history. By reemphasizing “distant reading”, a concept often associated with
                  large-scale literary history, Martin stresses that digital methods must not be presented
                  as apolitical. Instead, they are more connected with diverse perspectives, including
                  postcolonialism, disability, race, gender, and class dimensions. Through the lens
                  of
                  digital technology, it becomes feasible to question secondary literary criticism and
                  existing assumptions to propel the humanities forward. Finally, Martin concludes the
                  book with the prospects for developing digital methods and their far-reaching
                  implications for literary studies in the contemporary era. </div>
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p8">Martin addresses the benefits and difficulties of digital humanities' progress in
                  literary criticism. He argues that integrating digital methods with traditional close
                  reading facilitates a deeper appreciation of literary works and fosters a broader
                  understanding of their significance within the context of longer literary histories.
                  Although he suggests that the combination of distant and close reading presents a
                  novel
                  way of interpreting texts, he fails to provide an in-depth exploration of the specific
                  methods needed for successfully integrating close and distant reading into analyzing
                  literature with digital tools. Rather than focusing on the theory and practice of
                  digital humanities, he presents profound possibilities for interpreting literature
                  with
                  digital methods such as delta analysis, kernel density estimate, visualization, etc.
                  However, some of the digital tools discussed in his book might be obsolete when the
                  book
                  reaches readers because the evolution of artificial intelligence agents specializing
                  in
                  natural language generation has been extraordinarily swift. He would have never imagined
                  that ChatGPT and its ilk hold revolutionary potential for computing in the coming
                  years.
                  Moreover, the book’s analysis and examples are limited to works written in English
                  and
                  overlooks the realm of multilingual digital humanities practices in a global context.
                  </div>
               
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p9">Despite the limitations, this book still provokes literary scholars to reconsider
                  the
                  approaches to integrating digital methods with conventional literary criticism, and
                  assess how digital humanities might change the definition of canonical works and
                  literary theories. This book also serves as a valuable resource for individuals
                  interested in comprehending digital humanities and specializing in literary research.
                  As
                  digital methods challenge practical literary criticism, Martin Paul Eve’s <span class="hi italic">Digital Humanities and Literary Studies</span> offers supplement methods
                  and innovative approaches to literary criticism in the digital era. Meanwhile, the
