            <p>How can intertextual relations be formalized and annotated? What would be a coherent category system of intertextuality and which formalization is suitable to make it computable while not losing its expressiveness. Against the backdrop of the most influential classical theories of intertextuality, the article does not aim for an automatic detection of intertextual relations like many other digital humanities approaches did before, but suggests a formal and expandable model of the core of intertextuality with the means of description logic, i.e. it models relations and types of entities being related by them in a machine readable RDF format. The utilization of this theory-driven model is demonstrated by several examples of intertextual relations as discussed in literary studies.</p>

            <head>Everything is relational: the complexities of
					intertextuality</head>
            <p>Intertextuality is a complex
						yet very central category in the analysis of literature. Per definition it
						not only concerns one (literary) artifact but at least two and describes the
						relation between them (cf. Pfister 1985, 11). These relations can be found
						on numerous levels and depending on the personal notion of
						“intertextuality”, limits can either be established or relations can be
						found everywhere. Leitch for example claims that “[t]he text is not an
						autonomous or unified object, but a set of relations with other texts. [...]
						Every text is intertext” (Leitch 1983, 59).</p>
            <p>Several literary genres are constituted by their
						inherent referential character: persiflage, parody, pastiche, cento
						(patchwork poem), travesty, stylistic copies, and so on. This is one reason
						why intertextuality is one of the most central categories in literary
						studies―and one of the complex ones. Below the level of genre constitution,
						intertextuality can be detected as a more fine-grained web of references in
						most, if not all, texts. At this level, intertextuality is described with
						terms such as hypolepsis (textual responses to other texts through, for
						example, agreement, disagreement, continuation, correction, etc.) or
						allusion. In addition, references can occur here in the form of, for
						example, non-genre-constituting stylistic copies or in the parodic mode of a
						text passage. In general, a distinction is made between single text
						references and so-called system references, i.e. references to entire
						"systems" such as genres. A single text passage can (as a direct or indirect
						quote, as thematic or structural parallelism, etc.) (1) refer to another
						text passage or (2) to another artifact as a whole (by e.g. evoking the
						title of that artifact) or (3) to a complete system (e.g. by parodying the
						norms of a genre, reflecting on believes of a specific epoch, etc.). The
						manner in which these references are established (to parody is just one way)
						is an additional layer of categories that complexifies the universe of
						intertextuality.</p>
            <p>This article has two aims: (1) shed light into the
						plurality of different conceptions of intertextuality and seek for common
						denominators that could form an extensible core of intertextuality. (2) Make
						first steps to computationally model intertextual relations based on a
						formal logic. This formal logic (a) allows to express the complexities of
						different possible relations as well as (b) offers computability in order to
						be able to make the analysis of intertextual relations a global shared task
						that at some point offers researchers worldwide an extensive, extensible and
						standardized knowledge graph for the annotation, detecting, querying and
						analysis of intertextuality.</p>
            <p>After revising some of the most central classical
						intertextuality theories (section 2.1) we will show the different foci that
						can be and were set in digital approaches towards intertextuality (section
						2.2). Many of these had the aim to pave a way towards building an automatic
						detector for intertextual relations. This is not our goal. Text reuse, the
						automated finding of quotes or similar text passages in a corpus of texts―in
						itself very complex from a computer science point of view―frequently seems
						under-complex from the perspective of literary studies that traditionally
						deals with semantically much more complex forms of intertextual relations.
						We instead go the way of modeling a schema, a category system that can be
						applied to the description of different forms of these relations (section
						4). It lies in the nature of such an approach that we focus on the schematic
						or typological aspects―namely the categories themselves―of the concept and
						only refer to instances, i.e. specific findings of intertextual references
						in single texts or text passages, in the form of examples. At the very basis
						of such an approach lies an evaluation of different formal logics and their
						ability to model the complexities of intertextuality effectively while at
						the same time offer machine readability, i.e. possibilities for standardized
						data acquisition, querying, and reasoning. We argue that description logic,
						as implemented in the context of knowledge graphs of the semantic web, is a
						fitting candidate for these tasks (section 3).</p>
            <p>Focusing on what we call the core of intertextuality (section 4.1-3), we show how different theoretical conceptualizations of intertextuality (e.g. Genette’s “hypertextuality”), that each have a different understanding of text and the level of relations between texts, can be adhered to the general model in order to expand it (section 4.4). Finally we look at a specific example of an analysis from literary studies of the intertextual references in Franz Kafka’s <hi rend="italic">Ein
					Landarzt</hi> and ask how the findings can be modeled according to the specifications of our conceptualization (section 4.5).</p>

               <head>2.1 Classical intertextuality
						theories</head>
               <p>The term
							"intertextuality" was introduced in 1966 by Julia Kristeva when she gave
							a presentation in a course of Roland Barthes. She coined the term in
							order to overcome certain epistemological barriers structuralism had
							been running into since the early 1960s (cf. Dosse 1999). Following
							Michael Bakhtin's analysis of polyphonic novels and his notion of
							dialogism, Kristeva suggests that the characteristic trait of writing is
							"both subjectivity and communication, or better, […] intertextuality"
							(Kristeva 1986, 39). The author or writer is situated in two
							intersubjective or dialogic dimensions: The relation to early writers
							Kristeva calls the vertical dimension, the relation to the reader she
							calls the horizontal dimension. The voices of other authors the writer
							is engaged with and the echos of which are somehow present in his text
							(polyphony), is the central point that leads her to her concept of
							intertextuality. She points out, "any text is constructed as a mosaic of
							quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another.
							The notion of intertextuality replaces that of intersubjectivity, and
							poetic language is read at least as a double" (Kristeva 1986,
						37).</p>
               <p>The notion of
							intertextuality and the mosaic metaphor in this famous passage can be
							taken up by digital humanities, since the "mosaic" can be considered as
							a network: We can see the many delimited, single parts (tesserae, texts,
							nodes) and a bigger picture (the mosaic, the archive, the graph).
							However, other parts of Kristeva's contribution have been discussed
							controversially and also impose bigger challenges to digital humanities.
							Problems start, when the notion of text transcends from delimited texts
							in plural to a whole of a single text (sometimes called a "universal
							text", cf. Pfister 1985, 11f., Ternes 2016, 84-86), where everything
							participates in or rather "is" a universal "intertext." The linguistic
							marker of this transgression is the use of singular "text"―instead of
							‘archive of texts’ etc.―to denote something that is constituted of
							myriads of utterances. At the heart of this transgression is Kristeva’s
							deconstruction of the structuralist binary opposition denotation vs.
							connotation (cf. Kristeva 1986, 40-43), which delivers the foundation of
							inside vs. outside of a text, i.e. its delimitation to other texts (cf.
							Link 1997, 41). The transgressive (universal) notion of intertextuality
							can be found in neo-structuralist and deconstructionist literary
							theories from Barthes to Bloom (cf. Pfister 1985, 11-20).</p>
               <p>The other most influential conception of intertextuality originates from structuralism, too: With his concept of architext and the metaphor of palimpsest Gérard Genette gains back a historical dimension of texts (cf. Dosse 1999, 1.496f.,  2.446f.). His structuralist position is open for the categories of classical rhetorics and he decidedly sets focus on the notion of genre again. In his structuralist conception and as a contrast to a global conception of intertextuality, Genette (1982) describes―also with the aim of a genre typology―“transtextual” references as transformation or imitation of hypertextual text genres. Genette is aware that every literary artifact can more or less remind readers of another artifact. However, he concentrates on the cases, where these references are obvious and asks for the different kinds of categories such relations can belong to. He differentiates five forms of what he calls “transtextuality”: 1. intertextuality through quotations, plagiarism, or allusions, 2. paratextuality, by which he means framings such as title, genre classifications, author's name, etc., 3. metatextuality (i.e., critical commentary), 4. architextuality (i.e., external framings assigned by critics, for example), and 5. hypertextuality, in which a later text (hypertext) is inconceivable without a previous reference text (hypotext). Focussing mostly on the hypertextual conception of transtextuality, Genette on the one hand divides hypertextuality into transformation (James Joyce transforms Homer's <hi rend="italic">Odyssey </hi>in <hi rend="italic">Ulysses</hi>) and imitation (Virgil imitates the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey </hi>in the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>) (cf. Genette 1982, 17). On the other hand he
							further differentiates playful, satirical and serious hypertexts, parody
							and pastiche being playful, travesty and persiflage satirical, and
							transposition and replication being examples of serious
						hypertexts.</p>
               <p>While Genette is aware of the fact that
							intertextual relations can take many different shapes and happen on
							several levels (as mentioned above: text passages, whole works, and
							systems), in his notion of hypertextuality he limits his
							conceptualization in such a way that only one-to-one relations are
							discussed, i.e. literary texts that relate as a whole to another
							hypotext as a whole. An open question is, how these references relate to
							each other on different levels. Additionally, while Kristeva's concept
							of text goes beyond the written text and potentially includes any
							cultural phenomena, Gennette's model of intertextuality is limited to
							written whole texts in the sense of works. Consequently, it is
							permissible to claim that Kristeva's and Genette's conceptions of
							intertextuality form the two ends of a scale: one characterized by
							utmost openness and global claim, the other by over-limitation and
							exclusion of many aspects.</p>
               <p>With regards to Kristeva’s conception of
							(inter)text, also Pfister points out that “a concept that is so
							universal that no alternative to it, not even its negation, is
							imaginable, is necessarily of little heuristic potential for analysis
							and interpretation” (Pfister 1985, 15; our translation). His attempt to
							mediate between the two conceptual poles of intertextuality (global vs.
							specific) thus provides six degrees to scale intertextuality (cf.
							Pfister 1985, 25–30): 1. referentiality, 2. communicativity, 3.
							autoreflexivity, 4. structurality, 5. selectivity, and 6. (with direct
							reference to Bakhtin) dialogicity. (1) The more a text directly
							references a pre-text and thematizes it, the more intertextual it is.
							(2) The more intentional and obviously communicated a reference marker
							is in the text, the stronger the intertextuality. (3) The more a text
							itself reflects on its own intertextual conditionality and relatedness,
							the more intertextual it is. (4) The more fundamentally a pre-text forms
							the structural foil of an entire text, the more intertextual the text
							is. (5) The more concise and pointed the specific reference to a
							concrete pre-text, the stronger the intertextuality (i.e., a quote is
							more intertextual than e.g. an allusion or a systemic reference). (6)
							The stronger the semantic and ideological tension between the original
							and the new context, the stronger the degree of
						intertextuality.</p>
               <p>Closely related to Pfister’s category of
							referentiality is the contribution of text linguistics who described
							surface markers for referencing other texts like quotations (cf. Janich
							2019, 173). Such markers may be detected by text mining methods and thus
							be exploited by digital humanities. Rather studying text types than
							genres, text linguists have also discussed intertextual relations
							between types of texts, i.e. system-to-system-references (cf. Janich
							2019, 184-186).</p>

                  <head>2.2.1 Text reuse</head>
                  <p>In general, methods for automated detection of
								intertextuality can be classified by degree of text relationship
								(understood as only written language) ranging from mere syntactic
								similarity to semantic comparison. In its simplest form,
								simultaneous syntactic pattern matching―i.e. sequence alignment―is a
								well studied technique from bioinformatics. Several tools in digital
								humanities are substantially inspired by this technique.<note> Cf. e.g. TextPAIR (<ref target="https://github.com/ARTFL-Project/text-pair">https://github.com/ARTFL-Project/text-pair</ref>; access: October 24., 2022) or
										Tracer (<ref target="http://www.etrap.eu/research/tracer/">http://www.etrap.eu/research/tracer/</ref>; access: October 24,
								2022).</note> Various syntactic steps in natural language processing can generalize matching―all analyzing the syntactic surface of a text. Intertextuality understood as syntactic similarity between texts can be detected automatically at large scale by means of text reuse analyses (cf. Bär et al. 2012; Bär et al. 2015). Intertextuality understood as text reuse can be defined as a “more or less objective recognizable, explicit reference on the surface of the text” (Burghardt and Liebl 2020, our translation), which leaves out many aspects and categories of intertextuality research that go beyond direct or indirect quotations.</p>
                  <p>More elaborated digital methods towards
								intertextuality take semantics into account. In the context of
								intertextuality the notion of semantics applies on various levels of
								text components: words, sentences, and whole texts have their own
								meanings. As far as semantics is taken into account in digital text
								reuse methods, it so far seems to be restricted to
							<hi rend="italic">lexical
								semantics</hi> and <hi rend="italic">distributional
								semantics</hi>. In lexical semantics
								relations like synonyms, hyponyms, and antonyms are identified by
								humans and manually organized in lexical knowledge bases like
								wordnet. In distributional semantics word semantics is basically
								derived from statistical analysis of word co-occurrence of huge text
								corpora (e.g. Wikipedia). With the breakthrough of machine learning,
								this approach became very popular and led to the so-called word
								embedding method whose most prominent implementation was word2vec.
								The basic idea is to represent words as points in a vector space
								such that distances and directions in this space correspond to
								semantic relations (cf. Burghardt and Liebl 2020).</p>

                  <head>2.2.2 Semantic relations between
							texts</head>
                  <p>One way to go beyond this is to use latent
								semantic indexing (LSI), an unsupervised algorithm from the
								Gensim<note> Cf. <ref target="http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/intro.html">http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/intro.html</ref> (access: October 14, 2022).</note> framework, to try to model semantic-thematic intertextual references between source and reference texts. This was exemplarily exercised by Scheirer et al. (2016). Similarly to latent dirichlet allocation, LSI models textual semantics by looking for statistical co-occurrence patterns. Differently from bag-of-word approaches however, it offers the possibility to compare definable units (i.e. singular text passages) with each other instead of whole texts which makes it particularly useful for research in literary studies beyond distant reading or macroanalysis that, e.g., aims at finding intertextual relations between singular phrases or verses of smaller text corpora. While Scheirer et al. (2016, 215) emphasize “that LSI can be used to detect intertextual relationships of meaning where few or no words are shared by the two texts,” the approach, however, still remains under-complex from the point of view of literary studies and theories of intertextuality in that there is no specific concept or model of intertextuality applied.</p>

                  <head>2.2.3 Complex formalizations of
							intertextuality</head>
                  <p>Independent of how intertextuality could be automatically detected (if at all) is the question of how to formalize intertextuality such that computers potentially can process formalized entities of intertextuality. The mentioned approaches to “text reuse” were largely technology-driven in order to meet tool-specific requirements. The opposite approach is to design a model or formalism that comes close to the theoretical notion of intertextuality in the humanities. First steps are taken by Schlupkothen and Nantke (2019) who conceive intertextuality as an interpretive phenomenon and attempt to represent analytic-interpretive reading practices in the formalism of situation theory. Situations are basic concepts in this theory which allows us to express predications―so-called <hi rend="italic">infons</hi>―to hold only within a certain region of time
								and space. Moreover, situations themselves can be objects of infons
								such that one can formalize statements like “Along that conversation
								I recognized that Peter believed that …” Classical logic does not
								provide such means of reification and hence makes it rather
								difficult if not impossible to express some sort of truth conveying.

Isn't intertextuality rather a productive thing, that adds features by relation?</p>

            <head> The twofold task of formalization:
					expressiveness and efficiency of formal methods</head>
            <p>Whether a specific logic is
						suitable to formalize a certain domain of interest depends on what you aim
						to do with the formalized representation of your domain. What makes
						formalization attractive in scientific context in general is its clarity or
						precision due to its strict and syntactically easy language and its well
						defined mechanisms of reasoning: Once a domain is formalized, questions in
						that formalism can be posed to it and their answers do not depend anymore on
						meaning or vague arguments, but on proof of a sound calculus.<note> As Leibniz's famous phrase goes: "[...] if controversies were to arise, there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two calculators. For it would suffice for them to take their pencils in their hands and to sit down at the abacus, and say to each other: Calculemus." Leibniz (1875–1890) p. 200; the translation has been adopted from https://​en.​wikiquote.​org/​wiki/​Gottfried_​Leibniz.</note> Of course, developing an appropriate formal model of the domain of interest remains the actual challenge that always has to face criticism.</p>
            <p>Concerning the suitability of the choice of a certain formalism two aspects are considered particularly relevant in practice: Its <hi rend="italic">expressiveness</hi> and its <hi rend="italic">computability</hi>. A logic L¹ is said to be more expressive than a logic L² if any statement expressible in L² can also be expressed in L¹  but not the other way around. The computability of a logic addresses the capability of an associated calculus to compute the truth value of a given statement or to derive new valid statements from existing valid statements. In practice, though, what matters even more is <hi rend="italic">efficiency</hi>, i.e. the question of how efficient such
						computations can be performed in terms of processing time and memory
						space.<note> Whereby the difference is not in the range milliseconds, but between a few milliseconds and hours.</note> As a rule of thumb it can be said that the more expressive a formal logic is the more expensive is its reasoning. Hence, the choice of logic is necessarily a trade off between expressiveness and efficiency determined by the application requirements and their respective priorities. In the following we discuss the most relevant requirements to make explicit why and to what extent formalization matters for our current purpose.</p>
            <p>Concerning expressiveness,
						being able to express relationships (at least for binary relations) is
						certainly a fundamental requirement, since the notion of intertextuality
						inherently indicates a notion of relationship―namely between texts
						(independent of the notion of text itself). We also want to be able to
						classify the items that are subject of intertextuality, as we want to be
						able to talk more specifically than just about a very general notion of
						text. For instance, we want to differentiate between text segments, text as
						a whole, or text systems like e.g. genre. Similarly different kinds of
						intertextual relationships will be identified and these will be defined on
						the just mentioned specific item classes. Moreover, classes and
						relationships frequently are organized hierarchically, i.e. we need a notion
						of subclass (e.g. epitext is a subclass of paratext) and subrelation
						(hypertextuality is a subrelation of intertextuality―or transtextuality in
						Genette’s terms). These general requirements already exclude e.g.
						propositional logic as a formalism in that it does not provide any means to
						express relationships..</p>
            <p>As far as expressive power is concerned, first order
						logic would be a sufficient formalism for our purpose.<note> The well-defined semantic of predicate logic is the so-called model-theoretic Tarski Semantic. It should be mentioned, though, that modeling natural language in predicate logic is not the only approach to provide it with a well defined semantic. There have been various formalisms developed with that goal in mind. One of the most prominent and elaborated is the Montague grammar. However, these formalisms are too elaborated in the sense that they are not tractable for computation.</note> Unfortunately it is undecidable whether a first order logic formula is provable.<note>As worked out in  Alan Turing’s groundbreaking article  <hi rend="italic">On Computable Numbers, with an
								Application to the
							“Entscheidungsproblem”</hi> in 1936.</note> In other words: If we express two statements A and B  in first order logic and claim that B is derivable from A then there is no algorithm that could prove this claim in any case of A and B.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, we can restrict ourselves to a subset of
						the first order logic―namely to constants, unary, and binary
						predicates―without sacrificing the expressive power that we need. A first
						order logic with this restriction corresponds directly to description logic
						(DL). The reader may consult standard literature for a gentle introduction
						into this logic.<note> For this correspondence see Baader et al. 2003.</note> For the sake of brevity a simplistic example in such restricted logic may serve as illustration:</p>
            <list rend="bulleted">
               <item>Text(a) ∧ Text(b)
							∧ partOf(a,b)<note> This statement says that there exist two texts, a and b, and a is part of b. ∧ is the "and" operator in logic.</note>
               </item>
               <item>∀a,b,c.  partOf(a,b) ∧ relatedTo(b,c) ⇒ relatedTo(a,c)<note> This statement says that if a is part of b, and b is related to c, then a is also related to c. ∀ (pronounced "for all") is a quantifier in logic.</note>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The important point from a practical point of view is
						that there is a web conform implementation of the theoretical framework of
						description logic called Web Ontology Language (OWL)<note> Cf. latest W3C recommendation: <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-rdf-based-semantics/">https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-rdf-based-semantics/</ref> (access: December 05, 2023).</note> that is machine processable by various knowledge base systems and reasoners.<note> For a list of knowledge base systems see e.g.: <ref target="https://www.w3.org/wiki/SparqlImplementations">https://www.w3.org/wiki/SparqlImplementations</ref>and reasoners see e.g.: <ref target="http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tools/list-of-reasoners/">http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tools/list-of-reasoners/</ref> (access: December 05, 2023).</note>

            <head> In search of the core of
					intertextuality</head>
            <div>
               <head>4.1 A common denominator of intertextuality
						theories?</head>
               <p>While there are many
							theoretical designs of intertextuality around, they share a common
							conceptual core: Intertextuality is about relations between texts. This
							common denominator is obviously contained in the two lexical
							constituents of the neologism, in ‘inter’ and ‘text’. The third
							morphological component of inter-text-uality is a derivational morpheme
							which goes back to -alitas and -alité, respectively, of Romance
							morphology. Let's take this morphological analysis as a starting point
							to crystallize the common core of the various concepts of
							intertextuality and to get the foundation of its formalization.</p>
               <p>The analysis of lexical
							morphemes may seem trivial at first, but the theoretical consequences
							are not. ‘Inter’, i.e. ‘between’ (also: 'among' as in "primus inter
							pares" or 'while'), is a local preposition that can be transferred to
							temporal and other relations. It presupposes (at least) two distinct
							objects. This is still true if their exact boundaries become
							indeterminable and distinguishing the related objects becomes
							problematic. E.g., if in Latin "inter canem et lupum" is a metaphor for
							the hour when dogs and wolves cannot be distinguished, that is, for
							dusk, (cf. Georges 1913, 8.942) then dog and wolf, domesticated and
							wild, day and night, nevertheless remain distinguished in order to set
							up and set in motion the game of indistinguishability in the continuum
							between species, characteristics, and times. If we transfer the local
							preposition ‘inter’ to texts, here, too, their distinctness is the
							condition of the possibility of speaking of ‘inter’. In a
							phenomenological regard, distinguishing two texts is without problems:
							two codices, two rotula, two sheets of paper, etc. However, in a
							structural sense, which is of more interest here, distinguishing texts
							relies on processing a text's inside-outside difference, which is
							described by the opposition of denotation and connotation. "Denotates
							are all signifiers whose signifiers belong to the set of text-signs and
							which fit the context of the text" (Link 1997, 41; our translation).
							Connotates, on the other hand, are not direct, not notated in the text.
							Unsurprisingly, Kristeva has started her deconstruction of structural
							fundamental oppositions right here and tries to subvert binarity through
							a continuum. The morpheme 'inter' sets focus on that intermediate area
							which is not one and not the other. Genette has perhaps not
							coincidentally focused on a different local preposition and thus a
							different spatial logic: ‘trans’, engl. ‘beyond’ and ‘across’, does not
							direct the focus to the intermediate area, but introduces a
							directionality and with the beyond also a deictic center: Here one text
							refers to the other. And this seems to be precisely what is often meant
							by the study of the intertextual relations of a text to other texts.
							Even if intertextuality and transtextuality, with their prepositional
							morphemes, are certainly not as "transparent and self-explanatory"
							(Adamzik 2004, 96; our translation) on close inspection as some authors
							think, both approaches have the same denominator: They describe
							relations between texts that can be distinguished.</p>
               <p>Opinions differ on the
							second lexical morpheme of the neologism, ‘text.’ All theories of
							intertextuality naturally speak of text. Which concept is hidden behind
							the word, the theories sometimes differ considerably. Even within a
							theory, the word is used to refer to different concepts or different
							aspects of a concept. According to Kristeva, "everything, or at least
							every cultural system and every cultural structure" (Pfister 1985, 7)
							can be understood as text. At the same time, she also uses the word
							"text" in the very concrete sense of a written text (such as a
							particular novel). It is this very concrete notion of text that we place
							at the beginning of our formalization. We simply write T, a parameter to
							be bound to a more theoretically refined concept later.</p>
               <p>The third morphological
							constituent of the neologism, the derivational morpheme, -ality, -alité,
							-alitas, -al-i-tas, -al (adjectival) and -tas (substantival), determines
							what intertextuality is taken for. It indicates a passage through a
							twofold change of part of speech, the distortion of a property into
							something that exists, into substance. On the one hand, this
							substantializing morphology―as in nation-al-i-ty, re-al-i-ty,
							relation-al-i-ty, etc.―may be seen as the reason for the misery of
							intertextuality theories. On the other hand, a valuable clue to a common
							core emerges here as well: we use the word intertextuality in fact more
							like a substantive noun, and when we quantify it, we do not speak of
							two, five, or a hundred intertextualities, but, as with water, we add
							one more unit and speak of two, five, or a hundred intertextuality
							relations.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>4.2 Formalizing the core of intertextual
						relations semi-formally</head>
               <p>We can now proceed to formalize the core of
							intertextuality, i.e. firstly the relations between distinguishable
							entities and secondly a category system of entity types that can be
							connected by these relations. We first write the intertextual relation
							as a function between two T as in Frege's term logic:</p>
               <p>intertextualRelation’(T, T)</p>
               <p>Frege suggested such functional notations in order
							to formalize assertions expressed in natural language.<note> See Frege 1879 and Frege 1893/1903. An introductory example for the functional notation is the formal analysis of the sentence “John is happy”. It is an assertion about the individual John using the general pattern “() is happy”, which is a unary function. In functional notation the sentence thus is written as H(j) or happy(John). See Zalta 2022.</note> They can express natural verbs with an arbitrary arity. We could re-translate the formula to the language pattern ‘text 1 and text 2 are intertextually related.’ However, this pattern with a plural subject is not exactly what we want. The parameters have a positional order and this means that the relation is directed. From a purely formal point of view, there might be no point in introducing direction. However, with regard to the domain of intertextuality, there indeed is: Intertextuality has been introduced not to describe any formally possible relation, but to approach the historical dimension of texts and their inherently secondary status (cf. Kristeva 1986; Genette 1982). Thus, we say that an intertextual relation points in an anti-chronological direction from a later text to an earlier text (an avant text).<note> The anti-chronological assumption even holds true in cases, where it is undecidable which text comes earlier. We further acknowledge – but are for the current philological case not interested in – other possible worlds, such as contra-factual or imaginary ones, in which a future text influences a prior one.</note> So we bind the formula to the following language patterns: ‘There is an intertextual relation from text 1 to text 2’ or ‘text 1 has an intertextual relation to text 2.’</p>
               <p>Again, such an existential proposition (‘there
							is’) is not exactly what we want to come out with, since it does not
							give us a means to further reference the relation, the existence of
							which we stated. Thus, we introduce the term i, which denotes an
							instance of an intertextual relation and we rewrite the function as
							follows:</p>
               <p>intertextualRelation(i, T, T, …)</p>
               <p>Say: “i is an intertextual relation from text 1 to text 2.” We can also put the natural language representation in a more formal way, where we use relative clauses for every parameter following i: “i is an intertextual relation <hi rend="italic">which</hi> refers to ‘here’ in text 1 <hi rend="italic">and
						which</hi> refers to ‘there’ in text 2.” This form of defining relative clauses will help us later to rewrite the statement in other formal systems.</p>
               <p>Since this is obviously not all we want to be able
							to express, the formula currently allows an indefinite number of further
							parameters represented by points. We now try to define at least two
							other parameters or parameter classes.</p>
               <p>A major requirement is to further specify the
							intertextual relation. One text may be a copy, a travesty, etc., of the
							other. We note this specification as another parameter S. Some kind of
							specification must be made by an annotator. Because a specification may
							be made not only in one respect, but possibly in several respects, we
							note S+ for a non-empty set of such specifications.</p>
               <p>intertextualRelation(i, T, T, S+, ...)</p>
               <p>We also introduce the parameter set M* for
							mediators of the relation:</p>
               <p>intertextualRelation(i, T, T, S+, M*,
						...)</p>
               <p>Introducing mediators may appear a bit
							intransparent. Examples of mediation instances are provided by Genette's
							class of hypertextual relations. Here, each single intertextual relation
							between hypo- and hypertext is mediated by the works as a whole and by a
							paratextual signal which inaugurates the relation between the works as a
							whole. Mediators are also important for a whole class of intertextual
							relations: relations not marked in the referring text but established
							predominantly by the reader. For such a reception-aesthetically
							established intertextual relation, the situation of the recipient is to
							be regarded as a mediator. Another function of mediators is expressing
							transitivity: One intertextual relation can be the mediator of another
							intertextual relation. This way, transitive relations can be
							represented.</p>

                  <head>4.3.1 Formalizing in predicate logic
							and RDF</head>
                  <p>We used Fregeian functional semi-formal
								notation as an intermediate step towards a formalism with a well
								defined semantics. In section 3 we gave reasons in favor of
								description logic as a suitable formalism which in turn is the
								underlying formalism of the Web Ontology Language also known as
								OWL/RDF.
						</p>
                  <p>Since all these formalisms come up with
								different notations,<note> There exist various alternative notations even within RDF: RDF/XML, JSON-LD, Turtle, Manchester Syntax, Functional Syntax etc. We will opt sometimes for the so-called turtle syntax as it is one of the best human readable or JSON-LD as it is very common nowadays e.g. in the Web Annotation Data Model.</note> we stick to one which we consider the most widespread―namely classical predicate logic―and only present a few translations to other formalisms for the purpose of demonstration.</p>
                  <p>Predicate logic symbols we need to modell
								intertextuality (as motivated in section 4.2.) are: the logical
								symbol “∧” for “and” and the quantifiers “∀” for “all” and “∃” for “some”. For constants and variables we use lower case letters optionally with an index. For unary predicates we use uppercase words and for binary predicates we use lowercase words.<note> The rationale behind this convention is the corresponding best practice in OWL.</note>
                  </p>
                  <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>unary predicates:

									specifiedBy, mediatedBy</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The expression “IntertextualRelation(x)” then
								reads as “x is an instance of an intertextual relation” and
								similarly for Reference, IntertextualSpecification, and Mediator.
								The expression “here(x,y)” reads as “x relates here to y” and
								similarly for there, specifiedBy, mediatedBy. The sentence “i is an
								instance of intertextual relation that refers here to t1 and there
								to t2 and is specified by s and mediated by m” thus translates to
								the predicate logic expression:</p>
                  <p>IntertextualRelation(i) ∧ here(i,
								t1) ∧ there(i, t2) ∧ specifiedBy(i, s) mediatedBy(i, m) ∧
								Reference(t1) ∧ Reference(t2) ∧ IntertextualSpecification(s) ∧
								Mediator(m)</p>
                  <p>We exemplify how this translates to RDF in

                  <p>Not any arbitrary expression using these symbols, however, reflects our notion of intertextuality. Informally summarized constraints are: Every instance of intertextual relation must have exactly one here reference and exactly one there reference. Moreover, it must have at least one intertextual relation specification (specifiedBy) and it may rely on one or more mediators
								(mediatedBy). In mathematical terms<note>
									The mathematically less inclined

										idea of constraint formulated in the sentence
									above.</note> this means here and there are <hi rend="italic">functions</hi> assigning to each instance of intertextual relation an instance of reference.

									(access: December 2,
								2022).</note> (WADM) is a framework that fits quite well to our formalization of intertextuality. The basic idea of WADM is to express a relation between one object called body and another called target by a third object called the annotation as depicted in Figure 1.</p>

                  <p>Body and target can be any resource in the world wide web like hypertext pages, images, videos, audio streams, etc. Moreover, the model allows not just to reference a web resource like a web page as whole, but also fragments thereof. To this end the model offers the concept of <hi rend="italic">selectors </hi>for various media types, e.g. XPath
								constructs for XML like documents (typically HTML, but also SVG),
								offset for raw text, data positions for bitstreams, etc.<note> The INTRO ontology mentioned above is  rather restricted in this respect. With selectors, intertextuality can be represented as a network of texts instead of "only" as a network of excerpts. One of the strengths of INTRO, however, is its integration into foundational ontologies such as CIDOC-CRM and FRBR.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How does WADM fit to our formalization of
								intertextuality?<note> For the sake of coherence, we do not adopt the JSON-LD notation used in the specification of the Web Annotation Data Model, but translate them to RDF-Turtle notation. In fact the specification does not enforce the usage of JSON-LD, but just prefers this format as serialization to show examples of the model. For our purpose we prefer RDF-Turtle notation. Note that both are just serialization formats of RDF.</note> A principle about the intended relationship between body and target is: “The content of the Body resources is related to, and typically "about", the content of the Target resources.”<note> Cf. <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#web-annotation-principles">https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#web-annotation-principles</ref> (access: December 04, 2022).</note> Our understanding of the word “about” in this statement is that the body is on a meta level whereas the target is on the object level with respect to the annotation. We also find the distinction of meta and object level in our conceptualization of intertextuality: The instances of Reference are on the object level whereas the instances of IntertextualSpecification and Mediator are on the meta level. Hence, we interpret our Reference as either a target or body in WADM. More specifically this implies that our here and there predicates should be interpreted as hasTarget in WADM. And on the meta level we have an analogous interpretation of specifiedBy and mediatedBy as hasBody in WADM. Finally, corresponding to the Annotation in WADM our IntertextualRelation is the link between object and target level. We can thus formalize our interpretation in RDF-Turtle notation:</p>

               <head>4.4 Ontological specializations</head>
               <p>The core ontology developed so far does not force its users to follow certain theoretical concepts: it is theory-agnostic in its core. However, this core ontology should be extendable with specializations of core concepts such that specific theoretical concepts can be expressed. </p>
               <p>We deliberately designed our core ontology so that any theoretic specific aspects can be encapsulated in the specialization of our three core concepts:  Reference, IntertextualSpecification and Mediator. The following three subsections demonstrate as a
							proof of concept how this can be done in the case of Genette's theory of
							hypertextuality.</p>
               <div>
                  <head>4.4.1 Text as specialization of
							Reference</head>
                  <p>At its core, the formalization has not introduced a notion of text. We first used the parameter T to postpone the definition and later we used the class Reference to define the range of here and there but to keep its concept open at the same time. One might object that a user might reference a film and an image and state that they are intertextually related, but that no text is involved in this relation. However, one can think of a theory of intertextuality based on a wider concept of text that allows its application in such a case. We can now: (1) further restrict the application of IntertextualRelation to instances where here and there are texts in a more decided notion or (2) leave this open. The first option would make the ontology unusable for more general theories of text and intertextual relations. The latter might cause inconsistent ontologies in the light of more restrictive theories of text and its relations. A compromise is, however, to keep the definition of text out of the abstract basic ontology and put it into their own namespaces which can be used if wanted or needed. </p>
                  <p>The extension for text suggested here has two aspects: a) restrict the applicability of IntertextualRelation to relations between texts, b) further differentiate the notion of text. For either task we introduce the unary predicate Text. The restriction task a) is quite simple with the notations from above. We further restrict the range of here and there to Text:</p>
                  <p>E1: range(here, Text)E2: range(there,
								Text)</p>
                  <p>Task b) involves more conceptual work and it is where the semantic load of this extension originates from. The research and theories around concepts of intertextuality made it possible to differentiate three different levels on which relations can appear. These levels not only apply to text, but to other artifacts to: (1) the <hi rend="italic">systemic</hi> level of for example genres, epochs, styles, etc., (2) the level of complete <hi rend="italic">works</hi>, i.e. texts, music pieces or art works as a whole, and (3) the level of <hi rend="italic">segments</hi>, i.e. text passages, music sequences or
								sections of art works. Before formalization, we should briefly hint
								upon difficulties that may come with conceptions of system, work,
								and segments in their own rights.</p>
                  <p>The differentiation between single text
								relations and systemic relations stems from theoretical
								considerations by Pfister (1985, 53f.). The notion of system,
								however, is conceivably unrestricted. As problematic as notions of
								genre, epoch, literary style or school, etc. themselves, so is a
								conception between (textual) systems. It is undeniable, however,
								that single text passages, texts as a whole or even literary systems
								can and do relate to (other) literary systems in one way or the
								other. It thus seems the right approach to face the vagueness and
								also integrate the system level of intertextuality into our
								formalization in order to make it possible to record these kinds of
								connections, too.</p>
                  <p>With regards to the notion of complete works, the question of unity that especially arises from the possibility of compiling texts can be problematized, too: Is Proust's <hi rend="italic">À la Recherche du Temps
								Perdu</hi> a text, or is the volume <hi rend="italic">Du Côté de chez
							Swann</hi> a complete text in its own right? We do not make any decisions in this regard, but leave it up to the specific model usage to decide which units are taken as a text. In doing so, we only presuppose that agreement can be reached about the self-containedness.</p>
                  <p>In contrast to system and work, we speak of a text passage or segment if the beginning and end of this passage lie within a text, but are not identical with the text itself. Equivalent to the vague notion of text as a whole, the question as to what constitutes a segment is fluid: <hi rend="italic">Du Côté de chez
							Swann</hi> can be considered to be a work or a segment, depending on individual decisions, theoretical background, or annotation guidelines.</p>
                  <p>To formalize this, we introduce three unary predicates System, Work, and Segment. They are a partition of the set of Artifacts, i.e. an artifact is either a system, a work, or a segment. </p>
                  <p>E3: Artifact =
								System ⊍ Work ⊍ Segment</p>

                  <p>We can specialize the concept of artifacts and its partition to the domain of Text as Text is a subset of Artifact, too. A work can be a text, but it need not
								be. The partition of the set of artifacts into systems, works and
								segments applies to texts, too. We define:</p>
                  <p>E4: SingleText =
								Text ∩ WorkE5: TextSegment = Text ∩ SegmentE6: TextGenre =
								Text ∩ System</p>
                  <p>Since Text is a subset of Artifact and System, Work and Segment are a partition of Artifact, the following is true:</p>

                  <p>Analogously we could specialize the domain of artifacts to the domain of music, art, and further cultural domains. We call these cultural domains the <hi rend="italic">horizontal

								theories differ in this aspect even more than in different notions
								of Text (as discussed above). Difference does not necessarily imply
								contradiction, though. More often, it means a more or less
								independent refinement or granularity of concepts where different
								theories focus on different aspects of their subjects. To test the
								adequacy of our formalization approach, we formalize a tiny part of
								a single theory as a sample. To this end we choose Genette’s (1982;
								our translation) concept of hypertextuality:</p>

                  <p>This is only a basic formalization. An exhaustive one would have to declare or at least discuss constraints for these six categories since Genette introduces them as relations between whole texts (instances of SingleText) which are established and mediated by
								paratextual signals like the title of a work.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>4.4.3 Specific mediators</head>
                  <p>We also want to give some hints towards the formalization of mediators for intertextual relations. At the time of writing, there seems to be no system of mediators, but a variety of mediator types. To define such a mediator type, we declare it to be a <hi rend="italic">subset</hi> of Mediator. For example following Genette’s notion of hypertextuality, intertextual relations between Joyce’s <hi rend="italic">Ulysses </hi>and Homer’s <hi rend="italic">Odyssey </hi>are mediated by the title of Joyce’s novel,
								which is a paratextual signal. Another example may be motives or
								even subject matters or forms. The motive “horses in a pigsty”, for
								example, can serve as a mediator for an intertextual relation
								between a text by Kafka and others.<note> The example stems from a non-digital analysis of intertextuality in literary studies by Borgstedt (2010); cf. section 4.5, too.</note> The formalization task for such a case is (a) to declare a Motive to be a subset (subclass) of Mediator and then make HorsesInAPigsty an element (instance) of this set. Let’s
								write some such definitions down in RDF/Turtle:</p>
                  <p>@prefix m: &lt;https://intertextuality.org/extensions/motives#&gt; . </p>
                  <p>@prefix pt: &lt;https://intertextuality.org/extensions/genette/paratext#&gt; . </p>
                  <p>@prefix rdfs:

                  <p>m:Motive rdfs:subClassOf
								:Mediator .m:HorsesInAPigsty a m:Motive
								.pt:ParatextualSignal rdfs:subClassOf :Mediator .pt:Title
								a pt:ParatextualSignal .</p>
                  <p>We should emphasize
								that we start putting assertions about individuals into the
								ontology<note> In description logic it is common to call the set of all statements about individuals (e.g. instances of a class) <hi rend="italic">ABox</hi> and those about classes and properties <hi rend="italic">TBox</hi>. In less formal contexts “ontology”
										means
								“TBox.”</note> here: Making HorsesInAPigsty an instance of Motive is an assertion. Title is a similar case which one could say a lot about, e.g. how to annotate the title as a text segment with web annotations or about its relation to dublin core’s title.</p>
                  <p>We also add a
								mediator type, that may look strange at first:</p>
                  <p>:IntertextualRelation
								rdfs:subClassOf :Mediator .</p>
                  <p>Regarding the
								structure of our data, this makes intertextual relations a recursive
								datatype. Regarding the implied semantics, it enables us to record
								sets of transitive intertextual relations, where one relation is
								mediated by another intertextual relation or a set of other
								relations, that are again mediated by other intertextual
								relations.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>4.5 An example</head>
               <p>We choose a rather complex example to demonstrate the expressive power of our formalizations. In an article about intertextuality in Franz Kafka’s <hi rend="italic">Der
							Landarzt</hi>, Thomas Borgstedt analyzes a text with a kind of paradoxical intertextuality: It was classified as intertextually poor on the one hand. On the other hand obvious intertextual relations have been perceived for a long time, but scholars did not provide interpretations. One of these well known intertextual relations Borgstedt deals with is the scene with the horses in the pigsty. The scene is said to be reminiscent of the scene in Heinrich von Kleist’s <hi rend="italic">Michael Kohlhaas</hi>, where Kohlhaas’ horses were ill-treated and
							housed in a pigsty. The relation has long been described as a taking up
							of the motive of horses in a pigsty. This can be recorded straight
							forward:<note> We use a quick and dirty hack to give a specification for the intertextual relation, which we cannot really define (_undefSpec) due to lack of information in Borgstedt (2010). If Borgstedt had used our ontology, he would have had to be more explicit about the type of the relation.</note>

               <p>But that is only the well known part of the relation. Borgstedt also adds a relation to Homer who’s echo he thereby includes in Kafka’s text. The analogy between horses and goats reminds him of the verse of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, where Automedon, with the horses of Achilles,
							plummets into the goats (Iliad XVII.460). We record this without writing

               <p>Finally, there also is
							the transitive intertextual relation from Kafka to Homer, at least
							according to Borgstedt:</p>
               <p>ex:itr3 a :IntertextualRelation ; :here ex:landarztPigsty ;
							:there ex:iliadAutomedonsPlummet ; :specifiedBy _undefSepc ;

               <p>This shows that even
							complex chains of intertextual relations, chains of readers’
							reminiscences, can be recorded with the formalization presented
							here.</p>

            <head> Conclusion and outlook</head>
            <p>The goal of the current
						article was not to offer an algorithmic detector of intertextual relations
						in corpora of texts, but to suggest a theory- as well as domain-driven
						formalized category system that allows intertextuality researchers to
						annotate relations between text passages, works, or systems in a structured,
						general as well as specific and expandable way. The formal core we developed
						is based on predicate and description logic and was modeled with regards to
						the Web Annotation Data Model. This allows for (a) connections to web-based
						RDF knowledge graphs and thus possibilities of automated reasoning on the
						level of categories, i.e. the TBox in semantic web vocabulary, as well as
						(b) extensions towards specific theories of intertextuality which usually
						come with a certain definition of the notion of “text.” Reasons for this
						form of modeling the concept were computability, expressiveness, and
						efficiency on one side, and the impression on the other side that the global
						applicability and the allowance of unary and binary predicates of
						description logic make it a suitable candidate for the formalization of a
						concept that genuinely deals with relations between at least two objects.
						Two main conceptual aspects of what we framed as the core of intertextuality
						are the directedness of intertextual references and with it the inherent
						chronologic dimension: later texts refer to earlier texts. Leaving out the
						chronology of intertextual references (e.g. texts being related by a common
						motive, topic or structure independent of their temporal situatedness) would
						make it impossible to have a ‘here’ and ‘there’ and the relations would not
						be directed anymore. As a consequence, the whole formalization would have to
						be transformed quite fundamentally.</p>
            <p>The suggested formalization
						serves as a starting point for further research and elaboration: theorists
						of intertextuality on the one hand can sharpen their concepts through it by
						further refining and specializing the proposed model or by clearly
						delineating their own concepts. To have a core of intertextuality as a
						common denominator of intertextuality theories moreover is able to connect
						the different theories and shed light on possible paths between them.
						Practitioners of intertextuality on the other hand are provided with an
						(extensible) model to identify intertextuality in a structured way and to
						analyze it (e.g., by means of network/graph visualization and analysis, or
						by a synoptic comparison of text passages with intertextual
					reference).</p>
            <p>The theoretical foundation
						should subsequently serve as the basis for the architecture and design of a
						research environment that allows researchers both to further develop or
						adapt the model in specific intertextuality research projects as well as to
						explore intertextual relations in a corpus that has been annotated on the
						basis of this model. We believe that a core formalization of intertextuality
						has great potential―once it will be embedded into a low-threshold work
						environment―to be actually taken up by many researchers worldwide so that a
						global knowledge graph of manually selected and established intertextual
						relations can emerge as a result of a shared research task.</p>
