                  >https://hands-on-reading.atnu.ncl.ac.uk/login</ref>), a web app that explores the
               interconnections between digital reading and writing. The app was created as part of
               the AHRC-funded project <title rend="quotes">Manuscripts after Print c.1450-1550:
                  Producing and Reading Books during Technological Change,</title> which ran at
               Newcastle University between February 2019 and July 2020. It was initially designed
               to enable the project to ask two crucial questions: why does handwriting have an
               enduring relevance in a digital age; can a more hands-on approach to reading lead to
               a deeper engagement with a digital text? However, as this paper will show, the
               creation and testing of this app also raised a number of conceptual issues and
               technical challenges of broader relevance to the DH community, relating in particular
               to the question of whether reading and writing practices can be translated to the

            <head>Introduction: Background and Concept</head>
            <p>The initial concept of a digital reading and handwriting app stemmed from an interest
               in exploring the endurance and adaptability of handwriting in response to
               technological change. Before the invention of the printing press, writing a text by
               hand was the dominant means of producing a book. The scribes employed to undertake
               this task copied out texts slowly and carefully and, as a result, were usually their
               first readers. This task gave them an intimate and detailed understanding of the
               text. The invention of print changed the craft of book production. The mechanical
               processes of the press meant that printed books did not look like handwritten
               manuscripts although, in a close parallel to e-readers with page-flip features,
               printers tried to copy the handwritten book format as closely as they could.
               Nonetheless, scribes were aware of the differences between manuscripts and print,
               caused by the mechanics of the press, as were the patrons who commissioned manuscript
               copies, and scribes swiftly began to incorporate features of print into their
               manuscripts <ptr target="#nafde2020"/>. By the late sixteenth century, scribes were
               producing manuscripts that could have been mistaken for printed books. This change in
               scribal practice disrupts the linear narrative of supersession that often accompanies
               the invention of a new technology: that the new technology at first supplements and
               then eventually supplants the older technology (the German abbot, Johannes
               Trithemius, for example, wrote of his fear that print would eventually destroy
               manuscripts <ptr target="#trithemius1494"/>). But this linear narrative does not take
               into account that the older technology also adapts and changes in response to the
               new. This is particularly the case with handwriting, which has adapted through
               several technological changes. The Hands-On Reading app leverages handwriting’s
               adaptability to explore the relationship between digital reading and digital writing. </p>
            <p>The digital revolution has prompted a renewed interest in handwriting and its place
               in a multimedia world. In addition to the popular resurgence of calligraphy, there
               has been substantial experimentation in digital handwriting tools: from the
               integration of styluses with existing touchscreen technologies to the development of
               dedicated hardware and software solutions (e.g. Remarkable, Kaligo, Moleskine Smart
               Writing, the handwriting to text conversion tools built into some mobile phones and
               tablets). Unlike the majority of these commercial products, however, the development
               of Hands-On Reading was informed by a familiarity with medieval manuscript culture
               and, in particular, its blurring of the boundaries between scribe and reader. This
               allows us to better explore the relationship between writing and reading. </p>
            <p>The project was also informed by an awareness of different modes of reading and the
               possibilities they offer. Since the late 1990s, a growing body of research has
               explored the varying ways in which readers approach printed and digital texts, as
               well as the broader impact of digital culture on the evolution of reading practices.
               For all their advantages, it is generally acknowledged that digital texts tend to
               encourage swift reading at the expense of contemplative analysis. Recent research has
               found that university students who access texts in digital form are less likely to
               take detailed notes or employ other study strategies <ptr target="#schugar2011"/>;
               they excel in identifying and recalling the information needed to answer concrete
               questions, yet they are outperformed by peers who read in print when it comes to
               abstract questions that require inferential reasoning <ptr target="#kaufman2016"/>.
               These findings have prompted a renewed interest in the value of <q>active
                  reading,</q> whereby readers engage in critical or evaluative thinking as they
               read a text, often simultaneously taking notes – a practice familiar to any
               medievalist who has encountered heavily annotated manuscripts or early printed books.
               Yet such scholars will also be familiar with another form of reading prevalent in the
               Middle Ages: the slow reading of scribes, who copied texts word by word from an
               exemplar, and were therefore constrained to read them at a measured and regular pace,
               with all the time this task afforded for unhurried reflection. We wanted to use the
               app to explore the potential value of this process of slow reading within a digital
               context, and to assess how it influenced readers’ perceptions of and responses to the
               digital text.</p>
            <p>Development of the app brought together a team with significantly varied expertise.
               The project’s PI and RA shared research interests in medieval reading and handwriting
               practices, familiar with DH research tools though primarily from an end-user
               perspective. The involvement of researchers affiliated with Animating Text Newcastle
               University (ATNU), a collaboration between the Faculty of Humanities and Social
               Sciences and Newcastle University’s Digital Institute, brought specific expertise in
               the application of DH techniques to textual editing. Engagement with the broader
               public and creative practitioners such as professional calligraphers was central to
               the project, allowing investigation of contemporary trends in reading and writing and
               perceptions of how reading and writing practices might change in the future. The
               day-to-day development of the app was accomplished by research software engineers
               with extensive experience of both commercial and academic software development. This
               combination of perspectives was crucial to the conception of Hands-On Reading.</p>

               towards computer-aided distant reading whereby broad patterns are identified across
               large volumes of digitised texts by machine <ptr target="#aurnhammer2019"/>. Our
               interest, on the other hand, is in exploring the possibilities offered by digital
               texts for critical or evaluative close reading. To better understand how users
               interact with digital texts and digital writing tools, we held a symposium to which
               we invited academics, creative practitioners (mostly professional calligraphers but
               also artists and designers), and digital specialists, i.e. groups of practitioners
               that read and write differently. Conversations with this range of users allowed us to
               draw more concrete conclusions about the kind of experience we hoped to provide
               through the app, as well as its potential value from a research perspective. One of
               the key outcomes of these initial discussions was the notion of slowing down digital
               reading to allow time for critical thinking and reflection. This notion is
               particularly timely given the rise in bite-sized information on social media
               platforms that results in increasingly fast-paced reading. One of the ways we wished
               to explore slowing down digital reading in designing the app was to connect reading
               to writing. While other DH studies explore the possibilities offered by digital texts
               for active reading – annotating while reading – we are interested in the
               possibilities offered by digital texts for using writing <emph>as a means of</emph>
               reading – reading as modelled by medieval scribes. </p>
            <p>In order to encourage slow reading, we had to carefully consider the writing surface,
               the writing space, and the choice of pen tool in designing our app. A number of DH
               projects have attempted to expand the functionality of annotation tools, bringing
               together the applications of the pen with the possibilities offered by digital
               writing. One of the earliest examinations of computer-based active reading was
               Schilit et al.’s XLibris <quote rend="inline">active reading machine</quote>
               <ptr target="#schilit1998"/>. XLibris used a <quote rend="inline">commercial
                  high-resolution pen tablet display</quote> that mimicked the <quote rend="inline"
                  >key affordances of paper</quote> to allow readers to mark up a digital text by
               hand, thereby encouraging active reading. Various projects have attempted to develop
               this machine-based active reading further: PapierCraft experimented with hybrid
               machine-paper format to bring together the best of both paper and machine <ptr
                  target="#liao2008"/>; GatherReader sought to maintain the flow of reading while
               offering a range of solutions for annotation <ptr target="#hinckley2012"/>. More
               recently, dedicated updates to e-reader devices explore the possibilities of active
               reading by replicating the look and affordances of paper (such as page flipping)
               while also offering additional features such as adjustable text size, quick
               definitions or translations, and the ability to easily share text; but annotation is
               often limited to underlining, highlighting, or typing notes. Commercially available
               e-paper tablets – such as the Remarkable and Sony’s DPT-RP1 – have allowed users to
               annotate and edit digital text by hand, with specialist screen and stylus
               technologies seeking to mimic the feel and tangible nuance of physical writing. While
               such developments are promising, they remain in their infancy and are targeted at
               specific business and creative audiences rather than at readers. Studies that examine
               machine-aided active reading have found there to be a significant difference between
               reading digitally and reading on paper which limits the reader’s ability to read
               actively <ptr target="#sellen1997"/>
               <ptr target="#adler1998"/>
               <ptr target="#ohara1997"/> (these are conveniently summarised by <ref
                  target="#tashman2011">Tashman and Edwards (2011)</ref>). </p>
            <p>We were therefore aware that in creating an app to encourage slow reading the type of
               pen tool used would affect both reading and writing practices. Early research into
               digital writing undertaken by Microsoft found that <quote rend="inline">there is a
                  rich set of deeply rooted behaviors that people exhibit when working with pen,
                  paper, clippings, pages, and books</quote>
               <ptr target="#hinckley2010"/>, a concept which rang true in our initial discussions
               with creative practitioners. In exploring the use of digital tools to mimic physical
               writing, Hinckley et al. separated <q>pen</q> from <q>touch,</q> finding that <quote
                  rend="inline">the pen writes, touch manipulates, and the combination of pen +
                  touch yields new tools.</quote> Relatedly, Weibel et al. experimented with what
               they call <quote rend="inline">paper-digital tools</quote> by using Livescribe
               digital pens to understand the practice of note taking and data collection practices,
               finding that the use of digital pens caused their study participants to modify their
               note taking practices <ptr target="#weibel2012"/>. This influenced the choice of pen
               tool for our app. Users should not need a specialist stylus but should be able to use
               any pen tool with which they are familiar in order to avoid introducing a new element
               to the study of the relationship between digital writing and digital reading. They
               should, however, have the option to select from various pen sizes and colours, with
               touch-screen input using either a finger or stylus, to allow them to colour code or
               size their writing as they wish. </p>
            <p>We were also aware that writing surfaces affect the way the pen is used. Our early
               discussions with creative practitioners and potential end users brought to light the
               key differences between digital and physical surfaces. The calligraphers in
               particular noticed the lack of sensorial feedback when writing on a screen, a crucial
               difference between traditional and digital writing. Recent studies have made similar
               observations: that the digital writing surface has an immediate effect on the style
               of writing and, as a result, digital writing is <quote rend="inline">usually larger
                  and sloppier</quote> than its ink and paper counterpart <ptr
                  target="#agrawala2005"/>. Their solution was not to change the texture of the
               writing surface but to change the available writing space so DIZI (Digital Ink
               Zooming Interface) zooms in on the writing space to offset the inclination to
               increase letter size when writing digitally. Building on the idea of changing the
               available writing space, Yoon et al. experimented with creating extra space via their
               TextTearing interface, which allows the user to break up a page of text in order to
               annotate freely without interrupting its flow <ptr target="#yoon2013"/>. They
               concluded that their participants preferred TextTearing techniques to writing in
                  <quote rend="inline">naturally occurring space[s]</quote> on digital pages. But
               such dynamic pages that permit expanding margins and creating spaces between lines
               interrupts the natural flow of writing and disrupts reading, as Yoon et al.
               themselves observed. <ref target="#weibel2012">Weibel et al. (2012)</ref> conversely
               noted that paper allows spatial organisation of handwritten annotations in a way
               which digital tools do not. It was crucial for the development of the Hands-On
               Reading app therefore to strike a careful balance between such dynamism and the
               possible disruptions to the reading process it causes. Our primary objective was to
               facilitate interaction with text on the virtual page in a free and uninhibited way,
               offering an experience as close as possible to reading and writing by hand on paper. </p>
            <figure>
               <head>Initial design of the application</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The medieval manuscript and early printed page are ideal models for the interaction
               between reading and writing. Where digital reading material such as the page-turning
               books available on e-readers or the articles published in e.g. <title rend="italic"
                  >DHQ</title> provide little marginal space, medieval manuscripts and early printed
               books were often designed with large margins - and sometimes ruled with blank columns
               - for the very purpose of extensive annotation. To emulate the scribal process of
               slow reading, with pen in hand, the initial design of the app was based on a medieval
               manuscript page. The main page of the app displayed an image of a single vellum page
               that imitated a familiar non-digital writing surface. A blank vellum background was
               sourced from a fifteenth-century manuscript in Newcastle University Library Special
               Collections (Newcastle University Library, Mediaeval MS 4) onto which we provided
               only four lines of text alongside wide margins for annotations. To encourage
               interaction with the text, decorative elements such as <q>drop cap</q> initials were
               limited to a simple outline that could be filled in. We used a blank decorative
                  <q>Humanistic White Vine (Bianchi Girari)</q> initial designed by Klaus-Peter
               Schäffel. The text was rendered semi-transparent so as to elicit tracing and, in
               order that the text was easily readable and yet calligraphic enough to suggest it was
               a template, we chose Schäffel’s 1480 Humanistica font. A modern translation of the
               prologue to Chaucer’s <title rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</title> was selected for
               the text as it is unfamiliar enough to warrant annotation, yet not too unfamiliar in
               its language (being a modern translation) to be prohibitive or off-putting. </p>
            <p>Explicit instructions were limited in order to avoid the risk of prescribing the
               nature of interactions, but users were given the opportunity to provide specific
               feedback on their experience of using the app. It was vital to find a way to gather
               data on user interactions that could be analysed as part of the broader Manuscripts
               after Print project, with the potential to pave the way for further refinement of the
               app through subsequent funding bids. The decision was made to ask users to register
               an account to facilitate data acquisition and to allow users to save their work. </p>

                  was identified as a practical goal within the timescale, and would allow
                  compatibility with both iOS and Android. The technology stack included a client
                  built using Angular 9 and a server built using Nest.js.<note>The <q>client</q> is
                     the front-end visual appearance and behaviour of a website, whereas the

                     and communication with the database. Generally, the terms <q>client</q> and

                  Node.js based frameworks is the volume of community support online and the wealth

                  variety of drawing and shape creation functionality, enabling us to build an
                  interactive object model on top of a HTML canvas element. A reset function allowed
                  users to remove all annotations on the canvas. Consistent with the historical use
                  of different inks and sizes of script in manuscript rubrication and decoration,
                  users could also change the stylus colour and width, with these options housed
                  within a menu at the bottom of the screen (<ref target="#figure02">Figure

                     fields and relationships between fields, e.g. a user will have an email and a

                     pre-determined and the database does not follow a strict schema, e.g. fields
                     can be changed during development to add a username.</note> This was beneficial
                  as we anticipated that the database content would evolve in phase 2 to store more

               <head>Testing</head>
               <p>Beta-testing of the app was conducted at a workshop in December 2019, twelve weeks
                  after the initial symposium. Participants included a number of individuals who had
                  previously collaborated with the Manuscripts after Print project, chiefly
                  professional calligraphers and special collections librarians. The workshop was
                  also attended by a number of academics, both with specialisms in medieval and
                  early modern studies and from other disciplines. While participants were provided
                  with iPads and styluses, they were also encouraged to access the app via their own
                  devices, which included android tablets, phones and laptops, and to experiment
                  both with and without annotation tools.</p>
               <p>Following half an hour of testing, the floor was opened for general discussion.
                  Participants were also invited to complete a feedback form, answering the
                  following questions (which were specifically chosen to be as open-ended as
                  possible):</p>
               <list type="ordered">
                  <item>Did you enjoy using the app?</item>
                  <item>If you could enhance or improve any aspect of the app, what would it
                     be?</item>
                  <item>Did the app make you think differently about handwriting?</item>
                  <item>Did the app change the way you read the text?</item>
                  <item>Do you think the app would be of use to any specific user groups?</item>
                  <item>What device did you use?</item>
                  <item>What is your occupation?</item>
               </list>
               <p>While participants were broadly positive about the concept of the app, two main
                  criticisms were raised:</p>
               <list type="ordered">
                  <item>A concern over the limited guidance offered to the user. Responses to
                     question two included: <q>the task is not clear;</q>
                     <q>a little guidance...;</q>
                     <q>no task instructions.</q> While these comments were noted, they did not
                     represent a major concern as one of the key objectives of the workshop was to
                     see how users approached the app without instruction. Indeed, one participant
                     noted, <quote rend="inline">[I’m] glad we didn’t get this information at the
                        time.</quote></item>
                  <item>Frustrations regarding functionality, especially the absence of zoom and
                     undo features. Users who accessed the app on touchscreen devices mentioned that
                     they instinctively expected compatibility with touchscreen gestures. The lack
                     of a zoom function was noted particularly by phone users, while there was also
                     discussion of whether an erase function was appropriate within an app that
                     mirrored a manuscript page; several calligraphers suggested that a "scrape to
                     remove" function would be more in keeping with the style.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Questions three and four revealed a notable disparity between testers of different
                  professions. The responses of calligraphers generally indicated that the app had
                  not encouraged them to think differently about handwriting or read the text in a
                  different way; one admitted that this might be <quote rend="inline">because I’ve
                     been thinking about [handwriting] for a while.</quote> The experience of using
                  the app with pen tools rather than a pen itself stopped calligraphers from reading
                  the text carefully, with one commenting, <quote rend="inline">I began to read the
                     words as I traced but because that experience was frustrating I stopped
                     reading.</quote> However, academics and librarians stated that using the app
                  had made them consider the relationship between the reader and the text and had
                  encouraged them to contemplate the text's material form. One wrote that <quote
                     rend="inline">it made me think about handwriting and decoration, material and
                     page design as being inseparable;</quote> another wrote that <quote
                     rend="inline">it made me think differently about the relationship between
                     handwriting (as a reader) [and] text;</quote>
                  <quote rend="inline">it made me focus more on how I read.</quote>
               </p>
               <p>Professional calligraphers generally did not consider the app to be a potential
                  tool for teaching calligraphy, <quote rend="inline">unless it provided a starting
                     point to lead someone to say <q>I want to know more</q>.</quote> These
                  responses confirmed the limitations of a generic touch screen/stylus combination
                  for creating an experience akin to calligraphic writing with paper and pen; they
                  also confirmed that the app could be used as a tool to encourage reading the
                  digital text <emph>by</emph> writing, rather than a digital writing tool per

               <head>Phase 2</head>
               <p>Reflecting on these responses, it was clear that the functionality of the app
                  limited the way the text was read. The largest barrier to reading appeared to be
                  the gap between the expectations of users, the affordances of digital tools, and
                  the difference between paper and digital interfaces. The app was therefore refined
                  to address some of the issues raised by testers and to add new features that allow
                  further reflection on the initial research questions. </p>
               <p>The most pressing of these changes was the introduction of an erase button. We had
                  initially rejected the addition of an eraser on the grounds that it would not
                  reflect medieval annotation practices, opting instead to include a reset button
                  which deleted all annotations. However, testers found this option frustrating and
                  too distant from their experience of using digital tools. Part of these
                  frustrations is that testers came to the digital interface with pre-set
                  expectations of digital reading and writing, specifically around the features that
                  are typically available to them on tablets. Therefore a <q>scrape to erase</q>
                  feature, which would remove a layer of annotation and slightly damage the vellum
                  underneath it, in keeping with medieval annotation practices, would have likewise
                  been incompatible with how digital devices are used today. While we were conscious
                  that the app could not directly imitate the affordances of paper and pen, the
                  digital eraser function is both closer to its physical counterpart and a common
                  feature on digital annotation programmes and users are therefore likely to find it
                  more intuitive than the other options. The eraser was not a pre-existing feature
                  of Fabric.js and was implemented as an add-on, removing any drawing or imagery
                  existing on the canvas wherever the user <q>draws.</q>  </p>
               <p>At this stage we would also have liked to respond to feedback by introducing
                  zooming, panning, and responsive sizing (automatic resizing of the app based on
                  the user’s device). This is probably the most significant sacrifice necessitated
                  by Fabric.js. To facilitate responsive resizing, zoom functionality, and
                  associated panning across the screen, Fabric.js required the manuscript page to be
                  set as a background image on the canvas. However, the implementation of the eraser
                  meant that it removed all drawing on the canvas, not only the users' additions,
                  and therefore the manuscript image had to be added to the background HTML in a
                  parent <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> rather than as part of the resizable
                     canvas.<note>A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a block of content within the
                     site.</note> While this was a compromise, we were also conscious of the
                  potential disruptions to the reading process created by digital features such as
                  zoom, as described by <ref target="#yoon2013">Yoon et al. (2013)</ref>. Having
                  observed our testers, we noted that the majority of them demonstrated familiarity
                  with the features usually available on tablets, such as pinch to zoom gestures.
                  Such paradigms are now entrenched enough that users expect their availability in
                  all apps, finding their absence counterintuitive. Such gestures do not reflect the
                  affordances of paper and it is these sorts of changing expectations that are
                  driving the gap between physical and digital books. It will be key to a further
                  redesign of the app to negotiate between user-expectations and the experience of
                  focussed reading with a pen.  </p>

               <p>Other changes to the app were implemented to facilitate its use, thereby allowing
                  users to operate it more intuitively and focus on reading rather than the
                  frustrations of unexpected functionality. To simplify pen colour choice, black,
                  red, and blue were added to the colour picker as pre-set colours, as shown in <ref
                     target="#figure03">Figure 3</ref>. We also added page turn functionality to
                  encourage users to read beyond the first page and increased the amount of text
                  available. Given that we had to abandon responsive functionality at this stage,
                  the font size was carefully chosen to ensure it could be clearly read while
                  leaving enough blank marginal space around the text to encourage annotation. The
                  number of lines displayed on the screen was limited to four, conforming with the
                  size of a standard iPad. The text was displayed overlaid on an image of a right
                  and left facing manuscript page, as shown in <ref target="#figure04">Figure
                     4</ref>. Users move forward and backwards in the text with buttons on each side
                  of the manuscript. </p>

               </figure>
               <p>Stylistically, we refined the appearance of the app to a coherent theme giving the
                  feel of a native application. This was achieved using Bootstrap 4, an open source
                  css toolkit, chosen for its mobile-first styles throughout the components
                     offered.<note>CSS is a language used to write descriptions for formatting HTML
                     content. Bootstrap 4 is a library of code that can be integrated into a program
                     that provides pre-set styling for common elements such as buttons.</note> We
                  particularly made use of the button grouping and styling and layout assistance
                  that Bootstrap offers. <ref target="#figure05">Figures 5</ref>
                  <ref target="#figure06">and 6</ref> show the evolution from the Phase 1 to Phase 2
                  menu with additional features. The styling makes the menu smaller, thereby
                  ensuring that it does not encroach too heavily on the annotation space. Icons
                  rather than text keeps button size to a minimum. So that it is not intrusive, we
                  opted for a black background to match the black background against which most
                  manuscript pages are photographed and introduced a green and blue colour scheme to
                  pick up colours in the illustrated manuscript page. Finally, we included a pop-up
                  window on opening the app which details instructions for its use. These
                  instructions are kept to a minimum to avoid directing readers too precisely,
                  allowing us to monitor the variety of annotations made by users.  </p>

               </figure>
               <p>In order to encourage reading over a longer period of time and to enable us to
                  gather further data on how the app is used, user accounts that allow page saving
                  and resuming were introduced in this phase of redesign. Users are now able to
                  register with their email and set up a password, which is saved in the database in
                  an encrypted form using password hashing provided by bcrypt.<note>A hashed
                     password is a scrambled version of the original password that can be
                     unscrambled using a secret key known only to the website. This means that if
                     the scrambled version of the password is ever intercepted or accessed in the
                     database by an unauthorized source it cannot be unscrambled. bcrypt is a
                     library of code that offers this functionality. </note>
                  <ref target="#figure07">Figure 7</ref> shows the login page, including the option
                  to show or hide the password. On logging into the app at a later date, users are
                  presented with their last saved page to resume reading. Fabric.js made saving
                  images in the database straightforward through the functionality to export the
                  canvas as an SVG string suitable to be entered into a text-based database.<note>An
                     SVG (scalable vector graphic) is an image type where information can be stored
                     as text characters using the XML markup language. </note> As users make and
                  save additional changes to a page, that page is updated in the database. To
                  reflect the additional data now being collected by the app, admin features were
                  added, including the ability to view a table of users, the number of pages saved
                  with date stamp, and the number of feedback forms submitted. These data can be
                  downloaded in csv form for ease of analysis and interoperability. Each saved page
                  can also be downloaded and viewed. </p>
               <p>Further iterations of the app might include features which address our initial
                  research questions more fully. For instance, a feature that captures the timings
                  of the marks made on the page or video recordings of the page would give us a
                  fuller understanding of the process of reading with a pen in hand. Automatic
                  resizing for different devices would make the app more accessible to mobile phone
                  as well as tablet users. </p>

            <head>Conclusions and Future Work</head>
            <p>While Hands-On Reading demonstrates the importance of looking at the adaptability of
               old technology such as medieval manuscripts and early printed books in creating tools
               for digital reading and writing, there are several ways in which the app might be
               further developed to explore the possibilities of slow reading. Despite recent
               advances, the gap between current digital technology and its paper counterpart
               remains sufficiently broad enough to prompt the question of whether digital reading
               can directly replace the physical book. Readers approach the digital and the physical
               text with different expectations; their way of processing information in digital and
               non-digital platforms also differs. Thus, if medieval practices of reading with pen
               in hand cannot be translated directly from physical paper formats to current digital
               formats, then a broader question arises: can digital interfaces offer new ways of
               reading which surpass the possibilities of physical books? </p>
            <p>Early twenty-first century predictions of the demise of print publishing have proven
               to be unfounded, with a strong revival in sales of printed books over the last
               decade. Some categories of books – such as genre fiction and academic publications –
               have flourished in the new medium, yet many others remain firmly rooted in the print
               market. That audiences prefer to access different kinds of books in specific formats
               does not lack historical precedent. Moreover, as the recent decline in e-reader sales
               indicates, many readers prefer to access digital texts via computers, smartphones and
               tablets rather than seeking new devices for reading. Though future technological
               developments may well allow us to shrink the gap between print and digital media, it
               seems entirely likely that the two modes of textual consumption will continue to
               coexist, albeit with the emergence of new forms of interaction between them. </p>
            <p>However, one area where there seems to be considerable potential for permeability
               between paper and digital technologies is that of writing. The stylus is held and
               moved in the same way as a normal pen; even in its most basic form it affords a
               familiar experience, while advanced hardware and software tools are capable of
               emulating (if not fully replicating) the tactility and precision of writing with a
               pen on paper. Current touch screen and stylus technologies are not yet sufficiently
               advanced to teach practical calligraphy at anything more than a basic level, but the
               growing number of mass-market and specialist software solutions that facilitate
               “inking” indicates the potential for digital writing to complement and enhance
               existing digital tools and modes of consumption. </p>
            <p>With readers increasingly accessing digital texts with a stylus in hand, this is an
               opportune moment to explore the possibilities offered by slow reading within a
               digital context. Rather than imitating paper and pens to encourage active reading in
               digital formats, the gap between paper, pens, and the current affordances of digital
               technology could itself be leveraged to offer new ways of reading. While physical
               books are not designed to allow a reader to copy over a text while reading, digital
               texts can easily be manipulated to explore this functionality, encouraging the
               interaction of text and pen for example by tracing words. Doing so permits the reader
               to engage with the text in an entirely new way: reading <emph>by</emph> writing.</p>
            <p>Slowing the process of reading, and thereby allowing time for evaluative and critical
               thinking, means that the app could be adapted to a variety of audiences. The
               development process brought the question of the app’s target audience into sharper
               focus. The initial concept of the app emerged from a set of broad research questions
               rather than an attempt to fill a gap in the market, and throughout the design and
               trial phases we sought to explore potential applications in an open and
               non-prescriptive way. Feedback from testing workshops confirmed our assumptions about
               the limited value of Hands-On Reading as a tool for teaching calligraphy, but also
               raised various possible ways in which it might be adapted for other educational uses.
               The most promising of these suggestions – and the most consistent with our research
               goals – is further development of the app as a tool to explore and enhance reading by
               writing in primary, secondary, and higher education. The growing body of work on the
               impact of digital reading in this setting <ptr target="#cull2011"/>
               <ptr target="#schugar2011"/>
               <ptr target="#chen2013"/>
               <ptr target="#kaufman2016"/> is only the most recent phase of a longstanding
               tradition of scholarship on how students can and should read, stretching back to the
               twelfth-century <title rend="italic">Metalogicon</title> of John of Salisbury. More
               recent research indicates that the use of handwriting apps with a tablet and stylus
               not only improves children’s ability to write with pen and paper but also aids in
               their general development, academic success, and emotional wellbeing (these studies
               are conveniently summarised in <ref target="#klein2021">Klein et al. (2021)</ref>).
               Existing apps intended for both school and home use – such as Kaligo, iTrace and
               Handwriting Without Tears – teach letter and number formation through a similar
               process of tracing and are designed to complement national curricula. But while
               several DH projects have studied the benefits of annotation on memory and
               understanding at primary and secondary level <ptr target="#butler2019"/>
               <ptr target="#bonnetonbotte2020"/>
               <ptr target="#araujo2021"/> and university-level study <ptr target="#marshall1997"/>
               <ptr target="#wolfe2000"/>
               <ptr target="#hong2012"/>, only relatively limited attention has been paid to the
               role that writing plays in facilitating the comprehension and interrogation of the
               digital text (on this subject see <ref target="#fitzpatrick2013">Fitzpatrick
                  (2013)</ref>). Hands-On Reading’s unique digital medieval format could be
               leveraged to further aid the process of annotation and so information retention, and
               offer the opportunity to more deeply examine the concept of slow reading with pen in
               hand. </p>
            <p>Finally, the development of Hands-On Reading has allowed us to reflect on our initial
               research questions: why does handwriting have an enduring relevance in a digital age,
               and can a more hands-on approach to reading lead to a deeper engagement with the
               text? Though it is clear that numerous factors have contributed to handwriting’s
               longevity, development and testing of the app has shed particular light on the role
               of handwriting in facilitating the critical and inferential evaluation of textual
               sources, whether in printed or digital form. As the digital revolution continues to
               profoundly change the way we consume texts – and broader social trends highlight the
               fundamental importance of interpretative analysis – there is a pressing need to equip
               contemporary readers with the tools to approach the digital text on a deeper, more
               reflective level. There is nothing new about the use of handwriting to promote more
               active forms of reading, but digitally replicating much older forms of reading while
               writing can allow us to make the most of these technological advances while
               simultaneously taking a slower approach to reading, with all the critical and
               evaluative benefits this brings. </p>
