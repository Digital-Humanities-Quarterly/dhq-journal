                  <p>Exploratory studies have demonstrated the benefits of implementing Geographic
                     Information Systems (GIS) technology in literary and cultural-historical
                     research. These studies have done much to affirm the power and flexibility of
                     GIS technology as a resource for humanities scholarship. At the same time,
                     however, these studies share a common limitation in that they tend to rely on
                     the analysis of point-based cartographic representations. Such representations
                     are suitable for modelling quantitative geographical phenomena, but they are
                     inadequate for modelling qualitative human phenomena. This inadequacy
                     constitutes a significant problem for researchers who aspire to analyse the
                     geographical experiences and spatial relationships represented in works of
                     literature, including works that contain accounts of travel. The present article
                     proposes a solution to this problem by demonstrating how advanced spatial
                     analyses within GIS such as Cost-Surface Analysis (CSA) and Least-Cost-Path
                     Analysis (LCP) can be used to facilitate more nuanced interpretations of
                     historical works of travel writing and topographical literature. Specifically,
                     the article explains how GIS, CSA and LCP can be combined to build coherent
                     spatial models of the journeys recorded in the works of three canonical
                     eighteenth-century British travellers, each of whom composed influential
                     accounts of their travels through the English Lake District: the poet Thomas
                     Gray (1716–1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726–1798) and the
                     agriculturist Arthur Young (1741–1820).

                     research in the applied sciences since its inception during the 1960s. In the
                     Humanities, however, the use of GIS has been much more sporadic. This latter
                     trend can principally be attributed to the fact that only some Humanities
                     disciplines routinely engage with the kinds of quantitative and geographical
                     data that GIS were designed to analyse [<a class="ref" href="#pickles1995">Pickles 1995</a>]

                     interdisciplinary scholarship, which has enabled literary critics, theorists and
                     historians to work with Geographic Information Scientists on projects that
                     employ GIS in collaborative research. One innovation that has occurred as a
                     result of this research is the implementation of GIS in the study of both
                     individual literary works and literary corpora composed of several works. This
                     development has variously been labelled ‘Literary GIS’ (see [<a class="ref" href="#cooper2016">Cooper et al. 2016</a>]. Notably, between 2007 and 2008 the British
                     Academy-funded "Mapping the Lakes: A Literary GIS"
                     project at Lancaster University tested the interpretive possibilities of using
                     GIS to compare different literary accounts of the English Lake District: a
                     mountainous region in north-western England that has particularly significant

                     Edinburgh, Cardiff University and Stanford University have adopted similar
                     approaches in order to explore the imaginative and affective geographies of
                     writers and readers, and to examine how these geographies intertwine with one
                     another [<a class="ref" href="#alves2013">Alves and Queiroz 2013</a>]

                     and cultural-historical research.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">At the same time, however, these studies share a common limitation in that they
                     largely rely on the analysis of distribution maps and other kinds of point-based
                     cartographic representations. Point-based mapping techniques are useful for
                     plotting the position of fixed geographical features and for facilitating the
                     implementation of methodologies such as point pattern analysis; but these
                     techniques are also reductive in that they limit the real complexity of places
                     as sites of social engagement and interaction. Although we are accustomed to
                     thinking about places as being "static", or as being defined by fixed
                     boundaries, their cultural significance is in fact defined by other factors,
                     such as the interconnected flow of experiences that converge in them and the
                     roles they play as nodes in larger spatial networks [<a class="ref" href="#ingold2009">Ingold 2009</a>].
                     Point-based maps are suitable for structuring the analysis of quantitative
                     geographical phenomena, such as proximity and scale; however, they are less
                     adequate for structuring the analysis of qualitative human phenomena, such as
                     the experience of visiting a place or of travelling from one place to another.
                     This is a significant problem for scholars who are engaged in research that
                     aspires to analyse the geographical experiences and spatial relationships
                     represented in literary works and, even more specifically, in works of travel
                     writing and topographical literature. Analysing such works requires us to
                     consider how the accounts they contain are shaped not only by the experience of
                     specific locations, but also by the experience of travelling
                     <em class="emph">through</em> and <em class="emph">between</em> those locations. We need to
                     come to grips with both of these types of experience in order to appreciate how
                     the authors of the accounts we are reading encountered and apprehended the
                     places and landmarks they describe.

                     structuring analyses that satisfy these requirements. In what follows, we shall
                     demonstrate how advanced GIS-based spatial analysis, particularly Cost-Surface
                     Analysis (CSA) and Least-Cost-Path Analysis (LCP), can facilitate more nuanced
                     interpretations of historical works of travel writing and topographical
                     literature. Our objective in the following pages shall be to combine these
                     methodologies to perform a spatial analysis of the journeys recorded in the
                     travelogues of three canonical, eighteenth-century British travellers: the poet
                     Thomas Gray (1716–1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726–1798) and the
                     agriculturist Arthur Young (1741–1820). The travelogues of Gray, Young and
                     Pennant are diverse works, and they reflect the fact that these three writers
                     undertook their journeys for distinctive reasons. For the sake of concision, we
                     shall limit our analyses to the portions of Gray, Young and Pennant’s writings
                     that concern the English Lake District, and we shall focus on employing GIS, CSA
                     and LCP to investigate how the relative accessibility of the Lakeland landscape
                     influenced both the routes these three travellers followed and, consequently,
                     the experiences documented in their accounts.

                        District, this article aims to extend and refine aspects of the research
                        undertaken by the "Mapping the Lakes" project.
                        The chief case study completed by "Mapping the
                        Lakes" focused on two famous accounts of the Lake District. In
                        that study, Thomas Gray’s Lakeland travelogue (written in 1769) was assessed
                        alongside the letters and notes that a later writer, the Romantic poet
                        Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), composed during his ramble through the
                        western fells of the Lake District in 1802. As the findings of this case
                        study demonstrated, although Gray’s and Coleridge’s texts ostensibly contain
                        accounts of the same landscape, a GIS mapping of them reveals a set of
                        radically divergent patterns (Figure 1).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p6">Significantly, these divergent patterns point up a number of the key
                        differences between Gray’s and Coleridge’s excursions. Gray’s tour was a
                        fifteen-day trip by coach and horseback from Brough to Lancaster via the
                        lakes of Ullswater, Derwentwater, Thirlmere and Windermere. Coleridge’s
                        tour, by contrast, was a nine-day odyssey taken on foot from his house in
                        Keswick to the coastal village of St Bees, and thence famously over Scafell
                        Pike to Eskdale and Coniston before returning homeward over Dunmail Raise.
                        These contrasting routes indicate crucial differences in touristic attitudes
                        and practices [<a class="ref" href="#cooper2011">Cooper and Gregory 2011</a>, 93–95]. Gray’s account,
                        though famously one of the earliest documents of its kind, exemplifies many
                        of the tendencies of later picturesque tourism in the Lake District. Gray
                        travelled on coach roads in a planned route that took him through densely
                        populated areas to sites of visual grandeur and beauty. Coleridge, by
                        contrast, was a resident of the Lake District at the time he set off for the
                        western fells, and his irregular route reflected his desire to avoid
                        well-trodden paths. In short, whereas Gray was rather unabashedly what we
                        would call a tourist, Coleridge regarded himself as a traveller (see [<a class="ref" href="#buzard1993">Buzard 1993</a>]

                     <div class="ptext" id="p7">In using GIS to ground these interpretations, the study completed by the
                        "Mapping the Lakes" project confirmed that
                        quantitative spatial approaches can play a meaningful role in the
                        qualitative analysis of works of travel writing and topographical
                        literature. Our current research into the implementation of CSA and LCP
                        builds on these results, and it aims to enhance further the use of GIS-based
                        methodologies in literary and cultural-historical scholarship. Our
                        contention is that methods such as CSA and LCP can enable researchers to
                        move beyond merely schematic point-based mapping techniques and towards
                        spatial methodologies that are sensitive to the fact that places are
                        characterised by much more than their geographic location.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p8">As the map displayed in Figure 1 indicates, the "Mapping
                        the Lakes" project used straight lines to represent the
                        itineraries of Gray’s and Coleridge’s Lake District tours. Although this
                        "connect-the-dots" strategy does portray the sequence of places
                        that Gray and Coleridge visited, the geometrical depiction it produces gives
                        us, at best, a superficial understanding of how the physical geography of
                        the Lake District shaped the experiences documented in their accounts.
                        Integrating CSA and LCP, we decided to undertake a more nuanced spatial
                        analysis of a selection of key historical Lake District travelogues. Once
                        again, we decided to focus on Gray’s account, which was composed in 1769 as
                        a series of epistles to his friend Thomas Wharton. But instead of working
                        with Coleridge’s account (which was written more than four decades later),
                        we elected to draw on the accounts of two other writers who toured the Lake
                        District at roughly the same time as Gray did. The first of these writers,
                        again, is Arthur Young, who paid a visit to the Lakes whilst completing an
                        agricultural survey of Northern England in 1768; the second is Thomas
                        Pennant, who passed through the region as part of his tours of Scotland in
                        1769 and 1772.

                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p9">Our decision to focus on Gray, Young and Pennant is not, however, solely
                        based on chronology. It is, more significantly, based on the fact that they
                        were the three chief authorities cited in Thomas West’s highly influential
                        <cite class="title italic">A Guide to the Lakes</cite> (1778). A foundational
                        work in the history of British tourism, West’s <cite class="title italic">Guide to
                           the Lakes</cite> sold through an unprecedented eleven editions and was
                        still being reprinted more than forty years after its initial publication.
                        It was, accordingly, the work through which most late-eighteenth-century and
                        early-nineteenth-century Lake District tourists first encountered Gray,
                        Young and Pennant’s writings about the region. Importantly, however, West’s
                        guide only reproduces portions of each of these writer’s accounts of the
                        Lake District and thus only gives a partial glimpse of the geographies of
                        their Lakeland tours. In using LCP and CSA to investigate Gray, Young and
                        Pennant’s accounts of the Lake District, then, our aim was to achieve a
                        better understanding of the experience of Lake District travellers in the
                        era before the region was popularised by the works of writers such as West.
                        More broadly, our objectives in spatially analysing the tours of these three
                        writers were threefold:

                           <li class="item">In the first place, we wanted to assess the extent to which the Lake
                              District’s topography conditioned Gray, Young and Pennant’s accounts by
                              determining the degree to which the places each writer records having
                              visited either corresponds to or deviates from the corridors formed by
                              the natural contours of the region’s terrain.

                              individually favoured particular parts of the Lakeland region, and
                              (whenever a preference for a particular place or type of place could be
                              discerned) to assess the reason for the writers’ attraction to specific
                              locations.

                        however, we will first summarize succinctly the steps we took to meet each
                        of our three objectives. The first step in this process was to create a
                        GIS-readable version of the tours documented in Gray, Young and Pennant’s
                        accounts of the Lake District, and this itself involved several stages.
                        First of all, we had to digitise the portions of each writer’s account that
                        dealt with the Lakeland region. This gave us a set of text extracts
                        comprising [<a class="ref" href="#gray1775">Gray 1775</a>, 350–379]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#young1770">Young 1770</a>, III, 117–196]

                        individually to identify and to record every place-name reference each
                        extract contained. These place-names were then manually coded using XML and
                        divided into groups to distinguish the places and landmarks that the writers
                        visited from those they mentioned but did not visit. The places and
                        landmarks tagged as having been visited were then arranged sequentially in a
                        table to form an itinerary for each account. Once tagged, annotated and
                        arranged in this manner, the place-names were geo-referenced using
                        coordinate data from the Old Cumbria Gazetteer [<a class="ref" href="#norgate2014">Norgate and Norgate 2014</a>].
                        The fully georeferenced dataset was then uploaded into ArcGIS. This dataset
                        represents the geographic information contained in Gray, Young and Pennant’s
                        accounts as isolated points on the Lakeland landscape; however, it also
                        provides a platform for performing more sophisticated forms of geographical
                        analysis (such as CSA and LCP) in order to explore these accounts as records
                        of movement <em class="emph">through</em> that landscape.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p11">In order to achieve our first objective, we used CSA and LCP to simulate the
                        natural corridors, determining the most efficient route for travelling over
                        the terrain taking into account the relief of the Lake District’s
                        topography. We then implemented a spatial proximity test in order to assess
                        whether the places in itineraries we had extracted from Gray, Young and
                        Pennant’s accounts were closer to the natural corridors formed by the
                        region’s topography than would be expected by chance alone. Performing this
                        test allowed us to ascertain the relative accessibility of the places each
                        writer decided to visit. In order to achieve our second objective, we
                        simulated the routes most likely taken by the three writers according to the
                        places they visited. Taking the journeys of the three authors into account,
                        we then employed a Line Density Analysis (LDA) to identify the most
                        frequented routes in order to determine whether there was a preponderance of
                        attention given to any particular area or region. Finally, in order to
                        achieve our third objective, we carried out another spatial proximity test.
                        In this instance, however, we analysed the spatial relationship between the
                        simulated pathways and those places that were mentioned in Gray, Young and
                        Pennant’s accounts, but which were not actually sites these travellers
                        visited.

                        [<a class="ref" href="#wang2009">Wang, Savage and Bradley 2009</a>]. But this is the first time that these methods
                        have been used in Humanities research to analyse the journeys recorded in
                        historical travelogues. Admittedly, there are limitations to employing the
                        geospatial models that CSA and LCP create to study the accounts of
                        historical travellers. Methods such as CSA and LCP are ideal for measuring
                        the degree to which the routes taken by travellers correlate with the
                        contours of the terrain those travellers are traversing. CSA and LCP do not,
                        however, offer much in the way of insight about those traveller’s attitudes
                        towards the landscape through which they are moving or about the ideas they
                        form whilst moving through it. As GIS-based methods, CSA and LCP rely on
                        computational processes for which quantification is a prerequisite, and much
                        of the information contained in works of travel writing (including feelings,
                        sensations, and intuitions) is not necessarily quantifiable. Such
                        limitations notwithstanding, CSA and LCP can contribute meaningfully to our
                        understanding of historical works of travel writing and topographical
                        literature. In particular, CSA and LCP can assist us with visualising the
                        journeys such works describe, and they can alert us to geographical patterns
                        that are not otherwise readily discernible. In sum, then, these methods are
                        not a substitute for interpretation; rather, they are an aid for guiding
                        critical inquiry and facilitating research.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p13"> CSA is a spatial methodology that allows one to determine the "cost" of
                        travelling over a surface by considering not only Euclidean space, but also
                        more complicated factors, such as slope and elevation. In other words,
                        instead of limiting us to the examination of the Cartesian spatial
                        properties of the data, it allows us to consider additional factors such as
                        the contours of the terrain, as well as other variables (such as boundaries
                        and borders) which influence how one moves through the landscape [<a class="ref" href="#murrietaflores2012">Murrieta-Flores 2012</a>]. The first step in creating a cost
                        surface model in a GIS environment involves using a Digital Elevation Model
                        (DEM), which is a raster image that represents the topography of the surface
                        of the earth. Raster images, like DEMs, are similar to digital pictures;
                        they are composed of pixels (or, more properly, cells) to which attribute
                        information has been assigned. In digital pictures, this attribute
                        information typically assigns a colour or shade to each cell. In a DEM,
                        however, the attribute information assigned to each cell relates to the
                        elevation of the portion of the earth’s surface which that cell represents
                        (Figure 2).

                        stored in each cell of the friction raster map, which is accordingly used to

                        the purposes of this case study, we created two anisotropic models using

                           bodies of water; 3. the direction in which Gray, Young and Pennant were
                           each travelling (Figure 5). We then carried out a statistically based
                           spatial proximity test in order to assess the spatial relationship

                           natural corridors and then counting the number of visited places within
                           each buffer (Figure 6). We then used this data to perform a statistical
                           significance test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov). Our goal was to test whether the

                           corridors than one would expect by chance alone. The significance level
                           set to test the null hypothesis was 0.01, and in all cases it was
                           rejected. (As noted above, our goal here was to ascertain the degree to
                           which Gray, Young and Pennant were influenced by a logic of optimality
                           in their journeys: in other words, how closely they followed the natural
                           corridors of the terrain.) This finding suggests that Gray, Young and
                           Pennant did generally follow the natural corridors of the Lake District

                           proceeded to determine the extent to which Gray, Young and Pennant
                           emphasised specific portions of the Lake District in their tours. In
                           order to do this, it was necessary to construct simulations of the
                           journeys documented in their accounts. We built these simulations by
                           using each of the places in the itineraries we created for each writer
                           as nodes, and then by using cost surface analysis to calculate the least
                           cost path between them, following the order in which they were visited
                           (Figure 7). After we calculated least cost paths for each account, we
                           then performed a LDA, which allowed us to identify those parts of the
                           landscape through which each of the writers were likely to pass most
                           frequently (Figure 8). Performing these analyses indicates that,
                           collectively, Gray, Young and Pennant spent a significant amount of
                           their time in the Lake District travelling around the lakes of
                           Windermere, Ullswater and Derwentwater. We will offer additional
                           commentary about these findings in the following section. But before
                           concluding, it is worth noting that in addition to examining the
                           locations Gray, Young and Pennant visited, we also performed an analysis
                           on the places they mentioned but did not visit.

                           unvisited places in the travel narratives presented in Gray, Young and
                           Pennant’s accounts. Accordingly, after we identified all the places in
                           the four accounts that were mentioned but not visited, we then carried
                           out another spatial proximity test. This time, the distance index for
                           each writer was calculated with buffers of 1 km created from the
                           itineraries simulated and the statistical test was also set to a
                           significance level of 0.01. Our intention was to assess the degree to
                           which the representation of the Lake District in each account was
                           influenced by the places Gray, Young and Pennant visited and the degree
                           to which it was influenced by places that they mentioned but did not
                           visit. The results of this test indicate that the places mentioned but
                           not visited in Gray and Young’s accounts, and in Pennant’s account of
                           his tour of 1772, are closer to the routes they these writers followed
                           than one would expect by chance alone. When it came to Pennant’s account
                           of his 1769 tour, however, the null hypothesis could not be rejected. As
                           we explain below, this result clues us into an important aspect of how
                           Pennant’s 1769 tour stands apart from the other texts assess in this
                           experiment.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">We believe that the methods outlined above can facilitate more detailed analyses
                     of how the records of historical travellers were shaped by the contours of the
                     landscapes through which they travelled. What is more, to the degree that we
                     accept those travellers’ accounts as accurate descriptions of their journeys,
                     these methods can furnish useful insights into how their accounts were
                     conditioned by factors including the physical geography of the terrain, the
                     existence of roads and tracks, and the availability of specific kinds of
                     transportation. Our first spatial proximity analysis of the relationship between
                     the tours and the Lake District’s natural corridors demonstrates that all the
                     places Gray, Young and Pennant record visiting are nearer to these pathways than
                     would be expected by chance alone (Figure 5). In other words, although these
                     three writers certainly visited a few places that could be considered remote —
                     even adventurous — their itineraries still closely followed the natural
                     corridors of the Lake District. (Indeed, as indicated in Figure 6, most of the
                     places they visited fall within 500 metres of the region’s natural corridors.)

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">These initial observations assist us in making some basic distinctions about the
                     tours documented by Gray, Young and Pennant. For instance, they help us to
                     discern that of the four accounts, the itinerary Pennant followed during his
                     1769 tour was the one that most closely adhered to the natural corridors of the
                     region’s topography. Comparatively, Young and Gray strayed farther from the Lake
                     District’s natural corridors. This finding makes sense, since in 1769 Pennant
                     merely travelled along the outskirts of the Lakeland region whilst on his return
                     from Scotland to his Downing estate. In his tour of 1772, Pennant visited other
                     parts of the Lake District, particularly the Cumberland coast. Here again,
                     however, the analysis shows us that, for the most part, he still followed the
                     natural contours of the region’s terrain.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23"> Beyond enabling us to draw such basic distinctions, the spatial proximity
                     analysis we conducted also helps us to perceive the correspondence between the
                     Lake District’s natural corridors and the routes that were present at the time
                     Gray, Young and Pennant paid their visits to the region. Inasmuch, this analysis
                     enables us to discern that, without exception, all three writers primarily
                     relied on local carriage roads and turnpikes in their travels. At first glance
                     this may seem a minor point, but it is of significant importance. Scholars [<a class="ref" href="#andrews1989">Andrews 1989</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ousby1990">Ousby 1990</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#powell2010">Powel and Hebron 2010</a>] have long credited the accounts of early Lakeland
                     travellers, such as John Dalton and George Smith, with attracting tourists to
                     the region. At the same time, however, these scholars have generally paid less
                     attention to how the improvement of local roadways during the 1750s and 1760s
                     influenced the places to which those tourists were attracted. Brian Paul Hindle,
                     one of the few historians to devote substantial attention to the early history
                     of turnpikes in the Lake District, has observed that the influence of these
                     improvements was twofold. They not only established standard routes that
                     afforded swifter and safer access to several of the region’s main settlements
                     (including Kendal, Keswick, Carlisle, Lancaster and Penrith), but also, in doing
                     so, distinguished the places connected by, or at least visible from, these
                     routes as the sites most worthy of the tourist’s attention [<a class="ref" href="#hindle1998">Hindle 1998</a>, 147–177]

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24"> Accordingly, turning to Figure 8, it makes sense that the parts of the landscape
                     through which Gray, Young and Pennant passed most frequently are located in the
                     eastern half of the region (generally speaking, around the lakes of Ullswater,
                     Derwentwater and Windermere), since these were the sites around which the
                     majority of road improvements occurred. Incidentally, this also helps to explain
                     why neither Gray nor Young nor even Pennant — who travelled through much more of
                     Cumberland — set foot in the western valleys of Wasdale and Ennerdale. Although
                     turnpike acts were passed to improve access to this area in 1750 and 1762, the
                     roads in this remote part of the country remained in disrepair well into the
                     nineteenth century [<a class="ref" href="#hindle1998">Hindle 1998</a>, 154]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hodge1957">Hodge 1957</a>, 67]. Indeed, whereas West, writing in 1778,
                     could confidently declare that the roads throughout the Lake District had been
                     "much improved since Mr. Gray made his tour in 1765
                     [sic], and Mr. Pennant his in 1772", as late as 1821 West’s guidebook
                     (then in its eleventh edition) still cautioned tourists that the roads leading
                     to Ennerdale and Wasdale were, as yet, unimproved [<a class="ref" href="#west1778">West 1778</a>, 2]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#west1821">West 1821</a>, 141]. Roads, in this way, can be seen to have
                     exerted a decided influence over the cultural construction of the Lake District
                     in the eighteenth century: they determined not only which portions of the
                     Lakeland region travellers visited, but also the perspectives those travellers
                     were afforded and, therefore, the descriptions of the region set down in their
                     accounts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25"> So, in the first instance, Figure 7 shows us that Gray, Young and Pennant
                     chiefly went where the local carriage routes and turnpikes enabled them to go.
                     But how, we might ask, did those roadways shape their impression of the places
                     through which they passed? Cultural historians have often remarked, with due
                     amusement, that tourists in the late 1700s moved from scenic vista to scenic
                     vista, collecting sensations in much the same way that modern tourists collect
                     snapshots and souvenirs. Significantly, however, cultural histories of the Lake
                     District tend to quote passages from eighteenth-century travelogues and
                     guidebooks without commenting on the material conditions that determined the
                     writer’s point of view. Thus, whereas Gray’s panoramic description of Grasmere’s "peace, rusticity, and happy poverty"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#gray1775">Gray 1775</a>, 365] is regularly cited as an archetypal display of picturesque sentiment, few
                     scholars have noted that the poet’s perspective of the town was determined by
                     his having first seen it from the road over Dunmail Raise on a sunny autumn
                     afternoon. This is precisely the sort of empirical detail to which reading the
                     tours of Gray, Young and Pennant in relation to visualisations such as the one
                     displayed in Figure 9 helps to alert us. The following examples, from Young’s
                     and Pennant’s accounts of the journey over Shap Fell on the Heron Syke-Eamont
                     Bridge turnpike, help to develop this point further: 
                     <blockquote>

                     late-eighteenth-century vogue for sensational landscape description. When we
                     turn to the map, however, we begin to discern that they are as much shaped by
                     the aesthetic conventions of their era as they are by the situation of the
                     roadway that Young and Pennant followed. With a peak elevation of some 445m
                     above sea level, the route of the old turnpike between Shap and Kendal is
                     notorious for its isolation, exposure and poor weather [<a class="ref" href="#hindle1998">Hindle 1998</a>, 157]. (Even today the M6 at Shap, which rises to only some 315m, is
                     considered one of the highest and most treacherous stretches of road in the UK.)
                     It comes as little surprise, then, that Young and Pennant found the landscape
                     around Shap desolate and oppressive.

                     travel writing and topographical literature: it obliges us to examine local
                     descriptions within the broader geographic context of the traveller’s
                     experience. Rather than thinking in terms of isolated places, the models we have
                     developed emphasize that these writers were describing journeys from place to
                     place. In doing so, these models help remind us that the experience of
                     travelling in the Lake District in the late eighteenth century was not always
                     pleasurable, but that it imposed upon the body in other ways, through the jolts
                     of deep wheel ruts, the hazards of unpaved roads, the exposure to the wind and
                     the rain and the mud. The fact that Gray, Young and Pennant take the time to
                     record these details alongside the various scenes they encounter indicates the
                     importance of the <em class="emph">experience</em> of travel in eighteenth-century travel
                     writing and topographical literature. Young in fact goes so far as to include an
                     appendix in the final volume of his <cite class="title italic">Six Months’
                        Tour</cite>, recording the condition of each stretch of road he travelled —
                     often in exasperated detail. Hence, his damning account of the turnpike from
                     Preston to Wigan: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>I know not, in the whole range of
                           language, terms sufficiently expressive to describe this infernal road… let
                           me most seriously caution all travellers, who may accidentally purpose to
                           travel this terrible country, to avoid it as they would the devil; for
                           thousand to one but they break their limbs by overthrows or breakings down.
                           They will here meet with rutts [sic] which I actually measured four feet
                           deep, and floating with mud only from a wet summer; what therefore must it
                           be [like] after a winter? … These are not merely opinions, but facts, for I
                           actually passed three carts broken down in these eighteen miles of execrable
                           memory. [<a class="ref" href="#young1770">Young 1770</a>, IV, 180–81]

                     role that particular places play in the geographies represented in Gray, Young
                     and Pennant’s accounts. For instance, by examining whether the places that were
                     mentioned but not visited in these accounts have a significant spatial
                     relationship with the paths simulating the itineraries of Gray, Young and
                     Pennant, we can assess how the routes they travelled might have influenced the
                     perception of the places and geographies recorded in their tours. The results of
                     the statistical significance test indicate that places mentioned but not visited
                     in Gray and Young’s account, and in Pennant’s 1769 tour, are closer to the
                     routes than one would expect as a matter of chance alone (Table 1). In the case
                     of Pennant’s 1772 tour, however, the null hypothesis could not be rejected,
                     indicating that there appears not to be a significant relationship between the
                     places mentioned but not visited in his account and the simulated pathway we
                     created from it.

                     research techniques can clue us into the qualitative differences between
                     historical works of travel writing. Specifically, it clues us into the fact that
                     whereas Gray and Young’s account, and Pennant’s second account, are all accounts
                     of journeys <em class="emph">into</em> the Lake District, Pennant’s first account is
                     actually only an account of a journey that <em class="emph">passed by</em> the Lake District.
                     As mentioned above, in his first tour, Pennant simply travelled down the
                     turnpikes linking Carlisle, Kendal and Lancaster on his way home from the
                     Highlands. His account of the Lake District in the account he published in 1771
                     was, therefore, extremely cursory and only made reference to a few famous local
                     places, most of which lay outside his line of travel. Significantly, however,
                     Pennant returned to the region a few years later to view, as he expressed it in
                     his memoirs, "those parts of Lancashire, Westmoreland, and
                     Cumberland, which I had not before seen"
                      [<a class="ref" href="#pennant1793">Pennant 1793</a>, 16]. In this second tour (which was published in 1774) Pennant travelled
                     through the Lake District in a manner similar to Gray and Young — hence, the
                     statistical similarity between these three accounts.

                     distinction between the four works in our case study. More generally, it prompts
                     us to think critically about the role that places that were mentioned but not
                     visited plays within each tour. That each of the four works contains references
                     to such places indicates that the accounts of Gray, Young and Pennant are more
                     than mere itineraries; rather, they are descriptive records that attempt to
                     broaden the reader’s awareness of the geography of the Lake District, which was
                     still a relative <span class="foreign i">terra incognita</span> during the
                     late eighteenth century. The fact that each account contains references to
                     places that the writers did not actually visit suggests Gray, Young and Pennant
                     all endeavoured to give their readers a sense of the surrounding countryside. In
                     fact, when one turns back to the works themselves, one begins to see that the
                     place-names that are mentioned but not visited are often invoked in panoramic
                     descriptions. Thus, for example, Pennant’s account of the mountains visible from
                     the ramparts of Carlisle castle: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>The castle is ancient, but
                           makes a good appearance at a distance: the view from it is fine, of rich
                           meadows, at this time covered with thousands of cattle, it being fair-day.

                     adopt new computational methods, a growing number of researchers are also
                     embracing GIS techniques to extract, examine and explore the spatial

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> The application of GIS technology in literary studies represents an important
                     development. Until recently, however, little has been done to implement more
                     creative approaches to mapping a writer’s movement through space. Advancing from
                     point-based representations to the analysis of raster-based pathways is,
                     therefore, a major step forward in the application of spatial technologies for
                     studying works of travel writing and topographical literature. Such works are, after
                     all, not merely descriptive inventories of places, monuments and
                     buildings; they are narratives that offer first-hand accounts of the journeys of
                     specific individuals. In order to visualise such works adequately we must employ
                     techniques that are capable of representing the places they mention not as
                     discrete locations, but as a series of interconnected points along the line of
                     transit that constitutes the narrator’s tour. As noted at the beginning of this
                     article, is only by assessing works of travel writing as journeys that we can
                     understand how the writers of those works encountered the places and landmarks
                     they described. Thus, with respect to Gray, Young and Pennant, it is only by
                     tracing their journeys through the Lake District that we can hope to obtain
                     insights into how the topography of the region — with its valleys, peaks and
                     mountain passes — shaped the local experiences recounted in their travelogues.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37"> The implementation of these methods, however, is as yet imperfect. One
                     significant complication is that the data used to create the Digital Elevation
                     Models (DEMs) used to perform CSA and LCP comes from modern sources (Lidar
                     images and/or satellite or aerial photographs). This means that they contain the
                     elevation data of modern roads, motorways and towns. Although the routes
                     followed by eighteenth-century Lake District tourists often correspond to the
                     routes of the modern road networks in Cumbria, in many instances there are
                     significant differences between the two [<a class="ref" href="#hindle1998">Hindle 1998</a>, 154–157]. The accuracy of our data could be greatly enhanced by the creation of
                     historical DEMs. This could be accomplished by modifying and integrating to DEMs
                     data from sources such as historical maps. Another important innovation would be
                     the development of spatial models capable of accounting for more variables. The
                     use of different modes of transportation and surfaces based on time instead of
                     relative cost might also furnish new insights into the empirical realities
                     underlying travel narratives. Finally, one must remember that the
                     development of CSA models still relies primarily on quantitative variables and
                     that LCP is still based on a rationale of optimality, which is not always
                     applicable to human behaviour. These are all issues that shall need to be
                     addressed as humanities scholars and Geographic Information Scientists develop,
                     extend and refine the application of geospatial technologies in humanities
                     research.

                     cited herein, we can confidently conclude that spatial analysis can facilitate
                     more nuanced interpretations of works of travel writing and topographical
                     literature. The process of creating a spatial dataset from the tours of Gray,
                     Young and Pennant alerted us to details that most previous studies have
                     overlooked. The simulations we created using this dataset have, moreover,
                     provided the foundation for our on-going research into experimental forms of
                     digital literary geography, such as using Google Earth to create interactive
                     virtual tours. We believe that studies, such as the one presented here, can be
                     productively combined with other emergent forms of geospatial technology to
                     foster innovative collaboration between researchers in the Humanities and the
