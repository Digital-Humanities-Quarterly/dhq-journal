                  <p>A code-critical close reading of two related works by Daniel C. Howe. The artist's
                     <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite> is an installation that visualizes and
                     sonifies minimal-distance paths between English words and thus explores a possibility
                     space that is relatively familiar to western readers, not only readers of English
                     but
                     also readers of any language which uses Latin letters to compose the orthographic
                     word-level elements of its writing system. In Radical of the Vertical Heart <span class="foreign i">忄</span> RotVH) Howe engages with commensurate explorations in
                     certain possibility spaces of the Chinese writing system and of the language’s
                     lexicon. Translinguistically these spaces and, as it were, orthographic
                     architectures, are structured in radically different ways. A comparative close
                     reading of the two works will bring us into productive discursive relationship not
                     only with distinct and code-critically significant programming strategies, but also
                     with under-appreciated comparative linguistic concepts having implications for the
                     theory of writing systems, of text, and of language as such. Throughout, questions
                     concerning the aestheticization of this kind of computational exploration and
                     visualization may also be addressed.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">This essay discusses two distinct but related works by Daniel C. Howe. <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite>, 2012-16, is, in the words of the artist’s
                     description, “a networked installation composed of analog TV
                     monitors and RaspberryPIs running custom software) that explores the creation of
                     aesthetic, linguistic meaning via anticipation, juxtaposition, and association.
                     The algorithm at the heart of the work continually computes the minimum number of
                     substitutions required to transform each valid English word into the next,
                     deriving a near infinite number of combinations of words and phrases,
                     letter-by-letter, substitution-by-substitution.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e215">[1]</a> The
                     algorithm running on each of the usually nine) displays in an <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite> installation is the same, and close reading here effectively
                     focuses on this constituent of the work. <cite class="title italic">Radical of the Vertical
                        Heart <span class="foreign i">忄</span></cite>, 2019-21, the most recent work in
                     what Howe considers a series, 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>searches the Chinese lexicon by
                           repeatedly making minimal changes stroke-by-stroke) to the sub-components of
                           characters, in order to arrive at a new word. Rather than evaluating letters, as
                           in alphabetic machines, this logographic [sic] reader analyses the radicals,
                           components and strokes of characters. When the machine lands on sensitive words,
                           such as those disallowed by China’s Great Firewall or those now illegal in Hong
                           Kong), a break occurs and the machine jumps from traditional [Chinese script
                           forms] to simplified.</p>
                     </blockquote><a class="noteRef" href="#d3e228">[2]</a> As a critical feature of <cite class="title italic">RotVH,</cite> this is
                     aligned with other work by Howe, often engaged with important problems and structures
                     of our predominant digital culture – surveillance, security, power asymmetries,
                     freedom of expression, etc. This essay touches on these matters, particularly insofar
                     as they are addressed by algorithm, data curation, and data structuring, and also
                     comparatively, insofar as they are drawn out by and critiqued in this work’s
                     remarkable translinguistic and transcultural contexts. But for more extensive
                     discussion of the digital politics of Howe’s work, and its aestheticization, the
                     reader is referred to this other work itself.</div>

                     computational art and, as such, they are afforded the potential for re-presentation

                     computer monitors. The code or software of these works is at the core of what they

                     spaces. This discussion, however, concerns itself, chiefly, with the code itself and
                     what is presented by the code as, basically, typographic form on a 2D display, with
                     some accompanying audio: letters and words in the case of <cite class="title italic">Automatype;</cite> strokes, characters, and two-character compounds in the case
                     of <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite>. Audio is used to signal particular

                     natural languages, English on the one hand, Chinese on the other. Except that the
                     situation immediately becomes more complicated. <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite> does have an English lexicon at its disposal but, as it
                     “explores” a mathematically abstracted space of Roman-letteral
                     “spelling,” quite apart from “spellings” that are non-lexical in any

                     complicated but radically different. Arbitrary or regularly abstracted rearrangements
                     or substitutions of any particular character’s strokes or sub-elements will not –
                     or
                     only in extremely rare cases – produce an orthographically readable character in
                     Chinese or a language other than Chinese, but any of the orthographically readable
                     characters which <em class="emph">are</em> produced may be read, entirely differently, in any
                     number of Chinese dialects or, indeed, in any number of other dialects of certain
                     natural languages such as Japanese or Korean. Since Daniel Howe currently lives,
                     works, and exhibits in Hong Kong, readings of <cite class="title italic">RotVH,</cite> for
                     example, have often been anticipated in Mandarin Putonghua) and Cantonese, which are

                     things. It highlights the way in which similarly motivated algorithmic processes may
                     generate language-driven computational artworks with entirely different readings,
                     particularly since these “readings,” quite apart from being metaphoric – that is
                     critical or aesthetic – are also readings of distinct “written” linguistic
                     materials which co-constitute the works. And it also reminds us of deep problems
                     concerning the relationship between, on the one hand, what we call “text” or
                     “writing” or “typography,” or now also – in the context of computation –
                     “<em class="emph">strings</em> of characters,” and, on the other, language as
                     such.</div>

                     until it is considered to be, potentially, readable. This is a statement from my own
                     philosophy and, indeed, ontology of language. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e348">[5]</a> In the
                     context of my theory I am happy to refer this statement to a species-unique human
                     faculty of language;<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e371">[6]</a> in the present context I
                     ask only that those reading this essay agree that the words of <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite> and the characters of <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite> are
                     subject to the possibility, at least, of human reading and interpretation, and that
                     this does have a bearing on their appreciation as art, in particular any art of
                     language that they propose. Their code, however, executes and generates typographic
                     forms without regard to any human reading that may or may not be taking place. From
                     a
                     linguistic perspective, it is the various lexicons and associated data structures
                     embedded in these projects’ software –pre-determined and adopted by the artist prior
                     to any execution of the code – which establish relationships with human reading. The
                     processes which generate their displayed linguistic forms do not.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">They do not, that is, unless, as readers and scholars we believe and assert, amongst
                     other things, that reading and interpretation are reducible to regular, formal,
                     combinatorial processes. One of the important tasks of critical code studies is to
                     articulate this relationship between the code-composed programs “programs” both
                     literal and figurative) insofar as they are generative of linguistic form, and the
                     practices of reading that we bring to them in order to appreciate what they express
                     as language or, indeed, language art. To be clear, I am not in the camp of those who
                     take language to be computable reducible to computation) in any sense of this
                     hypothesis that is abstracted or divorced from evolution or, indeed, history. In
                     close reading these two works, I highlight the disjunctures between coded processes
                     and human reading, and will even argue that these disjunctures, articulated, are
                     themselves amongst the works’ most significant and affective readings. The
                     disjunctures are brought into relief by the similarity of algorithmic process across
                     these works, in contrast to their radically different integrations with the languages
                     they engage. Both works are, I believe, easy enough to understand in terms of what
                     their code is doing, while their readings are also clearly indicative of quite
                     complex differences of language and culture; and also, in the case of <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite>, sociopolitics.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Concluding these introductory and anticipatory remarks, it bears mentioning that this
                     relation between code-generated text and human reading has the same structure,
                     fundamentally, as that which obtains for the increasing predominant practices of
                     Natural Language Processing that are driven by Deep Learning. Except that, when Deep
                     Learning is operative, human readers’ ability to articulate and understand the coded
                     processes are – is it right to say “literally”? – redacted. Deep Learning
                     language models’ “encoding” of “representations” is often presented as a
                     “black box,” received as such even by willing experts. And while, in
                     principle, exhaustive formal analysis may be held to be possible, what is actually
                     concealed from us, as human readers and consumers sic) of the generated
                     pseudo-language, is a number of unsubstantiated assumptions concerning things that
                     we
                     do not and perhaps cannot) know, scientifically or otherwise. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3e414">[7]</a> I would summarize this by saying that, although we speak and
                     read, we still do not know what language is, nor how or why some of it may be
                     aesthetically significant for us. As to this how and why, when we consider <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite> and <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite>, at least
                     we have a chance.</div>

                     with English words spelt out in Roman letters – this distance is a relatively
                     straightforward concept to grasp. Typographic words are, indeed, sequences or

                     comes into play at this point. The strings and sequences over which Levenshtein
                     distances are calculated must be composed of integral, indivisible – at least for
                     the
                     purposes and processing of the algorithm – tokens, the “atoms” of the symbolic
                     system of which they are expressions. The atoms of <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite>’s sequences are letters taken from a familiar, quite clearly
                     delineated set, one that is widely shared over a number of linguistically integrated
                     domains. In linguistic reality, the Roman letters used for English orthography are
                     problematically related to what they purport to represent, the constituents of spoken
                     English “sound-images” as Saussure, for one, would have it). But leaving these
                     problems of reference, representation, and transcription to one side, “English”
                     letters can be read straightforwardly by humans as from a finite set of integral
                     elements. And although minimally semantic, they are included as lexical items in most
                     dictionaries. Letters are, generally speaking, typographic atoms of reading and are

                     writing system? Lexicons in the Chinese cultural sphere typically have characters
                     as
                     the “head words” of their articles although modern dictionaries may also use
                     “compounds” of characters, usually consisting of two characters. In modern
                     Chinese these compounds correspond, linguistically, to the words of English
                     dictionaries. Nonetheless, the Chinese character is, culturally speaking, the
                     “atom” of reading for the languages which use this logographic or, more
                     properly, morphographic system of inscription. <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite>
                     works with two-character compounds. If characters were <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite>’s atoms then Levenshtein distance would be calculated on the basis
                     of <em class="emph">character</em> insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Since single
                     characters are always morphemes and may often correspond with English words in modern
                     Chinese while typically doing so in pre-modern Chinese) they are clearly of a
                     different linguistic order as compared to Roman letters. Morpheme insertion,
                     deletion, and substitution would read – if it did motivate the algorithms of <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite> – as incommensurate with the corresponding operations
                     of <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite>, although, in this speculative condition,

                     items. And it would still also be able to signal and respond to any of its encounters
                     with politically charged two-character terms). But it would never be non-semantic.
                     Its operations would always yield readable and perhaps occasionally poetic)

                     of
                     Chinese characters. There is no generally accepted, rigorous analysis of this feature

                     from linguistic significance, in the sense of any sound-image denotation, than that
                     of alphabetic letters – their implicit deployment in Howe’s calculation resonates
                     with the letters-as-tokens approach that is assumed in standard Levenshtein
                     calculations over alphabetic orthographic typography. Finally, [3] calligraphic or
                     sinotypographic) strokes are also recognized as finest-grained elements of
                     characters. Ordered strokes are what compose the higher-level sub-elements of the
                     de)composition patterns. Howe documents the possibility of using stroke-token
                     sequences for each of the decomposed sub-elements and adding these to calculate a
                     correspondingly finer-grained Levenshtein distance between, for example characters
                     sharing the same de)composition pattern. He proposes to do this in an implicitly
                     weighted manner by adding these distances as a “floating

                     have been put forward in the context of science explicitly. The choice of next

                     triggered to switch to orthographic explorations in whatever is the other system of
                     Chinese spelling, either “trad[itional]” or “simp[lified],” depending on which of the two it was exploring
                     when disrupted by a “trigger.” This shift of orthographic
                     systems might perhaps be interpreted as a futile attempt to “misspell” and thus
                     elude surveillance, but it can never be more than a jolt to either system since the
                     underlying “trigger” is, as we have seen, the same word in
                     any Chinese that matters to the surveillance operations of its PRC state overseers.

                     traumatize, Chinese readers since each system has ideological and political

                     analysis of its elements must be done by way of bespoke or imported data structures

                     systems of inscription, the data structures and functions are already more or less
                     built into actually existing computational infrastructure. The historical reasons

                     is in no way consistent with even a linguistic-scientific analysis of language as
                     such.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e913">[19]</a> We call orthographic spellings “words,” but
                     this is both pragmatic, living-culture convention and scientific misdirection. If

                     adaptation of these infrastructures to systems of inscription for which they are
                     ill-adapted. Close reading of <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite> and <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite> allows us to encounter and explore these contemporary
                     transcultural critical aporias. These two ALMs both read “words” but read them
                     differently, because even the spellings of these words are culturally situated and
                     involve radically different relations to linguistic structure. The ALMs nonetheless
                     deploy algorithms for lexical traversal which are essentially the same. The code is
                     radically different in each case, not only due to the cultural situation of the
                     “words,” but also because the code itself – and contemporary computation as
                     whole – is culturally situated and adapted to particular global locations.</div>

                     by reading grasping, understanding) language’s material traces. These traces are
                     expressed and appreciated chiefly in aurality but also in culturally integrated
                     graphic visuality in writing; or in commensurate modes of language practice in any
                     perceptible material). The faculty that allows this to happen is necessarily
                     constitutive of language, and co-constitutive of “the human.” As such it
                     relies on the evolved and world-integrated embodiment of human animals, such that
                     the “differences” of its integral symbolic system are never abstract. They
                     are better understood as Derridean “differances,” as sayable meanings that
                     emerge as they are expressed – with the kind of ambiguity or polysemy, for
                     example, that embodied animation entails, and as neither pre-determined from a

                     Instar Books, 2015). Parrish’s work generates much of its significance and affect
                     from the socially mediated situation and circumstances of its publication, and
                     thus also from the transactional interventions and engagements of its readers

                     the lexicons used for <cite class="title italic">Automatype</cite> and <cite class="title italic">@everyword</cite> were different, there is clearly a profound
                     underlying “sameness” – a shared ideality if not an identity – to the
                     “texts” of these two works. And either could have used the other’s lexicon
                     without impugning their respective concepts or motivating principles. Moreover, it
                     is similarly the case that the text’s generation by code, in <cite class="title italic">@everyword</cite>, has little or no bearing on its human reading, although
                     the relationship between code and reading is radically different from that which

                     the 12 de)composition patterns; stage [3] tokenized identification of constituent
                     sub-elements from a comprehensive set. Then [4, was 3 in the text] Levenshtein
                     distances between string representations of the sub-elements’ ordered constituent
                     strokes. But it is a significant graphic problem to animate, in any
                     “readable” fashion, the operations of stroke insertion, deletion, and
                     substitution that might be called for or desired.<br /> This brings up a related
                     fact concerning the animated display of <cite class="title italic">R0tVH’s</cite>
                     current version. The part of its animation during which a sub-element is built up
                     is <em class="emph">not</em> a representation of Levenshtein edit operations. This is
                     simply an animation of the stroke-ordered process that a human calligrapher would,
                     by traditional convention, use to write the character’s sub-element. In the
                     current version of <cite class="title italic">RotVH</cite> only the graphic removal of
                     a sub-element and its subsequent animated rendering <em class="emph">as a whole</em> is
                     related to Levenshtein distance, but in the current version it often represents a
                     Levenshtein-distance “tie” since the before and after characters may have the
                     same de)composition value. Otherwise, it counts as a substitution
                     operation.</span></div>
