                     					inspiration for my creative works. In 2014, I attempted to use <span class="foreign i">Nehiyawewin</span> (the Cree language) words as variables
                     					using the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics [<a class="ref" href="#unicode2021">Unicode Inc. 2021</a>]. My
                     					early attempts were instantly problematic because the development environments
                     					(IDEs) I used would render the syllabics, like “ᑖ”, as empty boxes
                     					“⌧”. So I searched for other solutions. However, at that time, the
                     					platforms I was most familiar with, such as Processing, openFrameworks, Java,
                     					and C#, all shared this same “problem.” This experience sparked my desire
                     					to bring Nehiyawewin, in its syllabic form, into being as a programming
                     					language. In this article, I present the physical and abstract challenges of
                     					developing my <cite class="title none">Ancestral Code</cite> digital toolkit that
                     					allows a programmer to insert code blocks into transcribed Indigenous stories
                     					that, once executed, produce a generative visual narrative of the transcribed
                     					story. But for you to better understand this desire’s importance, it is
                     					customary in my heritage to first introduce myself.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">I identify as Nehiyaw-Métis and belong to the Métis Nation of Alberta. The Métis
                     					in Canada are federally recognized as one of the three Indigenous groups of
                     					peoples, the other two being First Nations and Inuit. The Métis have been
                     					historically referred to as half-bloods or, more derogatorily, half-breeds. We
                     					are a people that came to be from the blending of cultures and traditions of
                     the
                     					first European visitors with the numerous Indigenous peoples of the “new
                     						world.” Many of these first visitors were not men seeking to settle; they
                     					were merely coming to seek a better living as fur traders. They were nomadic
                     and
                     					travelled extensively, with many intending to return to their respective
                     					homelands when they retired.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Nevertheless, these traders married into First Nation and Inuit tribal
                     					communities, often for financially strategic reasons.  My Great-Grandfather five times over was a
                     					historically notable English fur trader named John Sayer and was one of these
                     					first visitors. These early relationships between European visitors and
                     					Indigenous peoples continued through generations, with subsequent mixed-racial
                     					generations raised with a blend of European knowledge and their original
                     					Indigenous languages and traditions. This concrescence of cultures and languages
                     					is how the Métis developed into a unique culture that privileges the cultural
                     					teachings of their respective Indigenous heritages without entirely rejecting
                     					their European roots.</div>

                     					my Indigenous heritage. Subsequently, I see computer languages as digital
                     					extensions of Nehiyaw storywork and ceremonies that reflect the epistemological,
                     					ontological, and axiological concerns of my Nehiyaw beliefs and practices. My
                     					perspectives on computer programming critique the prevalent use of English in
                     					coding languages and the reflection of settler/colonial perspectives in their
                     					design. Though I recognize that computer programming languages, like most
                     					technologies, are constantly evolving and changing, I maintain that they are
                     					also seemingly immutable and typically manifest from a “historically-essential … colonial impulse” [<a class="ref" href="#ali2014">Ali 2014</a>]. Most notably, the culture(s) from which modern programming languages and
                     					practices grow “[come] with significant cultural baggage” [<a class="ref" href="#heaven2013">Heaven 2013</a>]. Through my own visual media art explorations with the popular

                     					well documented, from forced displacement from traditional homelands to

                     					as necessary to engage with one another in our digital lives. Yet, critical
                     					theories of technologies are continually demonstrating that digital technologies
                     					are neither “socially or culturally neutral” [<a class="ref" href="#garneau2018">Garneau 2018</a>] nor are they “determinist, but rather [sites] of social

                     					remains vital to Indigenous peoples, who actively utilize these new computing

                     					use <em class="term">wholistic</em> here instead of holistic because Indigenous learning
                     					interconnects all aspects of being that include mind, body, emotion, and spirit

                     						<cite class="title none">Ancestral Code</cite> is my vision of how Nehiyaw

                     					perspectives with western programming practices. To begin this journey, I will
                     					first provide a brief background of what I frame as an Indigenous computing
                     					design theory, describing the importance of this framework when approaching
                     					technology and computing design development with an Indigenous focus. Next, I
                     					describe how this design influences a unique perspective that views “Code as
                     						Story.” And then, I delve into the challenges (and related solutions) to
                     					my ongoing efforts to bring the <cite class="title none">Ancestral Code</cite>
                     					platform for programming in Nehiyawewin to Nehiyaw communities. I hope this

                     					technological context and further foster Indigenous cultural maintenance.
                     					Finally, I surmise and summarize how this work can be used or reproduced by

                        						For instance, cultural attitudes towards concepts of time, order/sequencing,
                        						and efficiency can be radically different from their computational
                        						definitions. For example, I wrote a program to digitally-bead portraits of
                        						my family. The first version of this program used a basic loop to place
                        						pixel-beads on the screen in a sequence of rows, which it did in a
                        						left-to-right fashion. From a computational perspective, this loop was
                        						simple and efficient. However, the original computational instructions did
                        						not reflect my physical action of beading if I were to bead this image by
                        						hand. Nor did it capture the cultural significance of the continuous thread
                        						that connects each bead. There is a special meaning in the unbroken thread.
                        						As a result, I reformatted my code to reflect my Métis beading practice. The
                        						new code created alternating rows of digital beadwork that progress from
                        						left-to-right, then right-to-left in a continuous unbroken stream. This

                        								and can even merge into each other” [<a class="ref" href="#vee2017">Vee 2017</a>]. The relationship between story and code is particularly
                        						evident in esoteric computer languages such as “Inform
                        							7”

                        						stories. Moreover, I argue that “normal” programming languages like
                        						C/C++, C#, and Java also share storytelling’s main elements despite their

                        						the program’s function as it operates up until its “resolution” or
                        						termination. I first learned how to program in elementary school in 1979
                        						using Applesoft BASIC. My teacher explained BASIC’s syntax using story

                           							code positions from 1400hex to 167Fhex. It includes orthographic glyphs

                           							often the main obstacle in using Unicode characters, especially as
                           							variable names and, more problematically, as keywords or reserved words.
                           							Typically, this lack of support is simply because the environment often
                           							uses a pre-installed font that does not contain glyph(s) in the desired
                           							code points of the font file. By default, the coding environments I am
                           							familiar with, such as <cite class="title italic">Visual Studio</cite> and

                           							Syllabics block of glyphs. Until recently, changing this font was not
                           							easy. Although, as of the writing of this article, the settings or
                           							preferences support in some IDEs is open to changing the default font,
                           							some still limit the fonts that can be used. There also are limited

                           							aspects of language with the need for a monospaced coding font reveals
                           							two challenges. The first challenge is that, to my knowledge, only one
                           							monospaced font purposefully includes the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics
                           							blocks, Everson Mono.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e668">[4]</a> The second
                           							challenge is that the physical structure of syllabics makes using
                           							non-fixed-width fonts challenging to navigate as code. The visual
                           							structure of the major glyphs (i.e., the glyphs representing a consonant
                           							and vowel pair) consists of reflected orientations of a single shape
                           							(ex. ᒥ ᒣ ᒪ ᒧ). The resulting printed text is fairly consistently sized
                           							but is visually similar to coding in all English caps. This is not
                           							necessarily a negative, as my original programs written in BASIC were
                           							done in all caps. But a more significant point of consideration is how a
                           							culture perceives the visual design of its language. For example, in
                           							developing typefaces for Canadian syllabics, Canadian typography
                           							designer Kevin King worked directly with Indigenous communities to
                           							ensure their languages were written in the respective community’s
                           							preferred style. He notes that “to ignore this
                           									would result in a text that was neither culturally appropriate
                           									for local readers nor able to convey adequately the meaning and
                           									atmosphere of the text for that readership” [<a class="ref" href="#king2022">King 2022</a>]. Adding to these, the limited number
                           							of monospaced fonts that support Canadian syllabic glyphs encouraged me
                           							to develop a new code-friendly font to address these obstacles. This
                           							font (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>), I tentatively named
                           								“AC Mono,” was constructed using my
                           							wholistic design framework, and my choices in the font design process
                           							are consciously aware of Indigenous visual aesthetics. I want to note
                           							here that my design of this font was considered from a more
                           							pan-Indigenous perspective and not specific to Nehiyaw culture. This is
                           							because the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics is not Nehiyaw
                           							specific – it represents glyphs from various North American Indigenous
                           							languages. For example, as seen in the syllabic T-series glyphs like
                           								“tâ” (ᑖ) and “te” (ᑌ), I used thicker lines, an emphasis
                           							on fluidity in the curves, and rounded features on the start and end
                           							points of the strokes. These organic geometries and gestures are found
                           							in numerous Indigenous art traditions in North America, including the
                           							ovoid traditions of Coast-Salish artforms, Inuit bone and stone carving,
                           							and Métis beadwork.</div>

                           							is used often in teaching syllabics and contains several culturally
                           							specific teachings. For example, as a student at University nuhelot’ine

                           							medicine lodge (i.e., tipi), and “ᑕ” can be interpreted as the toe
                           							of a moccasin. Whether or not these story sources are the true

                           							usability for typing everyday documents. I found the star design
                           							keyboard was best suited as the primary interface for coding with
                           							Nehiyawewin in the <cite class="title none">Ancestral Code</cite> programming
                           							environment (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). Similarly, testing
                           							these designs with Nehiyawewin language-learners, users found typing
                           							syllabics with a “star” keyboard easier than QWERTY layouts because
                           							of the grouping of syllabic sounds in each of the four quadrants
                           							establishes a mental-map making locating syllabics by sound easier. For
                           							example, all the “i” syllabics are located in the keyboard's top
                           							left and top vertical. This relationship between spoken language,
                           							computer language, and teachings of the syllabic orthography is
                           							meaningful and is one that I feel is better supported by a device
                           							derived from Nehiyawewin pedagogy.</div>

                        						investigating how to engage with Nehiyawewin programmatically. I initially
                        						approached this project with a very naive and western mindset. I considered
                        						common modern computing ideas and abstractions that included
                        							<em class="term">variables</em>, <em class="term">data types</em>, <em class="term">loops</em>,
                        							<em class="term">conditional branching</em>, and <em class="term">linear/sequential
                           							instructions</em> (i.e., lines of code), and embarked on a journey to
                        						convert their English versions to Nehiyawewin. Thinking that some of these
                        						concepts would easily convert from English to Nehiyawewin, I quickly
                        						realized that this approach of language substitution in Nehiyawewin would
                        						not work. As I discovered on my first day as a Nehiyawewin student,
                        						Nehiyawewin technically does not have a word for “computer,” let alone
                        						any of the programming concepts I was hoping to capture. Technological words
                        						in English like <em class="term">programming</em>, <em class="term">network</em>, and
                        							<em class="term">protocol</em> I found were, for the most part,
                        							“non-translatable” to Nehiyawewin, at least not a way I could use
                        						in developing a programming language. Today, finding appropriate Nehiyaw
                        						cultural meanings that can map to technological terminology remains the
                        						biggest challenge in developing the <cite class="title none">Ancestral

                        						platform. Nevertheless, I took these challenges with language and formulated
                        						an approach that involved finding easily translatable concepts (if they
                        						existed), and borrowing from Nehiyaw language construction and word forms to
                        						create a unique coding paradigm.</div>

                           							and computer programmer Kari Noe for introducing me to this
                           							philosophical change. Noe was a member of a Ōlelo Hawai’ian programming
                           							team engaged with translating C# into Hawai’ian [<a class="ref" href="#muzyka2018">Muzyka 2018</a>]. She described the “if/then/else”
                           							statement as an example where the “if/then/else” statement does not
                           							make sense when translated from English to Hawai’ian. The programming
                           							team consulted with native Hawai’ian speakers and community members to
                           							find meaningful terms that could be both culturally appropriate and
                           							programmatically practical. The result for “if/then/else” becomes
                           								<span class="foreign i">muliwai</span>, the Hawai’ian word for
                           								“river”. The idea of rivers being able to branch from the main
                           							waterway and eventually rejoin the main river later provided a better
                           							conceptualization of a Hawai’ian context than the English
                           								“if/then/else” statement. This culturally-aware solution in
                           							their language was not only inspirational but fundamentally altered how
                           							I was approaching the relationships between computing concepts and
                           							cultural relevance. Though I recognize that Hawai’ian peoples’
                           							relationship with water is considerably different from those of the
                           							Indigenous peoples of the Americas, water is no less important. In
                           							Nehiyaw culture, water is a medicine, a provider of life, and is sacred.

                              								<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1382">[10]</a> is the word for dog. When you prefix

                              									great/large/big,” the resulting word <span class="foreign i">mistatim</span> is formed, which can mean “big dog,”
                              								but is more commonly used to mean “horse.” Adding the

                              									“[something] is small or little,” to <span class="foreign i">atim</span>, the result is <span class="foreign i">acimosis</span> meaning “little dog” or

                              								be semantically or syntactically correct in Nehiyawewin speech. So,
                              								for example, using a numeric variable called <span class="foreign i">atim</span>, you can use the following statement:<br />

                              								perceptions of coding in line-by-line formats. A simple coding
                              								example would be the completion command for <span class="foreign i">sîpiy</span>, <span class="monospace">sîpiy
                                 									kîsipayiw</span><a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1526">[12]</a>. In this case, <span class="foreign i">sîpiy kîsipayiw</span> and <span class="foreign i">kîsipayiw sîpiy</span> mean the same thing.
                              								Although, as a coder, I can use “end river” or “river
                              									ends,” it does not matter the order of the tokens as they are
                              								not fixed. A more expanded example uses this same idea but applies
                              								to whole lines or activities, as in a looping construction where a

                           							culture is <em class="term">the smudge</em>. A <em class="term">smudge</em> is a small,
                           							personal ceremonial practice where the burning of an Indigenous
                           							medicinal herb such as sweetgrass or sage is used to “cleanse” and
                           								“purify” the individual. When <em class="term">smudging</em>, people
                           							pass their hands or objects to be “blessed” through the rising
                           							smoke trails. In a normal smudge, you use your hands to draw the smoke
                           							towards you – blessing your head, ears, eyes, mouth, heart, and body
                           							with the smoke. And then, you “bless” anything else you wish to be
                           							cleared of negative energies, such as food, tobacco, eyeglasses, or even
                           							your laptop. Essentially, smudging is responsible for blessing anything
                           							that can affect any of your four spirits. I have even heard stories from
                           							several Nehiyaw and Métis Elders that have physically smudged their
                           							laptop to purify it before “Googling.” In the context of ceremony,
                           							this idea of “cleansing” is something that computers do regularly.
                           							Whether it is emptying the trash bin, clearing memory, resetting the
                           							graphics display, or deleting a browser’s cache, the intent of all these
                           							activities is to remove items that can negatively affect the system’s
                           							operation. Therefore, the first command in an <cite class="title none">Ancestral Code</cite> program is <span class="monospace">miyâhkasike</span> which is “to smudge with sage/sweetgrass,”
                           							or <span class="monospace">tisamân</span><a class="noteRef" href="#d3e1771">[18]</a>, which is “to smudge (in general),” both serve
                           							the same purpose of preparing the system. The choice of which smudge
                           							command to use is up to the programmer. However, I personally feel that
                           							a program that relates a sacred story or contains culturally specific or
                           							significant knowledge in the code would start with <span class="monospace">miyâhkasike</span>, being more purposeful than
                           							the more generic <span class="monospace">tisamân</span>. These

                           							is its significance to aging and identity in Nehiyaw culture. For
                           							example, in Nehiyawewin, I say, “I am currently 49 winters
                           								old.” As heard from respected Nehiyaw culture and language
                           							instructor Reuben Quinn, we use “winter” and not another season
                           							because back in the days before “comfortable housing” in the
                           							northern climes of what is now Canada, surviving winter signified your
                           							resilience and survival of the most extreme elements of Earth Mother
                           								[<a class="ref" href="#quinn2021">Quinn 2021</a>]. Surviving winter is a valued and
                           							personal accomplishment. The symbolism in “winter” as a programming
                           							keyword lies in its representation as a repeatable cycle and in its
                           							relationships to aging and resilience that naturally imply increased
                           							experience and knowledge. So, similar to when a western-formatted

                           							upon previously executed statements — the loop “ages” as it
                           							progresses and continues until the loop conditions are met or
