                     					for inspiration for my creative works. In 2014, I attempted to use <span class="foreign i">Nehiyawewin</span> (the Cree language) words as variables
                     					using the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (Unicode, Inc. 2021). My early
                     					attempts were instantly problematic because the development environments (IDEs)
                     					I used would render the syllabics, like ‹ᑖ›, as empty boxes ‹⌧›. So I searched
                     					for other solutions. However, at that time, the platforms I was most familiar
                     					with, such as Processing, openFrameworks, Java, and C#, all shared this same
                     						“problem”. This experience sparked my desire to bring Nehiyawewin, in
                     					its syllabic form, into being as a programming language. In this article, I
                     					present the physical and abstract challenges of developing my Ancestral Code
                     					digital toolkit that allows a programmer to insert code blocks into transcribed

                        						groups of peoples, the other two being First Nations and Inuit. The Métis
                        						have been historically referred to as half-bloods or, more derogatorily,
                        						half-breeds. We are a people that came to be from the blending of cultures
                        						and traditions of the first European visitors with the numerous Indigenous
                        						peoples of the “new world.” Many of these first visitors were not men
                        						seeking to settle; they were merely coming to seek a better living as fur
                        						traders. They were nomadic and travelled extensively, with many intending to

                        						provide a brief background of what I frame as an Indigenous computing design
                        						theory, describing the importance of this framework when approaching
                        						technology and computing design development with an Indigenous focus. Next,
                        						I describe how this design influences a unique perspective that views
                        							“Code as Story.” And then, I delve into the challenges (and related
                        						solutions) to my ongoing efforts to bring the Ancestral Code platform for
                        						programming in Nehiyawewin to Nehiyaw communities. I hope this platform can
                        						open new opportunities for heritage language use in our modern technological
                        						context and further foster Indigenous cultural maintenance. Finally, I

                           							an Indigenous Wholistic Computing Design Theory can, and will, often be
                           							at odds with western philosophies on computer function and design. For
                           							instance, cultural attitudes towards concepts of time, order/sequencing,
                           							and efficiency can be radically different from their computational
                           							definitions. For example, I wrote a program to digitally-bead portraits
                           							of my family. The first version of this program used a basic loop to
                           							place pixel-beads on the screen in a sequence of rows, which it did in a
                           							left-to-right fashion. From a computational perspective, this loop was
                           							simple and efficient. However, the original computational instructions
                           							did not reflect my physical action of beading if I were to bead this
                           							image by hand. Nor did it capture the cultural significance of the
                           							continuous thread that connects each bead. There is a special meaning in
                           							the unbroken thread. As a result, I reformatted my code to reflect my
                           							Métis beading practice. The new code created alternating rows of digital
                           							beadwork that progress from left-to-right, then right-to-left in a
                           							continuous unbroken stream. This updated code better represents my
                           							physical process instead of code that created patterns that flowed in
                           							one direction, from left-to-right, as multiple individual lines instead
                           							of a continuous loop. The ‘best’ or ‘most efficient’ code fractures the
                           							image’s construction, resulting in digitally rendered images conforming
                           							to the technological tools’ design and language, favouring efficiency

                     <div class="ptext" id="p14"><span class="hi">What is coding if not a story? At a basic level, a story consists of five
                           							essential components: character(s), setting, plot, conflict, and
                           							resolution. Scholar Annette Vee, known for her study of composition and
                           							rhetoric in computer programming literacy, compares narrative writing
                           							with computer programming stating that they “are not the same thing
                           							[but] have a lot in common and can even merge into each other” (Vee
                           							2017, 95). The relationship between story and code is particularly
                           							evident in esoteric computer languages such as </span><span class="hi italic">Inform 7 </span><span class="hi">(Aikin 2009) and </span><span class="hi italic">Shakespeare</span><span class="hi"> (Hasselström and Åslund 2001), where code is
                           							literally formatted as stories. Moreover, I argue that ‘normal’
                           							programming languages like C/C++, C#, and Java also share storytelling’s
                           							main elements despite their visual structure, notation, syntax, and
                           							semantic constructions. In ‘normal’ programming languages, these story
                           							elements exist in more abstract contexts where variables represent the
                           							‘characters,’ the ‘setting’ is the programming environment, and the
                           							‘plot’ is the program’s function as it operates up until its
                           							‘resolution’ or termination. I first learned how to program in
                           							elementary school in 1979 using Applesoft BASIC. My teacher explained
                           							BASIC’s syntax using story examples. I was so enthralled with the idea
                           							of being able to represent the world around me using computer code that

                           							that is, what font family/typeface to use for coding with syllabics, and

                              								environment often uses a pre-installed font that does not contain
                              								glyph(s) in the desired code points of the font file. By default,

                              								Consolas, Courier, or Monospace. These fonts are common to Windows
                              								OS systems but do not have the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics block

                              								challenges. The first challenge is that, to my knowledge, only one
                              								monospaced font purposefully includes the Canadian Aboriginal
                              								Syllabics blocks, </span>Everson Mono.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e506">[4]</a><span class="hi"> The
                              								second challenge is that the physical structure of syllabics makes
                              								using non-fixed-width fonts challenging to navigate as code. The
                              								visual structure of the major glyphs (i.e., the glyphs representing
                              								a consonant and vowel pair) consists of reflected orientations of a
                              								single shape (ex. </span><span class="hi">‹ </span><span class="hi">ᒥ ᒣ ᒪ ᒧ</span><span class="hi">›)</span><span class="hi">.
                              								The resulting printed text is fairly consistently sized but is
                              								visually similar to coding in all English caps. This is not
                              								necessarily a negative, as my original programs written in BASIC
                              								were done in all caps. But a more significant point of consideration
                              								is how a culture perceives the visual design of its language. For
                              								example, in developing typefaces for Canadian syllabics, Canadian
                              								typography designer Kevin King worked directly with Indigenous
                              								communities to ensure their languages were written in the respective
                              								community’s preferred style. He notes that “to ignore this would
                              								result in a text that was neither culturally appropriate for local
                              								readers nor able to convey adequately the meaning and atmosphere of
                              								the text for that readership” (King 2022). Adding to these, the
                              								limited number of monospaced fonts that support Canadian syllabic
                              								glyphs encouraged me to develop a new code-friendly font to address
                              								these obstacles. This font (Figure 1), I tentatively named ‘AC
                              								Mono,’ was constructed using my wholistic design framework, and my
                              								choices in the font design process are consciously aware of
                              								Indigenous visual aesthetics. I want to note here that my design of
                              								this font was considered from a more pan-Indigenous perspective and
                              								not specific to Nehiyaw culture. This is because the Unified
                              								Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics is not Nehiyaw specific – it
                              								represents glyphs from various North American Indigenous languages.
                              								For example, as seen in the syllabic T-series glyphs like ‘tâ’
                              								</span><span class="hi">‹ </span><span class="hi">ᑖ</span><span class="hi">›</span><span class="hi"> and ‘te’ </span><span class="hi">‹
                              								</span><span class="hi">ᑌ</span><span class="hi">›</span><span class="hi">, I used thicker lines, an emphasis on
                              								fluidity in the curves, and rounded features on the start and end

                           							where the burning of an Indigenous medicinal herb such as sweetgrass or
                           							sage is used to ‘cleanse’ and ‘purify’ the individual. When smudging,
                           							people pass their hands or objects to be ‘blessed’ through the rising
                           							smoke trails. In a normal smudge, you use your hands to draw the smoke
                           							towards you – blessing your head, ears, eyes, mouth, heart, and body
                           							with the smoke. And then, you ‘bless’ anything else you wish to be
                           							cleared of negative energies, such as food, tobacco, eyeglasses, or even
                           							your laptop. Essentially, smudging is responsible for blessing anything
                           							that can affect any of your four spirits. I have even heard stories from
                           							several Nehiyaw and Métis Elders that have physically smudged their
                           							laptop to purify it before ‘Googling.’ In the context of ceremony, this
                           							idea of ‘cleansing’ is something that computers do regularly. Whether it
                           							is emptying the ‘trash bin,’ clearing memory, resetting the graphics
                           							display, or deleting a browser’s cache, the intent of all these
                           							activities is to remove items that can negatively affect the system’s
                           							operation. Therefore, the first command in an Ancestral Code program is

                           							programmer. However, I personally feel that a program that relates a
                           							sacred story or contains culturally specific or significant knowledge in

                           							instructor Reuben Quinn, we use ‘winter’ and not another season because
