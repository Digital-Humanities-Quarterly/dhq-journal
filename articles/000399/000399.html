                  <p> This paper presents findings from a set of contextual inquiry sessions completed
                     in 2016 as part of the four year <cite class="title italic">Digital Scholarly
                        Workflow</cite> project (2012-2016) conducted at the Pennsylvania State
                     University and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Studying humanists’
                     workflows through contextual inquiry enabled us to gain valuable empirical
                     insights into digital scholarship from the perspective of individual scholars.
                     This small-scale observational study (N=8) supplemented findings from our larger
                     scale (N=196) and medium scale (N=23) studies previously completed in the
                     project, allowing us to develop deeper qualitative understanding of how
                     humanists’ research practices change in the encounter with digital technologies.
                     Through close contextual analysis of information-based research activities we
                     illustrate how humanists build rich personal collections of digital sources,
                     which become important information resources in their work. We also examine how
                     adoption of digital tools transforms the established methods of managing primary
                     and secondary sources, bringing hastier digital workflows to traditionally more
                     methodical work. Finally, we show that efficiency cannot be qualified as a
                     neutral or inherent characteristic of digital tools, independent of scholars’
                     practices, since scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts determines what
                     constitutes efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholar’s workflow. We
                     conclude that in humanists’ workflows digital and analog tools and resources do
                     not necessarily replace one another or vie for the dominant position. They
                     rather supplement each other in an interconnected, hybrid workflow that comes to
                     our respondents as an organic manifestation of their work, and as an
                     illustration of the bricolage character of humanists’ digital workflows.

                     the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The first part of the project (2012-2014)
                     analyzed how scholars across disciplines engage with digital technologies at
                     different phases of the research lifecycle, pointing at gaps in existing tools,
                     services, and infrastructures (see: [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872015">Antonijević 2015</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872014">Antonijević and Cahoy 2014</a>]). While acknowledging the importance of
                     domain-based and subject-specific research practices across the humanities (see:
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wineburg2001">Wineburg 2001</a>]), our study sought to understand some of the
                     common features of humanists’ digital workflows as compared to those in the
                     sciences, and to identify the distinctive features that software architecture
                     should have in order to support humanists’ research.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> The first phase of our project thus identified preferences and areas of strain
                     in the research workflows — specifically around discovery, organization, and
                     storage of research materials — and revealed distinct disciplinary differences.
                     For instance, humanities scholars preferred using local discovery tools, such as
                     the Penn State library catalog, more often than Sciences faculty. Humanists also
                     noted a lack of digital technology use in data collection and analysis phases of
                     their research process. Further, humanities scholars had the highest percentage
                     of lost and inaccessible research files, and were more likely than other
                     disciplines to curate their research file collections. Finally, phase I showed
                     that integration of digital tools into humanists’ search activities often
                     resulted in a breakdown of their systems for organizing information, previously
                     developed for print based materials [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872014">Antonijević and Cahoy 2014</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> Building on those findings, phase II of our study (2014-2016) focused on
                     observing humanists’ research and use of digital research tools <span class="foreign i">in situ</span>, through a series of contextual inquiry
                     sessions. Contextual inquiry showed that digital technologies have transformed
                     scholarly work in the humanities not only as reflected in the discourse of
                     digital humanities, but through daily practices of working scholars and through
                     some perhaps surprising integrations with long standing analog work routines. In
                     this paper we demonstrate, for instance, how impromptu on-site digitization of
                     archival materials with the use of digital cameras change scholars’ research in
                     both rewarding and challenging ways. Through such practices scholars build rich
                     personal collections of digitized primary sources, which become one of the
                     central information resources in their work. Our findings show, however, that
                     digital tools and resources do not necessarily replace analog or compete for the
                     dominant position, but form an interconnected stream, illustrative of the
                     bricolage character of humanists’ digital workflows.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"> Our view of humanists as bricoleurs builds on conceptual understanding of
                     bricolage developed over the past fifty years. While the notion of bricolage as
                     a process and bricoleur as an agent derives from Lévi-Strauss’s (1962) analysis
                     of mythical thinking, it assumed broader epistemological meaning already in this
                     original account. Soon after, and thanks to its broad generative capacity,
                     bricolage attained the status of a universal concept applied across knowledge
                     domains as diverse as evolutionary biology [<a class="ref" href="#jacob1977">Jacob 1977</a>],

                     also became used in the context of scholarly work, specifically related to
                     interdisciplinarity and multiperspectivism in the adoption of research methods,
                     data sources, and theories (see: [<a class="ref" href="#denzin2000">Denzin and Lincoln 2000</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kincheloe2001">Kincheloe 2001</a>]).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7"> Our analysis of bricolage in humanists’ scholarly work does not follow this
                     trajectory of explicit methodological and epistemological examination, nor does
                     it consider Derrida’s (1997/1967) approach to bricolage as discourse. Rather, we
                     seek to return to Lévi-Strauss’s inquiry into bricolage as situated practice and
                     its specific ideology of unscripted approach to technology expressed in the
                     comparison between engineers and bricoleurs discussed in more detail in the
                     conclusion of this essay (see also: [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2012">Johnson 2012</a>]). Along these
                     lines we argue that humanists observed in our study engage with digital tools in
                     a highly personal, unscripted way, which corresponds to their style of thinking
                     and working, to their intimate epistemology. Our respondents do not experience
                     digital workflow as a technical activity, but as a subjective process of
                     knowledge production in which they freely combine diverse tools and resources
                     suited to their sensibilities and research needs. Such use of digital
                     technologies also emerges from their understanding of efficiency as
                     contextualized in scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts, not as a
                     presumably inherent characteristic of digital tools independent of scholars’
                     practices. Certain methodological and epistemological inferences that we offer
                     in the conclusion of this essay thus seek to inform DH theory via DH praxis, in
                     line with the orientation of our study.

                     to enhance Zotero based on our research findings. Two software optimizations
                     were developed and launched, centered on discovery, organization, and archiving
                     in the research workflow. A Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed reader was
                     introduced in Zotero that allowed researchers to receive notifications from
                     their favorite journals and other publishers as new publications appear. A
                     Zotero “My Publications” workflow was also created,
                     offering researchers the capability to self-archive their work. These items
                     could then be automatically deposited into a Hydra-based institutional
                     repository via a new tool, Arkivo, developed for the project (see: <a href="https://github.com/zotero/arkivo-sufia" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/zotero/arkivo-sufia'); return false" class="ref">https://github.com/zotero/arkivo-sufia</a>). The second phase of the

                     towards centering specific research activities within the Zotero interface for
                     greater workflow productivity and cohesiveness (see: [<a class="ref" href="#cahoy2018">Cahoy 2018</a>]).

                     results gathered through contextual inquiries. Specifically, we focus on results
                     related to the research activities of finding, organizing, and storing digital
                     research data and materials, which were the focal point of phase II of our
                     project. The initial project phase, which analyzed scholars’ information
                     behavior at all stages of the research lifecycle, showed that the important
                     links and mutual influences among these research activities are not always fully
                     recognized, so, in phase II, we sought to contribute to filling in those
                     analytical gaps. The paper concludes with the vision of scholars as bricoleurs,
                     and with suggestions on how to approach digital scholarship in the humanities
                     based on ethnographic understanding of digital workflows in context.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12"> Contextual inquiry is a qualitative method that combines traditional
                     ethnographic techniques into a potent heuristic for gathering data about
                     contextualized and naturally-occurring activities (see: [<a class="ref" href="#holtzblatt1993">Holtzblatt and Jones 1993</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#bednar2014">Bednar and Welch 2014</a>]). Context refers to
                     a set of interconnected conditions in which analyzed activities take place, and
                     which motivate and shape those activities. In this study, contextual inquiry
                     concentrated on the digital workflows of eight humanities scholars in the course
                     of their daily research. This small-scale observational study thus supplemented
                     findings from our preceding larger and medium-scale studies completed in phase
                     I, allowing us to develop deeper qualitative understanding of how humanists’
                     research practices change in the encounter with digital technologies. Scholars
                     consulted in the contextual inquiries included four male and four female
                     participants, most of whom (6) were tenured professors. More than half of the
                     contextual inquiry sessions (5) were conducted at scholars’ offices and on
                     average lasted 90 minutes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e366">[2]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13"> Two researchers attended each of the sessions and used the same observational
                     guide, which provided for the consistency and easier standardization of research
                     notes and findings. These researchers quietly sat aside observing study
                     participants as they carried out their work, interrupting only if a
                     clarification was needed, and taking detailed notes of the observed workflows.
                     We did not assign any tasks to the participants, but asked them instead to
                     engage in the information-based research activities they planned for the day,
                     and to guide us through those activities by thinking aloud about why they are
                     doing what they are doing. The respondents’ verbal accounts were audio-recorded
                     and later professionally transcribed. Both the session transcripts and the
                     researchers’ notes were coded for activities, patterns, themes, and respondents’
                     experiences in interacting with digital tools. All information that could have
                     been identified with individual study participants remained confidential. The
                     quotations used in this text are thus presented through pseudonyms, and some of
                     the quotations have been slightly edited for privacy, clarity, and length. In
                     the following, we first discuss how our respondents search for research data and
                     materials, and we then turn to reviewing their activities related to storing and
                     organizing those materials.

                     web of resources, both electronic and paper-based. This study focuses on
                     electronic resources for two reasons. First, the study explored
                     <em class="emph">digital</em> workflows, that is, the integration of digital tools
                     and resources into humanists’ practice. Second, contextual inquiry allowed
                     direct observation of scholars’ use of online resources, while the information
                     on their use of libraries, archives, and other physical collections could have
                     been inferred only indirectly, through the respondents’ accounts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15"> Contextual inquiry showed that humanists predominantly use online resources to
                     search for secondary sources, such as journal articles and books. In
                     discovery search, they frequently use commercial search engines like Google and
                     Google Scholar, while library portals and academic databases mostly serve for
                     known item search and access. Contextual inquiry thus confirmed the findings of
                     phase I of our project and other relevant studies (see: [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872015">Antonijević 2015</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872014">Antonijević and Cahoy 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#nicholas2011">Nicholas et al. 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#asher2013">Asher, Duke, and Wilson 2013</a>]). Humanists also
                     explore more specialized online resources, such as movie databases and newspaper
                     online archives, as well as their personal collections of digital and/or
                     digitized materials. Among our respondents, the search for primary sources
                     largely takes place offline, in archival and other physical collections, and to
                     “digitize material” typically means to take a digital
                     photo of an archival document and to store it as a JPEG file for further use.
                     Such on-site digitized primary materials grow over time into humanists’ rich
                     personal collections, becoming a vital information resource these scholars
                     regularly access in their research.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16"> For instance, in one of the contextual inquiry sessions, Audrey, a professor of
                     history, searched for literature on an event that took place in 1916, and for
                     which she had only partial information. Audrey’s search starts with her personal
                     collection of notes written in Word and stored on the internal hard drive. She
                     uses a Word search function that queries the folder for a supposed event name,
                     but this search yields no result. Audrey then switches to her browser and the
                     online search. She logs on to the Penn State library and enters a search
                     phrase composed of three descriptors into the discovery search interface,
                     LionSearch. This attempt does not yield any results either. “Okay, no problem, I’m going to go to some of my favorite
                     databases,” Audrey says optimistically, and, using the same search
                     phrase, she continues her search in the <cite class="title italic">Historical
                        Abstracts</cite> database.
                     “All right, I need another field. It
                     happened in Rome,” she comments still optimistically, and expands her
                     search with one more field, which reads “Rome.” Still nothing. “Seriously?!,” Audrey exclaims with
                     annoyance. “All right, let me just do
                     ‘war council,’ something more specific,” she says with
                     reasserted optimism, and changes her search phrase accordingly. Failure again.
                     “Really?!,” Audrey laments in
                     shock. “I would have thought it was more
                     important.” Audrey then reaches to her bookshelf and grabs a book.
                     She reads through a few pages, trying to find any additional information that
                     could help her search. Nothing. But Audrey is not ready to give up yet.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p17"> She returns to her library search and adds “November” as one more search
                     field, trying to make her query as precise as possible. No results. Still,
                     Audrey does not give up, and, instead of adding one more search term, she
                     decides to change her search phrase. She creates a new search phrase, again
                     composed of three descriptors as the possible event name. “Nope. All right, strange,” Audrey says quietly,
                     confident that any further search would be pointless. “You would think someone must have written an article about
                     this. It was the time that the different allies got together and hammered
                     out a strategy …,” she continues murmuring, but discontinues her
                     library search. Instead, Audrey decides to try her luck with Google Search. She
                     enters the search phrase and the Wikipedia entry pops up right away. “See, that’s the thing,” Audrey
                     comments. “One would love to use more
                     scholarly resources, but I just typed [the search phrase] and it’s up there
                     [on Wikipedia]! Sadly, <cite class="title italic">Historical Abstracts</cite> was
                     not of too much use; the most useful one was still Wikipedia,” this
                     historian concludes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18"> Dominance of non-academic search services was also observable in the case of
                     Theodora, an associate professor of architecture, whose search for publications
                     on housing in the Soviet Union started directly with Google Scholar, omitting
                     the library portal. Theodora starts by opening the Google Scholar page in her
                     web browser and entering search keywords, “Soviet Housing.” Before looking
                     at the search results, Theodora reaches to both the <cite class="title italic">Zotero</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Papers</cite> citation managers
                     and creates a new collection in each of them, which she will use to store the
                     materials found online. Theodora creates the collections manually, since she
                     does not “trust the program to use its
                     smart features.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e465">[3]</a>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19"> Here we see that activities of finding and storing research materials can be so
                     intertwined in scholars’ practices that setting up a storage folder goes in
                     parallel, or even precedes search. Through her workflow and narration in the
                     contextual inquiry, we learn that Theodora uses <cite class="title italic">Zotero</cite> for saving bibliographic information about books, and <cite class="title italic">Papers</cite>, for which she has paid subscription, for
                     saving downloaded articles. Theodora relates that she particularly appreciates
                     the <cite class="title italic">Papers</cite> activity tab, which she calls “the magic finding feature,” which
                     recommends further readings based on the articles she stored, and also enables
                     her to discover tweets and other posts about those articles. Yet, despite
                     highlighting the “magic finding feature,” Theodora does not
                     use <cite class="title italic">Papers</cite>’ built-in search tool, but carries out
                     her searches through Google. This also influences the way in which she imports
                     materials to <cite class="title italic">Papers</cite>. Instead of using the built-in
                     import tool, Theodora downloads files from Google and saves them on her desktop,
                     after which she moves them to <cite class="title italic">Papers</cite>. This rather
                     untrained use of <cite class="title italic">Papers</cite> is a confirmation of
                     findings from the first phase of our study, which revealed that only a modest
                     percentage of humanists use citation managers — one third (33%) of those
                     surveyed — and, when they do use them, they employ them on a rather basic level
                     (see: [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872015">Antonijević 2015</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872014">Antonijević and Cahoy 2014</a>]).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20"> After setting up new collections in both citation managers, Theodora returns to
                     the web browser and starts reading through the results that Google Scholar
                     yielded. “This one – it’s an edited
                     volume, so I’ll look at that later. It is from 2005 and it’s talking about
                     the Soviet Union, which is a little bit weird, but it looks like it might be
                     OK,” Theodora thinks out loud, as she looks through her search
                     results. She opens the link to the collection in Google Books, and saves it in
                     <cite class="title italic">Zotero</cite>. “I’m going to save it to <cite class="title italic">Zotero</cite>. Since I just
                     created that [new collection], I’ll automatically dump it in there,”
                     she explains. Theodora further elaborates that it is the same search process she
                     uses for all electronic publications. The first round is a quick run through
                     search materials, where she collects and saves everything that seems interesting
                     and relevant for the project. In the second round, she looks closely at the
                     saved materials and decides which of them to keep. Finally, she organizes kept

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21"> Such a process of collecting and managing electronic information we observed
                     with almost all the humanists who participated in both phases of this project.
                     Faced with a deluge of information available online, humanists commonly collect
                     everything that seems relevant, “dumping” it into their hard
                     drives, citation managers, or Dropbox folders for further examination. Detecting
                     such a trend, Pampson (2014) posits that scholars “unsystematically gather materials, never certain when
                     an object might come in handy,” and observes that over time “folders seem to grow in number and size
                     geometrically” generating a ceaseless flow of information [<a class="ref" href="#papson2013">Papson 2013</a>, 387]. Our study implies, however, that
                     seemingly unsystematic scholars’ information seeking and storing behavior
                     actually has deeper and more systematic roots. One origin of such information
                     behavior relates to the essence of humanistic inquiry, which does not
                     necessarily constitute a search for evidence, but for multiple and often
                     opposing points of view. Humanists thus search for and collect materials until
                     they reach the point of data saturation, as one of our study participants
                     explained:

direction, so it’s kind of redundancy that begins to tell you [when to
end your search].</tt></pre></blockquote>

                     </div> Peter imports to Zotero all publications that look relevant for
                     his research, but acknowledges that it can take months before he moves from this
                     first round to the second round, when he goes back to Zotero and actually reads
                     those materials. “It’s conceivable, I’d
                     never would come back [to Zotero ] and do much for this, but I
                     might,” Peter specifies. He recognizes that this way of working might
                     be inefficient, but stresses that such inefficiencies constitute a critical part
                     of humanistic research. This point is important for broader understanding of
                     humanists’ digital workflows and their interaction with digital technologies. It
                     illustrates that efficiency is not a neutral or an inherent characteristic of
                     digital tools, resources, or workflows independent of scholars’ practices.
                     Rather, efficiency is construed through scholars’ interaction with digital
                     artifacts, as we discuss throughout the paper.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22"> Among the respondents in this study, the only exception from the above-described
                     online search practice was Linda, a research associate in comparative and
                     international literature, whose information behavior included a careful
                     selection of online materials already in the first round of encountering them.
                     Like Theodora, Linda starts her search in Google Scholar by entering a search
                     phrase. Going through the list of results that her search yielded, Linda reads
                     the abstracts and, if an abstract seems relevant, she reads the full text
                     online, taking handwritten notes in her notepad. Linda explains that if she ends
                     up taking a lot of handwritten notes while reading articles online, she later
                     takes photos of those notes, emails the photos to herself, saves them as PDFs,
                     and then OCRs them, thus transforming them into searchable digital notes. When
                     she finds a text that fully meets her criteria and needs, she downloads a copy
                     and saves the PDF file to her Box cloud storage. From there, she moves the file
                     to her library in the Mendeley citation manager, but only if she decides to cite
                     that piece. “I won’t download a PDF until
                     I have significant cause to,” Linda explains. “I have a pretty deep repository [in Mendeley], and these
                     are all things that I’ve read. Most of it I’ve annotated in some
                     way,” she adds. In that way Linda avoids the deluge of downloaded
                     files that stay unused, and keeps her collections of digital materials focused.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23"> This example illustrates how conceptions of efficiency are idiosyncratic and can
                     influence digital scholarly workflows in significant ways. For Theodora and
                     Peter, effectiveness implied keeping the diversity of materials available for
                     further analysis and for serendipitous development of their epistemological
                     paths. For Linda, on the contrary, efficiency implied very selective retention
                     and an early analytical reduction of heterogeneity in her knowledge production
                     process. Such differences might be a matter of personal preferences, and we
                     could say, following Malone’s (1983) seminal classification of storing and
                     sorting practices, that Theodora and Peter belong to the category of
                     <em class="emph">pilers</em>, who accumulate materials in a loosely organized manner,
                     while Linda belongs to the category of <em class="emph">filers</em>, who store and
                     organize their materials in a highly systematic way. We could also speculate
                     that such differences may result from dissimilar professional experiences. Both
                     Peter and Theodora are senior scholars, while Linda is a junior one, and one
                     might argue that senior scholars feel more comfortable dealing with
                     heterogeneity of analytical views than their junior colleagues. But one might
                     also argue that junior scholars feel more comfortable dealing with digital tools
                     and resources, and that the observed difference in handling electronic materials
                     derives from that disparity. A look at humanists’ offline search practices
                     supports such a possibility.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24"> While Linda’s search behavior stands as rare among the study participants when
                     it comes to online search, it closely resembles the traditional archival search
                     behavior humanists exhibited prior to the introduction of digital technologies
                     into archival work. Our respondents recollect that, when collecting primary
                     materials in physical archives, they used to carefully read and identify
                     materials most pertinent to their research, systematically storing only a
                     handful of selected documents. The rest of important materials they would
                     summarize on site in written notes, which ranged from short reminders to
                     detailed document digests. Such a practice of managing materials recalls the
                     time when photocopying was one of the main ways of saving archival documents for
                     offsite use. It was neither cheap nor easy to handle piles of paper, so, instead
                     of acting as <em class="emph">pilers</em> who gather everything, researchers needed to
                     act as <em class="emph">filers</em>, and to strategically decide which materials were
                     most important to collect.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25"> Audrey explains, for instance, that she used to take extensive notes in her past
                     archival work, and that those notes have been very useful for her over the
                     years. “Now that they let you take
                     pictures in the archives, it’s wonderful, but at the same time you don’t
                     take the time to take notes anymore,” this scholar observes. In
                     talking about her past archival work, Audrey also gives the following example:
                     
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>A lot of the archives for my field used to be very badly
                           organized, almost like what people told me about being in Poland in 1970 -
                           there was a shop that had opened and there’s a queue and you just queue up
                           and hope that something will be for sale, whether you need it or not. It was
                           very much like that with archives. They gave you something. You would take
                           furious notes and you would also photocopy, but you might only use one or
                           two things. You put it aside and you think, “I’m always going to be able
                           to use this.”
                        </p>
                     </blockquote>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26"> Audrey explains, however, that all those materials collected in an unintended
                     way are “in a sense all active,” as
                     they informed her later studies, which she did not know at the time of
                     collecting them. In other words, archival search helped Audrey in finding
                     materials she was looking for, but it also served the function of making her
                     aware of other valuable information. Malone (Op.cit.) identifies these two
                     functions as <em class="emph">finding</em> and <em class="emph">reminding</em>, explaining that a
                     distinction between them rests on intentionality. Specifically, he posits that
                     if a person becomes aware of the information she was looking for, then the
                     finding function has been performed. If, while conducting this search, the
                     person becomes aware of something she was not looking for, yet found useful for
                     her work, then the reminding function has been served [<a class="ref" href="#malone1983">Malone 1983</a>, 106]. This distinction, along with Audrey’s explanation and
                     experience, resonates with Peter’s previously cited description of his
                     “inefficient” search process, demonstrating again that
                     humanists’ outwardly inefficient digital workflows often have deeper
                     epistemological roots and constitute the core of humanistic inquiry.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28"> Both phases of our study showed that humanists largely use internal computer
                     hard drives and cloud-based services, such as Dropbox and Box, to store research
                     data and materials, while only a handful use the Penn State institutional
                     repository, ScholarSphere; this finding is consistent with other studies of
                     institutional repositories use (see: [<a class="ref" href="#davis2007">Davis and Connolly 2007</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#cullen2010">Cullen and Chawner 2010</a>]. The most common way in which our respondents
                     organize stored research materials is according to the research project. A
                     typical project folder, whether on a local hard-drive or in Dropbox, is an
                     over-reaching compartment that breaks down into two main sub-folders, one for
                     primary and one for secondary sources. Primary sources mainly consist of
                     archival documents captured as JPEG files, and they are commonly titled
                     according to the archive and/or archival box from which they originated.
                     Secondary sources, such as PDF files of journal articles and books, are stored
                     in a different subfolder. These subfolders further branch into sub-subfolders
                     organized around the subject they cover (a specific topic, period of time,
                     person), the source from which they originated (a physical archive, colleagues,
                     other projects), or in line with the project/workflow phase to which they are
                     related (“phase I,”
                     “articles to read,”
                     “annotated”).

                     history of Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) research. The organizational
                     structure of his project materials was the following: 
                     <ol class="list">
                        <li class="item">the overall project folder titled “UFO project”;</li>

                     mostly meets recommended file-naming conventions; he uses short and descriptive
                     titles, includes the project name in the file name, and so on. But the situation
                     changes when it comes to individual JPEG files of archival materials. Those
                     files all retain numeric, automatically generated file names, without
                     indications about the content of the file. Such a practice mainly stems from the
                     quantity of JPEG files Fred is managing. He points out that ever since digital
                     photographing became allowed in the archives, he decided to “get the scale of the digitization,” so he took
                     nearly 4,000 photos in one archive alone. Renaming thousands of JPEG files would
                     require substantial time and effort, including more careful reading of the
                     archival documents, so that assigned file-names could reflect their content and
                     enable more efficient browsing and retrieval. Fred, however, quickly reads
                     archival materials while on site and photographs everything that seems relevant
                     for his research. Acting as a <em class="emph">piler</em>, Fred thus amasses thousands of
                     digital JPEG files that are difficult to organize, rename, search, and retrieve.

                     stresses that he had suffered a critical system failure and loss of digital
                     materials a few years ago, so he switched to a daily backup routine ever since.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32"> Another professor of history, Connor, describes an experience similar to Fred’s,
                     which however quickly developed into a notably different workflow in managing
                     digital archival materials. When digital photographing became permissible in
                     archives, Connor used to be a piler like Fred and to take photos of everything
                     that seemed relevant, saving those materials as JPEG files. After a while, he
                     realized that he would return from the archive with an overload of digital
                     photos that required a lot of storage space, were unsearchable, and for which he
                     often could not recall contextual meaning. Connor thus decided to change his
                     archival workflow. Instead of just snapping photos, he now first reads archival
                     materials at the level needed to determine whether they represent those critical
                     materials that should be saved in the digital form. Resembling Linda’s strategy
                     described in the previous section — to save only those secondary sources that
                     she will cite — Connor comparably stores as JPEG files only those materials that
                     he deems as something he will use and cite in his work. All other relevant
                     archival materials he summarizes on site in short notes, usually a paragraph
                     long, and types as Word files. “This
                     condenses everything really, really small,” Connor says of his work
                     process, commending the ability to recognize key documents that should be
                     stored, and to efficiently summarize all other relevant materials: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>What I have here, for all of that [archival] material, are six
                           pages. It doesn’t exhaust everything. But when I go back to this stuff, I
                           tell myself that former me, back in the fall [when he was doing research in
                           the archive] was smart. I knew what I was doing. I knew exactly what kinds
                           of things were critical and important and what things weren’t.

                     back to the question of what constitutes efficiency in humanists’ digital
                     workflows. Like Connor, Fred also recognizes that JPEG files of archival
                     materials do not allow for easy browsing, retrieval, and annotation, but points
                     out that this inefficiency actually benefits his work. It compels him to
                     describe both the data and his ideas about the data in consolidated and focused
                     summaries that he types as Word documents: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>The only way I’ve
                           annotated them [JPEG files] is in this separate [Word] file here. As I would
                           go through [JPEG files], I would keep a paper where I would take my notes on
                           it with ideas. These are going to be things that I want to come back to,
                           themes that I’m noticing in the digital material. So when I want to start to
                           research, I’ll look at this stuff here to tell myself what is it I’m looking
                           for, what is it I want to do, and that becomes a major theses.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34"> For Connor, efficiency means promptly identifying key archival documents that
                     should be photographed and stored, thus eliminating the encumbrance of digital
                     deluge. For Fred, in contrast, efficiency means storing thousands of JPEG files
                     and systematically going through them throughout the research process, slowly
                     discerning over time the main findings and research ideas that those materials
                     suggest, while writing notes that facilitate such continuous analytical

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35"> Using a method similar to Fred’s, Ellen, a historian of American literature,
                     stores hundreds of digitized archival materials and keeps extensive notes that
                     help her navigate through those materials. When working in physical archives,
                     Ellen uses her cell phone to take photos of archival materials, which she then
                     stores in cloud-based services for further use. “Here I have a folder in Dropbox that says ‘archives,’
                     and here is the folder for Emory,” Ellen says, explaining that
                     citation managers, such as <cite class="title italic">Zotero</cite>, do not handle
                     archival materials well, so she “lives by
                     Dropbox.” This kind of living, however, is haunted by the specter of
                     data deluge. Ellen discloses, for instance, that her work at the Emory archive
                     yielded 189 JPEG files, which she still has not managed to process. “It comes back on your phone, it’s all mixed
                     in with your kids’ baby pictures,” Ellen complains. She specifies
                     that her next step will be to turn those JPEG files into PDFs for each archival
                     object, and to name the PDF files in a useful way that will enable her to browse
                     and retrieve them more efficiently. “That’s how I organize my archival stuff, but it takes a lot of steps to get
                     there, so I have a huge backlog of stuff like that from archives that I just
                     haven’t dealt with,” Ellen relates. Here we see yet another method of
                     managing digitized archival materials, by converting JPEG into PDF files.
                     Neither Ellen nor our other respondents use optical character recognition (OCR)
                     to convert their digitized archival materials into machine-readable text, which
                     illustrates their lack of technological savvy, discussed in more detail in our
                     previous work (see: [<a class="ref" href="#antonijevi%C4%872015">Antonijević 2015</a>]).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> Ellen’s work sometimes also includes materials available in digital archives,
                     and in such cases, when digital and traditional practices encounter each other,
                     deciding where to store materials and how to organize them is not always a
                     straightforward task. As an example, in a contextual inquiry session we observed
                     Ellen was dealing with an archival document that, according to her established
                     organizational logic, should be stored in the subfolder of primary documents.
                     Yet, Ellen decides to store it differently, in the subfolder for secondary
                     sources. She explains that she does not consider the document “an archival source exactly” because
                     she found it in the digital archive. “I
                     didn’t go work on a collection there [in the physical archive]; I’m just
                     pulling it [from the web], so for me that’s a resource, not an archival
                     document,” Ellen clarifies. This example illustrates an interesting
                     situation in which ontology of research objects cannot be separated from the
                     technological context in which they are produced, in line with Hottois’ (1984)
                     original understanding of technoscience. Authors such as Sinn and Soares (2014)
                     thus observe that humanists prefer original over digitized sources, and think
                     about digital materials as a way of duplicating the originals rather than as a
                     way of replacing them.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37"> Jordan, a professor of history, seconds the words and workflows of both Ellen
                     and Fred. Jordan takes photos and scans of archival materials from physical
                     collections and stores those digital files on his computer. In organizing
                     research materials, he has a folder for every project, and then subfolders and
                     sub-subfolders for every subject. Jordan discloses that all those valuable and
                     meticulously collected materials live on his computer hard-drive and nowhere
                     else. He backups his materials when he “gets into a panic,” which happens approximately every three months.
                     While we observe his work in a contextual inquiry session, Jordan shows us a
                     Word document that he keeps as the main directory of his primary sources. This
                     Word document lists all the materials he had photographed or scanned in various
                     archives, and it helps him locate those materials on the hard drive. “For instance, I have an item in here from
                     the archive in Germany,” Jordan says, pointing at a folder on his
                     computer. “And then I explain here what it
                     is that I have,” Jordan clarifies further, indicating a paragraph in
                     his Word document. “It’s all not terribly
                     systematic, but it’s my system and I know where everything is,” he
                     concludes. Jordan takes extensive notes on the archival materials he is working
                     with, indicating what those materials contain, from which archive they come,
                     with what research themes and/or questions are they connected, and so on.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38"> Jordan is one of the rare scholars consulted in our study who does not use cloud
                     storage in his work. Our respondents overwhelmingly select general storage
                     systems, such as Dropbox, over specialized tools like citation managers. One of
                     the main reasons is that Dropbox enables them to arrange primary and secondary
                     sources side by side, organizing them in an autonomous and personal way —
                     without imposed classification structures — and to navigate through those
                     materials in a way that is both coherent and personal. For scholars, storing and
                     organizing their research materials is not a technical or an information science
                     activity. It is a deeply personal intellectual pursuit of organizing their
                     thoughts in a way that supports a subjective process of knowledge production,
                     and enables them to construct digital workflows as bricolage, from a diverse
                     range of resources and tools, as we discuss in the concluding section of this

                     sciences, but not in the humanities. Through an ethnographic approach and an
                     analytical focus on contextualized research practices, our study documented
                     myriad ways in which humanists actively interact with digital technologies.

                     citations of digital archival collections compared with other sources. They
                     conclude that although citation of digital sources increases over time, “the impact of digital archival

                     practices significantly transform with the use of digital technologies. As we
                     observed throughout this paper, the main transformation emerges from the use of
                     digital cameras and humanists’ on-site digitization of archival materials. All
                     of our respondents whose research includes archival work reported taking digital
                     photos of primary sources and storing them for further use. Rutner and Schonfeld
                     (2012) identified the same trend among their respondents, arguing that the
                     widespread use of digital cameras in archives “is perhaps the single most
                     significant shift in research practices among historians, and one with
                     as-yet largely unrecognized implications for the work of historical
                     research and its support”

                     primary sources, which become one of the central information resources in their
                     work. Scholars consulted in both phases of our study stressed that such personal
                     digital collections provided them with desired work mobility and an
                     uninterrupted access to research data and materials. In parallel, however, such
                     collections confronted them with the problem of data deluge, for which our
                     respondents rarely had efficient management strategies.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44"> The problem of data deluge appeared as a consistent challenge with both primary
                     and secondary sources. As discussed in the previous section, humanists often
                     download from the web and save all secondary sources that seem relevant for
                     their work, but it sometimes takes months before they actually return to those
                     materials. By simply dumping downloaded files into hard-drive or cloud storage
                     folders, scholars often forget about those materials and end up investing time
                     in the same search process again. A further consequence is that their already
                     cluttered storage folders become even messier, as they save duplicate copies of
                     files downloaded in the previous search. Some of our respondents thus point out
                     that they had a complete breakdown of organizational system with a shift away
                     from paper copies, and needed to adjust their organizational system to digital
                     sources. An exception are scholars like Linda, who carefully review research
                     materials before deciding to download and store them, as well as scholars like
                     Theodora, who use citation managers that detect duplicate files.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45"> When it comes to primary sources, humanists traditionally managed archival
                     materials by collecting and storing a number of most important documents, while
                     they summarized other relevant materials in extensive research notes. This
                     established method of managing primary sources has been disrupted with the
                     adoption of digital cameras, as we discussed in previous sections. It appears
                     that, as a result of this change, humanists’ online practices have been
                     transposed to the sphere of physical archives, bringing hastier digital workflow
                     to traditionally more methodical archival work. Humanists now commonly handle
                     archival materials in the same way as they handle online sources — quickly
                     collect everything that seems relevant, store it, and examine later.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46"> Humanists’ archival work thus develops into “collection missions,” as Rutner and Schonfeld
                     illustratively dub it, where scholars spend most of onsite time photographing
                     archival materials [<a class="ref" href="#rutner2012">Rutner and Schonfeld 2012</a>, 12]. As a result, they
                     regularly return from archives with hundreds, in some cases even thousands of
                     digitally captured materials, which confront them with challenges of storing,
                     searching, annotating, and retrieving those materials. Scholars’ personal
                     digital collections thus need to be a more visible point of analytical
                     attention, particularly with regard to securely storing those materials and
                     managing them in ways that enable easy retrieval and better workflow integration
                     across tools and data formats.

                     in their research workflow. Trace and Karadkar (2016) noted similar practices
                     among the humanists they studied, and indicated support for a more integrated
                     solution with fewer moving parts and more connected activities. Literature on
                     personal information management has also discussed the fragmentation problem
                     within an individual workflow ([<a class="ref" href="#al-omar2013">Al-Omar and Cox 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#bergman2007">Bergman, Beyth-marom, and Nachmias 2007</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#jones2011">Jones and Anderson 2011</a>]). This “fragmentation of information into
                     different collections forces a person who is working on a single project
                     to store and retrieve items from different locations with no structural
                     connection between them”

                     then deposit in another (or in multiple cases, more than one place), and this
                     disconnect between search and storage is ripe with possible complications,
                     including loss of information. As mentioned in the Introduction, humanists
                     consulted in our study suffered higher data loss than their colleagues in the

                     Ellen demonstrate this workflow in action. All of these scholars used Word in
                     isolation as a “blank slate” document where they could create

These
                     initiatives, all conducted between 2000-2010, saw the value of semantic data
                     within Word documents for researchers. An overall goal of most of these projects
                     was simply to combine services and collaboration to provide greater
                     opportunities for researchers. While the projects have not continued, the need
                     persists for better integration of a range of services within the word

                     their work. To understand this better, it is useful to return to the view of

                     technology illustrated in the comparison between engineers and bricoleurs.
                     Although the figures of bricoleur and engineer are idealized — as is the
                     difference between them — they point to an important difference in engaging with
                     technology and knowledge production. While the engineer uses specialized tools
                     adjusting tasks to the availability of those tools and striving for perfection,
                     the bricoleur takes the opposite route and adjusts non-specialized tools to a
                     variety of tasks, tolerating imperfection. The bricoleur achieves that by
                     combining available tools and resources into an improvised aggregate adjusted to
                     his or her needs.

                     cultural forms, and so on — in individualized and unscripted ways. Drawing on
                     Lévi-Strauss, Jacob (1977) points out that “to create is to recombine,” and offers the
                     example of natural selection: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           The action of natural selection has
                           often been compared to that of engineers. This, however, does not seem
                           to be a suitable comparison. First, because in contrast to what occurs
                           in evolution, the engineer works according to a preconceived plan. …
                           Second, because… to make a new product he [the engineer] has at his
                           disposal both material specially prepared to that end and machines
                           designed solely for that task. Finally, because the objects produced by
                           the engineer, at least by the good engineer, approach the level of
                           perfection made possible by the technology of the time. In contrast,
                           evolution is far from perfection. … It works like a tinkerer — a
                           tinkerer who does not know exactly what he is going to produce but uses
                           whatever he finds around him. … The tinkerer gives his materials
                           unexpected functions to produce a new object. From an old bicycle wheel,
                           he makes a roulette; from a broken chair the cabinet of a radio.
                           Similarly evolution makes a wing from a leg or a part of an ear from a
                           piece of jaw.

                     “hard” and “soft” approaches to
                     programming as two ways of engaging with technology and knowledge production.
                     They interpret these two approaches as gendered, and, more relevant for our
                     discussion, as differently scripted. While “hard” corresponds
                     to highly scripted and canonical approach, “soft” is
                     eminently creative, non-canonical, and personal. Turkle and Papert see computers
                     as a medium for expression of personal styles. Accordingly, they interpret
                     different styles of engaging with computers as insights into various styles of
                     thought, which they term epistemological pluralism. “Hard and soft are more than different approaches to
                     computation,” the authors explain. “The phrase <em class="emph">epistemological
                        pluralism</em> (rather than, for example, <em class="emph">computational
                        pluralism</em>) underscores the generality of the issues. The
                     computer forces general questions about intellectual style to reveal an

                     activity. One of the students wants instead to code in a more flexible and
                     creative manner and to “manipulate computer language the

                     learned the required — scripted and canonical — approach to programming, she
                     enjoys programming in a more creative way, treating it as musical phrases [<a class="ref" href="#turkle1990">Turkle and Papert 1990</a>, 164].

                     previous sections that humanists do not experience their digital workflows as a
                     technical or an information science activity. Instead, it is a subjective
                     process of knowledge production in which they construct digital workflows from a
                     diverse range of tools and resources suited to their preferences, sensibilities,

                     emerges spontaneously, based on specific research or teaching needs. Once so
                     adopted, digital technologies continue to interact with scholars’ workflows
                     quietly, usually remaining outside the purview of digital humanities. It is,
                     however, critically important for both DH theory and practice to recognize and
                     engage this variety of voices of non-canonical technology use, which “holds the promise of catalyzing

                     study often comes from necessity, that is, from the lack of adequate tools and
                     resources. When our respondents use cell phone cameras to digitize archival
                     materials on site, this application of an available and simple technological
                     solution is a response to the lack of specialized tools and digitized primary
                     sources. Similarly, respondents’ extensive Word annotations of archival
                     materials alleviate the pain of managing impromptu digitized sources difficult
                     to search, annotate, and retrieve.

                     of digital tools primarily depends on the tool’s capacity to meet their research
                     needs. As long as a simple tool like Word or Dropbox successfully supports their
                     work, scholars do not tend to replace it with a novel or more sophisticated
                     tool. “Sufficient, not efficient” is the guiding motto of their selection
                     and adoption of digital tools and resources.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p60"> As we discussed throughout the paper, efficiency cannot be qualified as a
                     neutral or inherent characteristic of digital tools independent of scholars’
                     practices. It is scholars’ interaction with digital artifacts that determines
                     what constitutes efficiency of a tool in the context of a scholar’s workflow. As
                     Pinch and Bijker (1987) point out, the same technological artifact can be
                     attributed with very different meanings and interpretations depending on the
                     context of use and particular understanding of those artifacts. Law (2003)
                     similarly recognizes that technological imperfections and
                     “unruly” practices in technology use are not only
                     unavoidable, but also beneficial insomuch that they become integrated into a
                     routine that enables uninterrupted functioning.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p61"> It is through this analytical lens that we can understand
                     “inefficient” and “unruly” bricolage
                     practices observed in this study. Like bricoleurs in Lévi-Strauss’s original
                     account, humanists are constructing their digital workflow with an orientation
                     on creativity and interpretation rather than on efficiency. Embracing humanities
                     researchers as bricoleurs will thus enable us to prevent the quest for
                     computational efficiency from overshadowing the quest for humanistic
                     understanding.
