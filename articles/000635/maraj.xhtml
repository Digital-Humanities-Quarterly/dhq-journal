                  <p>This short reflective essay meditates on how/why digital Blackness need not strive
                     to
                     recover or repair humanity for Black peoples. It questions the teleological drive
                     for
                     building Black digital archives and technologies motivated by representational
                     politics. The foray performatively suggests otherwise by leaning into Sylvia Wynter’s
                     (2007) notion that such folding into the figure of the human — overrepresented by
                     Western Man — snuffs polyvalent and polysemic pluralities for Blackness.</p>

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">I don’t know where to pinpoint a start to my work in digital humanities. Maybe it
                  began
                  on instant messaging platforms like AIM or MSN Messenger, truncating, puttying, and
                  shaping language for new platforms. Maybe it was in re-watching early viral videos
                  —
                  “Chocolate Rain” still is and always will be a bop — and
                  thinking they related to something that might mean identity. Or perhaps it came earlier
                  with the affective thrill on hearing the distinct buzz of a dial-up internet connection,
                  so foreign a sound whirring through Caribbean breeze. I know it wasn’t in a classroom,
                  or — no offense Mavis Beacon — learning how to type, or formatting a resume in MS
                  Word
                  ’95. See, the appeal of the digital to me, an “inside chile” growing up in the
                  Trinidad (face usually in a book or screen) never was assimilation into some larger
                  arc
                  of intellectual or technological “progress” or change; one thing that drew me in to
                  thinking about the ways digital technologies culture us or how we culture them was
                  possibility. And I don’t mean possibility in the “discovery” or “recovery”
                  sense: I refuse the idea that the goal of Black digital technologies and their uses
                  remains building some Black canon of texts, some particular archive of artifacts,
                  a
                  catalogue of ways of being in the world somehow authentically emerging from “black
                  experience.” I also refuse the notion that “black digital humanities” might
                  help us find some place among the long arching shadow that is the figure of the “human,”
                  even as snuff videos stay circulating of cops killing us with pleas for humanity on
                  social media. I suppose possibility, to me, conjures constant shift(in’)-forms. </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Following Black feminist scholars and activists who take up approaches to digital
                  humanities situated in a Wynterian theoretical genealogy, like Tara L. Conley and
                  Ashley
                  Greene Wade for example, I understand digital technologies and media for their viral
                  potentials to undercut the overrepresentation of man as Western bourgeois male subject,
                  as human [<a class="ref" href="#conley2017">Conley 2017</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#greenewade2017">Greene Wade 2017</a>]. But my hope in virality lies not in building a single
                  vision or static versions of what might mechanize responses to Sylvia Wynter’s call
                  for
                  “new genres of being human”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#wynter2007">Wynter 2007</a>]. Nah, I believe that virality inherently offers — through
                  distribution — constant space for mashing up contexts, artifacts, identities, and
                  the
                  very frameworks on which settler-colonial, racial capitalist projects lie. We need
                  not
                  construct or overrepresent sub-genres of what being “human while
                  Black” might look like by digital means and watch them appropriated toward our
                  own demise. The plurality of Wynter’s call (in <em class="emph">genres</em>, rather than genre)
                  suggests that black studies might offer the digital the idea that no single “human”
                  or “humanistic” metric, discipline, or idea may measure or signify blackness
                  <em class="emph">in toto</em>. #BlackGirlMagic, #BlackBoyJoy, #BlackLivesMatter, none need
                  look or mean one way because blackness don’t need to look one way. Magic, joy, whatever
                  don’t have to <em class="emph">matter</em> according to normative (affective) scripts. Difference
                  — which Achille Mbembe reminds us blackness signifies in extremity — rather, suggests
                  we
                  could augur n/other planets: places, terrains, digital geographies where reiterative
                  negation of otherhood might help us fever dream something different [<a class="ref" href="#mbembe2013">Mbembe 2013</a>]. Together, by using digital media to turbulently disturb,
                  spread, alter any received sense of what we are or could be in the continued heat
                  of
                  racial capitalism, let’s dream nutha planets.</div>
