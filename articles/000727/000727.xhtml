                  <p>The case study is based on student annotations from a class on “Digital Methods in Literary Studies” taught in the English Studies / English Literatures and Cultures programme at Tübingen
                     University. The annotation task consisted in tagging the ambiguous modality of <em class="term">must</em> in Jane Austen’s novel <cite class="title italic">Emma</cite> (1816). The article, in a first step, presents how the criteria for annotation task
                     were developed on the basis of a close reading of the novel; these evolved into annotation
                     guidelines which were then translated into tag sets for two annotation tools: CATMA
                     and CorefAnnotator. The overall results of the annotation process are discussed, with
                     a particular focus on the difficulties that emerged as well as (patterns of) mistakes
                     and misconceptions across the groups and individual annotators. This approach will
                     yield insights into challenges when annotating with a group in a teaching context
                     as well as foreground conceptual difficulties when it comes to annotating complex
                     phenomena in literary texts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The motivation for this case study in a student group was two-fold: the main aim consisted
                     in introducing students to tools and methods of annotation that are applicable in
                     literary analysis. This objective is intricately linked to the problem that literary
                     analysis in general frequently relies very much on intuitions that are difficult to
                     be tested and verified. Category-based approaches and methods from the Digital Humanities
                     may help make the analysis of literary texts more plausible and empirically sound
                     (see also [<a class="ref" href="#pagel_etal2020">Pagel et al. 2020</a>]). It is the markup of texts through annotation in particular that requires phenomenon-based
                     distinctions and clear definitions in order to arrive at (fine-grained) categories
                     of analysis. The starting point is a particular reading experience and text observation
                     that leads to a first hypothesis with regard to the text phenomenon or feature under
                     discussion, from which categories of investigation are then developed. Once these
                     analytical categories are applied in the annotation process, they (potentially) undergo
                     a revision process that then feed into the next round of annotations and so forth
                     (see [<a class="ref" href="#gius_etal2017">Gius and Jacke 2017</a>]).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">The second aim is motivated by a textual phenomenon in Jane Austen’s novel <cite class="title italic">Emma</cite>, namely the ambiguity of voice which is related to an ambiguity of attribution:<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e267">[2]</a> this means that, throughout the novel, it often remains unclear whose voice we are
                     being presented with as readers, while there is a defined set of options, e.g. a narrator
                     and a character in the fiction. This is to say that the attribution of voice is not
                     merely underspecified or vague nor without clear referents (see more on this in <a href="#section02">section 2</a> below).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e282">[3]</a> This ambiguity is linked to the ambiguity of the modal <em class="term">must</em>. The annotation of all instances of <em class="term">must</em> in the text will hence not only reveal its overall distribution across the novel
                     but, more specifically, indicate how the ambiguity of its modality interacts with
                     ambiguities of voice. The expectation is that this approach will moreover yield results
                     relating to how voice is ambiguous with regard to the narrator and particular characters,
                     e.g. if the ambiguity of voice in the narrator cooccurs more frequently with a particular
                     character than with others. As occurrences of <em class="term">must</em> are also annotated in direct speech, it will moreover be possible to see if there
                     are characters that use <em class="term">must</em> more often than others (as well as in which ways). The results of the annotations
                     will then, in turn, feed into the qualitative analysis and interpretation of the novel
                     and its very peculiar narrative techniques.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">From early on in Jane Austen’s novel, the ambiguity of voice is made obvious: it is
                     unclear who the originating voice of an utterance in the diegetic mode is, i.e. who
                     a proposition can be attributed to. An example is provided in sample 1:

                           advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual
                           solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not
                           meet her in conversation, rational or playful.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The context is as follows: Emma, the protagonist of the novel, introduced as “handsome, clever and rich” [<a class="ref" href="#austen2012">Austen 2012</a>, 5] in its first sentence, has formed a bond of friendship with her governess Miss Taylor,
                     who, after many years in the Woodhouse household, has married and moved house within
                     the neighbourhood to live with her husband, Mr. Weston. In connection with the opening
                     question of the paragraph – which may be asked by the narrator or be an instance of
                     Free Indirect Discourse (FID)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e343">[4]</a> – it is unclear who thinks that “great must be the difference”: is this Emma or the omniscient narrator with access to her thoughts and feelings
                     – or both?<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e371">[5]</a> The question in this passage is an epistemic one and, depending on how we interpret
                     it, we may arrive at different readings: If we attribute it to the narrator’s voice,
                     Emma is objectively suffering from solitude. If we assume that we are presented with
                     Emma’s thoughts, we learn that she regards herself as lonely. The effect based on
                     the author’s strategy is clear: we as readers are supposed to pity her in any case,
                     either because of her feeling or because of the state she factually finds herself
                     in.</div>

                     are being presented. If we look closely, however, we can see that there is a second
                     ambiguity involved, potentially interacting with the ambiguity of voice: that of the
                     modal verb <em class="term">must</em>. Generally speaking, <em class="term">must</em> may be epistemic, deontic or bouletic, i.e. express a fact, an obligation/necessity
                     or a wish (see [<a class="ref" href="#fintel2006">Fintel 2006</a>]). In this instance (sample 2), <em class="term">must</em> is epistemic as it is a fact that evenings are a struggle in the months of autumn
                     with few visitors before Christmas; but it is also deontic as these evenings have
                     to be struggled through by necessity. This reading is in line with her father having
                     just been presented as being no companion to her; but to avoid interaction with him
                     altogether is not an option either: he “made it <em class="emph">necessary</em> to be cheerful” (<a href="#austen2012">7; emphasis added</a>), as the narrative continues to point out.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Throughout the novel, the “narrative voice that dips in and out of her heroine’s thoughts, fusing Emma’s subjectivity
                     (e.g. in the sense of her limited knowledge) to the narrator’s omniscience”  [<a class="ref" href="#oberman2009">Oberman 2009</a>, 2], a narrative device that has frequently been noted and commented on in the literature
                     on Jane Austen.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e422">[6]</a> The concrete linguistic makeup behind this ambiguity of voice has been left widely
                     unobserved, and our hypothesis is that it is intricately linked to the ambiguity of
                     the modal <em class="term">must</em>. Jane Austen regularly uses this ambiguity, and most famously so in the first sentence
                     of her novel <cite class="title italic">Pride and Prejudice</cite>:

                     thoughts are these? If we begin to disambiguate <em class="term">must</em> here, we come up with different originating voices behind the utterance, with Mrs
                     Bennet being its main originator as her most prominent objective in life is to see

                        the assumption that interpretations are “subjective”. In our understanding, a detailed analysis of the text leads to equally objective
                        interpretations that are text-based.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e517">[9]</a> The case study, based on the link between the ambiguity of modal verbs (a primarily

                        sit down together to discuss their annotations within their work packages: this was
                        to result in peer discussions to foster a process of understanding in the course of
                        which the annotations would improve and require less discussion as the students went
                        on annotating. Because of the uneven distribution of students over tools, work packages
                        were designed in a way that at least two groups working with CorefAnnotator would
                        (largely) overlap with the CATMA groups in the material they annotated, namely CATMA
                        A with Coref A and B, as well as CATMA B with Coref C and D. The respective annotation
                        groups were asked not only to discuss their individual annotations but agree on a
                        group result to be submitted as their joint annotations for which there was consensus
                        within the group. Unfortunately, this was only done by the groups working with CorefAnnotator:
                        that the students working with CATMA (apparently) never went through this internal

The “Preliminaries and Theoretical Background” in the annotation guidelines point to the ambiguous modality of <em class="term">must</em>, including examples taken from linguistic literature on the topic [<a class="ref" href="#fintel2006">Fintel 2006</a>]; a literary example from Jane Austen’s novel <cite class="title italic">Pride and Prejudice</cite> is also provided (see above, sample 3). The Annotation Guidelines proper were updated
                        in the course of term, based on feedback from the students in their annotation process.
                        They specified, for instance, that all instances of <em class="term">must</em> in direct speech have to be annotated as well in order to learn more about the overall
                        distribution of the modal verb in the novel as a whole (e.g. the question if it occurs
                        particularly often in the speech of a particular character, but also to see clusters
                        of the modal verb and identify chapters in which it is mentioned more frequently than
                        in others etc.). For characters, the tags “speaker” and “focalizer” were hence introduced to specify the occurrence of <em class="term">must</em>; as the notion of “focalization” is generally better known to students (in Germany) than “voice,” this term made its way into the annotation guidelines.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e656">[11]</a> By default, the “narrator” should always be tagged as “speaker”.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e671">[12]</a> Students were then asked to follow these steps when annotating:

                        the approach was one of maximal annotation: if a student or a student group were uncertain

                     challenges have cropped up as this analysis will show. A major problem was the wrong
                     assumption by some students in the group that annotating a literary work makes reading
                     the novel superfluous. Attributions hence become difficult as contexts within the
                     text remain obscure; put in a more positive way: students have learned about the importance

                        in <em class="emph">all</em> cases, especially since some errors can rather be attributed to the respective users.
                        This, for example, is apparent for the 224 annotations of spaces following the annotated
                        item in CATMA: a closer look reveals that the majority of these annotations were made
                        by the same student – which, because of this regularity, must be interpreted less
                        as an oversight induced by the tool than an intentional procedure. The complete absence
                        of such errors for the CorefAnnotator, by contrast, can be easily explained: it offers
                        a feature that is activated by default and ignores the annotation of spaces at the
                        outer borders of annotated items. The same applies to non-annotated letters in words
                        as a corresponding feature prevents the annotation of incomplete tokens. In our case,
                        these features automatically protected the annotators of the CorefAnnotator groups
                        from both accidental errors and intentional actions that turned out to be mistakes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e895">[15]</a></div>

                        of the narrative and alternative names for tags (e.g. “Mr. Knightley” or “Mr Knightley” or “John Knightley”), accumulate conspicuously with the CorefAnnotator, while CATMA shows almost no vulnerability
                        to these types of error in almost inverse exclusivity. This accumulation of errors
                        in tag names may be explained by an intentionally different configuration of the two
                        tools: in CorefAnnotator tags could be added flexibly by the annotators themselves
                        whereas all tags were fixed in CATMA beforehand; this configuration may always be
                        an issue when it comes to using these tools in class: students must apparently be
                        expected to generate mistakes at these points. The evaluations clearly show that –
                        especially for inexperienced annotators – an annotation environment that is as restrictive
                        as possible produces more reliable results. Formal aspects such as these should accordingly
                        be integrated into the annotation guidelines.</div>

                           The divergence sets in with the modality of must for each of them: groups A and B

                           the attribution as either deontic or epistemic, whereas group C attributed both to
                           each of the speakers. If we go back to the text passage, we can analyse this instance

                                 solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not
                                 meet her in conversation, rational or playful.

                        <div class="ptext" id="p29">We found earlier that the attribution leads to different readings: the narrator’s
                           voice states that Emma is objectively suffering from solitude; in the case of a presentation
                           of Emma’s thoughts, we learn that she regards herself as lonely. It is obvious that
                           this is neither an expression of a wish (bouletic reading) nor of a necessity (deontic)
                           but of a fact (epistemic). The deontic reading becomes possible, however, with regard
                           to the greatness of the difference between the two identities of Miss Taylor and Mrs.
                           Weston in their respective locations. From Emma’s perspective, this makes sense as
                           a necessary outcome of the change, and the narrator could be ironical in presenting
                           the change as such. This reading makes sense in the context of Emma’s introduction
                           as a character:

                           one may assume that both readings of <em class="term">must</em> go for both Emma and the narrator. The difficulty in arriving at this rather complicated
                           interpretation is reflected in the varying disambiguations between groups A and B:
                           their readings are merged by group C who identify an ambiguity for both Emma and the
                           narrator. Based on this observation, we assume that the modality of <em class="term">must</em> will prove to be the most difficult annotation task and lead to the greatest variety
                           in annotations across the CorefAnnotator groups. As to the reasons for this difficulty,
                           we can only speculate, but there are some indicators that it is extremely difficult
                           for students to assume multiple meanings for the modal verb that is so much part of

                           3 has several. In Figure 2, the divergences are more striking: while, once again,

                           ambiguity of “figure” rather than the ambiguity of modality, i.e. whenever it is unclear in the text whether
                           a character or the narrator is the originator of an utterance, an annotation ensues
                           for each of them. The divergences, once again, allow for a comparison between the

                           deontic and either bouletic or epistemic.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1533">[22]</a> If we look at the text, the narrator may very well also be read as being deontic,
                           but this only works in a meta-narrative reading with her being the law-giver of the
                           narrative in her (slightly ironic) appreciation of Mr. Weston’s thoughts and prospects
                           as well as expectations of married life – and wish him well in a bouletic reading.
                           Mr. Weston himself probably wishes for a happy marriage as much as he counts it for
                           a fact, given the qualities of his wife as he has come to know her, and thinks that
                           he is somewhat entitled to it as he “had never been an unhappy man”. This analysis also foregrounds, once again, that to have read the novel and know
                           about character dispositions is quite obviously indispensable for annotating such
                           phenomena as ambiguity; it also shows that the mere linguistic analysis of the individual
                           word must take into account the larger context, which results in an informed interpretation.</div>

                     and categories for the study of literary texts that make the analysis more precise,
                     and, secondly, at showing how methods from the Digital Humanities, i.e. annotation,
                     may yield quantitative results that influence close readings and make an interpretation
                     based on a precise analysis empirically valid. In the process, a third objective emerged:
                     to try and test annotation as a teaching and learning tool in a group of advanced
                     students.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">The annotation task has proved to generate more challenges than anticipated. This
                     has to do, on the one hand, with technical issues; conceptual flaws, however, turned
                     out to be even more frequent: the annotation of ambiguous modality, even the potential
                     ambiguity of the originators of utterances within the fictional text, transpired to
                     be partly unsurmountable challenges for the student groups. The annotations resulting
                     from the work in the seminar are unfortunately not really of any use for further quantitative
                     analysis: the complexity of the material makes the annotation by expert teams necessary.
                     And yet, the divergencies between the annotations trigger a reflection on the ambiguity
                     of the seemingly-clear-cut modalities and point to an ambiguity of ambiguity: it appears
                     extremely difficult to decide in some of the cases which of the potential modalities
                     are actualized in the context. We have also seen that ambiguous modalities may even
                     result in irony and foreground metanarrative strategies.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">The analysis of the annotations thus has been quite revealing in several respects.
                     In the context of digital annotation, they show that the annotation task is challenging:
                     not only have students overlooked instances of <em class="term">must</em> but they are also prone to careless mistakes, e.g. when direct speech remains undetected.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1554">[23]</a> The negotiations within the groups that used CorefAnnotator led to overall more reliable
                     results than those from the CATMA annotations that were submitted individually. The
                     greatest challenge, however, consisted in wrong attributions: mistakes range from
                     wrong attributions of figure and role to a tendency for disambiguation, in particular
                     with regard to modalities. Roles were wrongly attributed whenever the annotation guidelines
                     were ignored, i.e. when the narrator was given the function of focalizer although
                     this was in fact excluded as an option by the annotation guidelines, with the narrator
                     always counting as speaker by default.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">The expectation was that the annotations would yield quantitative results concerning
                     the distribution of the ambiguous modality of <em class="term">must</em> in relation to various characters in the novel, and, in particular, the ambiguity
                     of voice. An analysis of the first chapter of the novel, for instance, has shown that
                     <em class="term">must</em> is mentioned 16 times; and a close reading has revealed that it is used ambiguously
                     almost every time and refers to at least two, sometimes all three modalities. This
                     finding alone, i.e. the clustering of <em class="term">must</em> in the opening chapter, may be regarded as productive with regard to reading the
                     novel as a whole: it almost seems as if Jane Austen was trying to prime her readers
                     and have them watch out for ambiguous modalities. Annotations with a higher IAA would
                     make it possible to visualize the distribution of these ambiguities over direct speech
                     and in relation to focalization. They could moreover show which characters use <em class="term">must</em> most frequently in which communicative contexts, and whose usage of <em class="term">must</em> merges particularly often with that of the narrator to result in ambiguous focalization.
                     At the end of the day, the case study results in quite a number of insights when it
                     comes to didactic and methodological pitfalls, and the clarity of annotation categories
                     turns out to be no guarantor of their correct application. At the same time, annotation
                     may create awareness of categories of analysis and, if pursued diligently, open new
                     paths of literary analysis.</div>

                           in its application right from the start of the annotation work. This is especially
                           true for more powerful but (depending on the task: necessarily) not so straightforward

               <div class="endnote" id="d4e247"><span class="noteRef lang en">[1] The class was taught in the summer term of 2022 for advanced students. Altogether,
                     nineteen students took part in this seminar, most of them being enrolled in the BA
                     English and American studies, the MA English Literatures and Cultures and the BEd
                     / MEd English; three of the students were enrolled in the BA/MA programme International
                     Literatures.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e267"><span class="noteRef lang en">[2] Parts of the literary background presented in what follows were presented at the conference
                     “Ambiguity Matters”, organized by RTG 1808 “Ambiguity: Production and Perception” at Tübingen University, in a joint paper by Michael Reid and Angelika Zirker on “Ambiguity of Voice: From Mr Knightley to the Green Knight.” </span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e282"><span class="noteRef lang en">[3] When we speak of voice, in itself a notoriously underspecified term, we refer to whoever
                     speaks or to whom an utterance or thought is attributed in a fictional text. With
                     this notion, we go slightly beyond what is customarily regarded as voice, i.e. the
                     “persona […] behind […] the first-person narrator”  [<a class="ref" href="#abrams_etal2015">Abrams and Harpham 2015</a>, 287], but rather think of it in terms of the origin(ator) of an utterance or thought,
                     be it on the level of character or narration; in short, “the relationship between a character’s thoughts – his or her internal voice – and
                     the voice of the narrator”  [<a class="ref" href="#davidson2008">Davidson 2008</a>, 237]. This comparative openness is helpful particularly when it comes to ambiguity, e.g.
                     on the level of character thoughts and speech. The concept of “voice,” especially in the context of ambiguity, has often been linked to Ducrot’s notion
                     of polyphony ([<a class="ref" href="#ducrot1984">Ducrot 1984</a>]; see also [<a class="ref" href="#waltereit2006">Waltereit 2006</a>, 63]; and [<a class="ref" href="#bauer2015">Bauer 2015</a>, 149]).</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e343"><span class="noteRef lang en">[4] Oberman refers to Cohn’s term “narrated monologue”  [<a class="ref" href="#oberman2009">Oberman 2009</a>, 109–10] in the context of <cite class="title italic">Emma</cite> and considers the term to be “more specific” than FID (2n2); see also [<a class="ref" href="#pollackpelzner2013">Pollack-Pelzner 2013</a>, 766]. Bray notes that, in the context of FID, “point of view can be hard to determine and ambiguous”  [<a class="ref" href="#bray2007">Bray 2007</a>, 37]. – According to Genette, the explanation is of course that this is a case of (uncertain)
                     focalization. Interestingly, the distinction introduced by Genette between who speaks
                     and who sees does not consider that there may be a difference of voice in FID, where
                     the character’s language is used [<a class="ref" href="#genette1980">Genette 1980</a>, 186].</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e371"><span class="noteRef lang en">[5] See, e.g., Oberman who writes: “In third-person narrated novels that dip in and out of the consciousnesses of multiple
                     characters, there are usually moments when it is not easy to know for sure whether
                     the voice we are hearing belongs to the narrator or to a character in the novel”  [<a class="ref" href="#oberman2009">Oberman 2009</a>, 1].</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e422"><span class="noteRef lang en">[6] What is particularly tricky: there may even be an added ambiguity as we do not always
                     know whether the narrator is heterodiegetic or homodiegetic. Does the narrator “create” the characters (and, accordingly, is omniscient), or does the narrator “look” at them (on the basis of her limited knowledge)?</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e468"><span class="noteRef lang en">[7] The novel consists of altogether 160,310 words and is structured into three volumes,
                     with 18 chapters in each, volumes one and two, and 19 chapters in volume three. </span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e513"><span class="noteRef lang en">[8] We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this possible misunderstanding.
                     </span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e517"><span class="noteRef lang en">[9] For some more insight into this approach, see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#bauer_etal2020">Bauer et al. 2020</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#bauer_etal2017">Bauer and Brockmann 2017</a>].</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e527"><span class="noteRef lang en">[10] In hindsight, it may have been more sensible not to leave the choice of the tools
                     to the students but form identical groups for each of the tools to make the analysis
                     more comparable. At the same time, the group division as it stands has resulted in
                     some intriguing insights as well (see below).</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e656"><span class="noteRef lang en">[11] The notion of “voice” was not even addressed in more detail because of that. We still think, however, that
                     it makes sense, on some level, to distinguish “voice”, as “an utterance or thought” (see above, note 3) attributed to a character goes beyond Genette’s rather simplistic
                     “who sees,” especially when it comes to ambiguities of voice between characters and the narrator
                     (see also note 11 on this matter).</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e671"><span class="noteRef lang en">[12] This follows the view, expressed, for example, by Margolin, that “the term ‘narrator’ designates the inner-textual (textually encoded) highest-level
                     speech position from which the current narrative discourse as a whole originates” ([<a class="ref" href="#margolin2014">Margolin 2014</a>, ¶1], emphasis added).</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e731"><span class="noteRef lang en">[13] There was a number of students who made this wrong assumption, especially in the CATMA
                     groups – but this became obvious only fairly late in the term (although the reading
                     of the novel had been marked as “mandatory” in the course description).</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e752"><span class="noteRef lang en">[14] In our analysis we have therefore corrected careless mistakes as shown in Table 2.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e895"><span class="noteRef lang en">[15] It should be noted, however, that, whenever these rules should hinder the annotation
                     process (e.g. when only parts of a token are to be annotated), they can be switched
                     off.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1166"><span class="noteRef lang en">[16] The individual Students listed here were all in CATMA group A, hence Ca-A etc., and
                     have been numbered randomly in the course of anonymisation. Graph 2 refers to CATMA
                     group B (Ca-B) who annotated volume 3 of the novel.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1195"><span class="noteRef lang en">[17] Whenever the diagrams refer to CorefAnnotator in general, the corresponding quantities
                     include the numbers of those groups that were involved in the annotation of the chapters
                     to be compared.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1201"><span class="noteRef lang en">[18] The latter was certainly an issue: although there were full sessions dedicated to
                     annotating the text and there were no oral presentations that students had to prepare
                     other than to present their results, the students found the class demanding and annotation
                     time-consuming (beyond what is usually expected of them in terms of class work).</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1300"><span class="noteRef lang en">[19] To clarify the instances, especially for the following individual examples, we have
                     counted and named them in the order of their appearance within those first three chapters
                     of the novel.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1328"><span class="noteRef lang en">[20] While one might argue that there cannot be a difference between “figure” and “role,” in some of the annotations, wrong attributions could be found. One can also regard
                     the split task between identifying a character and their respective role as a speaker
                     or focalizer as a control task regarding the attentiveness of the annotators.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1361"><span class="noteRef lang en">[21] Following the widely used evaluation rankings by [<a class="ref" href="#landis_etal1977">Landis and Koch 1977</a>], the κ value for figure would qualify as “good agreement”, while role would still be considered a “moderate agreement”; unlike modality, which scores lowest possible as a “poor agreement”.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1533"><span class="noteRef lang en">[22] Here an epistemic reading, though referring to a future event, works because it refers
                     to a generally known fact (the assumption that second marriages are happier after
                     a disappointing first one).</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1554"><span class="noteRef lang en">[23] This has been the case for instance 35 of <em class="term">must</em>. In a dialogue between Mr. Knightley and Mrs. Weston in chapter 5 of the first volume,
                     Mrs. Weston addresses Mr. Knightley, who answers: “Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out,
                     and that you must still fight your own battle.” [<a class="ref" href="#austen2012">Austen 2012</a>, 27]. One student in the CATMA group attributed the passage to Mrs. Weston as focalizer
                     rather than Mr. Knightley as speaker, despite the quotation marks and the context
                     of a dialogue. The reasoning behind this may be that s/he recognized Mrs. Weston as
                     the originator of <em class="term">must</em>: “you think: ‘I must fight my own battle.’”</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e1601"><span class="noteRef lang en">[24] This has meanwhile been made obligatory in some DH classes – with very good results.</span></div>
