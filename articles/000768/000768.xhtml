                  <p>This article analyzes the possibility of a pedagogical renewal in the teaching of
                     the slave trade and slavery in the 
                     Senegalese middle cycle. On the basis of the directives of the National Education
                     orientation law of 1991, the 
                     consolidated history program of 2006, and the Senegal Registers of Liberation, we
                     identify the current limits of the 
                     teaching of the slave trade and slavery and propose new avenues taking into account
                     other pedagogical perspectives that 
                     are essential to the training of students congruent with the evolution of historical
                     science. Beyond these indicated 
                     aspects, the articlewill try to show how the digital humanities could contribute to
                     this pedagogical renewal, which will 
                     take into account the question of the ethics of the names of freed enslaved people
                     appearing in the Senegal Registers of 
                     Liberation. This article explores the renewal of the teaching of the slave trade and
                     slavery on the basis of a digital 
                     resource in the era of digital humanities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In 2006, the Republic of Senegal introduced its Consolidated History Program, which
                     stated that the study of history in 
                     public schools must contribute to shaping independent, critical, and conscientious
                     citizens. It should enable them not 
                     only to acquire scientific and humanistic knowledge, but also the critical thinking,
                     interpersonal skills, and 
                     understanding of how the past shapes the present that will enable them to become Senegalese
                     citizens capable of proudly 
                     assuring the country's destiny in Africa and the world. It is an understatement, to say the least, to 
                     observe that slave trade and slavery are minimally analyzed in middle cycle history
                     curricula in 
                     Senegal.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e201">[1]</a> Improving our approach to teaching the subject is important 
                     because in the precolonial period, the Atlantic slave trade had a significant impact
                     on Senegal, and 
                     slavery, as an institution, became common in some societies. Further, the legacy of
                     the slave trade and of domestic 
                     slavery weighs heavy on Senegalese society today. One cannot understand the present
                     without understand the impact of 
                     slavery and the slave trade.
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Today the focus of middle cycle schooling is broad and not to a great extent Senegal-specific. Students 
                     are taught about the mechanisms and circuits of the slave trade and commerce through
                     the study of ancient African 
                     civilizations (such as Egypt, Nubia, and Ethiopia), the empires of medieval 
                     Sudan and West Africa (such as Ghana, Mali, Songhai, 
                     Sokoto, and Macina), the Mossi kingdoms, the states of the Gulf of Guinea 
                     (Yoruba and Benin) and the societies of Senegambia (such as Jolof, 
                     Gaabu, Fouladou) [<a class="ref" href="#republique2006">Republique du Senegal 2006</a>]. Further, under the current middle cycle 
                     curriculum, teaching about slavery does not concretely promote the effective application
                     of important pedagogical 
                     methods and approaches, such as expository writing and dialogue and task methods,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e249">[2]</a> which are, 
                     after all, essential to learners. It is at this level that the open-source, online
                     dataset derived from the Senegal 
                     Registers of Liberation, a unique historical register of the liberations of nearly
                     30,000 enslaved people in 
                     Senegal between 1857 and May 1903, can be useful in pedagogical innovations in teaching about
                     the slave 
                     trade and slavery in Africa and Senegal.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e262">[3]</a> The Registers provide information on ages, genders, categories, and 
                     origins of freed enslaved people, their pathways towards liberation, and the evolution
                     and dynamics of the end of 
                     slavery in West Africa.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Based on the directives of the National Education Orientation Laws (1991) and the
                     Consolidated History Program (2006), 
                     this article demonstrates how, when transcribed and made accessible online in an open-source
                     format, these registers can 
                     promote new pedagogical innovations in the teaching of the slave trade and slavery
                     in Senegal. These 
                     innovations are centered on the pedagogy of what we call “discovery exploitation construction” in the digital 
                     humanities. Our approach involves the creation of new teaching paradigms that emerge
                     from the online presentation and 
                     integration of the registries into middle cycle curricula.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Thus, our reflection will be articulated around four aspects. First, we will review
                     the current teaching of the slave 
                     trade and slavery and its limits; second, we will analyze the possible pedagogical
                     and didactic perspectives of the 
                     liberation registers; third, we will look at the ethics necessary for the use of digital
                     humanities in the teaching of 
                     the history of coercion in Senegalese middle cycle schooling; and finally, we will
                     explore the challenges the liberation 
                     registers raise.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">After independence from France in 1960, Senegal embarked on a process of curriculum reform to 
                     align public schooling with the aspirations of the nation and its newly independent
                     people. Curricular reforms took place 
                     in 1965, 1998, and 2006, resulting in a national consolidated curriculum in 2006.
                     In the 2006 Consolidated History 
                     Program for the middle cycle curricula, the theme of the slave trade and slavery is
                     addressed through specific and 
                     general lessons. The aim of these lessons is: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>to help students acquire the concepts and facts that 
                           will enable them to better understand the events, [but also] to develop specific skills
                           in the subject; to encourage them 
                           to pose problems and [...] ask questions; to lead them to be autonomous in the development
                           of their own knowledge 
                           [<a class="ref" href="#republique2006">Republique du Senegal 2006</a>, 3].</p>
                     </blockquote>. The objective is to form “autonomous and 
                     supportive” citizens, capable of demonstrating “mobilizable knowledge” on the history 
                     of Senegal and Africa, to be based on the historical approach and methodology, to have an 
                     irreversible patriotic and civic posture, and to assume responsibility in any circumstance
                     and situation. This is in 
                     accordance with the Orientation Law (1991), which stipulates that National Education
                     must aim to:
                     
                     <ul class="list">
                        <li class="item">“Raise the cultural level of the nation” or, in other words, build the nation by 
                           training citizens who are cultured and proud of their Senegalese origins; and
                           </li>
                        <li class="item">“Train free men and women, capable of creating the conditions for their fulfillment
                           at all 
                           levels, of contributing to the development of science and technology, and of providing
                           effective solutions to the 
                           problems of national development”.
                           </li>
                     </ul>
                     </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Including instruction on the slave trade and slavery in the curriculum enables learners
                     to become aware of their past, 
                     however painful it may be, and to construct a valorizing perception of Black Africans.
                     This historical theme links school 
                     education to current issues, which are linked to the problem of identity in an increasingly
                     globalizing world. The goal 
                     was therefore to create in young Senegalese a sense of attachment to a community of
                     people who built the Americas 
                     through their own sweat and blood and, therefore, to be proud of this community's
                     trajectory and help shape its future. 
                     What is really sought is the need to encourage a certain social and patriotic commitment
                     among students, a commitment 
                     that would be a useful viaticum to get rid of the colonial negation associated with
                     Black Africans. The idea is, in 
                     short, to create in the student a sense of “cultural nationalism” and Black pride.

                     the slave trade and slavery in the

                     the angle of the civilizations of the 
                     great empires or kingdoms of ancient and medieval Africa (see L6 to L11 in the 6th grade; L6 to L11 and 
                     then L14 to L17 in the 5th grade; L10 to L15 in the 4th grade). Aspects of the slave

                     among other things, the demographics

                     the gender and age of enslaved people, and its differential impact on regions in Senegal and across 
                     West Africa). In addition, teachers do not have access to materials that make it possible to
                     explore the 
                     actors involved — elites who controlled processes of enslavement and, importantly,
                     the enslaved themselves, some of

                     Toussaint Louverture, no enslaved person is ever named in the lessons on these issues. The teaching of
                     the 
                     phenomenon has not changed in the schools; the curriculum approaches generalized populations
                     of enslaved people as 
                     products, not as actors. Students are exposed to historical and literary texts on
                     the subject, they visit the Slave House 
                     on Gorée Island, and they prepare a dossier on Gorée in the slave trade or on research work to 
                     be presented in the form of a lecture. This means that the learners are more involved
                     in storytelling and narration than 
                     in the analysis and critical exploration of concrete and primary historical resources.
                     The teachers' background readings 
                     of the slave trade in the classroom reflect an embryonic conception of the facts that
                     consists 
                     “almost exclusively in blaming exogenous factors for the fate of Africa from the 15th
                     
                     century onwards” [<a class="ref" href="#seck2009">Seck 2009</a>, 72].

                     political, social and cultural data” [<a class="ref" href="#republique2006">Republique du Senegal 2006</a>, 5], it is imperative that students be 
                     exposed to statistical resources when learning about the slave trade and slavery.
                     It is also imperative that we humanize 
                     the study of slavery and the slave trade in Senegal, centering named people whose life histories are 
                     relatable and understandable. The Senegal Registers of Liberation are, therefore,
                     appropriate for studying and 
                     understanding the social history of this era, focusing first on the captives and only
                     then preceding to the political, 
                     economic, and institutional history of this phenomenon. This would be a history that
                     allows students to have a panoramic

                     people in Senegal 
                     between 1857 and 1903, which was recorded by French colonial officials after slavery
                     was abolished in 
                     Senegal, consists of twenty registers that together contain evidence of 28,930 liberations.
                     
                     They record “the date, the identification number assigned to that specific liberation, the name
                     of 
                     the enslaved person, place of birth, age, place of liberation in the colony of Senegal,
                     and name and 
                     position of the colonial administrator who authorized the liberation” [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin_etal2021">Goodwin, Ivans, Roberts, and Wall 2021</a>]. A team 
                     of Senegalese and American researchers have transcribed the registers into a dataset
                     and are making a searchable and 
                     analyzable version available 
                     (<a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5185180" onclick="window.open('https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5185180'); return false" class="ref">https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5185180</a>). As a 
                     compilation of liberations, the registers are a dashboard of freed enslaved people,
                     a kind of tracing of freedoms. They 
                     make it possible to analyze the rate and pace of releases and to better understand
                     the geopolitical and economic 
                     restructuring in a region like Senegambia. They clearly show that “unaccompanied 
                     minors accounted for 68% of the total number of unaccompanied women” [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin_etal2021">Goodwin, Ivans, Roberts, and Wall 2021</a>]. Indeed, 
                     the release of young people was more frequent than that of the elderly. The period
                     of release is also an interesting 
                     aspect studied by the registers. Goodwin et al. affirm that a “majority of releases 
                     occurred between the months of March and June (41%), the months of October to January
                     account for only 26% of the total 
                     releases between 1894 and 1903” [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin_etal2021">Goodwin, Ivans, Roberts, and Wall 2021</a>]. The registers are, in short, a document that 
                     traces the captives and their social and cultural history. They become, therefore,
                     a pedagogical resource of paramount 
                     importance. Their use can allow for a finer analysis of the dynamics of liberation
                     in Senegal in the 
                     nineteenth and twentieth centuries by promoting interactive teaching strategies which
                     are at the heart of pedagogical 
                     practices. But how?

                     aspects. A rigorous exploitation of this resource helps to see and insert into the
                     lessons the geographic and social origins of the captives, the periods of liberation,
                     and the actions of slaves. The Registers also allow us to create and teach both demographic
                     histories of generalized populations and life histories of named enslaved individuals.
                     We can at once understand broad patterns and humanize the study of slavery by piecing
                     together shards of information recorded in the primary source to uncover histories
                     of named enslaved people’s networks, familial relations, movements, and more. An analysis
                     of the liberations between 1881 and 1885 shows, for example, that the captives freed
                     by the jurisdictions of Saint-Louis, Dakar, Gorée, Dagana and Get Ndar came from various
                     regions of Senegambia: Sudan, Brouillard, Gambia, Fouta Diallon, Ouassoulou, Ngabou,
                     Cayor, Casamance, Haut-Niger, Guidimakha, Boundou and others. All age groups were
                     represented, as indicated in the registry: children (1 to 14 years), adolescents (15
                     to 25 years), adults (27 to 50 years). And within each of those age groups, the Registers
                     allow us to dig down to the level of the individual and understand through fragmentary
                     data something about individual’s unique life histories.</div>

                     of "different data to give them meaning according to the objectives pursued, defined
                     and decided by the collective in charge of the project" (Boutet, 2016, p. 28). It
                     is therefore a pedagogy of experience that encourages the learner to "understand reality".</div>

                     In other words, it is a pedagogy intended to make learners understand that the process
                     of acquiring knowledge and knowledge is based on mutualization. And that the percentage
                     of success is also the result of pooling in training. Cooperative learning includes
                     the category of social interaction models. In short, the approaches described above

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">It is easy to see that the advantage of the Registry is that it can promote active
                     and guided methods. In active methods, the teacher places the student at the center
                     of learning, encouraging him or her to construct his or her own knowledge by using
                     a variety of teaching resources adapted from the information in the Register. Such
                     active methods, fundamental in historical practice, fulfill the goals of the Consolidated
                     History Program but require an "organized and methodical sequence plan" focused on
                     situational and prerequisite (cognitive) preparation, modeling (explanatory phase),
                     guided practice, objectification, regular revisions, and evaluation (Couerbe, 2015).
                     This sequencing aims to motivate students, to inform them, and to encourage them to
                     analyze data, interact with one another, and produce historical analyses. It places
                     learners in the time frame of the history of the phenomenon studied and its multiple
                     ramifications. Exploring, analyzing, and interpreting digital data with students allows
                     them to become aware, from a comparative pedagogical perspective, of the multicultural
                     and multifaceted nature of the slave trade and slavery, to grasp "the identities forged
                     there, and to integrate into the construction of historical knowledge a community
                     of [Black] destiny that concerns the past and the present as well as the future" (Heimberg,
                     2009, p. 21).</div>

                     their appropriate and practical use argues in favor of three theoretical currents:
                     cognitivism, constructivism and socioconstructivism. "These three approaches have
                     in common that they recognize the determining role of the learner in the construction
                     of his or her own knowledge and skills" (Cardin, 2009, pp. 34-35). The use of evidence
                     from the Registers of Liberation enables instructors to adapt their teaching of the
                     slave trade to the intelligence and personality of the students. Thus, the look at
                     the socio-cultural statistics of the phenomenon in question, through pedagogical testing
                     (activities, tasks and confrontations), while advocating an "ethical use of the document",
                     allows students to construct history and to get out of the straitjacket of the standard
                     history of the slave trade and slavery, which is limited to recounting its causes,
                     mechanisms, organization and consequences. </div>

                     taught, and we know that the force of the lecture alone is powerless to fix passive
                     learning and knowledge, the practices of transmitting ‘a closed knowledge to which
                     students must adhere’ forcefully question, on the threshold of the twenty-first century,
                     the real stakes of historical training (Hery, 2009, p. 115).</div>

                     and slavery from the perspective of African slaves who sought their own freedom rather
                     than from the perspective of the capitalist slave traders in Europe and the Americas,

                     related to slavery and the slave trade. Who was made captive? From what geographic
                     regions did captives come from? From what societies and cultures? What names and surnames
                     did slaves have? Such sensitive information in a conservative society like Senegal’s
                     where the discussions of people’s servile descent are discouraged raises ethical raises
                     questions about the use of the Registries in the classroom. In the collective imagination,
                     enslaved people were inferior and descendants of enslaved people continue to carry
                     that stigma today. Thus, a kind of self-censorship around discussions of slavery has
                     been created to avoid conflicts and divisions that could undermine national cohesion.
                     It is attested that even in the humanistic studies the issue of slavery in Senegambian
                     societies has been almost silenced for a long time by African historians. For Ibrahima

                     contrasts sharply with the importance of the phenomenon, its generalization across
                     the continent, its variable scope from one era to another, the role and functions
                     of slaves in all areas of activity, and the diversity of their social status. </div>

                     audience, with ethics and the teaching of this phenomenon, which in some societies

                     the critical issues to address prior to using digital resources like the Registers
                     of Liberation. Marc Bloch (1974) called for an appropriation of the modern tools of
                     science in history. Such tools that do not make a clean sweep of the past, but that
                     are part of a transdisciplinary approach that allows for the forging of new formal
                     models for achieving the objectives of teaching and learning. Far from being only
                     a virtual library, the humanities are spaces for the construction of scientific knowledge
                     that can be used in class and exploited in accordance with current pedagogical recommendations.</div>

                     applied to the teaching of slavery in conservative societies such as Senegal’s, can
                     be destructive of cohesion and harmony between populations. For any descendant of
                     slaves who feels dehumanized by stereotypes, whether held by those who claim to be
                     masters or by anyone else, fosters resentment and feeds hatred. Ethics in such a case
                     would be part of a patriotic perspective.</div>

                     is to proceed by useful discrimination:  discrimination that would have as its goal
                     the respect of human dignity. This would not mean ignoring historical reality. It
                     is a question of acting with respect, morality and prudence in the process of transmission.</div>

                     when it comes to taking an interest in slavery, calls for the data to be appropriated
                     pedagogically, that is to say, bearing in mind that not everything can be transmitted
                     and said as such without subterfuge. Clearly, it is a question of to bring about the
                     “emergence of a digital materialism” based on appropriate methods of training, learning
                     and information transmission. In this case, the digital historical resource should
                     be used not as a "bomb" that destroys social cohesion, but as material for reflection,
                     science, didactics and pedagogy. It then becomes what pedagogues and didacticians
                     would describe as toolboxes for the trainer and the teacher that are part of two levers
                     of performance of the history curriculum: teaching through tools and sources.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">The challenges linked to the use of digital humanities in educational pedagogy are
                     many and varied. The development of technologies in a connected century means that
                     no training and learning process can ignore digital technology. What's at stake is
                     the quality of learning and the performance of pupils and students, who feel more
                     at home with the web than with paper; hence their conception of Learners 2.0 to magnify
                     their attachment to the digital world. The learner 2.0 is that learner of the technological
                     and digital age. A learner who is aware of digital innovations, which are part of
                     their experience, their activities and their daily evolution. This is why introducing
                     pedagogical innovations using digital humanities means connecting Senegalese schools
                     and learners to the world of today and tomorrow. This would also be in line with principles
                     of the New School for Senegal<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e533">[6]</a>, a modern school serving the universal, where teachers are called upon to be in phase
                     with the new knowledge and methods in History and commonly accepted for their relevance,
                     originality, validity and decisive contribution to learners. It is a question of innovating
                     for science, and society by understanding that the digital humanities promote the
                     activity of the student, individualization and collaborative work, in practice transmissive
                     pedagogy.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Moreover, incorporating digital humanities into teaching practice means introducing
                     both teachers and students to the concept of scripting: “entering the digital era
                     of learning head-on" (Sauvage, 2019). The challenge, in fact, is to think of a digital
                     pedagogy of the future applicable to History. It's a question of thinking about teaching
                     History by the click of a mouse, which "enables us to move beyond the ancestral and
                     obsolete (albeit etymological) association of work/suffering towards learning/pleasure”
                     (Sauvage, 2019). It is also a question of integrating the teaching of history in Senegal
                     into globalization, with the aim of inscribing it and the learners in the time-world
                     of digital pedagogy, which constitutes an inevitable training imperative in a century
                     of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).</div>

                     and Communication Technologies; if modernity inevitably involves the integration of
                     nations into the digital world, we are called upon, within the framework of our training
                     curricula, to give a central place to the digital humanities. Digital innovation must
                     be a prime concern and imperative. It will be a question of pedagogical adaptation
                     via digital didactics in History. For the educational dimension of digital humanities
                     is expressed in "the transmission of skills within and outside educational institutions,
                     the training of trainers and teachers, democratization and open access to culture"

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">The treatment of issues related to the slave trade and slavery in the Senegalese middle
                     cycle is trapped in a form of academic writing of the phenomenon that privileges its
                     mechanisms, its consequences, and its areas of action. This form of history relegates
                     the captive as a demographic, social and cultural subject to the background. Thus,
                     we need to make a sociological history of the captive in the turmoil of the slave
                     trade and slavery more central to the history of Senegal. Teachers have been hindered
                     in this task by the lack of available sources on slavery in Senegal. The open-source,
                     online version of the Senegal Registers of Liberation allows us to fill this historiographic
                     gap. The possible didactic transposition of the data from this register can promote
                     the renewal of school history on this issue. In addition, it argues in favor of a
                     lively and constructive pedagogy that allows teachers and learners to break with the
                     liturgy and traditional rites of teaching about the slave trade and slavery in class.
                     The implementation of activities and tasks that give a great deal of space to the
                     analysis of figures, to the sociology of the captives and to their geographical and
                     cultural origins not only makes it possible not to dissociate historical culture from
                     the interests of the student, but also to make the pedagogical space the cradle of
                     historical vocations and of the collective consciousness that is so much sought after
                     in a century of conflicting identities. The use of this register must however be accompanied
                     by a robust discussion of the ethics and morality of transmission of this history
                     in order for digital humanities not to become a tool of social disarticulations.</div>

                     should we reconcile the teaching of history and the use of digital technology? Even
                     if the problem has arisen in the recent past, the efforts made to equip certain schools
                     with computer rooms are helping to encourage pedagogical innovations associated with
                     digital technology. The requirement to be part of these innovations has become an
                     imperative that the COVID-19 pandemic has helped to bring to light. From now on, education
