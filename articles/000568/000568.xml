            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>Since there has been a recent trend to establishing virtual museums, which various
               institutions have swiftly responded to, the objective of this paper is to understand
               the nature of virtual and/or digital museums by focusing on their particular
               characteristics. In this approach, the paper proceeds from the assumption that museum
               representations in the virtual space and/or virtual museums could extend conventional
               or physical museum space, leading to enhanced visitor attraction and experience. The
               paper thus focuses on the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and
               transdisciplinary object of investigation from the perspective of museology and
               digital humanities and seeks to ascertain whether scholarly and practical impacts are
               achieved. It also analyses the expected impacts on practical museum work and visitor
               needs, especially with respect to the tasks museums are required to fulfil in times
               of crisis. </p>

            <p>Analyzing the characteristics of virtual/digital museums, this paper presents the

            <p>The increased importance attached to virtual museums has transformed them into a
               major object of investigation, both in practice and in theory. In this context, this
               methodological and theory-driven paper asks whether and how digital and/or virtual
               museums could extend conventional and prevalent physical museum spaces. The paper
               argues that a virtual museum could serve as an interdisciplinary and
               transdisciplinary object of investigation<note> Various approaches and disciplines,
                  such as museum studies and media theory, deal with expanding museum communication
                  by using the term virtualisation or virtual museums, see: <ref
                     target="#niewerth2020" loc="521–2">Niewerth (2020), 521-532</ref>.</note>,
               making special reference to the scholarly background of the disciplines of museology
               and digital humanities and investigating the specific characteristics of virtual
               museums.</p>
            <p>Against this backdrop, the paper proposes that the digital virtual museum could
               extend conventional museum space by providing enhanced visitor experiences in terms
               of engagement and attraction. It investigates the manifold scholarly and practical
               impacts of extending the physical museum space into the virtual world from the
               theoretical perspectives of museology and digital humanities, as well as with respect
               to practical approaches that are necessary for museums and their visitors and users.
               In that context, the paper also relates to the relevance of virtual museums for
               museums and their visitors, especially in times of crisis, hence, particularly in
               times when those museums have to close their collections and exhibitions for various
               reasons, for example, in the current pandemic situation.</p>
            <p>At least in the German speaking world, the term <q>virtual museum</q> has been
               subject of discussion since the 1990s, but is still awaiting a clear definition (see

            <p>To answer the research question as to how digital or virtual museums should extend
               conventional museum space as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of
               investigation, the paper first focuses on the characteristics of recent digital or
               virtual museums, in order to find out how they engage with and attract museum
               visitors compared with physical museum space. In this context, the focus lies on the
               differences between, and similarities of, conventional and virtual museum spaces and
               refers to state-of-the-art museology and museum studies and digital humanities
               respectively.</p>
            <p>Secondly, taking the previously mentioned into consideration, the paper sets out to
               achieve an understanding of a virtual museum and its characteristics against the
               backdrop of the responsible disciplines concerned with that field, especially from
               the perspective of general museology <ptr target="#waidacher1999a"/>
               <ptr target="#desvallees2010"/>. General museology differs from other object-centred
               disciplines of the humanities as well as from the approach taken by museum studies in
               the way it defines its object of knowledge. Museology defines this as a special
               relationship of man to his environment, leading to the selection, preservation,
               interpretation and exhibition of meaningful objects. This relationship is also
               referred to as museality (see <ref target="#stransky1971a">Stránský [1971a]</ref>;
               and <ref target="#biedermann2017b">Biedermann [2017b]</ref>). From the perspective of
               ‘general museology’, museality is a supratemporal quality expressed differently in
               various times, its recent expression being the conventional or physical museum space
               of the institutional museum displaying museum objects physically to engage
               visitors.</p>
            <p>Consequently, the paper presents perspectives in order to achieve an understanding of
               the virtual museum as extended museum space from the perspective of digital
               humanities <ptr target="#jannidis2017"/>
               <ptr target="#kurz2015"/>
               <ptr target="#terras2013"/>, exploring strategies to digitally augment physical
               museum space. In this context, the paper draws on the approach taken by the
               University of Graz. Both disciplines are concerned with the topic of a virtual museum
               and, in that context, subsequently define the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary
               and transdisciplinary object of investigation with respect to the fundamental
               theoretical and practical aspects concerned.</p>
            <p>On this basis, I also address the challenges of establishing a virtual museum, or
               museum (re)presentations in virtual space, as interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary
               objects of investigation, and I consider practical approaches to establishing a
               virtual museum. </p>
            <p>Finally, the paper expounds on the relevant impacts of virtual museums with regard to
               the underlying research question as to how digital virtual museums could extend
               conventional and prevalent physical museum space. Impacts also include practical
               aspects of museum work as well as those relating to visitors and users. All these
               impacts are key to addressing new target groups, along with the crucial aspect that
               virtual museums can provide access to museum collections and their communication
               strategies even in times when museums have to close their doors to the public, for
               example, during the current Coronavirus crisis, which is just one of several possible
               scenarios.</p>
            <p>In its conclusion, the paper subsumes the relevant research desiderata in the field,
               especially in terms of establishing a virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and
               transdisciplinary field of application for the disciplines of general museology and
               digital humanities, finally also presenting a vision of what a virtual museum
               (considering the theoretical aspects in question) could look like.</p>

            <head>Characterising a virtual museum</head>
            <p>At least in German speaking regions, the term <q>virtual museum</q> has been
               controversially discussed since the 1990s <ptr target="#schweibenz2016"/>
               <ptr target="#biedermann2017a"/>
               <ptr target="#niewerth2020"/>, thus challenging the well-established museum
               definition proposed by the International Council of Museums (ICOM)<note>ICOM: <ref
                     target="https://icom.museum/en/resources/standards-guidelines/museum-definition/"
                     >https://icom.museum/en/resources/standards-guidelines/museum-definition/</ref>
               </note>. The ICOM’s museum definition refers to physical museums’ objects as being
               selected, preserved, interpreted and exhibited. Concerning virtual museums, sceptics
               have argued for physical museum space and physical engagement with the real object,
               which cannot be virtualised and thus substituted by a digital one, just as virtual
               restaurants cannot serve a real meal. From that perspective, virtualising physical
               museum space would also mean virtualising the actual creative and physical encounter
               between people of the present and authentic witnesses of the past. This assumption
               posits that the museum visitor’s encounter with the physical world cannot be
               transposed to the virtual world. That is the reason why <q>virtual museum</q> was
               interpreted as an oxymoron term. </p>
            <p>Finally, a methodological expedient defines representations of museum collections in
               virtual space and the originating <q>e-tangibles</q> (see <ref target="#parry2007"
                  loc="68">Parry [2007] 68</ref>) as additional forms of museum communication that
               neither substitute nor compete with the real and physical museum, but rather address
               various other communication needs of visitors (see <ref target="#beidermann2017a"
                  >Biedermann [2017a]</ref>). </p>
            <p>While German-speaking regions call for a <q>digital museum,</q> the Anglophone world
               argues in favour of the term <q>virtual museum.</q> However, both define it as a
               digital entity which summarises digital reproductions of museum objects (see
                  Wikipedia)<note> See entry <title rend="quotes">Virtual Museum</title> in English
                  Wikipedia: <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_museum"

               </note> appear specifically as museum online databases or web portals. Consequently,
               many museums are digitising, or have already digitised their collections
               systematically, and their visitors have access to considerably more museum objects
               via the world wide web than was the case only a few years ago. Basically, they draw
               on museum collections and museum object data digitally enriched and represented in
               various forms in the virtual space. They appear as museum databases providing open
               access to museum object data and digital images of museum objects, as well as digital
               online exhibitions focusing on various topics.<note>See for example: Technisches

               forms of museum communication now reflect a rather modified perspective and method in
               the visitor’s perception and therefore extend conventional museum space to encompass
               modified space. </p>
            <p>Additionally, digital museum features enhance conventional museum space by means of

               to augment museal reality, whereby virtual museums, galleries and cultural heritage
               tours can all complement, enhance and augment conventional museum space, especially
               through interactivity and user experience.<note>See Google Arts and Culture: <ref

            <p>Moreover, 3D techniques expand the field of digital museum features in virtual space
               by 3D scanning of objects. These scans create virtual copies of museum objects that
               serve the purpose of digitally turning the object or zooming in, which is not
               possible in the case of original museum objects. 3D prints of these objects enhance
               the user experience in physical museum space, because of the possibility to touch and
               handle them. Virtual museum space also provides online access to 3D copies of museum
                  objects<note>For example, the Pergamon Altar: <ref
                     target="http://3d.smb.museum/pergamonaltar/"

               </note> and to 3D tours of conventional museum space. This is why applied 3D
               techniques also broadly augment conventional museum space by immersive methods and
               provide a virtual reality to enable manifold possibilities of interactive visitor
               engagement (see <ref target="#carrozzino2010">Carrozzino and Bergamasco

                     zu werden</quote>
                  <ptr target="#waidacher1999a" loc="708"/>.</note> Currently, the conventional
               museum still dominates scientific discourse relating to museum documentation and
               presentation.</p>
            <p>According to the theory of museality, to give just one example, the vehicle in which
               heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were
               assassinated on 28th June 1914, is an authentic witness of this event. It is a
                  <q>Gräf &amp; Stift Double Phaeton</q> car, which is currently on display at the
               Museum of Military History in Vienna (Heeresgeschichtliches Museum Vienna). That
               vehicle bears witness to the event that triggered the outbreak of the First World
               War; it has a special function as an object of memory concerning the persons involved
               – especially the murdered heir to the throne and his wife. At the same time, the
               object is emblematic – it symbolises the outbreak of WWI. Hence, it serves as a
               bearer of museality and possesses effective legitimacy to act as a museum object.
               Needless to say, this artefact could transport many more stories than the one
               mentioned above (see also Heeresgeschichtliches Museum Vienna).<note>See the online
                  museum display of the above vehicle in the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna:
                     <ref
                     target="https://www.hgm.at/ausstellungen/dauerausstellungen/das-attentat-von-sarajevo-28-juni-1914"
                     >https://www.hgm.at/ausstellungen/dauerausstellungen/das-attentat-von-sarajevo-28-juni-1914</ref>
               </note> Nevertheless, the intrinsic aim, goal and purpose of any conventional museum
               space – as the display showing the Archduke’s vehicle exemplifies – is the actual
               creative encounter between a present-day person and an authentic object of
               history.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, from the perspective of museology it is a central and defining point
               that museum objects can serve as authentic witnesses of an event or a process.
               Moreover, they relate to persons, dates and places, and therefore, the object is an
               item of evidence for something or somebody. A scientific and hermeneutical process
               verifies this evidence and defines an object as bearer of museality. At the same
               time, this object becomes a <quote rend="inline">nouophor</quote> – a bearer of sense
               and meaning <ptr target="#waidacher1997" loc="20"/>. The unique aspect of the concept
               museality lies in its time independence, which means that it appears independent of
               time by changing forms of its expression. Consequently, it deserves a mirror of
               historical circumstances. At the same time, museality determines the object of
               interest as part of the discipline museology and defines museology as belonging to
               the humanities (see <ref target="#biedermann2017b">Biedermann [2017b]</ref>).</p>
            <p>Museology focuses on objects as sources and acts from a meta-perspective in terms of
               other object-centred disciplines of the humanities (such as art history, ethnology or
               archaeology) and natural sciences (such as geology, zoology, physics and so on). The
               objects thus act as evidence for various events and are especially significant – both
               with regard to their materiality <ptr target="#pearce1992" loc="1–10"/>
               <ptr target="#buchli2002"/> and symbolic meaning <ptr target="#pearce1992"/>
               <ptr target="#marstine2006" loc="1–36"/>
               <ptr target="#carbonell2012"/>. As a result, objects are able to tell numerous
               stories depending on the focus of the display and the storytelling.</p>
            <p>Both the approaches of museology and museum studies focus on questions of digitising
               and virtualising forms of museum communication (see <ref target="#parry2010">Parry
                  [2010]</ref>; <ref target="#hoptman1994">Hoptman [1994]</ref>; <ref
                  target="#langner2015">Langner [2015]</ref>; <ref target="#navarrete2016">Navarrete
                  and Owen [2016]</ref>; <ref target="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw [2015]</ref>). In that
               context, they reflect the claim to authenticity of conventional museum spaces (see
                  <ref target="#parry2007">Parry [2007]</ref>). </p>
            <p>However, amongst other examples, the digital presentation of the Archduke’s vehicle
               shows that forms of digital presentations are generally becoming more important for
               conventional museums, which have been enlarging their digitisation and virtualisation
               programmes for many years. </p>

            <head>Virtualising museums from the perspective of the digital humanities</head>
            <p>Particularly in German speaking regions, research in the field of digital humanities
               focuses on the information content of humanistic sources and primarily on modelling
               that content. Basically, this means describing and managing as well as visualising
               (meta)data by means of information transformation and exchange for the purpose of
               information intercommunication (see <ref target="#arthur2014">Arthur and Bode
                  [2014]</ref>; <ref target="#buttcher2016">Büttcher, Clarke and La Cormack
                  [2016]</ref>; <ref target="#cartner2013">Cartner [2013]</ref>; <ref
                  target="#jannidis2017">Jannidis, Kohle and Rehbein [2017]</ref>; <ref

                  and Siemens [2016]</ref>; <ref target="#terras2013">Terras, Nyhan and Vanhoutte
                  [2013]</ref>). </p>
            <p>Hence, in the German language-related context outlined above, the field of digital
               humanities is also beginning to highlight the museum as object of investigation (see
                  <ref target="#rehbein2019">Rehbein and Kunze [2019]</ref>) with a focus on
               digitising, enriching, standardising, formalising and contextualising museum object
               data. Moreover, digital humanities are supporting the discipline of museum
               presentation by using visualising techniques and offering open access to relevant
               data, which broadens the field to address new research questions. </p>
            <p>This approach applies digital standards of museum object documentation such as LIDO,
               which is compliant to the CIDOC-CRM.<note>LIDO is the Lightweight Information

               using castles in Prussia).<note>Herder Institut in Marburg: <ref

               The digital humanities systematise various interpretations of 3D copies, and
               reconstructions are also a matter of interest (see <ref target="#munster2016">Münster
                  [2016]</ref>). In this context, the technique of photogrammetry plays an important
               role in 3D scanning and copying museum objects. The University of Graz, which plays
               no small role in those pioneering achievements, has designed an online platform as a
                  <quote rend="inline">virtual museum</quote> for its digitised object collections
               on GAMS – an asset management system for the humanities (GAMS virtual

               </note>
               <ref target="#stigler2017">Stigler and Steiner [2017]</ref>). In that way, the object
               of study of digital humanities is gradually extending from text sources to cultural
               heritage and historical objects within the interior and exterior museum space (see
                  <ref target="#reisinger2013">Reisinger [2013]</ref>; see also the project
                  DiTAH).<note>The DiTAH project (Digital Transformation in Austrian Humanities)
                  focuses on the infrastructure and the tools and methods needed to transfer
                  research data to the public. In this context, cultural heritage data also plays an
                  important role. The university museums at the University of Graz are also project
                  partners and use the data of historical instruments for this analysis; see: <ref
                     target="https://www.ditah.at/">https://www.ditah.at/</ref>.</note></p>
            <p>The University of Graz’s approach in the context of digital humanities is based on
               semantic annotation, processing for tagging and analysing texts realised by special,
               almost XML-based standards (such as TEI – Text Encoding Initiative),<note> TEI: <ref
                     target="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">www.tei-c.org/index.xml</ref>
               </note> as well as visualising structured content by means of serialisations (such as
               XML, RDFa or JSON-LD).<note>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a simple, very
                  flexible text format (see XML: <ref target="http://www.w3.org/XML/"
                     >http://www.w3.org/XML/</ref>).RDFa is a specification for attributes to
                  express structured data in HTML5, XHTML and any XML application (see RDFa: <ref
                     target="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDFa"
                     >https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDFa</ref>).JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked

                     >https://json-ld.org/</ref>).</note> In this approach, controlled vocabularies
               use knowledge systems to structure information, and subsequently to exchange data
               (for example, RDF, SKOS and OWL).<note>RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a

            <head>Virtual Museums as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of
               investigation and extended museum space</head>
            <p>Virtualising physical museum space has effects on conventional museums, especially in
               terms of their presentation and communication strategies. The focus of museum
               communication always lies on the audience as a major subject of interest, as well as
               on digital forms of museum communication. At the same time, those digital processes
               and projects mentioned above are in the process of modifying conventional museum
               space and transferring communication strategies to the digital and/or virtual world
               as a kind of <quote rend="inline">public museum ecosystem</quote>
               <ptr target="#hartig2019"/>. Neither the conventional museum space nor its modified
               counterpart correspond to virtual space, as they generate two different kinds of
               perception. Consequently, the experience of physical space in conventional museums,
               which a virtual museum obviously lacks, needs to be configured to serve as an
               extended museum experience in virtual space – and vice versa.</p>
            <p>As a consequence, the virtual museum requires extended methods based on the theory of
               classical museology and on digital humanities to define tasks for and impacts of
               museums in the virtual space. From a scientific point of view, these <q>new</q>
               challenges give rise to an interdisciplinary field in the discourse between the poles
               of museology and digital humanities and information technologies respectively. The
               question of characteristics and criteria of virtual museums are thus becoming a
               mutually transdisciplinary object of investigation within current discourse, which
               needs to be viewed against the backdrop of current projects and with regard to
               state-of-the-art virtual museums. </p>
            <p>While debating on a virtual museum within an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary
               discourse between the poles of digital humanities and museology, it is vital to
               understand the particular characteristics of museum objects, as opposed to texts.
               From a museological perspective, texts are documents of the mind and especially
               determined by the content of information they transfer <ptr target="#waidacher1999b"
                  loc="5"/>. By contrast, a museum object is a singular man-made artefact or a
               selected natural object, a semiophor, or bearer of symbols (see <ref
                  target="#pomian1988">Pomian [1988]</ref>), and more explicitly – as already
               mentioned – as a nouophor <ptr target="#waidacher1998"/>, or bearer of sense and
               meaning. The value of a museum object is thus inextricably linked to its context
               information and its special object history. Hence, it is determined by the extent of
               its documented ‘object biography’. Museum documentation thereby defines an object,
               not only in terms of its materiality – by way of primary documentation (see <ref
                  target="#waidacher1999b">Waidacher [1999b]</ref>), but also in terms of being a
               material witness concerning special events or circumstances – by way of secondary
               documentation <ptr target="#waidacher1999b"/>, which also refers to the immaterial
               aspects of museum objects to be documented.</p>
            <p>In this context, the question arises of how to characterise a virtual museum and how
               to define its appearance from an interdisciplinary point of view. The
               interdisciplinary challenge is therefore to bridge the gap between real and virtual
               museum spaces, but not by substituting one for the other through simulation,
               comparable with Plato’s allegory of the cave. Conversely, a video call suffices to
               interconnect and transfer information but is not able to substitute a physical
               encounter – as aptly demonstrated and emotively experienced during the ongoing recent
               Coronavirus crisis. After all, a photograph or hologram is not a physically present
               person, but merely a (virtual) representation of that person. The challenges
               concerning authenticity and space are obviously central to this discourse. </p>
            <p>In that sense, several research questions arise from the perspective of digital
               humanities. The challenges to be faced in this regard concern the extension of
               conventional museum space into virtual space by enabling an enhanced visitor
               experience. This enhanced experience is created by communicating the specialities of
               the institution museum, which is grounded in the museum object as a bearer of sense
               and meaning and as an expression of museality. This is precisely why the basic
               objective of virtualising physical museum space is to communicate museum objects,
               (hidden) (hi)stories and contexts by using methods and tools of digital humanities in
               a way that conventional museums are not able to.</p>
            <p>As a consequence, the challenges of digital humanities regarding a virtual museum
               first of all face the processes of modelling the object metadata for presentation and
               visualisation in physical as well as virtual spaces. From the perspective of
               museology, these challenges refer to the circulation of museum objects within the
               process of documenting or collecting metadata. This process corresponds to
               registering, making an inventory and cataloguing the items as well as collecting data
               relating to the entire object history in the context of ‘biography’, including the
               immaterial aspects of the museum object. From the perspective of applied museology,
               these processes are operated by a museum management system, for example, a database.
               As regards digital methods, this means information modelling, describing,
               standardising and formalising metadata, as well as managing and ordering
               knowledge.</p>
            <p>Collecting the basic data of museum objects – from a museological perspective, the
               so-called primary documentation – means to register data that refers to the
               materiality of the object, such as its material, form, technique, measurements and so
               on. Primary documentation also means gathering information in terms of primary events
               to which the object is linked, such as producers, developers, artists and users as
               historic subjects. Museum curators, exhibit designers and museum staff act as a
                  <q>museum’s instance</q> which corresponds in most classic museum spaces to the
               museum’s interpretational sovereignty from a scientific point of view. In a further
               step, all of the gathered data is modelled and describes the objects and the object
               data as metadata. All in all, digital methods are used to manage and order
               knowledge.</p>
            <p>Museum documentation also collects data relating to dates and place names of objects.
               To again cite the example of Franz-Ferdinand’s motorcar, the 28th June 1914 is a
               relevant date that is primarily associated with this object. However, it is also
               related to the 15th December 1919, the date on which the owner of the object, Count
               Harrach, a friend of the Imperial Family, donated this vehicle to the heir to the
               throne. </p>
            <p>In the context of structuring object data in a logical order, various challenges
               concerning the standardisation of data can arise. Art historians often use the term
                  <q>indeed</q> or <q>probably</q> to express the time ‘around 1900’ to which an
               object is related. However, this classification is unreadable for machines because
               they need relatively accurate dates to process the data. To render date-related data
               machine-readable, and thus traceable, using search engines, the curators have to
               define concrete dates according to documentation guidelines, for example instead of
                  <q>indeed around 1900</q> they use 1895 as the earliest and 1905 as the latest
               date of production. Specifying information, of course, goes hand in hand with the
               hermeneutical process of researching object biographies. Consequently, such
               documentation guidelines should be used for an entire collection and virtual museum
               respectively.</p>
            <p>The secondary documentation process collects data describing the object as a bearer
               of sense and meaning, as a nouophor and an expression of museality. This results from
               the hermeneutic process of investigating an object as an expression of museality and
               describes the object from a synchronic as well as a diachronic perspective.
               Consequently, an object can have associations, for instance, to birth, baptism,
               marriage, death or – like the vehicle described – to assassination and war. In
               addition, the vehicle plays an important role in the discourse of memory culture as
               well as in the context of the recent commemoration of the outbreak and end of World
               War I and their anniversaries (1914/18-2014/18). </p>
            <p>Furthermore, objects have relations to museum-related administrative workflows such
               as loans, conservation activities and displays, which is primarily relevant to
               collection management. These basic and deepened object data, which are the results of
               primary and secondary documentation, build the foundation for visualisations in
               virtual space (for example managed by digital transformations, like XSLT<note> XSLT:
                     <ref target="http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/transformation#xslt"
                     >http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/transformation#xslt</ref>
               </note>). </p>
            <p>The first step in collecting data is managed by surfaces of databases or
               repositories, or in the case of smaller museums or projects, by Excel spreadsheets or
               word templates. These templates are mapped to already existing XML-based museum
               documentation standards like LIDO or also to TEI by using transformations and with
               the help of special programmes and (open source) software (see Oxygen<note>
                  <ref target="https://www.oxygenxml.com/">https://www.oxygenxml.com/</ref>

            <p>Museum objects are especially relevant in terms of their meaning and the events and
               persons they bear witness to. Consequently, there are unlimited options of relations
               between objects and events, persons, times and places, just as in the case of
               categories which describe these object relations. This means enhancing controlled
               vocabulary by using museological criteria, which particularly requires the
               establishment of museological thesauri. Such thesauri form structured concepts of
               object meaning in systems of controlled vocabulary. The XML standard SKOS is one
               possible and useful digital standard (see SKOS)<note><ref
                     target="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SKOS"
                     >https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SKOS</ref>
               </note> to map controlled vocabulary. SKOS categorises each concept by means of an
               identifier, which references the concept of the thesauri and contributes to
               representing the object meaning. By integrating these concepts into semantic web
               technologies (referring to SKOS), data is also accessible as <q>linked open data,</q>
               thereby enriching the semantic web.</p>
            <p>Different categories of sources, like index cards and images can reveal the history
               or the biography of museum objects. They show the provenance of objects and parts of
               the stories stored in objects. Digital collection complexes in virtual space enable
               all this information to interlink and link to the object in a structured manner. In
               this way, visitors can enjoy a multi-perspective view of the unique object. This also
               applies to the <q>open GLAM initiative</q> (see Open GLAM)<note><ref
                     target="https://openglam.org/">https://openglam.org/</ref>
               </note> and to the claim of open access to memory-related institutional data, in
               particular with regard to galleries, libraries, archives and museums.</p>
            <p>Requirements for digital humanities not only apply to the workflow of museum
               documentation, but also to the presentation method. To exemplify the University of
               Graz’s digital humanities approach, transformations of modelled data form the basis
               for data visualisations realised by XSLT-stylesheets, which support data output in
               various forms and formats (like PDF, XHTML, SVG, SMIL)<note>PDF is a Portable

               also at least printed on paper. These transformations map collected data on webpages,
               for example, and in terms of databases, interfaces are provided to support web
               presentations. These presentations map object biographies by linking objects to their
               metadata, to images and additional context information, and provide multi-perspective
               access to view the items. In this way, it is possible to create undreamt-of links to
               objects and collections which are not displayed or displayable, or which are
               dislocated, taking account of their very specific relations.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the medium text, which, from the perspective of digital humanities,
               often requires the separation of form and content <ptr target="#sahle2013"/>, the
               museum object calls for concentration on the single authentic object in combination
               with its metadata to which the object is intrinsically linked. As regards virtual
               museums, the aspect of museum documentation or data gathering is of special
               importance due to the need to build a basis for all other virtual communication
               strategies of digital storytelling, 3D techniques and augmented reality. On the basis
               of museum documentation, the object requires special tools to manage story-telling in
               order to offer narratives. Virtual space enables objects to be brought together,
               which for various museological reasons cannot be displayed (together) in conventional
               museum space. In addition, virtual museum presentations provide narrative access to
               objects on virtual guided tours, also giving narrative approaches to museum objects
               by linking object data, images and various groups of objects. The digital humanities,
               and in this context, informatics, thus also develop tools for the presentation of
               virtual guided tours (see: e.g. StoryMapJS).<note>

                     >https://storymap.knightlab.com/</ref>
               </note></p>
            <p>In the digital museum age, digital images which include metadata standards to
               describe and deliver images (see III-F)<note>III-F (International Image
                  Interoperability Framework) defines interfaces to provide standardised methods of
                  describing and delivering images via the web (see III-F: III-F: <ref
                     target="http://iiif.io/">http://iiif.io/</ref>).</note> are state-of-the-art.
               High-resolution images allow users to zoom in on a virtual object, which would not be
               possible in physical museum space. In order to do that, digital humanities use the
               standard III-F. </p>
            <p>The use of 3D-techniques in particular can bring new insights to the investigation of
               materiality and object biographies, which can be useful in a certain way, both for
               research purposes and for communicating objects. Special tools not only support zoom
               factors for high-resolution images, but also 3D object data. Such tools need to
               include an audio response, multimedia offers and 3D animations based on 3D scans to
               consequently augment conventional museum reality to extended forms of museum
               presentation in today’s digital age. Various different surfaces and responsibly
               designed media allow visitors to access museum data using various forms of output
               mediums.</p>
            <p>Such tools can also contribute to engaging visitor attention <ptr
                  target="#bitgood2016"/>, because of the greater mental effort involved in browsing
               through object stories of one’s own accord, additionally supported, for instance, by
               audio and image animations, 3D-object visualisations and virtual guided tours in
               online exhibitions and – vice versa – in physical museum space as well.</p>
            <p>As regards physical museum space, all of these tools can help combine object
               biographies and the context information of objects in accordance with the visitor’s
               personal interests and needs. For that purpose, digital media used in the classic
               museum space can complement conventional museum labels. Extending conventional museum
               spaces by means of digital technologies can be achieved in displays using replicas
               printed in 3D. These replicas address groups of visitors, such as children, who
               perceive certain effects by touching the 3D copies and experience these objects in
               that particular mode of perception. Moreover, the aspect of augmented reality can
               enhance visitor experiences of museum objects by using immersive technologies that
               involve the visitors in the content. </p>
            <p>Immersive methods (see <ref target="#dowling2019">Dowling [2019]</ref>) are a means
               of special communication also used in physical museum exhibitions to engage in a
               narrative or storytelling process, thus provoking a condition of flow. This status
               can also be evoked in the virtual world by means of various tools, offering, for
               example, digital storytelling using augmented reality methods (for technical
               implementation, see <ref target="#yuan2019">Yuan [2019]</ref>).</p>

            <head>Impacts of virtual museums</head>
            <p>All of these possibilities of linking and enriching the web with museum object
               metadata also serve the purpose of extending conventional and modified museum space
               to create a kind of <quote rend="inline">public museum ecosystem</quote>
               <ptr target="#hartig2019"/>, and hence to offer extended visitor and user experiences
               in the virtual space. Conversely, conventional museum space is able to integrate
               virtual museum experiences such as 3D techniques and augmented reality. However, in
               that way a museum representation in virtual space can rely on the extended space of
               museal experience. As a result, the extended museum space of a virtual museum has
               manifold impacts in terms of museology, digital humanities, museums and visitors. </p>
            <p>In terms of museology, virtual museum space serves to extend conventional physical
               museum space in multiple ways: by enriching museum object data digitally,
               communicating with visitors with the help of social media, offering access to digital
               object databases and online exhibitions, or providing 3D views on objects in the
               virtual world. Furthermore, an extended conventional museum space virtually maps
               manifold object data and their stories, such as museum object-related contextual
               information. It communicates narratives and relationships of and between museum
               objects and collections. A virtual museum integrates various forms of communication
               used within physical museum space, such as guided tours, lectures and presentations
               offered by museum staff, thus augmenting conventional museum space by using its own
               3D views. Also, a virtual museum represents the classic museum space
               three-dimensionally and links all possible museum object stories, images, 3D views,
               and storytelling tools to provide users with a virtual reality-assisted museum space
               based on museum objects and their relations to society, which always build the point
               of reference. Against this backdrop, it becomes clear that virtual museum reality
               strives to extend the theoretical approach of general museology into virtual space,
               as well as clarify aspects of authenticity and space to which a museum object is
               linked.</p>
            <p>In terms of digital humanities, standards in museum object documentation and data
               enriching need to be extended by including museological aspects. Furthermore, a
               virtual museum uses a wide array of (immersive) digital methods and tools for special
               visualisation requirements which need to be further developed as regards the aspect
               of museology. Impacts for digital humanities or informatics also concern data storage
               and the provision of access to object data. Establishing a virtual museum means
               storing a large amount of data in terms of high-resolution images, videos or 3D
               copies as well. It must be able to support the process of dealing with complex user
               queries concerning various knowledge systems and object stories. On this basis, it is
               possible to manage complex collection analyses with reference to the uniqueness of
               museum objects.</p>
            <p>An issue that goes hand in hand with that is the amount of time needed to load data
               and to process complex queries, which can influence visitor behaviour when browsing
               through the collections, and subsequently also the decision and will to visit a
               conventional museum. Managing personal and institutional data as well as image data,
               which involves applying for special licences, are hard facts (see Creative Commons
                     licences).<note><ref
                     target="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/"
                     >https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/</ref>
               </note></p>
            <p>As a result, visitors and users browse through virtual museum space, selecting and
               experiencing museum object reproductions, virtually combined with manifold museum
               object information, context data and storytelling narratives. Users gain virtual
               access to the aspect of authenticity of museum objects, which means linking up
               objects and object data, and depicting and representing object relations related to a
               specific relevant event, to which an object bears witness. This access is independent
               of opening hours and physical accessibility, and at the same time, it does not
               replace the original object’s authenticity.</p>
            <p>The aspect of open access to museum collections in the form of a virtual museum
               reality is of special relevance in times of crisis, which the ongoing recent global
               Coronavirus crisis has clearly shown, as long as users have access to the internet.
               International museum organisations have requested museums to enlarge their digital
               communication strategies to provide museum visitors with information about their
               collections. For example, UMAC (the international committee for university museums
               and collections in the context of ICOM international) provided webinars to the
               professional university museum community to enable discussion on the impacts of the
               lockdown especially for university museums (UMAC ICOM).<note><ref
                     target="http://umac.icom.museum/resources/webinars/"
                     >http://umac.icom.museum/resources/webinars/</ref>
               </note> One year on, many initiatives have found their way to various users, such as
               the virtual museum of the University of Cantabria (Luis Quintanilla, Art and Memory).<note>
                  <ref
                     target="https://web.unican.es/campuscultural/Paginas/Luis-Quintanilla-arte-y-memoria.-Museo-virtual.aspx"
                     >https://web.unican.es/campuscultural/Paginas/Luis-Quintanilla-arte-y-memoria.-Museo-virtual.aspx</ref>
               </note></p>
            <p>Consequently, it is of great importance to mention the manifold effects this has had
               on museums. Museums can use a virtual museum as a tool to communicate museum object
               data, context information, storytelling and narratives, in order to provide access to
               their collections, which is crucial for museums in times of crisis, as the
               Coronavirus crisis has revealed. Museums can grant access to their collections even
               in times of official administrative closures, in times of war or at any other time
               when museums are forced to close their collections to the public. Moreover, in terms
               of the (military) destruction of museum objects or attacks in areas of conflict,
               virtual museum space could enable access to museum object and collection data, and at
               the same time facilitate (at least) digital preservation. Even in times of a
               long-term shutdown and museum closures, exemplified by the present Coronavirus
               crisis, which is only one of various other options, virtual museum space has manifold
               effects on museum employees. As a research infrastructure, virtual museums could
               grant online access to museum employees to enable them to work from home on their
               museum communication projects. Additionally, a virtual museum could provide virtual
               visits to the museum, such as a digital video call, to complement the personal
               encounter. Conversely, all of these tools can influence the attractiveness of the
               real and physical encounter in times of physical visiting. By integrating these tools
               into physical museum presentations, they could help to deepen museum communication
               between museums and their visitors within physical museum space.</p>
            <p>Of course, museums are challenged in times of crisis, especially with a view to heavy
               losses of entrance fees. On the other hand, museums would be obliged to consider
               concepts of gaining money by visiting virtual museums like other providers of digital
               services do. As the Coronavirus crisis has shown, the Internet and online
               possibilities have played an enormous social role in terms of replacing physical
               interactions between persons in order to phone, shop, to obtain medical attendance,
               schooling and university teaching, to access online sports programmes offered by
               local fitness gyms, and to enable museums and visitors to communicate with each
               other. However, none of these tools are able to replace real experiences or physical
               encounters – both mediums are different and aim to serve different manners of
               perception. These digital tools were a time-limited possibility due to the necessity
               of physical distancing. What the crisis has also shown is that some target groups
               were focused on the virtual world and perfectly happy to consume digital and virtual
               offers. For museums though, it is possibly interesting to note that some non-museum
               visitor target groups were much more attracted to digital museum features than to
               physical museum spaces. It is against this specific backdrop that museums should
               consider which impact a virtual museum can have on the audience and how museums can
               benefit from those effects.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p>The virtual museum refers especially to the processes of collecting, gathering,
               structuring and visualising data of museum objects or rather of the cultural
               heritage. This means to manage data, reference objects to scientific knowledge
               systems, map the information to XML-standards, visualise information and provide
               access to objects that are linked to their appropriate metadata and context
               information. For a standardised museum documentation process, a museum database
               providing all the needs of the digital humanities and of museology is essential, as
               the use of Excel spreadsheets or Word templates have turned out to be impractical for
               museum work. </p>
            <p>The aim of a virtual museum is therefore to ensure that all visualisations take
               object biographies into account and that they link data to the very uniqueness of the
               objects and their relations in order to present a multi-layered view of those
               objects. In addition, virtual museums should also seek to impart narratives and thus
               address visitors emotionally in both the virtual and conventional museum space. This
               is done by integrating digital and immersive tools and methods in the process of
               representing conventional museum space in the virtual world. The extension of
               conventional museums into virtual space thus results in an interesting and attractive
               space where the joy of discovery is possible in an extended museum experience.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is important to point out that despite all of the impacts a virtual
               museum may have, it is definitely a challenge to implement it. In that sense, the
               digital museum documentation standards mentioned above have many advantages in terms
               of data harvesting, but the process of modelling and mapping the data is a very
               complex and time-consuming one. For the practical museum documentation process, it is
               of special importance that a database is able to fulfil all of the purposes of
               recording data, processing and linking information. Currently, the only digital
               infrastructure available is WissKI which can fulfil all the requirements mentioned
               above, in accordance with the international museum documentation standard CIDOC CRM.
               However, that gap between theory and practice can be bridged by exploring the virtual
               museum as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field of investigation.</p>
            <p>This approach to virtual museums as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object
               of investigation in the extended virtual museum space specifies further research
               desiderata specifically linked to the digital world. These desiderata address visitor
               studies and types of visitor behaviour in virtual space, for example, surfing and
               consumer behaviour, and questions as to which contents visitors would like to
               experience or even if they would be willing to spend money on visiting virtual
               museums. </p>
            <p>Evaluations of classic museum spaces showing their effectivity need to be extended to
               the virtual museum to question their ability to affect and to engage visitor
               attention. Methods used by empirical social studies such as psychology and
               communication sciences are thus combined with computer-supported methods and analyses
               such as eye-tracking. </p>
            <p>In conclusion, a virtual museum space provides manifold potential for museology and
               digital humanities to extend interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary methods and
               offers multiple impacts for museums and visitors to improve their presentation and
               communication strategies, not only in times of crisis. One important factor is that
               virtual museums are also able to target new groups of visitors and users, which would
               have to be investigated in detail in terms of their special needs.</p>
            <p>Until these requirements of virtual museums are achieved using interdisciplinary and
               transdisciplinary methods, the virtual museum will remain a
                  <term>gedankenexperiment</term>, an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object
               of investigation.</p>
