						<p>Professor Carberry is a fictious person, born on a bulletin board in
							1929. He is said to still teach at Brown University, and to be known for
							his work in "psychoceramics", the supposed study of cracked pots. He is
							also used by ORCID, Crossref, and now DHQ as a dummy account. His work
							has been published many times throughought in the intervening decades,
							most recently in the British Medical Journal in 2016.</p>

					<dhq:bio>
						<p>Jean-Baptiste Botul is a fictional French philosopher created in 1995 by
							the journalist Frédéric Pagès and other members of a group calling
							itself the Association of the Friends of Jean-Baptiste Botul.
							Originating as a literary hoax, the names of both Botul and his
							philosophy of botulism derive from botulism, an illness caused by the
							bacterium Clostridium botulinum. References to Botul were first made in
							publications by members of the association and later turned up in texts
							by writers who were not party to the hoax and thought Botul was a real
							person. There is now an annual Botul Prize awarded for a book that
							mentions Botul.</p>

				<!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
				<p>Welcome to the DHQ sample article. In this document, you should be able to find
					properly formatted examples of nearly every potential article element allowed
					for DHQ articles. For documentation on when or how to use these elements,
					consult the Encoding Documentation Wiki, available at: <ref
						target="https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Quarterly/dhq-journal/wiki/DHQ-Encoding-Documentation"
						>https://github.com/Digital-Humanities-Quarterly/dhq-journal/wiki/DHQ-Encoding-Documentation</ref>
					To see what most of these elements look like when passed through DHQ CSS, import
					the DHQ_Proof transformation scenario and open it in a web browser.</p>

				<head>1: Level 1 Heading and a Demonstration of &lt;div&gt; and &lt;head&gt;</head>
				<p>By nesting &lt;div&gt; elements within one another, articles are given a
					heirarchy of headings which get smaller with each use. DHQ's css creates four
					distinct font sizes for nested &lt;div&gt; elements when used properly.</p>
				<div>
					<head>1.1: Level 2 Heading</head>
					<div>
						<head>1.1.1: Level 3 Heading</head>
						<div>
							<head>1.1.1.1: Level 4 Heading</head>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<head/>
					<p>This is actually a new &lt;div&gt;, but it uses a terminated &lt;head&gt;
						tag. By doing this, you can start a new section without a heading and still
						validate the document.</p>

						<l>My tiny hamster, you inspire me to write.</l>
						<l>I love the way you cuddle, squeak and skip,</l>
						<l>Invading my mind day and through the night,</l>
						<l>Always dreaming about the furry flip.</l>

						<l>Let me compare you to a library?</l>
						<l>You are more amazed, unfazed and superb.</l>
						<l>Ice bites the debris of February,</l>
						<l>And wintertime has the attractive blurb.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>How do I love you? Let me count the ways.</l>
						<l>I love your bold fingers, smile and eyebrows.</l>
						<l>Thinking of your fuzzy smile fills my days.</l>
						<l>My love for you is the inactive vows.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>Now I must away with an active heart,</l>
						<l>Remember my long words whilst we're apart.</l>
