						<p>Professor Carberry is a fictious person, born on a bulletin board in

							his work in "psychoceramics", the supposed study of cracked pots. He is
							also used by ORCID, Crossref, and now DHQ as a dummy account. His work
							has been published many times throughought in the intervening decades,
							most recently in the British Medical Journal in 2016.</p>

					<dhq:bio>
						<p>Jean-Baptiste Botul is a fictional French philosopher created in 1995 by
							the journalist Frédéric Pagès and other members of a group calling
							itself the Association of the Friends of Jean-Baptiste Botul.
							Originating as a literary hoax, the names of both Botul and his
							philosophy of botulism derive from botulism, an illness caused by the
							bacterium Clostridium botulinum. References to Botul were first made in
							publications by members of the association and later turned up in texts
							by writers who were not party to the hoax and thought Botul was a real
							person. There is now an annual Botul Prize awarded for a book that
							mentions Botul.</p>

				<p>Welcome to the DHQ sample article. In this document, you should be able to find

					consult the Encoding Documentation Wiki, available at: <ref

					To see what most of these elements look like when passed through DHQ CSS, import

				<head>1: Level 1 Heading and a Demonstration of <gi>div</gi> and
					<gi>head</gi></head>
				<p>By nesting <gi>div</gi> elements within one another, articles are given a
					heirarchy of headings which get smaller with each use. DHQ's css creates four
					distinct font sizes for nested <gi>div</gi> elements when used properly.</p>
				<div>
					<head>1.1: Level 2 Heading</head>

				</div>
				<div>
					<head/>
					<p>This is actually a new <gi>div</gi>, but it uses a terminated <gi>head</gi>
						tag. By doing this, you can start a new section without a heading and still
						validate the document.</p>
