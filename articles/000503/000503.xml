            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>The field that has emerged as the digital humanities started with dreams and dots:
               pixelated digits and, beyond them, the prospect of methods and archives that could
               encompass almost an infinite number of texts. As it has grown it has developed a
               reputation as one of the few comparatively well-funded, expanding fields in an
               increasingly de-funded, precariously or under-employed academic humanities.<note>My
                  thanks to Brett Barney, Matt Cohen, Mike Cohen, Ken Price, and Steve Ramsay for
                  their thoughtful comments on drafts of this essay. On this phenomenon as
                  perception and as evolving actuality, see Kirschenbaum, <title rend="quotes">What
                     Is Digital Humanities?</title> and <title rend="quotes"
                  >Tactical.</title></note> It has also been criticized for a lack of ethnic and
               gender diversity and an unwillingness to think across cultures or to reckon with the
               theoretical insights of the humanities more generally.<note>This criticism has
                  prompted a series of conversations about postcolonial, feminist, and queer digital
                  humanities, as well as meditations on the possible complicity of digital methods
                  with neoliberal agendas. See #transformDH and #DHpoco for examples of the former;
                  for the latter, see Allington et al. and Greenspan’s response.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As a result, in part, of these criticisms, the moment for work at the intersection of
               digital methods and the humanities has never been more exciting. Creators of forums
               like </p>
            <p>#TransformDH, #DHpoco, and #GlobalOutlookDH have worked to transform the digital
               humanities by opening up space for a more diverse set of practitioners and voices.
               Projects like the Colored Conventions Project and the Mukurtu CMS have built tools
               organized around artifacts and knowledge practices associated with African American
               and Indigenous communities. Scholars and programmers worldwide are engaging questions
               of access, training, and opportunity. </p>
            <p>With these developments have also come a set of theoretical provocations, challenges
               to return to the difficult work of thinking about digital media and its relationship
               to human beings.<note> Bailey writes that “The move ‘from margin to center’ offers
                  the opportunity to engage new sets of theoretical questions that expose implicit
                  assumptions about what and who counts in digital humanities as well as exposes
                  structural limitations that are the inevitable result of an unexamined identity
                  politics of whiteness, masculinity, and ablebodiness.” </note> “[T]he black
               digital humanities promotes a system of change,” Kim Gallon has written: “it is a
               mechanism for deregulating the tendency of technological tools, when employed in the
               digital humanities, to deemphasize questions about humanity itself.” This
               transformative mode of thinking, the call to interrogate basic concepts and
               assumptions, shares some ground with an earlier moment in digital humanities. In the
               early 2000s, the SpecLab at the University of Virginia, led by Johanna Drucker and
               Jerome McGann, conducted a series of textual experiments with that era’s digital
               tools. These experiments in text and technology were informed by a methodological
               approach called “deformance,” a creative and playful mode of reading.<note> Websites
                  for SpecLab and the Applied Research in Patacriticism group are now defunct,
                  though legacy versions are accessible through the Internet Archive’s Wayback
                  Machine. See Samuels and McGann’s development of the term “deformance” in relation
                  to critical interpretation, editing, and translation, and elaborations by McGann
                     (<hi rend="italic">Radiant Textuality</hi>) and Drucker (<hi rend="italic"
                     >SpecLab</hi>). Later work by scholars and artists like Nick Montfort, Mez
                  Breeze, and Alan Sondheim offers other examples of the creativity that has emerged
                  at the intersection of art and algorithms. For further discussion of codework, the
                  integration of programming syntax and creative expression, see Raley.</note> One
               goal of this speculative, theoretical work was an ongoing effort to reimagine key
               literary terms like “text” and “work.”</p>
            <p>As digital methods that quantify and specify have come to play a prominent role in
               the digital humanities, perhaps it is worth exploring a complementary return to such
               ludic and experimental modes.<note> QueerOS is a notable recent example of this kind
                  of imaginative work (see Barnett et al). Play was proposed as a methodology for
                  #DHpoco, as well; see Koh and Risam.</note> In the context of the transformation
               of the digital humanities by scholars of race and gender, however, we may need to
               reconceptualize the practice and the nomenclature of “deformance” to one of
                  transformability.<note> The “emphasis was placed on de- rather than
                  transformance,” McGann writes, “in order to show that the “object of critical
                  reflection is not ultimately directed to the sign as such but to the rhetorical
                  scene and its functional (social) operators, not least of all the person(s)
                  engaged in the acts of deformance we commonly locate in a file headed
                  ‘Interpretation’” (<hi rend="italic">Radiant Textuality</hi> 102).</note> The
               malleability of form, for those who study connections between the body and identity,
               is a politically charged matter oriented toward the future as well as the present.
               Transformability shifts the focus from a product or process that has happened in the
               past, or is happening in the present, to the crucial role of imagination in turning
               to what is possible in the future. Transformability involves not only the many forms
               the text <hi rend="italic">has</hi> taken — the realm of book history — or the many
               forms the text <hi rend="italic">does</hi> take — the realm of textual editing — but
               also the many forms the text <hi rend="italic">could </hi>take, the vast scope of its
               potential iterations within historical fields of embodied practice. </p>
            <p>Using Walt Whitman as a case study, this essay explores the ways that the dreams of
               an American poet have been and could be expressed in dots, presenting an opportunity
               and a provocation to apply the formal logic of machines to poems, and vice versa.
               Miriam Posner has written that a useful challenge for the digital humanities, now
               that many of its methods have become established, might involve rethinking some of
               the most basic structures and binaries enacted by data. The current political and
               cultural moment points to the importance of testing the logics that have made
               machines so functional and so central to human existence in the twenty-first century.
               Inseparable from such logics are complicated questions, long fundamental to poetry,
               about kinship, race or ethnicity, age, and gender — differences among human beings
               that affect the uses to which machines are put and the ways in which they have shaped
               and been shaped by historical narratives.</p>
            <p>Whitman is a useful case study in part because his knowledge about and investment in
               the technologies of print so thoroughly inform both his composition practices and his
               poetry. Transformation, and to some extent failure, also define his engagement of
               race over the course of his lifetime. Recent critical assessments have shown the ways
               Whitman grappled with trying to develop a national poetry at a moment when the
               nation’s internal contradictions were tearing it apart. The opposition to slavery and
               the forms of identification with enslaved people visible in his early poems largely
               gave way, after the U.S. Civil War, to a much more lukewarm position on the rights of
               freed slaves and other Americans of African descent.<note> See Klammer; Folsom,
                  “Lucifer” and “Erasing”; and Mancuso.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the poem eventually titled “Song of Myself,” Whitman calls on his readers to
               “Unscrew the locks from the doors! / Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!”
               (1855, 29). If this were a hermeneutic challenge, one might propose questions
               tailored to our technological and philosophical moment: what would a model of
               criticism look like that combines a deconstruction of performative authorship, the
               thought-experiment of a (failed) mechanism, and a detailed attention to the material
               characteristics of an artifact? What lies between the sociology of the door-closer
               and the sociology of the text?<note> See Latour and McKenzie, respectively.</note>
               How do we map the crossroads of reparative reading and algorithmic criticism?<note>
                  Ramsay’s algorithmic criticism is an effort to “locate a hermeneutics at the
                  boundary between mechanism and theory” that explores transformation as key to the
                  generation of humanities “data.” Sedgwick’s reparative reading continues to offer
                  a provocative possibility of thinking beyond (even computer) binaries, in part
                  because it suggests that the fact that boundaries may structure our world in
                  fundamental ways need not determine the kinds of actions or thoughts that must be
                  taken in relation to or as a function of that knowledge. </note> This essay draws
               on structures of computational processing to reimagine and ultimately transform a
               manuscript draft of lines that have been at the heart of critics’ discussions of
               Whitman’s poetic treatment of race. Combining the ludic with the Luciferic, it
               engages a struggle with embodiment in a text from the past in order to frame that
               text’s transformation and re-embodiment in a troubled present.</p>
            <p>In the first section of the essay, I discuss practices of text encoding and
               electronic transformation in widespread use by editors of humanities texts, arguing
               that such practices resonate linguistically and structurally with Whitman’s own
               poetic and material practices. The second section of the essay situates Whitman’s
               poem “The Sleepers” as a model for a critical approach that taps into a dialectic of
               dreams and failure that has been influential in the imagination and the politics of
               the United States. Casting the “dreamspace” Whitman creates in “The Sleepers” as an
               analogue of namespaces in computer and information science, I suggest that it
               functions as a transformative, experimental environment in which dreams, failure,
               contingency, and intentionality combine to produce radical insights and forms of
               identification. To exhibit that potential, I transform a manuscript draft fragment of
               “The Sleepers” into a basic script written in the programming language Python. Such
               transformations have much to offer the critical imagination, drawing our attention to
               new textual dimensions and to the points at which poetic dreams fail to become
               functional dots or durable reparative interventions. </p>

            <head>“This electric self”: Machine Logics and the Transformability of Text</head>
            <p>One of the notable revisions Whitman made to his poem “Bardic Symbols,” first
               published in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly </hi>in 1860, between that
               initial publication and its final version (“As I Ebb’d With the Ocean of Life”) in
               later editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, was to substitute the word
               “electric” for the word “eternal.” Setting the stage for poetic reflection, Whitman
               wrote in the 1860 version:</p>
            <p>I, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,<lb/>Alone, held by the
               eternal self of me that threatens to get the better<lb/>         of me and stifle me
               (445)</p>
            <p>This self was still eternal in 1867, but by the 1881 edition of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Leaves</hi>, published just two years after Thomas Edison filed a U.S. patent for
               an electric lamp with a carbon filament, Whitman had revised both lines: </p>
            <p>I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,</p>
            <p>Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems (202)</p>
            <p>Now electric rather than eternal, the poet’s self has also along the way become a
               prideful source of utterance rather than a stifling force. In becoming electric, the
               self is no longer alone, no longer occupied in wrestling with itself, but now turned
               outward and uttering poems.<note> The first substantive revision to the second line
                  appeared in the 1867 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>: “Alone,
                  held by this eternal self of me, out of the pride of which I have utter’d my
                  poems” (331). See Gilmore for a discussion of the electrical and technological
                  developments that underpinned the transformation of the poem titled “Poem of the
                  Body” in 1856 to “I Sing the Body Electric” in 1867 and later editions.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The distance from the electric to the electronic self is a matter of a century, a
               couple of commonplace characters, and some successful inventions. Success, a word
               with roots in genealogical as well as temporal succession, can be considered to drive
               much of the work of description and transformation that is today fundamental to
               electronic editing and data manipulation in computational environments. The markup
               language XML, with the specific vocabulary created by the Text Encoding Initiative
               (TEI), has come to dominate the practice of digital editorial work on humanities
                  texts.<note> The use of XML has been questioned, and in several cases alternatives
                  proposed (see e.g. Schloen and Schloen), but as inline or embedded markup it
                  remains a common approach to encoding data and a standard for digital scholarly
                  editing.</note> As is the case with computer programming and markup languages more
               generally, the functionality of XML and its related languages depends on logic.</p>
            <p>The word “logic” is derived from the Greek <emph>λόγος</emph>, which has often been
               translated as “word.” Logic can refer to a formal system of reasoning depending on
               symbolic and mathematical procedures to establish claims, or, in a more loosely
               defined sense, to a set of rules or structures by which argumentation, reasoning, or
               understanding can be enacted within a given context (“logic, <hi rend="italic"
               >n</hi>.”). But <emph>λόγος</emph>
               <emph>is a complicated concept that extends further, encompassing speech or

            <p>The logic of XML depends on breaking data into machine-readable, processable parts,
               enforcing the description or the creation of boundaries. These boundaries ideally
               correspond to clearly defined units or categories, and they enable the construction
               of hierarchies and relationships. In the case of TEI these categories relate to
               inscribed materials like manuscripts or books. TEI also often encodes other
               categories that have been developed over years of academic production, like
               categories of genre, which underwrite the coherence of the discipline of literary
               criticism even as they are frequently challenged in individual studies. The logics
               that combine in the encoding practices and syntax of TEI are thus several, including
               logics of inscriptive technologies like the book and the manuscript, logics of
               categorical differences in style observed and enacted by literary criticism, and
               logics of information and meta-information that developed in library and
               computational contexts. </p>
            <p> The textual crux represented by the word “eternal” in Whitman’s “Bardic Symbols,”
               for example, could be expressed in TEI. In a single file that described multiple
               versions of the poem, the tags &lt;app&gt; (for critical apparatus entry) and
               &lt;rdg&gt; (for reading), with the attribute @wit (to point to a textual witness),
               could be used to mark two versions of the line:</p>
            <p>&lt;app&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;rdg wit= "#lg1860"&gt;&lt;l&gt;Alone, held by the eternal self of me that
               threatens&lt;lb/&gt; to get the better of me, and stifle
               me,&lt;/l&gt;&lt;/rdg&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;rdg wit= "#lg1881"&gt;&lt;l&gt;Held by this electric self out of the pride of
               which I utter </p>
            <p>poems,&lt;/l&gt;&lt;/rdg&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;/app&gt;</p>
            <p>Marking the text in this way reproduces several logics: the structural logic of the
               text (marking the line as a line with &lt;l&gt;); the logic of the critical apparatus
               that describes textual revision or versions of the text over time (&lt;app&gt; and
               &lt;rdg&gt;); and the logic of the printed page, which consists of both inked
               characters and white space (&lt;lb/&gt; or line break). </p>
            <p>A transformation of the text could proceed at the level of any of these logics, or
               all of them together. One could produce all the different versions of the line, one
               after the other, so they would display sequentially in a Web browser; or compare them
               as text strings and generate a visualization of the differences; or show the line in
               the context of other lines from the poem; or create a toggle allowing users to view
               or eliminate the line breaks, functionally reformatting the text. Data marked in XML
               can be transformed into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which in turn can be
               combined with display instructions to render readable, manipulable text in Web
               browsers. As display technologies and standards develop, XML remains useful, in
               theory, because the basic assumption is that it can be transformed into any number of
               other languages or data formats.</p>
            <p>For Whitman, as the change from “eternal” to “electric” would suggest, the line from
               “Bardic Symbols” was transformable when he wrote it and remained so even after it was
               printed. He orchestrated several transformations of both wording and appearance
               between 1860 and the final printing of the line in his lifetime in the 1891-2 <hi
                  rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. To mark the line with TEI does not alter its
               ontological status, but it does produce new options for transformability in a digital
               environment. We might say that digital transformation is simply an extension of the
               imagination of transformability that, for Whitman, was a basic condition of textual
               production. </p>
            <p>The syntax of transformation provides a surprisingly poetic point of continuity. The
               transformation of XML, like the original markup, is an interpretive act, introducing
               display and navigation elements that structure the reader’s experience of a text. A
               primary language of transformation in such cases is Extensible Stylesheet Language
               Transformations (XSLT), one of three recommendations that make up the broader
               language family XSL.<note> These include XSL-FO, XSLT, and XPath (“The
                  Extensible”).</note> XSL depends on kinship as its metaphor for expressing
               locations, finding nodes in a document tree hierarchy based on paths articulated as a
               matter of succession. In the case of XML Path Language (XPath), the expression
               language used by XSLT, succession is a means of expressing relationships between
               elements or nodes.<note> This language of succession was inherited from earlier
                  markup and stylesheet languages: the development of XSL syntax was influenced by
                  SGML and its stylesheet language DSSSL, which in turn had been based on earlier
                  programming and query languages. On the history and development of XSL, see Kay,
                  26-40, and “Transformation.” For a general discussion of lineal trees (and other
                  metaphors) in relation to algorithms and computational data structures, and within
                  a longer history of graph theory, see Knuth, 305-406.</note> The road from XML to
               HTML is navigated with siblings, parents, children, ancestors, and descendants. In
               order to select all of the &lt;rdg&gt; nodes to render a particular reading in a TEI
               file with an XPath that locates them in their relation to their parent &lt;app&gt;
               elements, for instance, you might use the notation:</p>
            <p> &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="child::rdg"/&gt;</p>
            <p>In plain (more or less) English, you could say that you are instructing the
               stylesheet to apply a series of transformations to any reading (&lt;rdg&gt;) that is
               a child of the current node. </p>
            <p>The logics and syntax of modern markup and transformation languages used for editing
               depend on a set of technical metaphors, terms for describing relationships that, in
               the case of XSL and many other languages, draw from family and nature — the stuff of
               poetry. And Whitman thought in machine logic, too, although his machine was the
               printing press. The kinds of material transformations that Whitman’s texts underwent
               in the nineteenth century bear some resemblance to the file transformations and
               structural logics of the electronic age. Whitman’s poetic transformations often
               involved cutting and pasting.<note> For further discussion of Whitman’s collaging as
                  fundamental to his poetry composition, see Miller.</note> Modularity was key, and
               Whitman, a former printer, often composed with the structure of the printed text in
               mind. When he received proofs of a set of notes about Elias Hicks that would form
               part of his 1888 volume <hi rend="italic">November Boughs</hi>, for instance, Whitman
               noted to the printer that he wanted the section to begin on an odd-numbered page:</p>

            <figure>
               <head>Page proof of “Notes (such as they are) founded on Elias Hicks.” Walt Whitman
                  Papers in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection. Library of Congress, Washington,
                  D.C.</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.jpg"/>
            </figure>


            <p>This move made logical sense for situating the Hicks essay as a new section of the
               prose in the volume — but it also reflected Whitman’s practice of repurposing
               sections and binding them into later book issues.<note> In an entry in <hi
                     rend="italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</hi> dated July 31, 1888, Horace
                  Traubel noted as much: “W. has an idea of putting the Hicks-Fox matter eventually
                  into a special pamphlet. Made many changes of the make-up in order to get the
                  Hicks started on an odd page. This is one of his memorandums to the printer:
                  ‘begin making up Elias Hicks on page 119 I will supply something for page 118’”
                  (2:64). For another example of sheets that Whitman published independently and had
                  bound into other volumes, see the entry for <hi rend="italic">Passage to India
                  </hi>(1871) in Winship (36).</note> He habitually arranged for the printing of
               poems and other materials independently on slips of paper, using them as the basis
               for proofing, sending them out for publication, circulating them among friends and
               acquaintances, and in some cases adding them into books. In ways that anticipated the
               concerns of twenty-first-century information scientists, Whitman designed his chunks
               of poetry and prose to be materially interoperable. If they were arranged such that
               they could be printed on separate sheets or gatherings, they could be assembled into
               other books or bound and distributed independently.<note> See Winship, Myerson,
                  Stallybrass, and Grossman for inventories and descriptions of Whitman’s
                  publications and printed slips. This comparison is not meant to gloss over Tara
                  McPherson’s important points about the racial and political implications of the
                  “lenticular” logic of modularity and interoperability in the development of modern
                  computing. </note>
            </p>
            <p>Like XML-marked data today, Whitman’s modular text could be used for a number of
               (multimedia) futures. Both books and languages like XML depend on structured
               relations, definitions, hierarchies, and dependencies. And yet the imagination that
               selects and designs particular transformations is, as tools and books develop, an
               increasingly crucial component of digital processing. Whitman’s imagination of text
               and its possible transformations was shaped by the technologies of his time. We face
               a similar effect today, as critical and creative imaginations are challenged by
               machines that enable new forms of transformation, as humanities texts and machine
               languages combine in novel and interesting ways, and as practitioners are
               increasingly conversant in the logics of both. Conceived as a language whose
               use-value and sustainability was grounded in the possibility of transformation, XML
               is in certain ways an investment in the future of both technology and imagination.

            <head>“In the ruin, the sediment”: Poetic Dreams and Electric Failures</head>
            <p>In Whitman’s early, much-revised and much-discussed poem “The Sleepers,” the dreaming
               poet begins out of sorts: “I wander all night in my vision, / … / Wandering and
               confused . . . . lost to myself . . . . ill-assorted . . . . contradictory” (1855,
                  70).<note> The poem is untitled (or assigned the recurring title “Leaves of
                  Grass”) in the 1855 edition. It appeared in the 1856 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
                     Grass </hi>as “Night Poem” and in the 1860-1 and 1867 editions<hi rend="italic"
                  > </hi>as “Sleep-Chasings.” It was first titled “The Sleepers” in 1871.</note> And
               yet the poet is capable, in this dream vision, of acts of acrobatic transcendence and
               identification. In “The Sleepers,” Whitman first included and then edited out
               arguably his most striking identification across racial boundaries, lines in which
               the poet speaks as an enslaved person.<note> For a discussion of this poem and
                  related manuscript drafts, see Folsom, “The Sleepers.”</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whitman had explored dreams as a space for transcending boundaries as early as his
                  pre-<hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> fiction, and he may have been tapping
               into a genre of dream visions in literature. The unsettled mental state of the
               dreamer at the start of the dream in Whitman’s “The Sleepers” and in his fiction is
               like that of other dream-vision narrators. The space of the dream for Whitman is
               liminal, in the sense that it seems to exist somewhere between pure presence and pure
               transcendence. In it the world of possibility is expanded, sometimes
                  alarmingly.<note> A murder is juxtaposed to dream and sleeping scenes in Whitman’s
                  temperance novel “Franklin Evans.”</note> Critics have argued that the redemptive
               vision at the close of “The Sleepers,” in which the poet describes the sleepers
               “hand-in-hand” in a restorative sleep through which the illnesses and inequities of
               the world are healed, is a classic “dream vision” culmination of wandering in greater
               understanding and a sympathetic poetic enlightenment.<note> See, for instance,
                  French. </note>
            </p>
            <p>Another way to think about Whitman’s dreamspace — one quite out of time — would be to
               think of it as a kind of poetic namespace. In computer and information science,
               namespaces denote distinctions among objects (entities) or vocabularies, establishing
               boundaries around a specific collection of symbolic terms and related definitions.
               The use of namespaces allows for combinatory worlds in which the same word, element
               or object might mean something different in a specified context, or have a different
               relationship to other words, elements, or objects. Namespaces are often expressed
               using prefixes. One might, for instance, distinguish between the dreamspace “I”
               (ds:I) of “The Sleepers” and the waking space poetic “I” (ws:I) of the other poems in
               the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Let us say &lt;ds:I&gt;
               experiences discomfort, but possesses an ability to see and identify with the
               population of sleepers that extends beyond even as it informs the ability of
               &lt;ws:I&gt;. </p>
            <p>The premise of namespaces and elements is the ability to declare entities like
               &lt;ds:I&gt; and distinguish them from other entities both within a namespace and
               outside of it. The striking thing about Whitman’s dreamspace in “The Sleepers,”
               however, is the very impossibility of that activity. In dreamspace, the night is a
               spatial as well as a temporal setting: of the sleepers, the poet writes, “The night
               pervades them and enfolds them” (1855, 70). The poet, too, both penetrates and
               enfolds the sleepers he describes. The poem begins with description: the poet,
               “Pausing and gazing and bending and stopping,” simply looks at the sleepers. Next, he
               comes closer — “I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them” — but
               still the restless sleepers sleep fitfully (71). He then joins them, sleeping and
               dreaming with them — “I sleep close with the other sleepers, each in turn; / I dream
               in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers” (71). Finally, his dreaming
               produces a deeper identification: “And I become the other dreamers.” In this state
               the poet pervades the dreamers like the night, taking on their identities — “I am the
               actor and the actress” — and acting in their stead. The poet of dreamspace transcends
               the boundaries between himself and the people he describes. The descriptive work of
               dividing the sleepers into individuals becomes the work of drawing them together
               through the consciousness and the transformative dream-vision of the poet. As the
               poem concludes, the sleepers rest “hand in hand,” unified and beautiful in sleep, and
               the poet passes from night into day (76-7). </p>
            <p>“Elements merge in the night,” Whitman writes in “The Sleepers.” “The antipodes, and
               every one between this and them in the dark, / I swear they are averaged now . . . .
               one is no better than the other, / The night and sleep have likened them and restored
               them” (75). If the work of descriptive markup or the creation of distinct entities as
               part of XML namespace vocabularies involves breaking things down into parts,
               dreamspace might serve as an impetus to imagine ways of bringing them back together —
               or to recognize the artificiality of their separation. Like night in “The Sleepers,”
               dreamspace enables the existence, or the imagination of the existence, of two
               simultaneous possibilities: a difference and a cosmic averaging. Dreamspace brooks
               mathematical experimentation, perhaps because its elements and entities are defined
               contingently, in relation to deep, incomprehensible forces — not the natural forces
               of physics and institutional agency that guide the elements and entities of waking
               life, but something more inward-looking and subjective. In Whitman’s dreamspace,
               imaginative forays begin to mediate difference, bridging the gap between entities,
               even those posed as binary opposites. Transformability has both conceptual and
               material dimensions for Whitman, informing his dreams of poetic identification as
               well as his practices of revision and bookmaking.</p>
            <p> If the digital humanities represents a field in which the logics of programming and
               machines are called upon to revise the patterns of humanistic and philosophical
               inquiry, where multiple namespaces may coexist and serve co-articulated purposes,
               perhaps dreamspace can be cast as a foil to the functional side of programming, an
               invocation of the vocabulary of experimentation, of margins, of imagination, and of
               failure. In an essay on the methodological potentials of repair, Steven Jackson casts
               breakdown as a starting point in thinking about new media. Noting the role of
               shipbreaking in Bangladesh, where the raw materials of old ships are recycled into
               usable products, Jackson situates failure as one stage in a longer story, one in
               which breakdown and decay form constitutive components of existence in the
               twenty-first century, and in which imagination and reconfiguration are key to
               building sustainable practice. </p>
            <p>In science and technology worlds, failure (in moderation) has long held a special
               status. As journalists and media scholars have pointed out, the vision of failure as
               a preliminary step in success continues to be lionized in the “fail fast, fail often”
               mantra associated with Silicon Valley, however well the mantra corresponds to actual
               conditions of employment and production.<note> See, for instance, Surowiecki, Draper,
                  and Newman. See also Liu, <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi>.</note> Stories of failure
               in a rapidly developing media world have an analogue in the newspapers and
               periodicals of the nineteenth-century. Frank Luther Mott’s histories of early
               American newspapers and magazines showcase the way such productions went under with
               sometimes bewildering regularity. Newspapers were not the only industry full of
               folds, of course — Scott Sandage, tracing the ubiquitous failures of merchants in the
               nineteenth-century U.S., notes that “in addition to those who went broke or bankrupt,
               thousands of businessmen teetered on the brink for years” (7). Failure, according to
               Sandage, is the substory of the idea that came to be known as the American Dream.
               Constituting a central part of stories and experiences of life in the U.S., but never
               quite fitting into the vision the republic had of itself, failure lingered
               uncomfortably at the boundaries of success and identity for the American nineteenth
               century.</p>
            <p>In the economic sense that would be associated with failure in the nineteenth-century
               United States, Whitman’s first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>,
               self-published in 1855, was undeniably a failure. An unusual book in both size and
               manufacture, the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves </hi>lacked a formal
               publisher and was set in type between other non-literary jobs at Andrew Rome’s
               Brooklyn printing shop. Whitman’s friend Horace Traubel reported in <hi rend="italic"
                  >With Walt Whitman in Camden </hi>that “W[hitman] spoke about the first edition of
               the Leaves: ‘It is tragic — the fate of those books. None of them were sold —
               practically none — perhaps one or two, perhaps not even that many. We had only one
               object — to get rid of the books — to get them out someway even if they had to be
               given away’” (1:92).<note> Whitman probably exaggerated here, as often in his
                  discussions with Traubel.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Today, copies of Whitman’s first edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass
               </hi>are listed for sale at prices that range from $50,000 to $270,000.<note>
                  Estimates are based on prices and sales figures for copies listed on AbeBooks.com
                  and sold at rare book auctions between 2018 and 2020.</note> The books that once
               failed to sell are now the most expensive and sought-after of the editions of <hi
                  rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Failure has a place in the narrative of
               literary production, which like that of technology often centers on dreams,
               succession, and innovation. For Whitman, the arc of the future and its changing
               literary preferences fueled the popularity of his work over a century and a half of
               massive historical and technological changes. In the wake of a transformation in the
               value readers found in the poems that comprised his <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
                  Grass</hi>, the first edition has re-emerged as a site of interest. Its rarity,
               combined with critical and popular consensus about the value of Whitman’s poems, has
               helped to make it one of the most expensive books of American literature on the
               market today. In the same economic sense that once rendered it a failure, one might
               say that the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass </hi>has become a resounding
               success. </p>
            <p>Discussions of the digital humanities, too, are threaded throughout with tales of
               failure. Failures in the collection of essays titled <hi rend="italic">A New
                  Companion to Digital Humanities</hi>, updated in 2016, include the failures of
               collaboration (Edmond), of fabrication (Sayers et al.), of interdisciplinarity
               (McCarty), of technology/hardware, of the imaginers of design fictions to account for
               humanities concerns about ethics and culture (Jørgensen), of data to interoperate, of
               the search string to correspond exactly with the search meaning, and so on. Happily,
               in none of these cases is failure conceived as a reason not to attempt. Indeed, the
               failure often produces different insights and, in some cases, visions with more
               comprehensive impact. </p>
            <p>Whitman splintered his poetry and prose into pieces, but like the shipbreakers he
               also brought it back together again in diverse and imaginative ways. One of his
               friends, Harrison S. Morris, recollected a story about the poet:</p>
            <p>He said an idea would strike him which, after mature thought, he would consider fit
               to be the “special theme” of a “piece.” This he would revolve in his mind in all its
               phases, and finally adopt, setting it down crudely on a bit of paper, — the back of
               an envelope or any scrap, — which he would place in an envelope. Then he would lie in
               wait for any other material which might bear upon or lean toward that idea, and, as
               it came into his mind, he would put it on paper and place it in the same envelope.
               After he had quite exhausted the supply of suggestions, or had a sufficient number to
               interpret the idea withal, he would interweave them in a “piece,” as he called it. I
               asked him about the arrangement or succession of the slips, and he said, “They always
               fall properly into place.” (Qtd. in Kennedy, 24) </p>
            <p>Did Whitman ever think about failure, as he scratched out lines, cut and pasted,
               shuffled scraps in envelopes, relying on, in place of the muse, the seemingly mutual
               co-determinative pull of randomness and data? Do we think of failure as we gather,
               create, and transform data, trying not to let the questions determine the answers,
               trying not to let the machine be too much a reflection of our own biases and
               preconceptions? Is there any creative or analytical work that is not haunted by
               failure? </p>
            <p>As he walks the shore, the poet of Whitman’s “Bardic Symbols” ponders the deposits of
               the waves, “In the ruin, the sediment, that stands for all the water and all the land
               of the globe.” </p>
            <p>The detritus or sediment cast onto the shore is not random (being at least in part
               the product of known and ordered industries or natural phenomena like shipbuilding,
               trade, and weather). Neither is it fully recognizable. The poet laments his inability
               to understand the meaning of the debris — “Oh, I think I have not understood
               anything, — not a single object, — and that no man ever can!” The signs or bardic
               symbols represent a momentary configuration, but also a cosmic and historical
               culmination. Recognition in this poem occurs when the poet stops trying to read, to
               find a pre-determined meaning, and embraces the transformative work of metaphor.
               <lb/> Struck shortly into “Bardic Symbols” by an “old thought of likenesses,” the
               poet begins to think about poetry as he observes the detritus. “Bardic Symbols”
               becomes a poem about printing and inscription as much as it is about a poet observing
               the sea. “I wish I could impress others,” the speaker begins, using language drawn
               from the technology of inscription of his time — the printed impression, the pressure
               of metal type on the page exerted by the printing press. Later, in an ecstasy of
               recognition, he exclaims “I, too, leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped
               island!” and concludes by looking up from the page to the reader:</p>
            <p>We, capricious, brought hither, we know not whence, spread out before you,—</p>
            <p>you, up there, walking or sitting,<lb/>Whoever you are, — we, too, lie in drifts at
               your feet.</p>
            <p>Capricious, brought hither, through space and time, the drifts take the shape of the
               inked characters on the page or — now — the pixels or dots on the screen. The
               “semiotic ecology” of poetry encompasses the cast-off detritus of the ocean as well
               as of print, and all the forms future likenesses take (Drucker, “From A,” 74).
               Whitman’s drift, a complicated co-articulation of randomness and intentionality,
               offers a proleptic vision of digital textuality.<note> On Whitman’s concept of drift
                  and its relation to the distribution and circulation of his writing, see
                  Cohen.</note>

            <p>Guided by transformability and repair, we might break Whitman’s “Sleepers” back down
               into draft segments and imagine them further, beyond the familiar ground of TEI and
               namespaces, into Python, one of today’s most powerful and widely used programming
                  languages.<note> GitHub’s 2019 “Octoverse Report” ranked Python as the second
                  most-used language in Git repositories, based on number of unique contributors
                  (Zhou). Python, like other programming languages and software platforms, has
                  recently begun to reckon with its metaphors. See Oberhaus on the use and removal
                  of the terms “master” and “slave.” These terms have long been used (and recently,
                  in some cases, deprecated) in other engineering and computational contexts,
                  including as references to central and backup servers, primary and secondary
                  drives, and primary and replica databases. For further discussion, see Eglash and
                  Landau. </note> Like Emily Dickinson’s description of reading poems backward,
               seized by Samuels and McGann as a provocation for deformance, transforming or
               translating poetry into a programming script defamiliarizes elements of both, opening
               the door — or unscrewing it entirely — inviting insights at the intersection of
               digital and poetic logics.<note> Samuels and McGann quote Dickinson’s note, from “an
                  undated fragment on a leaf of stationery”: “Did you ever read one of her Poems
                  backward, because the plunge from the front overturned you? I sometimes (often
                  have, many times) have–a Something overtakes the Mind–” (26).</note> With
               particular force, this operation helps to demonstrate the ways in which what Ivy
               Wilson has described as “the presence of African Americans — suspended between the
               material and the apparitional, as it were — within the poetic space of [Whitman’s]
               verse and other writings” could be made to speak back to both the containment of
               Black U.S. citizens and deterministic, abstract narratives of technological
               development (“Looking” ix). </p>
            <p>The culminating dramatic moment in the poem that would be titled “The Sleepers,” more
               dramatic in the form of one of several manuscript drafts, has a striking conditional: </p>
            <p>I am a hell-name and a Curse:</p>
            <p>The Black Lucifer was not dead;</p>
            <p>Or if he was, I am his sorrowful, terrible heir</p>

            <p>From the narrative present of the poem, the speaker looks back to a past time: “Black
               Lucifer <hi rend="italic">was </hi>not dead.” As Ed Folsom has written, the possible
               sources for Whitman’s Lucifer are many, from the Biblical Isaiah’s reference to “a
               fallen king of Babylon,…a reference that led to the mistaken notion that Lucifer was
               the fallen angel from heaven, Satan,” to an ignitable match, to a nineteenth-century
                  <hi rend="italic">Webster’s Dictionary</hi> description of Lucifer as “the planet
               Venus, when appearing as the morning star” (“Sleepers”; “Lucifer,” 49). Folsom notes
               that in one early notebook, “Whitman lists gods, including Lucifer, who are defined
               as ‘made up of all that opposes hinders, obstructs, revolts’” (“Lucifer” 48). Lucifer
               was not dead, the poet-historian, poet-interpreter, asserts — only to undercut the
               assertion. <hi rend="italic">Or if he was….</hi> Neatly bifurcating historical or
               spiritual time with a possibility, the poet-historian-slave follows one conditional
               path and moves confidently into the present: “I am his sorrowful, terrible heir.”</p>
            <p>Folsom situates this manuscript as one of several draft versions in which the speaker
               ceases to speak for the enslaved person and instead speaks <hi rend="italic">as</hi>
               the enslaved person, in a culminating act of identification. The deleted line in this
               draft shows the speaker beginning with a declaration of identity that is at once
               naming and invective: “a hell-name and a Curse.”<note> Whitman works through this
                  line in other drafts. For a complete list of transcriptions of the known drafts of
                  these lines, see Gray, ed., line <ref
                     target="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1855/variorum/main.html#l1775"
                     >1775</ref>. </note> The fracture or bifurcation of historical/spiritual time
               introduces the capacity for the speaker to transform, fully, into the divine. As
               (possible) heir of Black Lucifer, the speaker becomes “the God of Revolt — deathless
               sorrowful vast.” The draft moves then into the future: “I will either destroy them
               him or they he shall release me.”</p>
            <p>The published versions of the lines that appeared in the 1855 edition of <hi
                  rend="italic">Leaves of Grass </hi>incorporate several revisions, among them the
               first word of the “Lucifer” line:</p>
            <p>Now Lucifer was not dead . . . . or if he was I am his sorrowful terrible heir;</p>
            <p>I have been wronged . . . . I am oppressed . . . . I hate him that oppresses me,</p>
            <p>I will either destroy him, or he shall release me. (74)</p>
            <p>Whitman’s substitution of “Now” for “Black” is one example of his removal of explicit
               references to race that appeared in the manuscripts.<note> See Folsom, “Erasing
                  Race”; Price, 17-18; and Sandler, 71-74.</note> Functioning as a transitional
               word, “Now” emphasizes the temporal disjunction of this passage, moving to a new
               section of dreamspace in this poem about sleepers. But it also opens the door to
               another apparitional development: the historical moment and the institution of
               slavery have provoked an emergence that resurrects the God of Revolt, as undead
               (deathless) or in the form of succession. </p>
            <p>The revision between manuscript draft and published poem situates the lines within
               the larger temporal frame of the poem, which flits, dreamlike, among past, present,
               and future. Other words already in the draft describe the complicated conditions of
               both genealogical and temporal succession. The operators in the lines of this
               manuscript — OR, IF — form the axes of legibility for many programming languages. If
               these lines were a script written in Python, they might look like:</p>

            <p>Segments of the “Sleepers” manuscript can be produced by the Python script, which
               enacts executable parts of the poem. Depending on the date a user enters, the
               execution of the script might generate parts of the draft lines of the manuscript
               version, or it might generate other lines completely. The parameters are time,
               history, and the state of existence of Black Lucifer. In this transformation,
               succession returns to somewhere just short of its biological roots: Lucifer’s
               conditional successor is a function and a refraction of American slavery. A
               “hell-name and a Curse,” Lucifer or his heir is handed down across borders of time
               and space, iterations of manuscript and print, evolutions of communicative machinery,
               to emerge briefly and dramatically in a peculiar, failed, breakthrough book of
               American poetry — or on your computer screen. </p>
            <p>The kinship of languages is framed as relations of history (origin, reproduction),
               but recast as a matter of space, execution, and transformation within the specific,
               limited temporality of the script, or of dreamspace, or of the boundaries of the
               logics declared in our interpretations. The program points to the significance and
               the operability of the conditional. The poem points to the significance and the
               inoperability of the past tense. For the loop, something is or is not. “Was” is not
               operable or definable within the space of the loop. It could be argued that it is
               enacted by the space outside the loop, and the variables are handed down. But what
               must come outside the loop to begin to approximate the meaning? The entire history of
               U.S. slavery and oppression, condensed into a series of expressions? Would they be
               definitions, or descriptions, or conditionals?</p>
            <p>That computers can draw critical attention to patterns that sometimes go overlooked
               by the human eye has formed the appeal behind many digital methods. One of the most
               powerful characteristics of computational analysis tools like text mining
               classification algorithms is that they can be trained or tweaked by programmers based
               on specific data or results sets. Can the attention of researchers also be trained to
               look more closely at the kinds of words that machines would find actionable or
                  significant?<note> For text mining purposes, as Jockers and Underwood point out,
                  “we know from years of authorship-attribution research that the most effective
                  features for distinguishing one author’s style from another’s are high-frequency
                  features such as the words ‘the,’ ‘of,’ ‘him,’ ‘her,’ and ‘and,’ as well as common
                  marks of punctuation” (293). </note> What would it mean to experiment with
               training as a mutual process, a kind of projection by a human into a computational
               mode of processing? In a world of posthumanist criticism, the insights of
               macroanalysis may be used to conduct even closer readings — to see the value in
               Whitman’s “the” and his “or” as well as his “leaves” and his “grass.” Such attention
               may, as Matthew Wilkins has noted, “suggest that there’s a low-level linguistic basis
               for the category distinctions we’ve long been inclined to draw.” It might also help
               us to produce new readings of well-traveled passages. </p>
            <p>Book historians and bibliographers have demonstrated that the formal and linguistic
               interference of the editor is a crucial component of the afterlife of the work, and
               therefore its continued life in time. “Acts of translation and editing are especially
               useful forms of critical reflection,” McGann writes, “because they so clearly invade
               and change their subjects in material ways” (“Marking,” 368). The heart of the way
               text is increasingly imagined today — the product of our data-vision — is its <hi
                  rend="italic">transformability</hi>. This transformability is a matter of
               succession, but not always of success. Whitman, an early exponent of modularity or
               transformability as a fundamental characteristic of textual production, serves as an
               instructive precursor. His transformational approach is visible in the scraps he
               shuffled in envelopes, the many editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>,
               and his re-making of books more generally.</p>
            <p> Programming, perhaps for everyone, but particularly for those of us not formally
               trained in the art, becomes a study in errors. In writing the sleepers.py script, I
               encountered a series of errors:</p>
            <p>TypeError: us_slavery() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'self' and
               'year'</p>
            <p>NameError: name 'slave' is not defined</p>
            <p>NameError: name 'I' is not defined</p>
            <p>Traceback (most recent call last):</p>
            <p> File "sleepers.py", line 21, in sleepers</p>
            <p> lucifer = Black_Lucifer</p>
            <p>NameError: name 'Black_Lucifer' is not defined</p>
            <p>Traceback (most recent call last):</p>
            <p> File "sleepers.py", line 40, in sleepers</p>
            <p> lucifer = lucifer(input("Was Black Lucifer dead? "))</p>
            <p>UnboundLocalError: local variable 'lucifer' referenced before assignment</p>
            <p>The errors — TypeErrors, NameErrors, UnboundLocalErrors — that I produced in the
               making of sleepers.py mostly had to do with variables, either undefined or not
               included as part of the execution of a function that required them. In the case of a
               finished, working script, of course — or a script developed by an experienced,
               trained programmer — one may be less likely to encounter errors. Nor is it
               necessarily clear after the fact, unless a log or versioning system is associated
               with the development and made accessible as a complement to the resource, that they
               existed. Such data often fades into an invisible history of development, or it
               vanishes by virtue of being overwhelmed by an avalanche of incremental changes,
               commits, updates, migrations, transformations, deletions, and additions.<note> On the
                  role of this kind of invisibility in the capitalistic exploitation of creativity,
                  see Liu, “Transcendental.”</note> In this case, perhaps as a conceit, one might
               argue that the errors formed a layer of the transformation, the undefinedness of the
               variable part of its poetic interpretation. The missing definitions represent
               segments of American history as it is performed in Whitman’s poems: the specific
               identity of the reader, the ambiguity of the designations of “slave” and “I.”
               Somewhere between the failures of the programmer and the untranslatability of the
               poem fragment lurks the impossible largeness of poetry, its ambiguities and its
               historical roots, the unexecutable complicating presence of the undefined and the
               undefinable. </p>
            <p>Before the publication of the 1881 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>,
               Whitman returned to pages from an earlier edition to revise “The Sleepers” for
               republication. On those pages, Whitman created a textual event, a deletion of the
               “Lucifer” passage:</p>

            <figure>
               <head>A page from “The Sleepers,” with Whitman’s edits. Walt Whitman Papers in the
                  Charles E. Feinberg Collection. Library of Congress.</head>
               <graphic url="resources/images/figure03.jpg"/>
            </figure>

            <p>Editing these and other lines out of his dreamspace, Whitman produced a final version
               of the poem tuned to a different historical present and different priorities on the
               part of the poet.<note> For a discussion of this deletion and other omissions as
                  related to Whitman’s increasing concern about the role of Blacks in the
                  Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction U.S., see Folsom, “Lucifer,” 52-77. See
                  also Klammer. Whitman deleted other sections from the poem, as well: see, for
                  instance, the two sections beginning “O hot-cheek’d and blushing! O foolish
                  hectic!”</note> For Whitman, it would seem, the moment for the conjunction of
               experimental dreamspace with historical possibility had passed. If all you looked at
               was the 1891, “authorized” edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, you
               would never know the self of “Bardic Symbols,” now titled “As I Ebb’d With the Ocean
               of Life,” had once been eternal — or that Lucifer had ever been there at all. </p>
            <p>Luckily, Whitman’s was not the final word on the matter. Transformation is one path
               to the other side of determinism — a methodology that resurrects fragments, writes
               dysfunctional scripts, and attends to errors, absences and deletions. Media have
               always had to do with light and darkness, shadow and space, figures, icons, and
               projections. They can affect the visibility of history, passion, identification or
               difference. Perhaps media technologies become most apparent when the binaries break
               down in the act of translation, transformation, or remediation: in error, or,
               sometimes, in deletion. Moments at which multiple possibilities exist, suspended in
               space, can look suspiciously like moments of failure to the backwards glance of
               history: <hi rend="italic">Or if he was</hi>. From this vantage point we watch
               Whitman on the verge, pencil in hand, weighing the path of erasure. The penciled bars
               of his hashmark deletion bought “The Sleepers” into a new “Now,” a post-war moment in
               which the promise of Lucifer’s heir — “I will either destroy him, or he shall release
               me” — may have echoed uncomfortably even for many former abolitionists, by then
               inclined toward reconciliation. The voice of the former slave and his descendants
               would continue to be locked away and suppressed from full political participation up
               to and beyond the emergence of Jim Crow in a series of criminal acts of silencing,
               violence, and oppression whose ongoing existence and implications are abundantly
               visible in our own time. But in that first conditional instant, that “Now” in which
               the God of revolt was summoned, is also <hi rend="italic">success</hi>, if only in
               the form of the recognition that one is part of a succession, sorrowful or
               otherwise.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Conclusion: “I, too, Paumanok”</head>
            <p>A 2007 <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi> special topic forum about the digital editorial
               project <hi rend="italic">The Walt Whitman Archive</hi> exposed fundamental
               disagreements about the use of metaphors as substitutions for precise descriptions of
               digital tools.<note> See Folsom, “Database”; McGann, “Database”; and Hayles.</note>
               Demystifying the tools, however, does not rid us of metaphors, nor of the
               responsibility of navigating the complicated interplay of imagination, history,
               language, functionality, exclusion, and desire that defines the use and development
               of any technology. The transformative work of metaphor continues to inform the way
               technology functions, as well as the ways literary scholars can put it to work. Using
               imagination to cast seemingly competing logics against one another, to put pressure
               on the resonances between the words and the workings of poetic and machine language
               of the past and present, is one tool among many for training the attention to linger
               on a particular moment in a poem or other creative work and tease out some of its
               existing or potential implications.</p>
            <p>Creative transformations applied to materials made digitally available by projects
               like the <hi rend="italic">Whitman Archive</hi> can act as provocations to think and
               act and edit differently. In some cases, this may be a way to explore how
               underrepresented populations and perspectives are addressed (or erased) in historical
               documents. Recognition that race, gender, and other forms of diversity have shaped
               the historical record is finally beginning to affect textual and technological theory
               in ways that are slowly filtering back into editorial approaches, the digitization of
               literary and historical documents, and the work of thinking about the multiple
               versions of those documents in relation to the many different people whose histories
               they often imperfectly represent.</p>
            <p>“If an electronic scholarly project can’t fail and doesn’t produce new ignorance,”
               John Unsworth wrote in a 1997 essay, “then it isn’t worth a damn.” The costs of
               failure or confessing ignorance, in the face of today’s confident, practiced users of
               digital tools and a historically bad tenure-track academic job market in the
               humanities, seem unusually high. Contingent, part-time, or adjunct positions can feel
               an awful lot like failure, without any guarantee of transformation, productive or
               otherwise. The current funding situation for the humanities and, increasingly, for
               education more broadly, is easily tied to the worst human motives — greed, racism,
               nativism, fear — and the darkest political prospects. Redefining the goals and
               parameters of success and failure for any project may be particularly necessary at
               such a time. Somewhere in theorizations like Sedgwick’s, or in Jackson’s repair, may
               be a glimmer of light, in the form of a call for the work of maintaining projects to
               become visible, for a broader notion of “success” to make that phenomenon visible in
               more places, for transformations of fields and texts to create the space for new
               voices and insights, and for the role of creation to be recognized in forms of labor
               other than authorship or innovation.</p>
            <p>Is it time for the digital humanities to fail? As the humanities increasingly engages
               computation as a practice fundamental to the production of scholarship, or as the
               field called the digital humanities continues to splinter into method-specific
               approaches, we might resolutely cultivate one of its most exciting vectors: the
               emergence of a recuperative, radically experimental critical mode. In this mode, the
               imagination that fuels transformability is key, and failure holds a place of crucial
               importance. As Whitman’s “self” became electrified over the course of the
               nineteenth-century manifestations of “Bardic Symbols,” so might we find in the
               digital detritus of our own day an electrifying vision of the future, a set of new
               critical possibilities to build out of the ships and the shipwrecks of history, as
               well as the transformable lines of poetry and prose to which they give rise. </p>
