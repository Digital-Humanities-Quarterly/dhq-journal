                  <p>This paper examines the potentialities of <em class="term">networked browsing</em>, a form
                     of faceted searching that visualizes digital archives in the form of a
                     force-directed network graph. Using BigDIVA.org as an example of networked
                     browsing, this paper presents the results of a small usability study that
                     compared how participants (<span class="hi italic">N</span> = 8) engaged with BigDIVA’s
                     networked browsing in comparison to use of a search engine such as Google. In
                     doing so, we situate our study within performative conceptualizations of
                     human-computer interfaces [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>] in order to explore the
                     potential becomings when human and nonhuman machinic component are entangled
                     together. Based on the observations from our usability study, we argue that
                     networked browsing is suggestive of Whitelaw’s (2015) “generous interfacing” that emphasizes browsing as a tool for
                     exploring relationships between nodes in archives, as well as Shneiderman’s
                     (1996) “joyous experience” for interfacing with the
                     web.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Conducting a search query through Google or scholarly archives is a performance.
                     It requires curation of key terms or phrases from memory, fingered articulation
                     upon a keyboard, recall from the database, selection and then uptake from a list
                     of results. This ubiquitous everyday performance, while providing information
                     access and retrieval across the world, is nonetheless a narrowly defined
                     operation in which a given search query is matched to a given resource. As
                     Mitchell Whitelaw (2015) argues, the process of browsing limits a user to
                     understanding and exploring the scores of information available online. If an
                     online archive is analogous to a museum, then Whitelaw argues that starting with
                     a search query is the equivalent to being told to wait at the entrance to the
                     Louvre until you explicitly request to see the Mona Lisa. Citing Ben
                     Shneiderman’s two-decade-old appeal to make information exploration a “joyous experience”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#shneiderman1996">Shneiderman 1996</a>] as well as Johanna Drucker’s (2013) call for the humanities to take a
                     central role in such endeavors, [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw 2015</a>] outlines the
                     numerous possibilities for online archives and databases to design “generous interfaces” in order to allow users to explore
                     relationships between nodes of information across the web. This paper examines
                     BigDIVA (short for Big Data Infrastructure Visualization Application) as one
                     such instantiation of a “generous interface” that
                     invokes performative materiality for an online database cataloguing archives in
                     the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">BigDIVA<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e271">[1]</a> is a database that visualizes the ARC catalog<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e277">[2]</a> through an interactive force-directed graph
                     in which network nodes represent specific catalogued archives, collections, or
                     resources (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). Its name invokes the
                     concept of Big Data, and as such provides users with visualization of the
                     <em class="emph">entire</em> ARC catalog, while search queries either narrow or
                     shrink the webbed catalog. This paper argues that searching and browsing online
                     archives through a networked visualization interface (henceforth <em class="term">networked
                        browsing</em>) allows users to explore and interpret relations between
                     archived sources (nodes) and to perform contingent in-the-moment search queries
                     outside of the search box. In this sense, networked browsing prioritizes play
                     and meaning-making that is co-constituted with the distributed materiality of
                     the database itself. This turns traditional browsing performances on their heads
                     and downplays the human-centered process that directs a subject from search
                     query to resource, and instead directs the subject(s) to explore and infer
                     relationships between the human user, the machinic components of the interface,
                     and the networked points that make up the archived subjects.

                        traditional browser interface such as Google</span>? In the simplest terms,
                     networked browsing disrupts the expectations of traditional web browsing. As
                     such, these disruptions will necessarily manifest behaviorally (i.e., facial
                     gestures, mouse clicks, vocalizations) and temporally (i.e., time spent on each
                     search task). Such distinctions in usage may suggest how new users might
                     interact with BigDIVA’s interface as well as networked browsing. Second, <span class="hi italic">how does usage of BigDIVA’s interface (as well as self-reports

                     may not always be transparent to the intended users and thus the interface still
                     risks becoming functionally fixed. Thus, we intend to explore how users'
                     experience — as well as perceptions of their experiences — of BigDIVA may
                     explicitly reflect interfacing that is theoretically grounded in the notion of
                     performative materiality, wherein various bodies and distributed components meet
                     at the point of the interface to perform a search.

                     importance on what subjects are doing in a given assemblage, and how their
                     actions co-constitute one another. Questions are more concerned with what a
                     subject does, rather than what it is [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>]. Karen Barad
                     argues that

                        <p>
                           The move toward performative alternatives to
                           representationalism shifts the focus from questions of correspondence
                           between descriptions and reality (e.g., do they mirror nature or
                           culture?) to matters of practices/doings/actions.
                            [<a class="ref" href="#barad2003">Barad 2003</a>, 802]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> This move away from representationalism (i.e., concern with what subjects
                     are) is an effort to grant and explore the agency of subjects that are otherwise
                     agentless through practices that seek understandings of definitions and
                     boundaries. For example, a representationalist understanding would render a
                     BigDIVA user’s keyboard as an input apparatus that is acted upon by human
                     agents. While not necessarily inaccurate, this definition is necessarily based
                     upon a priori knowledge of the keyboard (i.e., how it <em class="emph">has been
                        used</em>), and subsequently obscures its infinite range of potentialities
                     (i.e., how it <em class="emph">could be used</em>). However, as argued by [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>], keyboards, which were originally designed as
                     writing devices for the blind, were not necessarily intended as primary input
                     devices for computers. The agentive trajectory of components in a cybernetic
                     assemblage are thus not pre-determined. Interfaces are therefore an exemplary
                     site to explore such cybernetic performances since multiple bodies constituting
                     multiple agencies and materialities meet at the point of interface.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Barad argues that in casting aside representational concerns about “inherent boundaries and properties,” bodies are instead
                     “material-discursive phenomena” that engage in
                     unique performances that create meaning through their performances [<a class="ref" href="#barad2003">Barad 2003</a>, 823]. She elaborates that “‘Human’ bodies are not inherently different from
                     ‘nonhuman’ ones. What constitutes the ‘human’ (and the
                     ‘nonhuman’) is not a fixed or pregiven notion, but nor is it a
                     free-floating ideality”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#barad2003">Barad 2003</a>, 823]. In this way, what a subject does in constellation with other subjects is
                     what continually configures and reconfigures the notion of that subject. In
                     Barad’s framework, which she terms <em class="term">agential realism</em>, meaning is
                     made in the spaces in which these bodies come to meet together, which she calls
                     <em class="term">intra-activity</em>.

                     when humans act with any apparatus they — together — create new potential
                     meanings. Barad’s framework therefore reminds us that understanding and studying
                     digital media apparatuses requires attention to how they are made meaningful

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">To return to our previous question: how does a performative materiality reveal
                     the material-discursive phenomena at play within the interface? First, it is
                     worth noting that Johanna Drucker (2013) argues that the interface should be
                     conceptualized as a <em class="emph">space</em> rather than a <em class="emph">thing</em>,
                     specifically, “a space of affordances and possibilities structured
                     into organization for use”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>, para. 31]. Thinking of an interface in terms of a space therefore entangles more
                     than just the machinic components, but enfolds the multiple bodies and agencies
                     that organize around possibilities of use. Alexander Galloway (2012) has
                     similarly argued that an interface, like that of a computer, “is a process or active threshold mediating between two
                     states”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2012">Galloway 2012</a>, 23], and thus an <em class="emph">effect</em> of the meeting of bodies. Understanding
                     an interface as a <em class="emph">space</em> and an <em class="emph">effect</em> of the meeting
                     between bodies therefore requires attention to the numerous distributed
                     components — on both sides of the threshold — that meet at the point of
                     interface, from the human user to the device to the networked archive.

                     components that meet in digital media interfaces are complex cybernetic
                     assemblages that constitutes a <em class="term">distributed materiality</em> in which
                     multiple components are “locked into relations with each other that are governed
                     by their material design and constraints in ways that have an effect on
                     the costs and efficient operation of the system”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>, para. 6]. Such an assemblage’s operation (i.e., <span class="hi italic">performance</span>) might be most evident at the point of interface, but Drucker
                     argues that the various components that are “locked
                     into” that performance may be distributed at points quite distant
                     from the point of interface. This is not so surprising considering that
                     ergonomic design traditions for complex computer interfaces frequently encourage
                     concealment of the elaborate distributed components that make up the machine
                     [<a class="ref" href="#harwood2011">Harwood 2011</a>], as well as how they often draw upon adjacent
                     cultural metaphors (e.g., the computer “desktop”).

                     the site, the server that hosts the site, the cooling system that prevents the
                     servers from overheating, etc. With so many components locked together in play,
                     Drucker argues that “[e]very person produces a work as an individual

                      [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>, para. 22]. This performance may thus occur at various points of distribution in

                     distributed materiality, it is possible to understand the potentialities of

                         [<a class="ref" href="#shneiderman1996">Shneiderman 1996</a>, 336]. Noting the rising demand for information-seeking online services in
                        the days before Google’s ubiquity, Shneiderman argued that as online
                        archives expanded that the “visual presentation”
                        as well as “direct-manipulation” of information
                        would be critical for users to be able to deliberately sort through the slew
                        of search results without experiencing cognitive overload. The “visual presentation” of different types of data
                        would therefore be critical to managing user experience, and Shneiderman
                        outlined several data types in order to aide how designers conceptualized
                        the user’s relationship between data and directly manipulating this data.
                        His taxonomy included data that he considered 1-dimensional (e.g., textual
                        data), 2-dimensional (e.g. maps), 3-dimensional (e.g.,
                        “real-world” objects like the human body), temporal
                        (e.g., timelines), multi-dimensional (e.g., combination of multiple data
                        types), treed (e.g., hierarchical tree-structured data), and networked
                        (e.g., network visualizations that show relationships between data)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e534">[3]</a>

                        accommodating several data types simultaneously would be necessary to design
                        information search interfaces, and further suggested that the goals and
                        interests of users conducting searches would likely affect the use of

                        searching. Fagan (2010) noted that contemporary instantiations of faceted
                        search tools aimed to represent data types and provide tools for users to
                        narrow information search results. A typical example might start with a
                        single search term, and then facet by the type or resource, the date range,
                        or even availability of digitized copies (see <a href="resources/images/figure02.png" onclick="window.open('resources/images/figure02.png'); return false" class="ref">Figure 2</a> for an example of

                        investigated faceted searching, Fagan (2010) reported on a bevy of benefits
                        to faceted search, perhaps most notably that faceted search may contribute
                        to users finding a greater amount of relevant results as well as creating

                        custom mobile application that combined text and visuals to conduct faceted

                        on prior knowledge, and then selecting the next facet through a map with
                        geographically specific “points of interest.” In this way, at each
                        point of faceting the user is presented with a different dimensionality of
                        the interface so that they may go from map, to list, to detailed visual, to
                        detailed text. Such an example of faceted searching that incorporates
                        multidimensional data, Kleinen et al. argue, may yield more enjoyable search

                     <div class="ptext" id="p18"> Since the DH ethos values both the evolution of traditional research
                        practices from humanities scholars as well as knowledge production in
                        humanities classrooms, it is reasonable that DH scholars seeking better
                        understanding and improved designs of digital media are concerned with a
                        wider context than that of the interface. Burkick &amp; Willis (2011) have
                        argued that 21<span class="hi superscript">st</span>-century literacy practices are
                        <em class="emph">design</em> practices, which transforms digital scholarship and
                        knowledge production into a process of thinking through designing. This
                        <em class="emph">user-oriented</em> approach “takes into account not only how an application is
                        used but also the kinds of subject positions, world-views, and
                        models it affords”
                         [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2011">Burdick and Willis 2011</a>, 550]. User-oriented designs would account for Gibbs &amp; Owens’s (2012)
                        recommendation that DH tools be designed more holistically for the needs of
                        humanities scholars and students, specifically tools that are “more transitory than revolutionary”

                        to understanding how scholars and students of varying expertise use digital
                        tools and media as part of their broader scholarly practices. This
                        encourages <em class="emph">use</em> in addition to <em class="emph">usability</em>, and
                        attention to what users (i.e., scholars) <em class="emph">want</em> and how they
                        might engage in practice with digital tools — regardless of usability [<a class="ref" href="#kemman2014">Kemman and Kleppe 2014</a>]. By focusing on the user in context, Kemman &amp;
                        Kleppe (2014) argue that observations will inform design, which may then
                        result in feedback loop between design and use. This user-centered design
                        process requires iterative attention to use in context, such as through
                        extended and longitudinal usability studies [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2012">Warwick 2012</a>].

                        noting that the tension between a <em class="emph">user</em> and <em class="emph">use</em> for
                        DH scholars and <em class="emph">usability</em> from UX approaches are not mutually
                        exclusive, and, as suggested by [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2012">Warwick 2012</a>], the two can
                        inform one another. Software and methods intended for usability studies,
                        which may include screen capture, log-file data, and even front-facing
                        cameras to capture facial expressions, may well yield rich and well-rounded
                        understandings of <em class="emph">use</em> as well as <em class="emph">usability</em>. In our
                        study of BigDIVA, we therefore sought to further understand how new ways of
                        visualizing and encountering data types may serve as a
                        “transitory” practice for humanities scholars, and
                        our use of a usability study may be seen as an intervention to elicit not
                        only potential understandings of how users initially use BigDIVA, but also
                        how they may perceive its potential use in their own practices. In the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">In Shneiderman’s (1996) taxonomy of data types, network data accounts for
                     relationships between and among items in an online archive. The configuration of
                     these relationships, or <em class="term">network topologies</em>, are commonly visualized
                     through force-directed graphs in which items are nodes and lines connect related
                     nodes [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2007">Galloway and Thacker 2007</a>]. Shneiderman cautions that network
                     representations risk overwhelming complexity (particularly as archives access
                     large amounts of items), as can be seen in attempts to document the topology of
                     the internet. However, he does suggest that network representation may allow
                     users the opportunity to find the shortest routes between nodes in order to
                     establish mental representations of relationships between items and clusters of
                     items.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">BigDIVA operationalizes faceted searching through presenting a model of the
                     network through one of four user-defined facets: <span class="hi italic">resource</span>, <span class="hi italic">genre</span>, <span class="hi italic">discipline</span>,
                     and <span class="hi italic">format</span>. While <span class="hi italic">resource</span> is the
                     primary representation by default, users can choose to begin with one of the
                     other three. This is accomplished without extensive revision to the existing
                     schema because the ARC catalog is a fairly shallow example of faceted search,
                     with its categories largely existing as sister nodes under a central tree. The
                     tool takes advantage of this functionality to create ad-hoc trees based on the
                     user’s defined needs and ARC catalog schema.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Once a user has selected their initial facet, they are then presented with a
                     group of sub-nodes that consist of the various recognized categories in the
                     schema. For example, a user that selects <span class="hi italic">Genre</span> as their
                     initial limitation will be presented with sub-nodes with categories such as Law,
                     Scripture, and Drama. From there, they can select the desired category,
                     whereupon they are presented with the total number of items under that category
                     in a sidebar and the ability to refine further based on either the remaining
                     categories or the individual records. This refinement can be narrowed further by
                     repeating the process with the newly-refined category until all four aspects of
                     the site have been selected upon.

                     provide a truncated version of the catalog information and, most importantly, a
                     link for the user to go to that resource, which will then appear in a new
                     window. At the same time, the user can see the entire path between their initial
                     category and the individual item, maintaining a visual representation of the
                     mental model they were operating under while making that selection. Furthermore,
                     they can select different nodes and combinations of categories to visualize
                     multiple mental pathways at the same time, a functionality that is not possible
                     in most faceted search systems. In all instances, the nodes are color-coded to
                     help the user to understand at a glance what selections have been made, while
                     unavailable choices are greyed out. This maintains both the full picture of the
                     ARC catalog while simultaneously foregrounding those items that are of most
                     import to the researcher. Finally, because the ARC catalog deals with historical
                     objects, a timeline is provided at the bottom of the workspace, which allows a
                     user who works in a particular period to view only those items of interest
                     within that period.

                     through multiple means simultaneously, i.e., the user-defined facets, a
                     timeline, as well as more direct manipulation of the network nodes, it may
                     afford a unique browsing experience. While simply overlaying multiple types of
                     interactive data is not alone a cure-all, the combination of a networked graph
                     of the entire catalogue, combined with the ability to expand the network graph
                     through faceting based on category as well as time-line may serve as
                     complementary tasks. However, the inclusion of a standard search bar as a way to
                     exclude archival items from the network visual may serve as a source of
                     confusion since one is a standard search feature while the other is not. In
                     other words, a key aspect of understanding BigDIVA’s usability as well as the
                     experiences of users will be the perceived relationship between these starkly
                     different data types, in Shneiderman’s terms.

                     that BigDIVA’s networked browsing has to offer, we designed a usability study
                     intended to compare networked browsing with more traditional web browsing. In
                     doing so, we hoped to observe not only whether individuals could successfully
                     use BigDIVA as a search tool without any training, but also how BigDIVA’s
                     networked browsing engaged individuals in unique acts of online information
                     searching. In short, we sought to understand BigDIVA’s operational

                     input-related actions, and elicited self-reported perceptions by first-time

                        First, participants were asked to complete a brief pre-study questionnaire
                        to self-report expertise with generic information search, as well as fields
                        of expertise. Next, participants were guided through three search tasks that
                        required using Google to find a famous work by William Blake, a relief
                        etching by William Blake, and an etching of Blake’s “Milton: a Poem.” These three tasks in particular were intended
                        for participants to find increasingly specialized information and to use
                        Google’s faceting feature for searching via dimensions such as Image, Web,
                        or Video. Following these three tasks, participants were then required to
                        use BigDIVA to identify collections with large results for “William
                        Blake,” an individual result from this search, meta-data from a
                        specific result for Blake’s “Night Thoughts,” and
                        an example search result that contains the text string “chastity.” It

                        that the BigDIVA search tasks were intentionally longer simply to observe
                        users interacting with BigDIVA for longer. Following the search tasks, the
                        first author engaged the participants in a brief follow-up interview to

                        completed graduate coursework, and were from a variety of fields and
                        academic positions including tenured professors, graduate teaching/research
                        assistants, library &amp; information scientists, industry workers, and one
                        individual currently between jobs. A small group of participants (<span class="hi italic">N</span> = 5) piloted the study design during the spring of
                        2015, which led to subsequent adjustments to the study’s task design (i.e.,
                        particular phrasing of task instructions, and streamlining of the Google
                        Forms interface). The remaining participants (<span class="hi italic">N</span> = 8)
                        engaged in the study between late 2015 and early 2016, and will make up the
                        primary participant pool to be discussed throughout the remainder of this
                        paper.

                        Participant usability sessions were analyzed according to three dimensions:
                        Time On Tasks (TOT), Actions Within Tasks (AWT), and Log-File data
                        (primarily Mouse and cursor actions). TOT data was primarily continuous,
                        i.e., based upon duration of time a participant spent on each individual
                        task, whereas AWT and Log File data were discrete, i.e., a specific type of
                        action that occurred at a specific moment of time. <a href="#table01">Table 1</a> below outlines each specific dimension along with its

                           2</a> for breakdown of TOT). When looking at TOT for each individual

                        that, while in many cases the TOT for BigDIVA tasks varied within the same

                     <div class="ptext" id="p32">Since all participants self-assessed themselves as “Very Good” or
                        “Excellent” Google-users, it is certainly reasonable that they
                        would need to spend less time on the Google search tasks. Directly comparing
                        aggregate TOT for Google and BigDIVA tasks does not account for time
                        necessary to adapt to an unfamiliar search tool; therefore, understanding
                        the value of aggregating TOT across tasks and search platforms requires more
                        nuance. For example, based on comparison of TOT for BigDIVA tasks only, it
                        becomes apparent that following the first BigDIVA task (Task 2_1a), some
                        participants appeared to become more time-efficient (particularly for Task
                        2_2b and 2_3b), which suggests that they overcame a learning curve and
                        adjusted to aspects of networked browsing. Further, some participants that
                        exhibited similar difficulties with search tasks (particularly Task 2_3a-b
                        and 2_4) spent more time on each task. For example, participant B06 and B08
                        were both unable to complete these three tasks for similar reasons (as will
                        be discussed below), but B06 spent much longer (5.66 minutes on all three
                        tasks) than B08 (3.74 minutes on all three tasks). This suggests that
                        successful or unsuccessful adaptation to BigDIVA is not necessarily
                        dependent on how much time a user spends on task.

                        fine-grained comparisons of what participants did for each task with the
                        time allotted. <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a> provides a timeline
                        for each participant colored for any occurrence of an AWT action type. This
                        provides a window into the interplay and sequencing between multiple action
                        types over the course of the entire study, and shows that a typical action
                        sequence for Google tasks involved entering a search query, adjusting for
                        search dimension (i.e., Image, News, Scholarly), opening a result (maybe
                        two), and then eventually entering an answer for the task. For BigDIVA,
                        these sequences were more complex as participants were required to explore
                        and manipulate interface elements they were previously unfamiliar with.
                        Interestingly, at first glance of BigDIVA’s force-directed network, all
                        participants found the search bar and entered a query in a matter of
                        seconds. However, once a search query was entered, participants variably
                        played with the network nodes, switched dimensions (e.g., <span class="hi italic">Genre</span> or <span class="hi italic">Format</span>), enlarged the screens,
                        faceted, etc. In other words, the sequence from search query to facet to
                        search result was broken. Entering or modifying the search query makes up a
                        much smaller portion of AWT actions for BigDIVA tasks (with the exception of
                        Tasks 2_3a and 2_4), while experimenting and playing with the faceting
                        features and the nodes were much more frequent. The greater frequency of
                        these action types suggests that participants’ unfamiliarity with BigDIVA —
                        specifically the aspects of networked browsing — are likely indicative of a
                        sense of fascination and playfulness, or even confusion and frustration,
                        with these features in order to understand their function. The novelty of
                        these features may have encouraged participants to spend time playing with
                        these features in order to better understand them, which may explain how

                        participants engaged with the keyboard and various other AWT action types

                        the BigDIVA tasks, despite the fact that BigDIVA’s functionality is

                        actions were. Furthermore, in order to have a comparison of these
                        Non-Finisher participants to those that did, we made a subgroup of the two
                        Non-Finishers (B06 and B08) and two Finishers (B01 and B04). This sub-group
                        was determined by developing a rudimentary scoring system for each task in
                        which participants received 1 point for completing the task as designed, 0.5
                        points for completing the task not as designed, and 0 points for not
                        completing the task at all. After rating all participants, B06 and B08
                        scored the lowest, while B01 and B04 scored the highest.

                        demonstrates both groups overall were not strikingly different. Besides the
                        action type QUIT, both the Finishers and Non-Finishers engaged in similar
                        distribution of AWTs as the Finishers. The primary distinction is for the
                        action type DIMENSIONSWITCH, as the Finishers switched dimensions in BigDIVA
                        more than half as much as the Non-Finishers. After looking more closely at
                        when and how these participants switched dimensions, it was observed that
                        both groups had developed distinct understandings of this feature’s
                        function: the Finishers would switch dimensions and then enter a search
                        query, whereas the Non-Finishers would enter a search query and then switch
                        dimensions. While a seemingly inconsequential distinction in Google, this
                        sequence of action in BigDIVA is the difference between filtering results
                        based on a search query and resetting the force-directed network
                        visualization of the archive to another dimension. Thus, when the
                        Non-Finishers entered a search query, and then switched dimensions, they
                        effectively negated their query and reset the visualization to view all
                        archive content — albeit in a different dimension. In other words, the
                        Non-Finishers were very likely unable to finish all of the BigDIVA tasks
                        because they had failed to adjust to this specific feature of BigDIVA’s
                        functionality, and instead appeared to transfer their understanding of this
                        functionality directly from Google.

                        the scope of this current study to adequately or appropriately surmise how
                        using BigDIVA resulted in participants’ affective reactions. After all,
                        since BigDIVA was new to the participants while Google was used daily, some
                        manner of novelty effect would be expected. Further, since BigDIVA did
                        require some manner of learning curve (and at least two participants
                        experienced delays due to server interruptions), such analysis would likely
                        have been biased towards affects such as frustration or confusion [<a class="ref" href="#dmello2012">D’Mello and Graesser 2012</a>]. Nevertheless, at first glance of BigDIVA’s
                        network visualization all users did display unique momentary reactions. For
                        example, B04 noticeably smiled, B01 appeared surprised, B02 exclaimed
                        quietly to himself “What,” and B08’s brow
                        furrowed. In other words, the novelty of networked browsing appeared to
                        induce affectations — perhaps even “joyous” in
                        some cases — that in and of itself may offer participants hope of a new
                        manner of searching.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">Indeed, based on the self-report questionnaire following the search tasks,
                        participants were largely in agreement about the potentialities of networked
                        browsing. While many elaborated on early frustrations with the new
                        functionalities of the search tools, or the initial learning curve, all
                        participants remarked about BigDIVA’s ability to establish an understanding
                        of the relationship between the collections and their individual archive
                        sources. In particular, three common themes were apparent from the
                        participants’ self-reports: that the novelty of BigDIVA’s networked browsing
                        was either “fun” or “interesting,” that BigDIVA could be most useful for specialized
                        archives or use in scholarly settings, and that the networked visualizations
                        may be pedagogically valuable for demonstrating relationships between
                        scholarly sources (see <a href="#table03">Table 3</a> below).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p40">Another unique theme expressed by participants related to the nature of
                        web-based search queries altogether. In particular, while participants noted
                        that after a brief adjustment period they were able to successfully search
                        and find specific information using BigDIVA, that they would still use a
                        more typical visualization such as Google — even if networked browsing were
                        an option with Google. Participants justified this preference with the fact
                        that a text-based list of results still might be simpler and quicker if the
                        user already knows what they are looking for; whereas networked browsing
                        would be preferable if the user was not certain what they were looking for.
                        In other words, networked browsing would be more suitable for exploring the
                        contents of an archive without a predisposition for specific results.

                     questions, we are left with valuable evidence that point towards the potential
                     range of experiences and materialities that networked browsing has to offer.

                     evidence of how the process of searching with BigDIVA compares to a more
                     traditional search tool like Google. According to our analysis of users’
                     input-related actions, we observed that despite the fact that BigDIVA employs
                     traditional faceted search functionality (albeit with networked visualization)
                     participants experienced browsing differently for Google and BigDIVA.
                     Participants took significantly longer to complete BigDIVA tasks, in some cases
                     were unable to complete certain tasks, and in some cases attempted to transfer
                     functionalities from Google. Additionally, participants generally used the
                     search bar less, the mouse and cursor less, and the faceting features more when
                     completing BigDIVA tasks compared to Google tasks. It was therefore apparent
                     that, perhaps because of the comparative study design, when participants shifted
                     from using Google to BigDIVA that they experienced a performative disruption.
                     The spike in mouse clicks for the first BigDIVA task, which subsequently leveled
                     out for participants, exemplified the learning curve or adaptation to the
                     distinctive performances engendered by networked browsing.

                     components in understanding the cybernetic assemblage, do not tell the whole

                     distributed machinic components is made discursively meaningful. Self-reports of
                     users’ experiences and perceptions regarding BigDIVA therefore revealed the most
                     surprising observations and indications of what it is like to perform networked
                     browsing. Participants described their initial impressions of networked browsing
                     as “fun,”
                     “interesting,” or “different” — regardless of their success or failure in the search
                     tasks. They additionally reflected on the potential scholarly and pedagogical
                     applications, and yet, most surprising, participants remained skeptical of
                     networked browsing’s usefulness for everyday web browsing (i.e., in place of
                     typical search interfaces like Google); however, numerous participants suggested
                     it would be more fitting functionality for finite archives (i.e., such as the
                     ARC catalog).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44"> That participants generally reported such positive experiences and perceptions
                     of BigDIVA, in spite of its more specialized use, is a promising indication that
                     networked browsing may indeed engender Shneiderman’s (1996) “joyous experience” for interfacing with the web. Indeed, such
                     experiences are difficult to observe by examining input-related actions alone
                     and without facial recognition software to analyze affect. In future study, we
                     therefore intend to place greater emphasis on <em class="emph">how</em> users experience
                     networked browsing with an eye toward longitudinal designs and repeated
                     self-report measures in addition to analyses more common in usability research.
                     These observations follow Warrick’s (2012) suggestions for the combined use of
                     log-file data to track input and output actions in addition to more traditional
                     ethnographic methods, such as interviews and longitudinal participant
                     observation, in order to examine usability and use of new tools in the digital
                     humanities. If our study observed even an inkling of how new users
                     performatively intra-acted and engaged in meaning-making with BigDIVA, then more
                     prolonged and iterative observations would be able to richly observe use in
                     context.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p45">Of course, as implied already, our study was not without its limitations. In
                        addition to a small sample size, we wish to emphasize that the comparative
                        design of our study is one such limitation, because, as participants
                        self-reported, BigDIVA prioritized a different kind of browsing than Google.
                        Finding information in BigDIVA did not require a scavenger hunt amongst a
                        hierarchical text-based list that required prior knowledge encoded in the
                        form of a query. Instead, BigDIVA made information available without a
                        search query, thus begging participants to visually untangle and play with
                        the networked catalog. Our study design admittedly prioritized specific
                        search tasks in order to target use of specific features as well as to allow
                        easy comparison to search tasks in Google. Open-ended tasks or longitudinal
                        observation, per [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2012">Warwick 2012</a>], would therefore be
                        well-suited alternatives.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p46">At the same time, comparative methods are still valuable for design and
                        experiential considerations of these interfaces. After all, if networked
                        browsing indeed affords unique performative understandings and
                        meaning-making experiences compared to other operationalizations of faceted
                        search functions, then more detailed comparative studies could reveal the
                        distinctions in those processes, particularly comparing similar scholarly
                        faceted search tools such as a university library database. As suggested
                        above, such a comparative study would do well to not solely rely on
                        input-based behavioral measures that privilege the machine components of the
                        interface, and instead privilege the human components in the interface by
                        observing affect, metacognitive processes, as well as self-report measures
                        to emphasize users’ perceptions of their experiences. In particular, such
                        methods could potentially parse out the distinction between users’
                        understanding of search functionality from archive architecture, as well as
                        how, in their own terms, they may find joy in their browsing experiences.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47"> Based on the observations from our study, networked browsing may indeed be
                     suggestive of Whitelaw’s (2015) “generous
                     interfacing” that emphasizes browsing as a tool for exploring
                     relationships between nodes in archives. The possibilities for exploration and
                     play are evidenced not only in how archives may be accessed and searched for
                     specific scholarly aims, but also for configuring new relational understandings
                     of the distributed materiality of an archive itself. In other words, networked
                     browsing may help users conceptualize archives as agential or living material
                     bodies. In doing so, searching through an archive is no longer a linear act of
                     retrieval, but perhaps an exploratory and contingent act of meaning-making. 
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p48"> Of course, our study’s observations and what they suggest only yield more
                     questions about networked browsing, faceted search functions, and generous
                     interfacing. As mentioned above, further research design would do well to
                     observe how individuals might use BigDIVA over a longer span of time, involve
                     more open-ended tasks, and involve multidimensional analysis. In particular,
                     future research should question what could users learn or discover with BigDIVA
                     when simply given time and freedom to experiment with networked browsing and
                     explore the archive? Would they come to a more detailed understanding of its
                     components (i.e., collections, individual resources, faceting structures)? Would
                     they become more fluent with the interface’s functionality? Such questions,
                     which we see as central to the study of knowledge-production in the digital
                     humanities, would require attention to <em class="emph">usability</em> of digital tools
                     as well as a well-rounded and holistic model of who a digital <em class="emph">user</em>
                     is and how they engage in <em class="emph">use</em> .
