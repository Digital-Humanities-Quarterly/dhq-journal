            <p>Improving methods of stylometrics and classification so that they give good results
               with small texts is the focus of much research in the digital humanities and in the
               NLP community more generally. Recent work <ptr target="#gorman2019"/> has suggested
               that an approach using combinations of shallow and deep morpho-syntactic information
               can be quite successful. But because the data in that study were taken from hand
               annotated dependency treebanks, the wider applicability of such an approach remains
               in question. The present paper seeks to answer this question by using
               machine-generated morphological and syntactic annotations as the basis for a
               closed-set classification experiment. Texts were parsed according to the Universal
               Dependency schema using the <q>udpipe</q> package for R. Experiments were carried out
               on data from several languages covering a range of morphological complexity. To limit
               confounders, consideration of vocabulary was excluded. Results were quite promising,
               and, not surprisingly, a more complex morphology correlates with better accuracy
               (e.g., 100-token texts in Polish: 88% correct; 100-token texts in English: 74%).The
               method presented here has particular advantages for stylometrics as practiced in
               literary analysis and other fields in the humanities. The Universal Dependency
               annotation categories are generally similar to those used in traditional grammars.
               Thus, the variables which serve to distinguish the style of a given author are
               relatively easier to interpret and understand than, for example, are character
               n-grams or function words. This fact, combined with the availability of easy-to-use
               dependency parsers, opens up the study of a syntax-centered stylometrics to persons
               with a wide range of expertise. Even students at the early stages of their studies
               can identify and investigate the morpho-syntactic <q>signature</q> of a particular
               author. Therefore, the characterization of texts based on computational annotation of
               this type deserves a place in classification studies because of its combination of
               good results and good interpretability.</p>

               <head>1. Introduction</head>
               <p>Developing better methods of classifying short texts is becoming increasingly
                  important in the field of computational stylometrics. Synoptic work (Eder 2015)
                  suggests that many common approaches to at least one kind of text classification —
                  Authorship Attribution — are unreliable when the text to be classified is less
                  than a few thousand words. Maciej Eder’s study examines several
                  classifiers (Burrows’ Delta, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor) and
                  finds that all suffer from a similar drop in effectiveness as the size of the
                  target texts decreases. The same result is seen when considering the most usual
                  independent variables (a.k.a. <q>features</q>) used as input to the various
                  classifiers. These features include Most Frequent Words, character n-grams, and
                  POS (part of speech) n-grams. Based on Eder’s results, one must conclude that
                  success in classification of short texts needs improved algorithms and/or more
                  informative input variables.</p>
               <p>This study focuses on the second requirement and explores the value of
                  morphological tagging and syntactic parsing to create a richly discriminative set
                  of variables. Generally speaking, morphological and syntactic data are underused
                  in Authorship Attribution as compared to lexical and character-based features.
                  While a wide-ranging survey <ptr target="#stamatatos2009"/> was able to refer to a number of
                  studies that used syntactic re-write rules or more complex morpho-syntactic
                  features, an examination of references in a subsequent overview <ptr target="#swain2017"/>
                  indicates POS tags are almost the only such features in frequent use. However, a
                  more recent experiment in Authorship Attribution relying entirely on
                  morpho-syntactic variables <ptr target="#gorman2020"/> suggests that such features can
                  significantly enrich the information available for text classification. </p>
               <p>The general applicability of R. Gorman’s study is questionable for at least two
                  reasons. First, it involves a morphologically complex language — ancient Greek. It
                  is uncertain how its methods may be suited to a simpler morphological target such
                  as English. Second, the study’s approach is based on a dependency syntax corpus in
                  which morphology and dependency relations have been hand annotated by a single
                  language expert. The corpus is unusually large to be annotated in this way, and
                  the resulting accuracy and consistency is a luxury available in few languages. </p>
               <p>The present investigation will further explore the viability of a morpho-syntactic
                  approach to text classification. It will test the effectiveness of such variables
                  in several languages representing a wide spectrum of morphological complexity
                  (English, German, Spanish, Finnish, and Polish). In addition, the requisite
                  morphological and dependency annotation will be generated automatically, using a
                  freely available program. As a proof of concept, classification will be carried
                  out with only the resultant morpho-syntactic information. This restriction will
                  simplify interpretation of results by reducing possible confounding elements
                  within the proposed feature set. In addition, an important consideration in
                  authorship classification is to eliminate as far as possible the effects of topic
                  and genre and to avoid relying on any features that could be easily imitated or
                  manipulated. Syntactic features are thought to meet this requirement better than
                  lexical ones. Since identifying syntactic information requires extra processing
                  with possibly noisy results, most investigations fall back on <q>function words</q> as
                  a proxy for truly syntactic features. By directly using computationally generated
                  syntactic analyses instead, this study will explore the benefits of such
                  pre-processing in comparison to the costs of the noise it inevitably
                  introduces.</p>
               <p>The remainder of this article has the following structure. Part 2 discusses the
                  formation of the various language corpora. It then details the creation of the
                  input variables. These variables are somewhat complicated, in that they are based
                  on combinations of morpho-syntactic elements and, at the same time, seek to
                  preserve as much flexibility as possible in the incorporation of these elements.
                  Part 3 explains the several steps of the classification experiment itself. Part 4
                  presents the results of the classification process and explores their
                  implications. It lays particular emphasis on the interpretability of the input
                  variables used in this study. Arguably, descriptions of authorial style based on
                  traditional morpho-syntactic categories will prove more persuasive to those
                  outside the ranks of scholars of computational stylometrics. </p>

               <head>2. Corpora and Feature Extraction</head>
               <p>This study involves corpora of texts in several languages: English, Finnish,
                  German, Spanish, and Polish. An attempt was made to gather publicly available
                  texts in a wider range of languages, but it was hindered by several factors. The
                  design of the proposed experiment requires 20 single-author texts in a given
                  language. All texts should be more than 20,000 tokens in length, and all texts in
                  a language should be of the same type. Where possible, texts were to be drawn from
                  a well-defined temporal range. These demands were most easily met by selecting
                  works of fiction, in particular novels. The works were drawn from Project 
                  Gutenberg and the Computational Stylistics Group.<note> <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/">https://www.gutenberg.org/</ref>
                     and <ref target="https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/">https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/</ref>. The list of authors
                     and works is given in the appendix. </note>
               </p>
               <p>It may be surprising that a study interested in classification of short texts
                  would use novels rather than, for example, tweets or news articles. However, the
                  focus here is on the informational value of morpho-syntactic variables in various
                  languages and not on any particular kind of text, and in this case the reasons for
                  choosing novels are fairly compelling. As noted, the literature suggests that
                  classification of more than a few texts becomes ineffective when the targets are
                  shorter than a few thousand words. Thus, our investigation starts with texts c.
                  2000 words. Since data are traditionally split into a training set comprising
                  approximately 90% of the material, with the remainder in the test set, texts of
                  20,000 words are in order. While it might be possible to manufacture texts of this
                  length by concatenating tweets or the like, it would not be easy to find, for a
                  range of languages, large sets of short texts that meet a second requirement: that
                  single authorship of each 20,000-word text group can be assumed. Third, the use of
                  novels minimizes, at least as compared to concatenated collections, possible
                  confounding effects of genre and topic. </p>
               <p>The core of this investigation is variable extraction and preparation. The first
                  step is to generate morpho-syntactic annotations for each text. The processing is
                  done with the <q>udpipe</q> package for the R Software Environment <ptr target="#wijffels2019"/>. The
                  package includes functions to produce a universal dependency grammar analysis for
                  texts in a wide variety of languages. Dependency grammar is an increasingly widely
                  accepted approach to describing the structure of sentences. It offers an advantage
                  to the present study in that, unlike phrase structure grammars, it deals well with
                  non-projective grammatical sentence components — essentially, words closely
                  related grammatically that are separated from each other by less closely related
                  words. Non-projectivity occurs frequently in many languages, especially those
                  which, unlike English, have a relatively complex system of morphology. The
                  <ref target="https://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies</ref> framework <ptr target="#nivr2015"/> has been developed by an
                  international cooperative of scholars to further cross-linguistic language 
                     study. One of its most
                  important contributions is to establish a common set of tags for morphological
                  features and syntactic relationships. This standard is a great step forward in
                  natural language processing across languages, since, <term>inter alia,
                  </term>the parsers (i.e., programs to analyze syntax) sponsored by the Universal
                  Dependencies (UD) project produce mutually compatible output: a single algorithm
                  can pre-process texts from a range of languages.</p>
               <p>Raw text (.txt files) provided to the udpipe program gives an output in which each
                  token is lemmatized, tagged for morphology, and parsed for universal dependency
                  relationship. Formatted as a matrix, its most salient results look like this:</p>

               <p>The text is part of a sentence from <title rend="italic">Buddenbrooks</title> by Thomas
                  Mann: <quote rend="inline"><foreign xml:lang="de">Er lachte vor Vergnügen, sich über den Katechismus mokieren zu können …</foreign></quote>
                  (<quote rend="inline">He laughed with pleasure at being able to make fun of the catechism</quote>). </p>
               <p>For each token the analysis gives the form as it appears in the text and its
                  lemma. This information is not used in our approach to classification and will be
                  ignored here. The remaining columns shown, however, are integral. The “upos”
                  column contains the UD part-of-speech tags for each word. The “feats” column gives
                  the morphological analysis. Morphology information has the form “TYPE=VALUE, with
                  multiple features separated by a bar symbol (TYPE1=VALUE1|TYPE2=VALUE2). For
                  example, token #2, <hi rend="italic">lachte</hi> (“laughed”), is identified as
                  Indicative in the category Mood (Mood=Ind), Singular in the category Number
                  (Number=Sing), etc. There is no limit to the number of features that may be
                  assigned to a single token.</p>
               <p>Part of speech and morphology constitute what we may call “shallow” syntactic
                  features. Information of this type may allow us to infer some syntactical
                  structures, but they do not represent them directly. In contrast, the
                  “head_token_id” and “dep_rel” columns do constitute such a direct representation.
                  The head token is the item that is the immediate syntactic “parent” of a given
                  token. The dependency relation specifies the type of grammatical structure
                  obtaining between parent and target. From these columns we may generate a
                  description of the syntactic structure of the entire sentence in a representation
                  of its “deep” syntax. The structure revealed by these data points is perhaps most
                  clearly illustrated with the corresponding dependency tree:</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Figure 1: Dependency Tree of Example Sentence</p>
               <p>As is apparent, the syntactic “path” from the sentence root to the each “leaf”
                  token is given by the combination of head id and dependency relationship.</p>
               <p>Both shallow and deep syntactic information are used to create the input variables
                  for this investigation. Before looking at those variables in detail, it is worth
                  noticing that pre-processing with the udpipe program introduces a certain amount
                  of noise through mistaken analyses. To focus on the “feats” output, token 4, the
                  noun <hi rend="italic">Vergnügen</hi>, is incorrectly assigned NOMINATIVE case
                  (should be DATIVE). In addition, the three indeclinable tokens in this text —
                  i.e., words with a fixed and static form whose morphology is usually not further
                  analyzed — are treated very strangely indeed: the preposition <hi rend="italic"
                     >vor</hi> and the particle <hi rend="italic">zu</hi> are assigned gender,
                  number, and case (<hi rend="italic">zu</hi> also gets classified for definiteness
                  and pronoun type). The frequent preposition <hi rend="italic">über</hi> is treated
                  as a foreign word, perhaps as a dependent of the ecclesiastical (and ultimately
                  ancient Greek) word <hi rend="italic">Katechismus</hi>. Whatever the reason, the
                  parser has introduced 4 errors in 12 tokens. Of course, the example text was
                  chosen because it is short yet relatively complex; it may not be at all
                  representative of the general error rate of the udpipe program. Nonetheless, it
                  would be reasonable to worry that the noise introduced by erroneous
                  morpho-syntactic annotations would undercut their value for classification input
                  variables. However, as we will see below, bad tagging and parsing seems to make
                  little or no practical difference in the classification results. We may evidently
                  assume that these input errors are distributed randomly across the classified
                  texts and that they have little effect as compared to the information carried by
                  the input variables.</p>
               <p>To turn now to the details of the features (i.e., input variables) themselves,
                  there are two main principles guiding their creation: first, the set should
                  include both shallow and deep syntactic information; second, the “degrees of
                  freedom” present in the morpho-syntactic “system” of the target language should
                  be, to the greatest extent possible, preserved and represented in the
                     features.<note> Here the metaphor “degrees of freedom” is drawn not from the
                     statistical technical term but rather from traditional physics. Thus, the
                     phrase is meant to call to mind the number of independent parameters that a
                     mechanical system can have, such as the yaw, pitch, roll, etc. of a ship or
                     airplane. Analogously, as discussed below, a German noun has three independent
                     morphological parameters, gender, number, and case, each with multiple possible
                     values. <hi rend="italic">Ex hypothesi</hi>, any combination of these
                     parameters can carry important information about an author’s style, and
                     therefore all “degrees of freedom” should be taken into consideration. </note>
               </p>
               <p>The first criterion is met by including, alongside the morphological information
                  for each word, its dependency relation and, for each word that is not a sentence
                  root, the morphology and dependency relation for the parent word of the target
                  word. To illustrate from the German sentence given above, the variables for the
                  word <hi rend="italic">Katechismus</hi> would include the following:</p>
               <p>Self: POS = noun, case = accusative, gender = masculine, number = singular,
                  dependency = oblique</p>
               <p>Parent: POS = verb, verb form = infinitive, dependency = open clausal
                  complement</p>
               <p>Including values for parent as well as target word creates a representation of the
                  hierarchical structure that most linguistic theories assume for syntax. Of course,
                  the dimensions of morpho-syntactic information produced by the udpipe
                  tagger-parser vary sharply by language. The following table (Table 2) indicates
                  the number of “basic” elements for each language. </p>

               <p>Table 2: Number of “Simplex” Variables.</p>
               <p>The second requirement mentioned above is meant to preserve the complexity of the
                  morpho-syntax of the input texts. As we have noted, it is rare for an attribution
                  attempt to take any morphological feature into account with the common exception
                  of part of speech. In those studies that do include morphological details, the
                  various values that make up the relevant information about a word seem to be coded
                  in a single block. For example, Paulo Varela (2018, 2016) incorporate in their
                  variables a vector for “flexion” (number, gender, tense, etc.), but apparently
                  combine the features of a word into a single value: thus the entry for <hi
                     rend="italic">é </hi>(Portuguese “is”) is reported as “PR 3S IND VFIN,” i.e,
                  present indicative 3rd-person singular verb.<note> Varela et al. (2018, 2016) do
                     not explicitly explain how the internal structure of the values in the flexion
                     vector are handled in their approach. However, the number of input variables in
                     their analysis (179 reduced to 132) is not consistent with the preservation of
                     all degrees of freedom in their five morpho-syntactic vectors.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Combining the morphological categories of a word into a single value obscures some
                  of the stylistic information that the word may contain. For example, if we
                  categorize a German noun into a consolidated unit of gender, number, and case
                  (e.g., Masc Sing Nom), the computer can assign each noun in the corpus to one of
                  the 24 resulting categories (3 genders x 2 numbers x 4 cases) and calculate a
                  frequency distribution over them, but it cannot access the frequencies of, say,
                  masculine nouns or of combinations of two categories such as feminine dative,
                     etc.<note> Certainly, an algorithm could be designed to recognize the internal
                     structure of a composite variable and calculate the frequency of the
                     components, but this procedure would be a more cumbersome route to the same
                     result as including more granular variables from the beginning.</note> There is
                  no strong reason to presume that any frequency ratio among the ternary variables
                  is more discriminative for the texts in a corpus than, e.g., the ratio between
                  Masc Nom and Fem Nom. We may usefully think of the morpho-syntactic elements that

                     et al. (2012) explore what we might call “word-level” syntactic n-grams. The
                        <hi rend="italic">n </hi>in their conception represents the number of
                     hierarchically contiguous words included, where hierarchy is determined by
                     dependency and is analogous to linear order in the more familiar form of
                     n-gram. Gorman and Gorman (2016) explore a similar procedure. In the present
                     study, greater weight is given to intra-word characteristics alongside
                     syntactic sequences between words. The analogy with character n-grams thus
                     seems apt.</note> Just as the addition to word-based inputs of character
                  n-grams with different values of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> may improve
                  classification, in the same way using a range of combination lengths for
                  morpho-syntactic elements may be valuable. Thus, it is best <hi rend="italic">in
                     principle, </hi>to include variables made of all “arities” of morpho-syntactic
                  categories, from one to the total number of such categories (i.e., <mml:math>

                     (1948, 12) has pointed out that entropy is sub-additive, in that the sum of the
                     individual entropies of several variables is greater than the joint entropy of
                     those variables, except in the case where the variables are statistically
                     independent. While calculating the relative contribution to information of two
                     variables is elementary, specifying the contributions of multiple variables is
                     an open question (Williams and Beer 2010). It may therefore be more prudent to
                     turn linguistic features into a larger number of more basic variables than a
                     smaller number of consolidated inputs.</note>

               <p>Of course, such an extensive variable set is not feasible <hi rend="italic">in
                     practice.</hi> For example, the udpipe program for German returns 13 categories
                  of morphological features. To these 13 must be added the part of speech and the
                  dependency relationship, and since the characteristics of the parent word are to
                  be combined with those of each target word, variable types will be combinations
                  constructed from 30 categories. If all sizes of combination were included (i.e., <mml:math>

                  combination Gender-Number-Case may take one of 24 different values in German: MASC
                  SING NOM, etc. Thus, the number of type-value pairs reaches truly astronomical
                  values. Clearly, we must combine the generation of input features with a rigorous
                  culling and reduction process.</p>
               <p>The first step deals with the combinatorial dimension. Selecting grammatically
                  sensible combinations such as Gender-Number-Case (and its unigram and bigram
                  components) would be laborious and would require knowledge of the various
                  languages to be classified. Thus, a naïve approach was preferred: an arbitrary
                  maximum length was chosen. Given a set of 30 elements for combination, the length
                  must necessarily be short. <mml:math>

                  </mml:math> already gives 31,930 unique combinations. When we take into account
                  that each combination will have multiple values, trouble with data sparsity and
                  computational limitations can be expected. Therefore, the maximum was set at three
                  elements per combination. This limit results in 4,525 combinations. </p>
               <p>The next step populates each combination (or variable type) with its various
                  values, as drawn from the basic morpho-syntactic elements produced by udpipe. This
                  process is computationally slow for combinations of more than two elements, so we
                  have used a smaller sample corpus for each language; it is composed of 500 tokens
                  (punctuation excluded) from each text. When populated, the various combinations of
                  types exhibit a large number of unique values. To take German as illustrative: the
                  30 unary types produce 161 values, the 435 binary types produce 5,579 values, and
                  the 4,060 ternary combinations yield 56,349 values. As one would expect with
                  linguistic data, the frequency distributions of these values are quite skewed. For
                  example, 53,209 of the ternary values occur in 1% or fewer words and 19,116 occur
                  only once in the sample corpus of 10,000 tokens. To avoid severe sparsity, another
                  culling of variables is clearly in order.</p>
               <p>Once again, since we do not know without prior investigation which combinations
                  may be most distinctive for authors and texts, we have had recourse to a naïve
                  approach. For each combination length, only those type-value pairs that occur in
                  5% of the tokens in the sample corpus have been included as input variables for
                  classification. A separate set of variables has been identified in this way for
                  each language. The size of each sub-set of variables is given in the following

               <p>It is important to emphasize that it is the <hi rend="italic">pairing</hi> of the
                  (possibly compound) types <hi rend="italic">and </hi>their (possibly compound)
                  values which constitute the input variables for this investigation. In Polish, for
                  example, a type combining the Number of the target word, with the part of speech
                  and dependency relation of the target word’s parent can have many possible values.
                  But only those combinations of values that occur no less often than the 5%
                  frequency of Singular-Verb-conjunct have been taken into account. All less
                  frequent values for this type have been excluded from the variables and
                     ignored.<note> Note that it follows that one cannot pay attention to the values
                     alone: the value Fem/Perf may be included in the variable set when it gives the
                     values for the Gender and Aspect of a given word’s dependency parent, but the
                     same morphological features may be excluded when they are the values of the
                     target word’s <hi rend="italic">own </hi>Gender and Aspect.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This generation and selection of variables produce, for each text in a language
                  corpus, a matrix in which each row represents a token of the text and each column
                  represents a type-value pair as described above. The total number of variable
                  columns differs for each language (see Table 2). For each row, each cell is
                  assigned a value of one if the token has the morpho-syntactic characteristic for
                  that column; otherwise, zero is assigned. The design of the variables means any
                  given token can have positive values in numerous columns. The German corpus, for
                  example, has a mean of 48.8 positive columns per token (of a total 592 variables).

               <p>The purpose of this study is to test whether automated Universal Dependency
                  annotation, as supplied by the udpipe program, can be useful for authorship
                  attribution and related problems. It seeks to understand whether such an input
                  contains enough information to overcome the noise introduced by a level of
                  mistakes, which can be relatively high as compared to the results of expert “hand
                  annotation.” Since it is known that the information/noise ratio worsens for
                  shorter input texts (Eder 2017), this investigation focuses on the degree to which
                  classification performance degrades as the size of the input decreases. This
                  process requires texts of various lengths, with all other factors held constant,
                  insofar as this may be possible. This requirement is met by creating a series of
                  smaller “texts” for each author by sampling the full text.</p>
               <p>At each stage of classification, each text in each language corpus was divided
                  into smaller texts, and these smaller units were classified according to author.
                  Gorman (2020) has shown that — at least for expert-annotated ancient Greek prose —
                  classification on the basis of combinations of morpho-syntactic characteristics is
                  practically error-free for input texts larger than 500 tokens (&gt; 99%).
                  Exploratory tests for our study confirm this high level of accuracy for text sizes
                  of between 2000 and 600 tokens. Thus, this paper will present only the data for
                  the smallest texts in the investigation; it begins with texts of 500 tokens, and
                  then decreases to 400, 300, 200, 100, and finally 50 tokens.</p>
               <p>As is traditional in textual attribution studies, each text was treated as a “bag
                  of words” for the purpose of division into samples. Each token was — naively —
                  treated as independent of all others; no further account was taken of the context
                  of an individual token in sentence, paragraph, or any other unit of composition.
                  Thus, segments may contain tokens from many parts of the original text without
                  regard for their original order.<note> Because udpipe works sentence by sentence,
                     all annotation must be completed before creating new smaller “texts” by
                     subsampling since this random selection of course disrupts sentence structure.
                     Thus, for strictly practical reasons, the sampling process is applied to the
                     matrices of token plus annotation rather than to the raw text. This procedure
                     seems to imply no theoretical implications beyond those entailed by the
                     application of the bag-of-words method in general. My thanks to the anonymous
                     reader for raising this question. </note>
               </p>
               <p>Once segments of the appropriate length have been generated, the next step is to
                  aggregate the values for all variables in each segment. For example, a matrix with
                  20,000 rows representing as many separate tokens, each with a 1 or a 0 in its
                  variable columns, is replaced by a new matrix with 40 rows, each representing 500
                  tokens. Each variable column now contains the sum of the relevant column for the
                  underlying tokens. Columns values are then normalized so that sums are replaced by
                  relative frequencies. These “segment matrices” become the input for the
                  classifying algorithm. </p>
               <p>To present a difficult classification problem (Luyckx and Daelemans 2008, 2011),
                  each language corpus contains one work apiece by 20 different authors. Given the
                  number of suitable texts available in the public domain, this number represent an
                  attempt to balance between including more languages with fewer authors for each
                  and including fewer languages with more authors in each.</p>
               <p>For the classification algorithm itself, logistic regression was chosen. This
                  method has an ability to handle a large number of observations and variables. It
                  is also able to function well in the presence of many co-linear variables.
                  Specifically, the <hi rend="italic">LiblineaR</hi> package for the <hi
                     rend="italic">R Project for Statistical Computing </hi>was chosen (Fan 2008;
                  Helleputte 2017). This package offers a range of linear methods; we selected the
                  L-2 regularization option for logistic regression.<note> Exploratory testing
                     revealed that the L-2 option was the quickest and most accurate of those
                     available. L-2 regression (also called “Ridge Regression”) is also preferable
                     for the way it handles collinearity. L-2 regression distributes the weight that
                     collinear variables will have in a model across those collinear variables. The
                     alternative method, L-1 or “Lasso Regression,” by contrast, arbitrarily singles
                     out one of the collinear variables and assigns it the full weight of those
                     variables. L-2 appears more conducive for the interpretation of the importance
                     of individual variables since L-1 may lead the unwary to dismiss the force of a
                     large number of collinear inputs.</note>

               <p>For each input text size in each language, 90% of the data was used for training
                  the classifier and the remaining 10% set aside for testing. Inclusion of a segment
                  in the training or testing set was random. However, the amount of text by
                  individual authors in some language corpora varies a great deal, and this
                  situation may affect results, with the classifier, for example, strongly
                  preferring the most frequent author in the training set. Thus, the random
                  assignment into training and test sets was guided by associating a selection
                  probability with each segment so that each of the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> authors
                  in a corpus was represented by approximately <mml:math>

                  </mml:math> of the segments in the test set. This balance prevents undue bias in
                  the classifier. To validate the results of the classification testing, we used
                  Monte Carlo subsampling (Simon, 2007) applied at two levels. As a rule, the
                  populating of the segments with randomly selected tokens was carried out ten
                     times.<note> Processing becomes slow for text sizes of 100 tokens and fewer,
                     depending on the morphological complexity of the language. The number of times
                     the texts were partitioned was reduced accordingly.</note> For each of these
                  partitionings to create text segments, 100 additional random divisions into a
                  training set and a test set were made. As noted below, because the classification
                  process becomes much slower as text size falls, fewer iterations of both kinds of
                  subsampling were used for the smallest segments. The results of the tests at each
                  text size were averaged. These steps minimize the effects of the internal make-up
                  of particular segments or of their inclusion or exclusion from the
                  training/testing groups.</p>

               <p>For each language corpus, the results of classification according to the size of
                  the input text segments are given in Table 7. Since the goal of this study is to
                  evaluate for authorship attribution the sufficiency of machine-generated Universal
                  Dependency data, no consideration is given to various specialized measurements of
                  classification success. Instead, the simplest measure of accuracy is used:
                  percentage of successful attributions. The mean accuracy over all attempts is
                  given in the top row of each cell; the range is given below the mean. </p>

               <p>Table 7: Classification Accuracy</p>
               <p>These data make clear that morpho-syntactic variables derived from UD automated
                  parsing suffice to identify author/work in a closed set of authors with a single
                  work for each. For all tested languages, accuracy is greater than 90% with text
                  segments larger than 300 tokens. Each language corpus contains 20 classes for
                  attribution; 90% accuracy is roughly 18 times random chance since the
                  “no-information rate” for each iteration varies slightly from 5%.<note> We may
                     take “random chance” here to be equivalent of the reported “no-information
                     rate.” The no-information rate in a classification experiment is the occurrence
                     rate of the most frequently appearing class in the data. For example, if texts
                     by Thomas Mann made up 50% of our material, then a model that classified all
                     test segments as “Mann” would achieve 50% accuracy simply “by chance.” As
                     indicated above, to minimize the no-information rate, our approach ensured that
                     the representation of each class in the training set was roughly equal.</note>
                  Such success offers promise for the feasibility of classification when vocabulary-
                  and/or character-based variables are not appropriate. </p>
               <p>A few more specific observations about these results are in order. In general,
                  accuracy tracks well with the size of the variable set for each language (see
                  Table 2). Languages with larger sets tend to have better accuracy. We may
                  reasonably presume that this tendency is due in part to the correlation between
                  the number of variables and the sparsity of the input matrices. Ordinarily, we
                  expect sparsity — the number of cells of a matrix containing zeros — to increase
                  as the number of variables becomes greater. And more sparsity in data for natural
                  language processing usually means less accuracy. However, recall that in this
                  study a single token may have positive values for many variables and that any
                  variable which has positive values for fewer than 5% of tokens has been excluded.
                  The combination of these two factors means that as the number of total variables
                  increases, so too does the number of variables per token (Table 4). When the token
                  matrices are aggregated to form representations of “texts” of various lengths, the
                  variable columns are summed. The presence of positive values in a good number of
                  columns in the original matrix makes it unsurprising when relatively few columns
                  in the aggregated matrix sum to 0. We may illustrate this with the example of
                  Spanish. The average token in the Spanish matrix has 34.7 columns with a positive
                  value. Forming, e.g., a 50-token segment by the aggregation of the matrix rows
                  means that, on average, 1,735 (34.7 × 50) positive values will be distributed
                  among the 385 variable columns in the resulting matrix. It stands to reason that,
                  all else being equal, we may expect relatively few aggregated columns containing
                  zeros. In fact, with the variables used in this study, sparsity is almost
                  non-existent for texts larger than 100 tokens; the sparsity rates for 50-token
                  texts are themselves unexpectedly small given the number of variables (Table 8).
                  This low sparsity may go far to explaining the good accuracy of the classification
                  experiment.</p>

               <p>Table 8: Sparsity</p>
               <p>A second aspect of the accuracy results reported in Table 3 needs closer
                  elaboration. As is usual for author attribution studies that take text size into
                  consideration, results in each language show a monotonic decline in accuracy as
                  text size decreases. However, when viewed from the perspective of relative error
                  rates, our morpho-syntactic variables seem quite robust against decreasing text
                  size.</p>
               <p>When considering classification accuracy of a range of text sizes, it is important
                  to focus on the relationship between the change in accuracy and the change in text
                  size. A 5% decrease in accuracy when text size drops from 2000 tokens to 1900
                  tokens is much more worrisome than the same decrease from 2000 to 1000 tokens.
                  Table 9 gives the relevant information for this experiment. Specifically, it
                  records the rates at which the error rate (1 – Accuracy) for each language
                  increases as the text size is repeatedly halved: 400 to 200 tokens, 200 to 100,
                  and 100 to 50.</p>

               <p>Table 9: Change in Error Rate by Text Size</p>
               <p>The first row in each cell gives the error rate for a given text size divided by
                  the error rate for the text that is double the size. For example, the Polish
                  200-token corpus had an average error rate of 3.72%, which is divided by the
                  average error rate for the Polish 400-token corpus, 0.95%. The second line of the
                  cell gives the corresponding result: while the text size decreases by a factor of
                  2, the error rate increases by a factor of 3.92. An overview of this table shows
                  that for all languages the increase factor becomes significantly smaller as the
                  input size itself decreases. While the absolute accuracy (or error) rate is still
                  quite properly the metric of interest for literary and, most especially, forensic
                  attribution methods, clearly presenting proportional relationships such as that of
                  the rate of change in text size viz-à-viz the change in success rate should help
                  us to better judge the effectiveness of different approaches to classification of
                  small texts.</p>
               <p>There are, of course, anomalies in the patterns observable in Table 3. For
                  example, since the German matrix has both more total variables and more variables
                  per token than does the Spanish, we might reasonably expect classification of
                  German would outperform Spanish. This is not the case. Nor can an explanation be
                  offered here.<note> It should be recognized that the number of variables produced
                     by UD parsing and the selection process outlined above is not a precise measure
                     of a language’s morphological complexity. Some relevant studies identify the
                     complexity of Spanish as greater than that of German (Bittner 2003; Marzi
                     2019).</note> We can only note that some of the differences between the success
                  rates of various languages must be due not to characteristics of the
                  morpho-syntactic variables, but to particularities of the language corpora.
                  Although an effort was made, within the limits of the texts available in the
                  public domain, to assemble corpora that were roughly similar among languages,
                  important aspects of the corpora must necessarily differ. It is inevitable, for
                  example, that one corpus contains a higher proportion of texts that are more
                  difficult to distinguish from each other than does another corpus. It is possible
                  that this advantage, then, is so great that it may significantly affect the
                  classification accuracy rates. Another complicating factor is introduced by the
                  relative effectiveness of the udpipe annotation. Again, we must assume a possibly
                  wide range between the most and the least accurate of the annotation algorithms.
                  Accordingly, a relatively large amount of noise in the variables of an individual
                  language may certainly be expected to suppress classification accuracy.</p>
               <p>However, identifying such possible confounding elements and measuring their
                  effects are not germane to the purpose of this study. Our experiments have been
                  designed to test the hypothesis that machine-generated morpho-syntactic annotation
                  can be used for accurate closed-set attribution, even for fairly small texts, in a
                  range of languages. All comparisons among languages are merely illustrative and
                  suggestive: greater morpho-syntactic complexity seems to correlate at least
                  approximately with accuracy. Detailed investigation of this apparent relationship
                  must be left to experts in the respective languages and literatures.</p>
               <p>This investigation has set out to explore the discriminative value of a certain
                  set of input features. It has advanced the hypothesis that, absent any vocabulary
                  data, a mixture of a text’s shallow and deep morpho-syntactic characteristics,
                  when combined in a way that preserves as many “degrees of freedom” as possible,
                  can produce strong results in closed-set classification. These results are
                  significant, insomuch as most text classification methods rely primarily on
                  vocabulary or character information, with a text’s syntax represented only by
                  function words and POS tags. However, the quantitative study of language and texts
                  has recently seen the rise in prominence of approaches such as deep neural
                  networks. These are often “end to end” learning systems; input consists of “raw”
                  text with little pre-processing and no feature extraction. Results can be
                  amazingly accurate. In the presence of such effective alternatives, the reader of
                  this study may reasonably feel doubts about a method which requires syntactic
                  parsing as well as significant effort given to feature engineering. </p>
               <p>Yet, user-specified input features have their own advantages. The continuing
                  efforts to find better methods of text classification is primarily driven, at
                  least in the various disciplines of the humanities, by the desire to identify and
                  describe the essential features of individual style. Investigations seek to
                  confirm (or refute) the hypothesis that every user of language has a stylistic
                  “fingerprint” or “signature” that allows written or spoken “texts” from that
                  source to be distinguished from all others. In order for studies of this sort to
                  be plausible, however accurate the results may be, we must be able to give a clear
                  interpretation for the variables on which the classification depends.<note> Simon
                     Gabay (2021, 360) argues persuasively that stylometry should go beyond analysis
                     of quantitative observations to focus on the exploration of “stylistic features
                     with an interpretative yield.”</note> Optimally, we must give this
                  interpretation in terms of commonly accepted phenomena of language and
                  communication. Generally speaking, hand-crafted input features meet this
                  criterion. In contrast, end-to-end deep learning algorithms typically abstract
                  their own features, and often it takes a great deal of effort to establish what
                  phenomena the model is taking into account.<note> For example, one method of
                     interpretation is to inactivate one at a time hidden nodes within a neural
                     network model to see if the “ablation” affects the outcome of interest (Lakretz
                     2020a, 2020b). </note>
               </p>
               <p>The input features examined in this study are familiar in their basic elements and
                  transparently interpretable. Anyone interested in the dimensions of authorial
                  style presented here can quickly learn the outline of a language’s morphology and
                  the elementary structures of Universal Dependency grammar. As a result,
                  classification based on UD parsing and morphology tagging puts even beginning
                  students of style in a position to explore clear distinctions between texts and
                  authors.</p>
               <p>Since even a classification technique as fundamental as logistic regression
                  complicates the matter by adding a layer of learned weights to the input features,
                  the interpretability of these morpho-syntactic variables is well illustrated if
                  looked at through the lens of a simple distance measure. Since its publication,
                  Burrows’s Delta has become one of the most widely used metrics for comparing text
                  styles. In essence, Delta measures, for each feature of interest, how far the
                  target text differs from the mean of the corpus, normalized by the standard
                  deviation of each variable.<note>

                     values, Burrows’s Delta is a species of Manhattan Distance (Evert 2017).</note>
                  In spite of its simplicity, Delta can produce very good classification results
                  (Eder 2015). Conveniently, classification by this method is included in the
                  “Stylo” package for R (Eder 2016). Table 10 demonstrates the effectiveness of our
                  morpho-syntactic variables by showing the results for the classification of 33
                  Polish novels using “Stylo.”<note> The top line of each “Accuracy” cell gives the
                     mean of all classifications for that size; the second line gives the range. For
                     text sizes of 2000-600 tokens, data were partitioned into text segments five
                     time; each such partition was then classified 100 times, with each
                     classification using a different random test and training set. Because of
                     slowing processing speed, the 500-token texts were classified only 50 times for
                     each partitioning of segments.</note>

               <p>Clearly, the variables used in this study can accurately distinguish texts without
                  the addition of weights and calculations that may obscure interpretation. A very
                  few brief examples should suffice to make this point. </p>
               <p>According to the application of Burrows’s Delta to the morpho-syntactic variables
                  presented here, the two stylistically most distinct works in our corpus of English
                  fiction are James Fenimore Cooper’s <hi rend="italic">The Last of the Mohicans
                  </hi>(1826) and Mark Twain’s <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
                  </hi>(1885). The most distinctive feature in the set (where the two authors differ
                  by almost four standard deviations) is Cooper’s fondness for an oblique dependent
                  of a verb that itself is modified by its own dependent. In UD grammar, the oblique
                  of a verb is a nominal dependent of a verb that is not an argument of the verb.
                  Here is an example from Cooper’s first paragraph: “The hardy colonist, and the
                  trained European who fought at his side ….” Here, <hi rend="italic">side </hi>in
                  “at his side” is an oblique of <hi rend="italic">fought </hi>and is modified by
                  its dependent possessive <hi rend="italic">his. </hi>If the annotations created by
                  “udpipe” are to be trusted, Cooper used such structures to an unusual degree,
                  while Twain avoided them. Comparing Cooper to the entire English corpus, we find
                  that the author was also inordinately fond of modifying the object of a verb with
                  a dependency.<note> In UD grammar, object does not refer only to a direct object
                     of a transitive verb, but to the second argument of any verb. For example, in
                     “she went to the store” <hi rend="italic">store </hi>would be considered the
                     object of <hi rend="italic">went </hi>on the assumption that, with that verb,
                     an expression of goal is usually mandatory.</note> The unusually high frequency
                  of this construction remains even if we control for the number of objects in
                  general, as well as when we consider the total frequency of all verbs.</p>
               <p>To examine a morphologically more complex language, in our German corpus the work
                  with the greatest mean distance to all the others is Arthur Achleitner’s <hi
                     rend="italic">Im grünen Tann </hi>(1897?). One of the strongest <hi
                     rend="italic">differentiae </hi>is the author’s marked preference for verbs in
                  the Present Indicative Active 3rd-person Singular. Because the data set contains
                  values for simple morphological elements as well as combination, we can quickly
                  see that Achleitner’s verbal tendency can be explained in terms of his very sharp
                  relative avoidance of past tense verbs, alongside a more moderate relative deficit
                  of plural verbs; we may assume that mood, voice, and person do not play a
                  significant role in this stylistic peculiarity. With respect to nominal forms,
                  Achleitner shows a relatively high number of nouns with a dependent definite
                  article; this frequency is only partly explained by the relative number of nouns
                  in general. At the same time, the frequency of pronouns is much lower than
                  average. Accordingly, we might formulate, perhaps for our students, a “thumbnail”
                  outline of Achleitner’s stylistic quirks: he loves <hi rend="italic">liebt</hi>
                  and hates <hi rend="italic">liebte</hi>; loves <hi rend="italic">der, die,
                     das</hi> and hates <hi rend="italic">er, sie, es.</hi> It is a gross
                  simplification to be sure, but it emphasizes the transparency of stylistic
                  distinctions drawn on the basis of our feature set.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, the evidence presented in this study has shown that
                  morpho-syntactic features can form a basis for the successful classification of
                  texts. Results are good across languages ranging from the morphologically complex
                  (e.g., Polish) to the simple (e.g., English). And, while it is unlikely that the
                  frequency of morpho-syntactic elements is unaffected by topic, genre, etc., we can
                  reasonably suppose that it is less affected by such elements external to the
                  author than are variables based primarily on aspects of vocabulary. Therefore,
                  morpho-syntactic features seem essential to characterizing an author’s stylistic
                  signature. </p>
               <p>A second goal of the present work has been to demonstrate that we do not need to
                  rely on expensive expert-annotated data to provide satisfactory syntactic
                  information. Automated parsers such as udpipe are able to output Universal
                  Dependency annotation that is sufficient to form the basis of effective variables
                  representing both the “shallow” and “deep” syntax of a text. Because, with most
                  variable sets used in the attribution literature, noise tends to overwhelm
                  information when text size decreases sufficiently, this investigation has focused
                  on short texts. Even with texts of 50 tokens, accuracy remains many times better
                  than random chance (74%-53%). These results were achieved with the most naïve
                  methods of feature selection and without any optimization of the parsing or
                  classifying algorithms. We may thus suggest that further explorations of the value
                  of UD parsing for classification promise to be productive. </p>
               <p>Finally, we have argued that the morpho-syntactic features discussed here are
                  advantageous, at least from the point of view of interpretability and pedagogical
                  usefulness. Unlike n-grams, for example, morpho-syntactic variables represent
                  traditional grammatical terms and categories. Unlike function words, such
                  variables — at least when the preservation of “degrees of freedom” is emphasized
                  in their construction — contain information based on every word in a text. As a
                  result, stylistic traits formulated in terms of these variables are easily
                  identified and illustrated in a way relatively more likely to be persuasive in the
                  classroom or in the pages of a specialized literary journal.</p>
               <p>In sum, this investigation of short text classification on the basis of
                  machine-generated Universal Dependency annotation indicates that, at the very
                  least, morpho-syntax should occupy a larger role in the future development of text
                  attribution. Perhaps it should even take a central role.</p>
