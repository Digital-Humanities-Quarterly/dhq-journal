                  <p>There are plenty of good reasons for building a website for your collection,
                    including learning a new skill, protecting fragile resources from constant
                    handling in the archives, adding interactive functionality that is only possible
                    on the web, and opening access to users who cannot visit in person.</p>
                  <p>But often there are better ways to share your collection. Websites are expensive
                    and a lot of work. Committing to building a website is like committing to build
                    and maintain a library for the foreseeable future.</p>
                  <p>If you're reading this, you must already be enthusiastic and have a great idea.
                    This flowchart is not meant to dampen that enthusiasm. Instead, it is written to
                    make sure you ask yourself som eof the tough questions too, to make sure your
                    project is viable before you make a big commitment.</p>

                     <a href="#p1">1</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Starting in earnest in the late 1990s, we began to see an increasing number of
                    online digital archives containing digital versions of historical primary
                    sources. The "digital surrogates" as we call them, may have
                    been in the form of digital photographs of the original, or perhaps
                    transcriptions of the text stored in a searchable database. These websites make
                    primary sources accessible to anyone, no matter where in the world, and the
                    digital format allows new types of research – linking, network analysis, corpus
                    linguistics – like never before. Many contain huge collections that run into the
                    hundreds of millions of words. They are archives in their own right. We have
                    come to love the beautiful and user-friendly search interfaces that point us to
                    relevant sources. We admire (even envy) those colleagues who win the big grants
                    to put these sites together. We have seen all the positives, but in the process
                    have forgotten to ask a fundamental question: are these websites necessary?</div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p2">2</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Not, are these digital records necessary? I believe they are; or at least, that
                    they provide tremendous benefits that justify their creation and their cost.
                    Instead, I argue that we must question whether or not a website is always the
                    best (most economical, sustainable, good use of funds) way to store and
                    distribute these records. Sometimes the answer is yes. Often, depositing your
                    digital records in an existing repository, or releasing them in a
                    standards-compliant format for download, provides all of the same research
                    benefits as would a website, but without the hassle and expense. Every time a
                    website is built, less energy and money is available to digitise more materials.
                    That’s not good for taxpayers, and it’s not good for researchers. Instead, I
                    argue we should be critical of the need for a website, and should spend more
                    time making data available, and less time making it look pretty.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Of course, there are plenty of good reasons for building a website for your
                    collection, including learning a new skill, protecting fragile resources from

                    lot of work. Committing to building a website is like committing to build and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Before taking on a major web-based project, I urge would-be website builders to
                    pass three tests: morality, audience, and competency. These tests are outlined
                    in greater detail in the flowchart that accompanies this editorial. The morality
                    test asks the reader to consider the cost of the project and the value for money
                    of a web-based solution. The audience test is a series of questions designed to
                    tease out which users the website seeks to attract (journalists, family
                    historians, students, academic historians, the general public), and by extension
                    of that, if a website is the best way to reach that audience. Finally, the
                    competency test ensures that you or your team have the technical experience to
                    build an effective, sustainable website that can compete for the attention of
                    users for many years to come.</div>
