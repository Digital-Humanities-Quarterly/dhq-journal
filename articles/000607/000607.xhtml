                  <p>This article documents the theoretical and practical considerations underpinning
                     the COVID-19-inspired digital humanities event: “The
                     Scholarly Primitives of Scholarly Meetings.”  Drawing from both the
                     long tradition of work on scholarly primitives as well as the rush of new work
                     that appeared in the early months of 2020, the event described here was designed
                     as both an exercise in critical making and a response to the constraints of the
                     virtual incunabular state so many organisations found themselves in, attempting
                     to recreate their planned face-to-face meetings in virtual formats without due
                     consideration of the affordances and constraints of each context. As a
                     structurally distributed organisation, the DARIAH European Research
                     Infrastructure as event host was able to bring its experience of virtual
                     interaction to the recosideration of these challenges, but also the sensitivity
                     to research processes and practices that is central to our positioning in the
                     digital humanities.  As such, the resulting model for a virtual event, realised
                     in May 2020 and described in this paper, was built upon a very self-conscious
                     set of considerations, meta-reflection, and goals regarding what we might
                     tacitly and could expect from a virtual event.  The instruments designed to
                     deliver this, as well as their performance in practice, is documented alongside
                     consideration of what lessons the experience delivers about both virtual
                     meetings and more generally about the interactions of scholarly communities.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In March 2020, the DARIAH ERIC, a pan-European research infrastructure for the
                     arts and humanities, was deeply engaged in the planning for their May annual
                     event, but this annual event had to be postponed and ultimately moved online due
                     to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. For DARIAH, however, we did not
                     want to lose the opportunity to share knowledge and exchange ideas in our usual
                     vibrant format. Our position within digital humanities and the meta-relation to
                     our chosen event theme of “Scholarly Primitives” made
                     us hyperaware that virtual interactions were impoverished and lacking. However,
                     there was little investigation of exactly what functions could be easily
                     transposed into the virtual format and which ones could not. With this event,
                     which we referred to not as a conference but as a Virtual Exchange (VX) event,
                     would seek to maximise audience engagement and interaction, minimise participant
                     cognitive load, foster serendipity and discovery, and specifically explore the
                     human side of what happens at in-person versus online scholarly meetings. This
                     field report details how the DARIAH VX team theorised, built, lived and
                     evaluated the strengths of the virtual scholarly meeting through the contextual
                     lens of “Scholarly Primitives” and how future online
                     events could learn from and apply these strategies and specific practices.</div>

                     and ultimately moved online due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. For DARIAH,
                     however, the difficult process of coming to terms with losing our opportunity to
                     share knowledge and exchange ideas in our usual vibrant format was accompanied
                     by two strong resonances. First of all, as a distributed organisation, the
                     DARIAH community was somewhat ahead of the curve in terms of moving to online
                     meetings. While the rest of the world seemed to be just discovering the joys of
                     “Zoom fatigue” and that seminal <span class="foreign i">cri de
                        coeur</span> of the virtual meeting “please mute your mic,” DARIAH
                     was already a heavy user of this platform since 2016, and had developed a robust
                     calendar balancing virtual and face-to-face interactions for its core and
                     peripheral team members so as to maximise the utility of each mode of
                     interaction. Watching the transformation of professional interaction from our
                     position of relative experience with virtual work made us uniquely sensitive to
                     the manner in which the blunt instrument of videoconferencing was suddenly
                     needing to be applied to nearly every human interaction, many of which had not
                     been imagined as use cases when the tools were designed. We were finding
                     ourselves in a period of the “virtual incunabular”
                     (drawing on the idea developed in [<a class="ref" href="#crane2006">Crane et al 2006</a>] of the “digital
                     incunabula”) where the usage of a new knowledge technology was being
                     applied according to the norms and affordances of an older one, and not always
                     with fully satisfactory results, a model alternatively referred to by [<a class="ref" href="#weinberg2020">Weinberg 2020</a>] as the “online insert” model.</div>
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">We were inspired not only by our observations of the incunabular, however, but
                     also by our sensitivity, honed by our engagement with the digital humanities, to
                     the research and exchange processes that our chosen event theme of “Scholarly Primitives” had made us so aware of. It was
                     an accepted truism that virtual interactions were impoverished and lacking, but
                     there was very little investigation of exactly what was missing and, as a
                     corollary, what functions could be easily transposed to the virtual format, and
                     what ones could not. Rather than merely accept or ignore these simplistic
                     insights, we decided instead to approach this question of efficient scholarly
                     communications as a research challenge, to be framed by the research question
                     how one might apply the concept of scholarly primitives to our communal, social
                     knowledge-creating and -sharing processes, breaking down the functions of the
                     scholarly meeting in the same way that Unsworth had with research processes. Our
                     central argument was that through such an application of canonical DH theory we
                     could better understand a different, but not unrelated, subset of our research
                     practices within the digital humanities, as well as to develop widely
                     transferable insight regarding the tactical use of virtual interactions that
                     might transcend the virtual incunabular. Had we not been long aware already of
                     the fact that we should be reconsidering our modes of interaction within the
                     research ecosystem in the light of climate change anyway, the late 2019/early
                     2020 rush of opinion pieces questioning academic conferences would have
                     certainly brought this to our minds (see for example [<a class="ref" href="#wolff2019">Wolff 2019</a>]
                     and [<a class="ref" href="#macdonald2020">Macdonald 2020</a>]), and, as these commentators also emphasised,
                     COVID-19 was our sudden and unwelcome, yet undeniably still fertile, opportunity
                     to participate in a grand experiment.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The experiment this positionality inspired us to undertake was centred on the
                     need to pivot our development of the physical event planned for May to a virtual
                     one, but this virtual event would seek to harness different interaction
                     paradigms from those we had thus far been considering. To do this we would draw
                     from scholarship on scholarly interaction and knowledge exchange, on carbon
                     neutral conferencing, but also pedagogical paradigms and the methodologies of
                     “critical making”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2011">Ratto 2011</a>]. With this event, which we eventually came to refer
                     to not as a conference but as a Virtual Exchange (VX) event, we would seek to
                     maximise audience engagement and interaction, minimise participant cognitive
                     load, foster serendipity and discovery, and deeply explore the human side of
                     what happens at scholarly meetings. What follows is an account of how the DARIAH
                     VX team theorised, built, lived and evaluated this attempt to play to the
                     strengths of the virtual scholarly meeting, and the lessons we learned in the

                        primitives</em>, described as “basic functions common
                     to scholarly activity across disciplines, over time, and independent of
                     theoretical orientation.”[<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2000">Unsworth 2000</a>] The immediate
                     intention underlying Unsworth’s explication of scholarly primitives was to
                     suggest some (recursive) functions of humanities scholarship that might be
                     usefully embodied in tool-building in humanities computing. Unsworth’s list
                     comprised seven discrete functions — discovering, annotating, comparing,
                     referring, sampling, illustrating and representing — with Unsworth further
                     noting that “referring” and “referencing” are the two true primitives, as they are in some way
                     related to all of the others.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">In an interview conducted in 2011, Unsworth reiterated the point that his list of
                     scholarly primitives was not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, in his initial
                     contribution he welcomed and encouraged debate on the subject. Indeed,
                     Unsworth’s approach of using scholarly primitives as a means of understanding
                     humanities’ research processes and building digital tools for scholarship in the
                     humanities has been, and continues to be, the subject of much discussion within

                     of that body of literature gives an overview of these trends. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In a 2009 report on the state of knowledge of scholarly information behaviour
                     compiled for the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), Carole Palmer and her
                     co-authors presented an adapted definition of Unsworth's concept of a primitive
                     “by emphasizing a sense of the primitive as something at
                     the base or beginning of a larger process”. This amended definition
                     was closely related to the authors’ concept of scholarly information activities
                     which emphasised “the explicit role of information in the
                     conduct of research and production of scholarship” (OCLC, 2009, 7).
                     Palmer et al. derived a framework of five core scholarly activities — searching,
                     collecting, reading, writing and collaborating — with two or more primitives
                     identified within these broader categories. Similar to the “true primitives” of Unsworth’s model, the authors also distinguish
                     four cross-cutting primitives that are related to at least two individual
                     scholarly activities. </div>

                     cyberinfrastructure initiative for the arts and humanities, published the
                     findings of a series of workshops held in 2008 with an international cohort of
                     digital humanities practitioners with the aim of charting “a
                     direction for cyberinfrastructure development in the humanities”
                     (2010:1). This report identifies thirteen themes of scholarly practice and the
                     authors of the report map the Bamboo themes to Unworth’s scholarly primitives
                     and Palmer et al.’s scholarly information activities [<a class="ref" href="#palmer2009">Palmer et al. 2009</a>]. In 2014, Annie Murray and Jared Wiercinski further developed this body of
                     research by supplementing it to better reflect the specific activities of
                     humanities scholars who work with audio formats [<a class="ref" href="#murray_wiercinski2014">Murray and Wiercinski 2014</a>]. Moreover, Murray and Wiercinski recommend
                     familiarity with the work of Unsworth, Palmer and Project Bamboo as the

                     DARIAH. During DARIAH’s preparatory phase, Sheila Anderson et al. combined the
                     related concepts of methodological commons and primitives “to map research work in arts and humanities e-Science, and to assist in
                     scoping the research infrastructure for the European project DARIAH”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2010">Anderson et al 2010</a>]. Lastly, in the context of this brief review of
                     the literature on scholarly primitives that informed and inspired the DARIAH VX,
                     the Scholarly Domain Model (SDM) proposed by the Digitised Manuscript to
                     Europeana (DM2E) project proposed to bridge the “practices
                     of humanist research approaches in both the analogue and digital
                     world” (DM2E 2015, 8-9). The SDM, which consists of four “different layers of abstraction” — Areas, Scholarly
                     Primitives, Scholarly Activities and Scholarly Operations — was based on the
                     assumption that an understanding of Unsworth’s Scholarly Primitives is
                     fundamental to any model of the scholarly domain (9). </div>

                     intentionally apply these frameworks in the specific context of scholarly
                     meetings, however. Our first exercise as a group, therefore, was to try to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">This results were in some ways not surprising: for example, some elements of a
                     scholarly meeting would inevitably map on to the traditional mechanisms for
                     formal scholarly communications (i.e. the registration, dissemination,
                     certification and archiving functions of scholarly publishing (c.f. Roosendaal
                     and Geerts et al., 1997 and Prosser, 2013, as cited in [<a class="ref" href="#vandeweel_praal2020">Van de Weel and Praal 2020</a>], 26). Other aspects seemed to recognise that
                     for the digital humanities at least, the shifting of traditional practices of
                     sole authorship and single scholarship to more collaborative modes of knowledge
                     co-creation [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2016">Edmond 2016</a>], were driving the scholarly exchange
                     space to be ever more an opportunity to also meet specific milestones for the
                     work of subgroups attending. Perhaps most interesting in the light of later
                     findings, however, was the large amount of space and time we could identify at
                     events that was dedicated to the development of informal networks and social
                     capital. This of course represents trends in the wider scholarly communications
                     ecosystem, but also a certain irony, given that the rise of printed periodicals
                     in the late 17th century was driven in large part as mechanism by which to
                     preserve ephemeral fragments of knowledge that tended to disappear after the
                     informal exchanges from which they originated [A. Fyfe, in Science Europe, 2019,

                     biases we might be inadvertently allowing overt influence over the event we
                     would design, namely a wider literature review and an effort to crowdsource
                     further input for our model from our event itself. To deliver on the first of
                     these, we sought out existing adjacent research literature to inform our
                     activities, in particular work on “Nearly Carbon Neutral” (NCN)
                     professional meetings was of great relevance for the questions it had been
                     asking about how and why we might meet in the future, albeit form a perspective
                     driven by environmental sustainability, rather than a global pandemic. Given its
                     connections to the DH community, the set of pre-publication blog posts and

                        Sustainable Research Practices in the Anthropocene</cite> (Rockwell et al,
                     forthcoming). In particular the taxonomy of “presences” developed there,
                     highlighting social, cognitive and leadership presences, as well as the space
                     where research agendae can be negotiated [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2020a">Rockwell et al 2020a</a>] provided
                     the DARIAH VX team with a perspective on the values of the scholarly meeting
                     that organised similar observations to our own according to a different

                     into the question of whether conferences facilitate collaboration. In spite what
                     one might see as a relatively narrow, STEM specific conceit underlying the
                     studies he cites (the measure of collaboration being a shared publication or
                     funding application within a relatively limited period of time) the results did
                     still provide a resounding confirmation of the vibrancy of interactions as a
                     facilitator for knowledge consolidation, with one study [<a class="ref" href="#boudreau2017">Boudreau et al 2017</a>] demonstrating that being in a randomly assigned
                     discussion room increased the probability of submitting a joint grant proposal
                     by 75%. On the other hand, as the author concluded, these studies all focussed
                     on face-to-face interaction itself, not in comparison with virtual alternatives. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Interestingly, we found that our conceptualisation of the virtual scholarly
                     meeting from the ground up led us to very different conclusions from some of the
                     existing literature. Two particular points of departure were the benefits of
                     asynchronicity as proposed by [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2020b">Rockwell et al 2020b</a>] and the capacity
                     for virtual meetings to be more inclusive (a benefit cited by [<a class="ref" href="#byrdforthcoming">Byrd forthcoming</a>]). On the former issue, while of course making
                     materials available in multiple formats provides some benefits, our analysis of
                     the social and intellectual processes involved in a scholarly meeting led us to
                     believe that it was precisely the informality and ephemerality of many of these
                     engagements that delivered the most value, and that enhancing their formal
                     aspects might achieve a different aim, but not perhaps the most crucial ones of
                     supporting openness and disruptive thinking and interaction. On the second
                     issue, while we would agree that anything that increases access to knowledge for
                     marginalised groups is a benefit, we saw strong threats possible that the
                     virtual could lower barriers in some ways only to raise them in others. This
                     could bring not only the impact of technical digital divides and time zones more
                     to the fore, but of course also make it more difficult to hear voices, such as
                     those of early career researchers, that might not come in to such a meeting
                     already confident or empowered. It could perhaps also perpetuate assumptions
                     that just because someone <em class="emph">can</em> log in to a meeting from their home
                     means that they <em class="emph">will</em> be afforded the time and space they need to
                     truly participate.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">The unprecedented times made us aware of a need to gather perspectives specific
                     to the current moment as well, however. We therefore decided that in the spirit
                     of inclusivity and engagement we wanted to place at the heart of the DARIAH VX
                     event, we would also solicit input from participants at the point of
                     registration as to what they felt the latent and manifest purposes of scholarly
                     meetings were, and what place these events held for them in the landscape of
                     inputs and opportunities they might have for personal and professional
                     development. In the registration form, we included two sets of questions. The
                     first question asked: “Please give us up to three of your
                     most important reasons for attending meetings with other
                     researchers.” We also asked, for each example, whether the person
                     felt that a given “primitive” was better served by the analogue context,
                     the virtual context, or both. The second information request was more open, and
                     designed to explore the anecdotal and emotional weight of scholarly meetings:
                     “Please share with us your strongest memory of a
                     scholarly meeting (positive or negative)”.</div>

                     from which we then extracted and aligned key terms with each other (as we had
                     not controlled the participant’s vocabulary) and with our enriched internally
                     defined set of functions. While the crowdsourced responses to the first question
                     did not contradict the initial framework, they did enrich it greatly, and
                     brought out a couple of key nuances, in particular the very strong weight given
                     to the informal, open-ended aspects of the interaction meetings enabled and fact
                     that these “people processes” were perceived to be far less well-served in
                     the virtual environment than those that supported the circulation of ideas.

                     content per se, was the overwhelming preponderance of strongly positive accounts
                     given in the personal anecdotes. With one exception, all of the responses to
                     this question related not just positive experiences, but very strongly positive

                     into the practicalities of setting the virtual stage for the synchronous event
                     also entailed making informed choices about the technology we relied on. The
                     enormous impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on IT infrastructures and especially
                     on online meeting services (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#abusaada_elshater2020">Abusaada and Elshater 2020</a>],
                     [<a class="ref" href="#zaveri2020">Zaveri 2020</a>]) made the ethical complexities inherent in their
                     use, acquisition and development, together with how exposed we were to them (see
                     e.g. discussed in [<a class="ref" href="#stoviac2020">Stoviac 2020</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#lau2020">Lau 2020</a>]) even
                     more malleable. Although many of us would have preferred an open source
                     alternative (particularly given some of Zoom’s privacy issues, see [<a class="ref" href="#doyle2020">Doyle et al 2020</a>]), we had to prioritise three core criteria at short
                     notice: reliable performance, rich functionality, and the degree of familiarity
                     of DARIAH communities with the tools in question. We also wanted to ensure we
                     followed best practices shared in our broader communities, such as the
                     experiences of the COPIM team with moving events online and setting up breakout
                     rooms the smoothest possible way [<a class="ref" href="#barnes2020">Barnes 2020</a>]. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">To keep a delicate balance between giving to our audience the richest possible
                     experience vs. avoiding cognitive overload in online meetings and learning
                     environments (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#costley2020">Costley et al 2020</a>]), we decided not to involve
                     external tools (e.g. Mentimeter, Miro, Mural etc.) but put the emphasis on
                     maximizing the potentials of Zoom (e.g. via using break out rooms, facilitating
                     exchange in different chat rooms, enabling the audience to share content etc.)
                     instead to facilitate serendipitous discussions of different sorts between and
                     across speakers, breakout chairs and the members of the audience. In doing so,
                     the help of technical facilitators was required. These support roles, forming
                     human bridges between the technical and people, included a technical coordinator
                     who was responsible for the overall smooth running of the online event (setting
                     up and tailoring the virtual environment to our needs, testing, managing
                     different contributor roles and enabling content sharing, setting up the break
                     out rooms and assigning people to them, supporting members of the audience with
                     connection problems or getting lost in the virtual spaces) and technical
                     facilitators (members of the DARIAH Central Office) in each breakout room. They
                     made sure that everyone arrived and felt comfortable in their breakout rooms and
                     also provided help with note taking (using the one additional tool we did allow
                     ourselves, Google documents). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">DARIAH’s well-established routine of conducting virtual scholarly meetings as
                     well as the best practices we incorporated in our technical set-up enabled the
                     smooth running of the synchronous event. However, it is worth mentioning three
                     specificities of online events as take-aways that are worth keeping in mind when
                     organizing future events. Firstly, we saw a significant difference between the
                     number of registrations to the event (with breakout room pre-assignments) versus
                     the actual participants. Although, a discrepancy in registrations and actual
                     online participation is common, it was a challenge to assign the sufficient
                     number of participants to all the seven breakout rooms. Secondly, enabling
                     small-group interactions in itself does not break down academic hierarchy. We
                     observed that not all the attendees researchers felt comfortable joining the
                     discussions in smaller breakout room settings, even with the encouraging and
                     sensible contributions of the breakout chairs. Thirdly, for these sessions to
                     work well, they need to be well staffed, and those contributors need to be well
                     briefed on their specific roles. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Although the preparation phase for this event was given particular attention, we
                     did not feel that any more than a two-hour event would be productive: one of the
                     greatest misunderstandings of the early days of day-long face-to-face meetings
                     being taken virtual was the assumption that an eight hour session in a room
                     could simply be replaced by a similar day of work online. Even within this
                     limited window, we felt that a variety of interaction types would be needed,
                     each no longer than 30 minutes. We therefore ultimately decided on a structure
                     composed of 1) an opening plenary; 2) breakout sessions; 3) a short break
                     followed by a presentation on presence and connection informed by a piece of
                     performing arts research we would commission; and 4) a closing plenary to share
                     the results of the break out groups and wrap up the event. In each of these
                     sessions, we were mindful of what we wanted not only the meeting, but also the
                     virtual medium to achieve, with the results as follows.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p27">Given the goal of the meeting to draw people together into a sense of having
                        experienced something communal, we felt that we would not be able to avoid
                        an opening plenary. The risk of this strategy, however, was that people
                        would fall too easily into the habits of large virtual meetings,
                        (over)stretching their cognitive capacities in a state that technology
                        consultant, Linda Stone, has named “Continuous Partial

                        [<a class="ref" href="#stone2009">Stone 2009</a>]. We therefore deployed a number of specific
                        measures within this block in order to maintain not just shreds of
                        attention, but engagement with the ideas and topics we were hoping to focus

                        record as possible of the event. Ultimately, we decided that having the

                        be allowed to exercise a potential chilling effect or over-formality on what

                        sessions. In-person conference exchanges are not traced and documented, and

                        of the participants to pause before the start of the session to take three
                        breaths with her. The idea of using this technique to open the programme was
                        suggested by the arts researcher on the programme committee, Courtney Grile,
                        as a way to bring an element of the shared physical grounding of the
                        face-to-face meeting - the tang of a particular floor cleaner, the waft of
                        an urn of coffee outside the door, the humidity on a rainy day, the shadows
                        through the windows on a sunny day - that we lose in virtual spaces. Breath
                        is a powerful centre point for creating a communal experience, but also had
                        a signalling function for us, indicating that it was our intention to
                        deliver an event that did not abide by the established heuristics by which
                        scholars generally navigate their meetings. </div>

                        Some of these were simple and general aspects of good virtual behaviour:
                        mute your microphone, turn off notifications to the extent you can, try to
                        keep your attention on the topic, if not on the presentation, be kind, be
                        generous, be empathetic. But we also used this phase to encourage what could
                        have been seen as a new social norm with a “rule-breaking” role, namely
                        that we encouraged the virtual version of chatting in the back of the
                        plenary room. We drew attention to the participants list and the chat
                        window, and explicitly encouraged people to take advantage of whatever back
                        channels they were comfortable with to reach out to fellow participants they
                        knew. For people who might be new to the community, we explicitly invited
                        them to make contact with one of three programme committee members (the
                        authors of this paper) whose role in that session was specifically to be
                        available for questions and informal conversation. The rationale for this
                        encouragement to not to pay attention to the plenary was twofold: first,
                        full attention was unlikely anyway but second, we wanted to try to emulate
                        the experience of what we referred to as “shared social listening,”
                        that communal experience of not just hearing the same words and processing
                        the same ideas at the same time, but of also weaving those words and ideas
                        into our own neural and social networks, the intellectual and relational
                        components of our professional identities.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p31">After these preliminaries, we moved to the opening plenary presentation of
                        what we wanted the event to achieve and what inspirations underpinned it. In
                        this session as well, however, the emphasis was on the communal experience
                        of knowledge creation, balancing aspects of our formal secondary literature
                        review with the insights from the registration process, described above.
                        This attempt to keep the focus on the knowledge of the group assembled,
                        rather than of the programme committee or of a small group of individuals
                        was continued in the closing plenary as well, which moved through four
                        stepping stones chosen to bring a sense of closure to the group and the
                        experience. </div>

                        format from the break-out discussions (see a description of this below); a
                        “reveal” of how our event had been conceptualised to meet the needs
                        the collected input led us to focus on; a brief report drawn from expert
                        input on the question of what the future technologies for virtual
                        interaction might hold (as provided in advance of the event by Professor
                        Sarah Kenderdine, a member of the DARIAH Scientific Advisory Board), and a
                        brief reflection on some of the lessons the DARIAH VX programme committee
                        felt they had learned in the course of developing the VX content and
                        structure. Recordings of these plenaries were added to the virtual
                        exhibition after the event so participants could re-visit them and reflect
                        upon any key moments or inspired thoughts they had. The advantage of digital
                        media is that participants could use the recordings as memory triggers for
                        any desired follow-up actions, which can be common outcomes after
                        non-virtual conferences. These recordings are available at: <a href="https://www.virtualexchange.dariah.eu/" onclick="window.open('https://www.virtualexchange.dariah.eu/'); return false" class="ref">https://www.virtualexchange.dariah.eu/</a>. </div>

                     impoverished in virtual meetings, The DARIAH VX would need to find some way to
                     encourage its participants to give themselves the time and space to prepare
                     their minds if the event was to be a success. In addition, we realised in our
                     preparations that what we could never recreate in a virtual space was the
                     situated, physical, embodied experiences and learning of the face-to-face
                     meeting, and thus. we had to think from an early moment of how we might bring in
                     an explicit conceptual element to our event to explore these aspects. DARIAH’s
                     position as an infrastructure for the arts as well as the humanities gives us a
                     broad community of practitioners, and no one knows better than theatre
                     practitioners the difference between live engagement and interactions mediated
                     by space, cameras and microphones as well as performing artists. Thus, we
                     engaged in a meta reflection of this through the Liveness Investigation. </div>

                        that all participants might engage with every single item on display. To
                        achieve this, a few different platforms were investigated, however, in order
                        to complete this in the limited time available and to keep it simple, it was
                        decided that a Wordpress.org based site was the most feasible and the layout

                        them (see Figures 5-7). For example, the Registration Desk offered lists of
                        fellow participants, practical information such as how to sign up to the
                        main Virtual Exchange event, and a programme of events. It also introduced
                        the organisation (DARIAH) and the team behind the event, and provided some
                        links relevant to the topic of Scholarly Primitives. The main auditorium,
                        renamed here as the Knowledge Exchange Space, had the items related to the
                        themes of the live event grouped thematically, sometimes overlapping, or
                        offering different perspectives on similar topics. Finally came the Coffee
                        Break Space that encouraged interaction and allowed for less formal
                        discussions around the themes of the event (including the participant
                        anecdotes and COVID-19). The Coffee Break section of the virtual exhibition

                        most prominent latent purposes of scholarly meetings, referencing
                        interpersonal connections and a sense of space and place with links to
                        various audio-visual experiences elsewhere on the internet. This included a
                        Spotify playlist compiled by members of the DARIAH Coordination Office, who
                        are themselves dispersed across Europe and offer a wide selection of
                        idiosyncratic musical tastes, and a place to upload a “deskie” photo
                        that would allow participants to share images of their participation spaces

                        was something they needed to “complete”) finding new perspectives on
                        the theme of the Virtual Exchange. There was discussion among the programme
                        committee as to whether we should include a “floor plan” that listed
                        all the items on offer, or whether it would be best to allow participants to
                        discover things for themselves, in an “easter egg” style. Ultimately we
                        decided to keep the sense of serendipitous discovery by not providing this
                        floor plan. Additional challenges in creating this space lay in the
                        decisions around which items best fit into which spaces, and identifying at
                        what point we might start imposing our own biases on the pathways people
                        could take through the exhibition and risk removing the sense of accidental
                        discovery that we wanted to achieve. As ever, knowledge organisation and
                        asset curation is a challenge, so we made sure to flag very clearly to
                        participants the status of these resources as “prompts and
                        provocations” rather than a complete, fully theorised, scholarly
                        collection. A full list of the assets in the Virtual Exhibition appears in

                        practice. While many theatre arts practitioners have begun to play with new
                        technologies in order to adapt and bring them into arts practice, the
                        COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated innovation and rethinking of how it might
                        be possible to practice the craft in an online setting. Within applied drama
                        praxis, with its focus on embodiment and collaboration, the tools of
                        drama/theatre were specifically utilised in the DARIAH VX event in order to
                        explore ideas and create dialogue amongst participants. The collective
                        knowledge that is generated through this process relies on participants’
                        absorption and interpretation of information through their entire being: all
                        of their senses, body, mind, and feelings/emotions. How is this altered when
                        it is moved into a completely online space? What might be gained? What might
                        be lost?</div>

                        for this DARIAH VX event sought to explore this topic as a meta reflection
                        through a presentation and discussion of a piece of research that compared
                        two instances of theatrical collaboration with the same format and
                        participants, but delivered ten years apart. The first collaboration was
                        conducted in a physical space that was captured during the development of a
                        2011 project entitled “The Other F Word”, and
                        then again with the same participants in a virtual space. The presentation
                        to the DARIAH VX participants also included the reflections from the “The Other F Word” workshop participants on the
                        adaptation from an in-person setting to an online one, and of the project
                        leaders.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p39">The biggest takeaway from this exploration for the participants and the
                        Artist-Researcher who facilitated it was the understanding that moving the
                        practice online created something new, with new possibilities. Many elements
                        of connection that manifest when sharing physical space, such as nuanced
                        nonverbal communication (especially eye contact) and kinetic information
                        relayed through placement, proxemics, and direction were largely lost in the
                        online space. The in-person “machines”, which were made up of small
                        groups of live performing artists, allowed for each contributor to build
                        upon what the previous person had offered. The creative process for working
                        in shared physical space allowed for deeper co-creation and collaboration
                        intrinsically during the act of creation. This is in contrast with the
                        “machines” that were created online being much more of a collage of
                        individual contributions to the ideas offered (such as the “love
                        machine” or “hate machine”). The online creative process was
                        marked by most individuals responding on their own to create within a kind
                        of vacuum — with the collaboration and meaning-making actually coming
                        afterward in the workshop reflection in which there was an attempt to create
                        understanding about the machine as a whole. The online practice showed signs
                        of potentially further empowering participants to contribute more personal,
                        individualised responses, however.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p40">In light of these discoveries, what becomes clear is that the format
                        (in-person or online) which will be most conducive for a meeting, workshop,
                        or gathering depends on the purpose and goals of the gathering. If it is
                        crucial to build a sense of community and co-create contemporaneously, then
                        an in-person setting would be ideal. However, if it is crucial to allow
                        space for each participant to act individually, then an online platform may
                        well be optimal for highlighting that endeavour. The nature of these
                        differences, and the manner in which technological affordances might be
                        modified in order to be more focussed on certain kinds of interaction
                        defined in these terms, is still largely unexplored. While a great deal more
                        remains to be explored in this area, it feels necessary to encourage a
                        “both/and” way of moving forward with in-person and online
                        gatherings rather than an “either/or” model when it becomes available
                        post-COVID. Insights from this exploration were further integrated into the
                        DARIAH VX event through the inclusion of a small breathing exercise informed
                        by applied drama praxis. The exercise was shown to be effective in
                        generating a feeling of connectedness in online spaces and was incorporated
                        after the comfort break during the exchange session. The Prezi and videos of

                     in small groups last 30 minutes, and were designed as opportunities to make
                     connections based on common interests and share ideas. Each session was
                     supported by a DARIAH VX organising team member, a chair, a support person who
                     served as rapporteur of the discussions and one or two presenters who opened the
                     discussion with some thought-provoking ideas in a rapid five-minute
                     presentations. The Zoom platform breakout groups function was used to move
                     participants to/from the small group which was pre-selected based on shared
                     interests stated in the pre-attendance questionnaire. Participants were also
                     informed that the sessions would not be recorded and that we had set up shared
                     documents for each group in which they could keep a record of their discussion. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">Each of the seven breakout sessions focussed on some facet of academic
                     conferences, in-person versus virtual, and the impacts these formats have in
                     terms of travel, sustainability, and ability and methods for researcher
                     collaborations, and were designed to provide participants with a chance to
                     emulate the informal discussions that happen in the hallways after conference
                     presentations or at the coffee station, rather than more formal question and
                     answer discussions after a 15-20 minute presentation from each speaker. The
                     breakout sessions were 30 minutes long and participants were pre-divided into
                     groups of less than 10 people each, to ensure the potential for real discussion.
                     The breakout sessions were not recorded but the rapporteur took notes in a
                     shared Google document that all session participants could view and contribute
                     to. Across the seven sessions, four main themes of conversation emerged which
                     were: (1) navigating personal and professional spaces, (2) technical and
                     financial practicalities, (3) methods of communication, and (4) academic
                     status.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">In terms of navigating personal and professional spaces, breakout session
                     participants discussed how working from home during COVID-19 has created greater
                     challenges in separating the formal workspace and time from leisure and family
                     time in the home. Academics may try to multitask during online conferences, but
                     they need to explicitly block out time for virtual conferences as they would
                     when travelling for an in-person conference. The physical separation of
                     colleagues during COVID-19 had made people more conscious about connecting with
                     those whom they would normally meet informally without making specific plans.
                     This extended to the casual relationship building that happens at in-person
                     conferences when new people meet professionally, but serendipitously form
                     friendships through the collective experience of listening to presentations and
                     participating in the social and cultural activities. The consensus was that
                     virtual conferences and meetings could be most useful for people who have
                     already met and established a working relationship, but that establishing this
                     rapport was more difficult to build online when meeting someone for the first
                     time.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">The second theme that arose in discussions surrounded the technical and financial
                     considerations for virtual conferences and meetings. Zoom had emerged as the
                     most popular platform among academics, and video calls often lasted between one
                     to two hours. However, Zoom calls can be exhausting because they take more
                     mental effort to carefully consider what you say since you are in a
                     “performance-like” situation. There can also be a multitude of possible
                     environmental distractions, including the background views of individuals’
                     personal spaces, and if two people are meeting for the first time on Zoom, these
                     distractions could be considered unprofessional by the other person due to the
                     lack of a pre-existing relationship. If Zoom calls are recorded, it often
                     results in modified behaviours of participants. There have also been technical
                     and security issues with some virtual calls as well as data protection issues,
                     which in some cases resulted in weakened trust. It was noted that funding would
                     be needed to have technical support for large virtual conference calls, which
                     may also have smaller breakout sessions, in order to permit conversations and
                     presentations to flow without interruption.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">In regards to methods of communication, some key differences were highlighted
                     between in-person and virtual conferences. DARIAH VX participants noted that
                     sometimes it can be difficult to read people’s body language when online. Tone
                     of voice alone is not always the best way to understand colleagues or conference
                     participants. Another person said that they can become distracted by seeing
                     their own face and background during a video call. Each academic community,
                     whether it be at an annual conference or the specific disciplinary conventions,
                     has different styles and expectations for presentations and interactions, but
                     across the board, it was noted that ability to digitally access and share
                     content is very important to virtual academic exchanges. Issues of inclusion
                     were very much on the minds of the DARIAH participants as well: the presence of
                     a moderator or chair is often needed for larger groups to ensure each voice is
                     heard and that those with questions or comments from the “audience” get the
                     chance to speak up. In addition, as when many in-person academic conferences are
                     in English, linguistic marginalisation can flatten diversity in the discussions
                     and the academic discipline more generally, a situation only intensified by the
                     impoverishment of online communications. One possible solution offered was to
                     include slides in another language to allow for better communication to those
                     who may not speak or understand English as their primary language. This would
                     allow them to get more out of the presentation/content if they can follow along
                     in their first language. Finally, it can be difficult to connect with another
                     scholar/participant until they give their presentation, as the ability to
                     discuss ideas flows easier after one hears about the other’s interests in more
                     detail. Collaboration often relies on serendipity, but social distancing has
                     drained much of the serendipity out of our professional lives, with everything
                     needing to be scheduled and social media offering an active space for
                     connection, but one in which diversity, complexity and context might be
                     diminished. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p48">The final theme that emerged in the discussions was the role of hierarchies and
                     status in academia in relation to attending and playing specific roles in
                     conferences. For example, flying to conferences confers status, yet this culture
                     needs to change for academia to be more inclusive of those who cannot get
                     university funding to travel to exchange knowledge. Another consideration is the
                     limited discussions on academic methods and practice. Early-career researchers
                     may fear that publishing or speaking about their “failures” or methods that
                     did not produce fruitful research results could have negative consequences for
                     their academic career. On the contrary, in a situation where status or
                     reputation is already assured, it is easier to talk about research shortcomings
                     one has experienced. Without discussing or sharing “failures” scholarship
                     can fail to move forward, with other scholars making the same mistakes because
                     nobody has documented a similar attempt that did not work. A solution that was
                     offered was that if one scholar does not want to bear the weight of
                     “failure” alone, they could discuss or publish it as a collective group
                     or write in other venues like on social media.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">The difference in terms of the keynote speakers versus PhD candidates and the
                     lack of informal conversations between senior and early career scholars is a gap
                     at virtual conferences that some felt in-person conferences were perhaps far
                     better able to facilitate, though not without the investment needed to break
                     down barriers. Thoughts on whether a better model could be developed in the
                     virtual context was an exciting opportunity to explore. People, after all, are
                     the focus of collaboration: we do not work with institutions, we work with each
                     other. Even while there may be an enduring valorisation of the solitary scholar,
                     there is also a generation of scholars who recognise that we often work better
                     together.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p50">These break-out sessions offered the participants opportunities not only to
                     explore the themes of the workshop, and put them into the context of their own
                     words and experiences, but also to connect their current experiences to their
                     wider personal and professional lives. In particular topics like hierarchies,
                     dealing with failures, isolation and mental health, and inclusiveness cut to the
                     heart of not just how we might as a community of scholars navigate the “new
                     normal,” but also how we might use this moment to improve conditions of
                     the preexisting state of scholarly communities. Many of these topics were not
                     specific to digital humanities, and yet the context and many of the connections
                     made, such as the role of collaboration and the tensions between cultural and
                     communicative signals and the technology that mediated them, most certainly
                     were.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">The DARIAH VX approach to reporting back from the plenaries also reflected our
                     intention to use the opportunity of the COVID-19 forced change in format as an
                     opportunity to rethink the format of the scholarly meeting at a higher level.
                     The group shared a certain frustration with the level of engagement that tended
                     to be accorded to the mechanisms of sharing break-out discussions with a
                     plenary, while also recognising their important role as a social buffer between
                     larger and smaller groups. We therefore asked each group to provide back to the
                     plenary five keywords that reflected central points of their discussion, one
                     challenge statement and one opportunity statement. These inputs were included in
                     the slides for the final plenary, where they were presented and connections
                     between them drawn out, without the opportunity for a longer discussion. The
                     results of this exercise appear in Appendix 2.</div>

                     answers from participants but also presenters in the various sessions and
                     organisers. In the end, thirteen people completed the survey and overall they
                     valued positively the event and their participation. Although there was the low
                     response rate, as is also common in optional post-event surveys and not a
                     statistically authoritative sample, it was indicative of another observed
                     phenomenon of the pandemic period, namely a certain virtual activity fatigue and
                     there were enough strong trends in the responses to merit some concluding
                     reflections here.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">One of the aims of the event was to encourage informal conversations happening in
                     the background, in parallel to the event, either in social media or in the chat.
                     This was also stressed in the opening keynote, as discussed above. Conferences
                     are great networking opportunities, places to meet colleagues and friends but
                     also make new acquaintances and start new collaborations. Encouraging people to
                     replicate this in the virtual event was again an aspect we hoped to experiment
                     with, to see if we could improve upon the current average standard for this
                     online. In the respective question in the follow up survey (a true/false
                     response to the statement “the event helped me to broaden my scholarly networks
                     and make new contacts”) the answers were very diverse. Despite the fact that
                     people did feel part of a community during the event (nine positive responses),
                     most of them were not able to network and start new discussions/collaborations
                     in the background. </div>

                     hosted in the virtual exhibition made a very positive buzz on social media and
                     in particular Twitter (the Twitter moment for the event can be found here:
                     https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12528-020-09254-y). Researchers and
                     projects following the event through Twitter or indeed participating in the
                     DARIAH VX had very positive remarks to share about the experimental approach,
                     take away messages and new terminology emerging with this new virtual space for
                     interaction, the need for conferences and why they are vital to a researcher’s
                     work. These responses also included more informal and personal information, such
                     as images of their home offices and reflections on how they adapted to the new
                     situation. With a feeling of “we are in this together”, the DARIAH VX
                     created a virtual space of sharing scholarly notions, expressing personal
                     remarks and concerns on the future of conferences, traveling, research and the
                     scholarly profession that was greatly appreciated and was in some way comforting
                     at a time when no physical contact was possible. Providing such an opportunity
                     for personal connection, transcending our disciplines and institutions, may have
                     been in fact one of the most important and telling contributions of the DARIAH

                     scholarly interaction online as resources to hone our virtual and face-to-face
                     meetings. In the realm of written scholarly communications, we are observing a
                     sea change in the rise of informal outlets for sharing scholarly knowledge.
                     While we still may have a long way to go toward protecting this knowledge (in
                     every sense), a better understanding of the interplay between formal and
                     informal layers of scholarship can also improve our practices of meeting.</div>

                     groups, so as to “seed” rich experiences and empathetic responses while
                     still respecting the nomadic nature of knowledge (as already proposed by Fraser,
                     et al., 2017) The DARIAH VX “Liveness Investigation” made clear the
                     essential role of presence in supporting empathy, attention and engagement, but
                     it also asked the question of how much presence we need: is it enough to have a
                     small group around you, to model the kind of trustful, attentive and mindful
                     attitude we should generally approach our scholarly meetings with? Could
                     technology that enabled certain things currently lost, such as “real” eye
                     contact, make a difference?</div>

                     There is incredible tech out there, but for every collaborator you may have who
                     is dedicated to one platform or another, there is another for whom that new
                     tools may present an annoyance, at least, or barrier at worst, in terms of

                     the scholarly primitive to our interactions rather than our research processes
                     also yielded fruitful and interesting results, bearing out our hypothesis that
                     digital humanities could learn and contribute greater precision to the
                     contemporary debates about how we might optimally adjust to post-incunabular
                     virtual meeting practices. This builds from the foundation where the arts and
                     cultural heritage took an early leadership position in driving social
                     innovations to soften the force of fear and isolation. Cultural heritage
                     institutions from across the world transcended their usual user engagement
                     strategies to innovate and plan virtual paths that would, in the first instance,
                     showcase their content and artifacts and, in the second, make culture a
                     comforting place for people to retreat to and learn from. The challenge of
                     maintaining human contact within and across virtual spaces presented an
                     opportunity and an imperative to understand the art in our science. A recent
                     consideration of art and AI comes to the conclusion that:</div>

                        <p>… art emerged as a way for our Pleistocene ancestors to
                           strengthen their social ties and social status. For example, art can serve
                           as gifts, as fitness signals for mating, and as displays of status and
                           tribal affiliation. In each role, the fundamental purpose of art is to
                           affect peoples' relationships with each other, where the relationships are
                           themselves important.</p>

                     need to: people, however, do. And while people do also need to create scientific
                     knowledge, they can’t do this without the communities, contexts and interactions
                     that nurture their minds, bodies and souls. Let us hope that we can find
                     creative ways to usher in new forms of scholarly meetings that combine the
                     incentives of both science and art.</div>
