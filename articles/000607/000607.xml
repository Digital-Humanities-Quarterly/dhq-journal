            <dhq:abstract>
                <p>This article documents the theoretical and practical considerations underpinning
                    the COVID-19-inspired digital humanities event: <title rend="quotes">The
                        Scholarly Primitives of Scholarly Meetings.</title>  Drawing from both the
                    long tradition of work on scholarly primitives as well as the rush of new work
                    that appeared in the early months of 2020, the event described here was designed
                    as both an exercise in critical making and a response to the constraints of the
                    virtual incunabular state so many organisations found themselves in, attempting
                    to recreate their planned face-to-face meetings in virtual formats without due
                    consideration of the affordances and constraints of each context. As a
                    structurally distributed organisation, the DARIAH European Research
                    Infrastructure as event host was able to bring its experience of virtual
                    interaction to the recosideration of these challenges, but also the sensitivity
                    to research processes and practices that is central to our positioning in the
                    digital humanities.  As such, the resulting model for a virtual event, realised
                    in May 2020 and described in this paper, was built upon a very self-conscious
                    set of considerations, meta-reflection, and goals regarding what we might
                    tacitly and could expect from a virtual event.  The instruments designed to
                    deliver this, as well as their performance in practice, is documented alongside
                    consideration of what lessons the experience delivers about both virtual
                    meetings and more generally about the interactions of scholarly communities.</p>

                <p>In March 2020, the DARIAH ERIC, a pan-European research infrastructure for the
                    arts and humanities, was deeply engaged in the planning for their May annual
                    event, but this annual event had to be postponed and ultimately moved online due
                    to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. For DARIAH, however, we did not
                    want to lose the opportunity to share knowledge and exchange ideas in our usual
                    vibrant format. Our position within digital humanities and the meta-relation to
                    our chosen event theme of <title rend="quotes">Scholarly Primitives</title> made
                    us hyperaware that virtual interactions were impoverished and lacking. However,
                    there was little investigation of exactly what functions could be easily
                    transposed into the virtual format and which ones could not. With this event,
                    which we referred to not as a conference but as a Virtual Exchange (VX) event,
                    would seek to maximise audience engagement and interaction, minimise participant
                    cognitive load, foster serendipity and discovery, and specifically explore the
                    human side of what happens at in-person versus online scholarly meetings. This
                    field report details how the DARIAH VX team theorised, built, lived and
                    evaluated the strengths of the virtual scholarly meeting through the contextual
                    lens of <title rend="quotes">Scholarly Primitives</title> and how future online
                    events could learn from and apply these strategies and specific practices.</p>

                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>In March 2020, the DARIAH ERIC, a pan-European research infrastructure for the
                    arts and humanities, was deeply engaged in the planning for their May annual
                    event, putting final touches on its three-day schedule of papers, panels,
                    posters and meetings featuring reflections on the twentieth anniversary of the
                    publication of John Unsworth’s seminal paper on the <title rend="quotes"
                        >Scholarly Primitives</title> of humanities research. And then, suddenly, we
                    weren’t.</p>
                <p>Like so many other events in 2020, the DARIAH Annual Event had to be postponed
                    and ultimately moved online due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. For DARIAH,
                    however, the difficult process of coming to terms with losing our opportunity to
                    share knowledge and exchange ideas in our usual vibrant format was accompanied
                    by two strong resonances. First of all, as a distributed organisation, the
                    DARIAH community was somewhat ahead of the curve in terms of moving to online
                    meetings. While the rest of the world seemed to be just discovering the joys of
                        <q>Zoom fatigue</q> and that seminal <foreign xml:lang="fr">cri de
                        coeur</foreign> of the virtual meeting <q>please mute your mic,</q> DARIAH
                    was already a heavy user of this platform since 2016, and had developed a robust
                    calendar balancing virtual and face-to-face interactions for its core and
                    peripheral team members so as to maximise the utility of each mode of
                    interaction. Watching the transformation of professional interaction from our
                    position of relative experience with virtual work made us uniquely sensitive to
                    the manner in which the blunt instrument of videoconferencing was suddenly
                    needing to be applied to nearly every human interaction, many of which had not
                    been imagined as use cases when the tools were designed. We were finding
                    ourselves in a period of the <quote rend="inline">virtual incunabular</quote>
                    (drawing on the idea developed in Crane et.al, 2006 of the <q>digital
                        incunabula</q>) where the usage of a new knowledge technology was being
                    applied according to the norms and affordances of an older one, and not always
                    with fully satisfactory results, a model alternatively referred to by (Weinberg,
                    2020) as the <q>online insert</q> model.</p>

                <p>We were inspired not only by our observations of the incunabular, however, but
                    also by our sensitivity, honed by our engagement with the digital humanities, to
                    the research and exchange processes that our chosen event theme of <title
                        rend="quotes">Scholarly Primitives</title> had made us so aware of. It was
                    an accepted truism that virtual interactions were impoverished and lacking, but
                    there was very little investigation of exactly what was missing and, as a
                    corollary, what functions could be easily transposed to the virtual format, and
                    what ones could not. Rather than merely accept or ignore these simplistic
                    insights, we decided instead to approach this question of efficient scholarly
                    communications as a research challenge, to be framed by the research question
                    how one might apply the concept of scholarly primitives to our communal, social
                    knowledge-creating and -sharing processes, breaking down the functions of the
                    scholarly meeting in the same way that Unsworth had with research processes. Our
                    central argument was that through such an application of canonical DH theory we
                    could better understand a different, but not unrelated, subset of our research
                    practices within the digital humanities, as well as to develop widely
                    transferable insight regarding the tactical use of virtual interactions that
                    might transcend the virtual incunabular. Had we not been long aware already of
                    the fact that we should be reconsidering our modes of interaction within the
                    research ecosystem in the light of climate change anyway, the late 2019/early
                    2020 rush of opinion pieces questioning academic conferences would have
                    certainly brought this to our minds (see for example Wolff, 2019 and Macdonald,
                    2020), and, as these commentators also emphasised, COVID-19 was our sudden and
                    unwelcome, yet undeniably still fertile, opportunity to participate in a grand
                    experiment.</p>

                <p>The experiment this positionality inspired us to undertake was centred on the
                    need to pivot our development of the physical event planned for May to a virtual
                    one, but this virtual event would seek to harness different interaction
                    paradigms from those we had thus far been considering. To do this we would draw
                    from scholarship on scholarly interaction and knowledge exchange, on carbon
                    neutral conferencing, but also pedagogical paradigms and the methodologies of
                        <quote rend="inline">critical making</quote> [Ratto, 2011]. With this event,
                    which we eventually came to refer to not as a conference but as a Virtual
                    Exchange (VX) event, we would seek to maximise audience engagement and
                    interaction, minimise participant cognitive load, foster serendipity and
                    discovery, and deeply explore the human side of what happens at scholarly
                    meetings. What follows is an account of how the DARIAH VX team theorised, built,
                    lived and evaluated this attempt to play to the strengths of the virtual
                    scholarly meeting, and the lessons we learned in the process.</p>

                <head>Informing a novel approach to scholarly meetings: Primitives, NCN Events and
                    beyond.</head>
                <p>In 2000, John Unsworth presented a tentative list of <term>scholarly
                        primitives</term>, described as <quote rend="inline">basic functions common
                        to scholarly activity across disciplines, over time, and independent of
                        theoretical orientation.</quote> The immediate intention underlying
                    Unsworth’s explication of scholarly primitives was to suggest some (recursive)
                    functions of humanities scholarship that might be usefully embodied in
                    tool-building in humanities computing. Unsworth’s list comprised seven discrete
                    functions — discovering, annotating, comparing, referring, sampling,
                    illustrating and representing — with Unsworth further noting that <quote
                        rend="inline">referring</quote> and <quote rend="inline">referencing</quote>
                    are the two true primitives, as they are in some way related to all of the
                    others.</p>
                <p>In an interview conducted in 2011, Unsworth reiterated the point that his list of
                    scholarly primitives was not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, in his initial
                    contribution he welcomed and encouraged debate on the subject. Indeed,
                    Unsworth’s approach of using scholarly primitives as a means of understanding
                    humanities’ research processes and building digital tools for scholarship in the
                    humanities has been, and continues to be, the subject of much discussion within
                    the fields of Digital Humanities and Information Sciences. The following sample
                    of that body of literature gives an overview of these trends. </p>
                <p>In a 2009 report on the state of knowledge of scholarly information behaviour
                    compiled for the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), Carole Palmer and her
                    co-authors presented an adapted definition of Unsworth's concept of a primitive
                        <quote rend="inline">by emphasizing a sense of the primitive as something at
                        the base or beginning of a larger process</quote>. This amended definition
                    was closely related to the authors’ concept of scholarly information activities
                    which emphasised <quote rend="inline">the explicit role of information in the
                        conduct of research and production of scholarship</quote> (OCLC, 2009, 7).
                    Palmer et al. derived a framework of five core scholarly activities — searching,
                    collecting, reading, writing and collaborating — with two or more primitives
                    identified within these broader categories. Similar to the <quote rend="inline"
                        >true primitives</quote> of Unsworth’s model, the authors also distinguish
                    four cross-cutting primitives that are related to at least two individual
                    scholarly activities. </p>
                <p>The following year, the US-based Project Bamboo (2008-2012), a
                    cyberinfrastructure initiative for the arts and humanities, published the
                    findings of a series of workshops held in 2008 with an international cohort of
                    digital humanities practitioners with the aim of charting <quote rend="inline">a
                        direction for cyberinfrastructure development in the humanities</quote>
                    (2010:1). This report identifies thirteen themes of scholarly practice and the
                    authors of the report map the Bamboo themes to Unworth’s scholarly primitives
                    and Palmer et al.’s scholarly information activities (Palmer et al. 2009). In
                    2014, Annie Murray and Jared Wiercinski further developed this body of research
                    by supplementing it to better reflect the specific activities of humanities
                    scholars who work with audio formats (2014). Moreover, Murray and Wiercinski
                    recommend familiarity with the work of Unsworth, Palmer and Project Bamboo as
                    the foundation for an evidence-based design methodology for building digital
                    tools for humanities scholars.</p>
                <p>Unsworth’s Scholarly Primitives had been highly influential in the context of
                    DARIAH. During DARIAH’s preparatory phase, Sheila Anderson et al. combined the
                    related concepts of methodological commons and primitives <quote rend="inline"
                        >to map research work in arts and humanities e-Science, and to assist in
                        scoping the research infrastructure for the European project DARIAH</quote>
                    (Anderson et al. 2010, 3785). Lastly, in the context of this brief review of the
                    literature on scholarly primitives that informed and inspired the DARIAH VX, the
                    Scholarly Domain Model (SDM) proposed by the Digitised Manuscript to Europeana
                    (DM2E) project proposed to bridge the <quote rend="inline">practices of humanist
                        research approaches in both the analogue and digital world</quote> [DM2E
                    2015, 8-9]. The SDM, which consists of four <quote rend="inline">different
                        layers of abstraction</quote> — Areas, Scholarly Primitives, Scholarly
                    Activities and Scholarly Operations — was based on the assumption that an
                    understanding of Unsworth’s Scholarly Primitives is fundamental to any model of
                    the scholarly domain (9). </p>
                <p>This long tradition of discourse and practice in the theory and application of
                    scholarly primitives did not necessarily prepare the DARIAH group (later to
                    become the VX Event Programme Committee, the authors of this paper) to
                    intentionally apply these frameworks in the specific context of scholarly
                    meetings, however. Our first exercise as a group, therefore, was to try to
                    translate the various components of a typical scholarly meeting into their
                    functions (the results of which are summarised in Figure 1).</p>
                <p>This results were in some ways not surprising: for example, some elements of a
                    scholarly meeting would inevitably map on to the traditional mechanisms for
                    formal scholarly communications (i.e. the registration, dissemination,
                    certification and archiving functions of scholarly publishing (c.f. Roosendaal
                    and Geerts et al., 1997 and Prosser, 2013, as cited in van der Weel and Praal,
                    2020, 26). Other aspects seemed to recognise that for the digital humanities at
                    least, the shifting of traditional practices of sole authorship and single
                    scholarship to more collaborative modes of knowledge co-creation [Edmond, 2015],
                    were driving the scholarly exchange space to be ever more an opportunity to also
                    meet specific milestones for the work of subgroups attending. Perhaps most
                    interesting in the light of later findings, however, was the large amount of
                    space and time we could identify at events that was dedicated to the development
                    of informal networks and social capital. This of course represents trends in the
                    wider scholarly communications ecosystem, but also a certain irony, given that
                    the rise of printed periodicals in the late 17th century was driven in large
                    part as mechanism by which to preserve ephemeral fragments of knowledge that
                    tended to disappear after the informal exchanges from which they originated [A.
                    Fyfe, in Science Europe, 2019, 9].</p>
                <p>We were able to apply two further measures to attempt to check any unconscious
                    biases we might be inadvertently allowing overt influence over the event we
                    would design, namely a wider literature review and an effort to crowdsource
                    further input for our model from our event itself. To deliver on the first of
                    these, we sought out existing adjacent research literature to inform our
                    activities, in particular work on <q>Nearly Carbon Neutral</q> (NCN)
                    professional meetings was of great relevance for the questions it had been
                    asking about how and why we might meet in the future, albeit form a perspective
                    driven by environmental sustainability, rather than a global pandemic. Given its
                    connections to the DH community, the set of pre-publication blog posts and
                    releases for the collection <title rend="italic">Right Research: Modelling
                        Sustainable Research Practices in the Anthropocene</title> (Rockwell et al,
                    forthcoming). In particular the taxonomy of <q>presences</q> developed there,
                    highlighting social, cognitive and leadership presences, as well as the space
                    where research agendae can be negotiated [Rockwell et al., 2020] provided the
                    DARIAH VX team with a perspective on the values of the scholarly meeting that
                    organised similar observations to our own according to a different organising
                    principle. </p>
                <p>Clancy (2020) provides an excellent review of research across a number of fields
                    into the question of whether conferences facilitate collaboration. In spite what
                    one might see as a relatively narrow, STEM specific conceit underlying the
                    studies he cites (the measure of collaboration being a shared publication or
                    funding application within a relatively limited period of time) the results did
                    still provide a resounding confirmation of the vibrancy of interactions as a
                    facilitator for knowledge consolidation, with one study [Boudreau et al., 2017]
                    demonstrating that being in a randomly assigned discussion room increased the
                    probability of submitting a joint grant proposal by 75%. On the other hand, as
                    the author concluded, these studies all focussed on face-to-face interaction
                    itself, not in comparison with virtual alternatives. </p>
                <p>Interestingly, we found that our conceptualisation of the virtual scholarly
                    meeting from the ground up led us to very different conclusions from some of the
                    existing literature. Two particular points of departure were the benefits of
                    asynchronicity (as proposed by Rockwell et al, 2020) and the capacity for
                    virtual meetings to be more inclusive (a benefit cited by Nick Byrd, 2020). On
                    the former issue, while of course making materials available in multiple formats
                    provides some benefits, our analysis of the social and intellectual processes
                    involved in a scholarly meeting led us to believe that it was precisely the
                    informality and ephemerality of many of these engagements that delivered the
                    most value, and that enhancing their formal aspects might achieve a different
                    aim, but not perhaps the most crucial ones of supporting openness and disruptive
                    thinking and interaction. On the second issue, while we would agree that
                    anything that increases access to knowledge for marginalised groups is a
                    benefit, we saw strong threats possible that the virtual could lower barriers in
                    some ways only to raise them in others. This could bring not only the impact of
                    technical digital divides and time zones more to the fore, but of course also
                    make it more difficult to hear voices, such as those of early career
                    researchers, that might not come in to such a meeting already confident or
                    empowered. It could perhaps also perpetuate assumptions that just because
                    someone <emph>can</emph> log in to a meeting from their home means that they
                        <emph>will</emph> be afforded the time and space they need to truly
                    participate.</p>
                <p>The unprecedented times made us aware of a need to gather perspectives specific
                    to the current moment as well, however. We therefore decided that in the spirit
                    of inclusivity and engagement we wanted to place at the heart of the DARIAH VX
                    event, we would also solicit input from participants at the point of
                    registration as to what they felt the latent and manifest purposes of scholarly
                    meetings were, and what place these events held for them in the landscape of
                    inputs and opportunities they might have for personal and professional
                    development. In the registration form, we included two sets of questions. The
                    first question asked: <quote rend="inline">Please give us up to three of your
                        most important reasons for attending meetings with other
                        researchers.</quote> We also asked, for each example, whether the person
                    felt that a given <q>primitive</q> was better served by the analogue context,
                    the virtual context, or both. The second information request was more open, and
                    designed to explore the anecdotal and emotional weight of scholarly meetings:
                        <quote rend="inline">Please share with us your strongest memory of a
                        scholarly meeting (positive or negative)</quote>.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, 85 people registered for the event and filled in this information,
                    from which we then extracted and aligned key terms with each other (as we had
                    not controlled the participant’s vocabulary) and with our enriched internally
                    defined set of functions. While the crowdsourced responses to the first question
                    did not contradict the initial framework, they did enrich it greatly, and
                    brought out a couple of key nuances, in particular the very strong weight given
                    to the informal, open-ended aspects of the interaction meetings enabled and fact
                    that these <q>people processes</q> were perceived to be far less well-served in
                    the virtual environment than those that supported the circulation of ideas.
                    These responses were distilled into the following visualisation in Figure 2.</p>
                <!-- how do I encode tables?-->
                <p>What was perhaps more interesting and surprising for its intensity, if not its
                    content per se, was the overwhelming preponderance of strongly positive accounts
                    given in the personal anecdotes. With one exception, all of the responses to
                    this question related not just positive experiences, but very strongly positive
                    ones, deeply personal and often life-changing. An extract of some of the common
                    terms appearing in this corpus is as follows in Figure 3.</p>
                <!-- figure 3 not here, possibly in OJS -->
                <p>This led us to conclude that while the manifest purpose of scholarly meetings
                    might well be achieved in a number of ways, the latent purpose of building
                    careers, friendships and professional identities was not only present, but
                    exceptionally strong.</p>

                <p>Mapping the above considerations about the scholarly primitives of online events
                    into the practicalities of setting the virtual stage for the synchronous event
                    also entailed making informed choices about the technology we relied on. The
                    enormous impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on IT infrastructures and especially
                    on online meeting services (see e.g. Abusaada and Elshater 2020, Zaveri 2020)
                    made the ethical complexities inherent in their use, acquisition and
                    development, together with how exposed we were to them (see e.g. discussed in
                    Stoviac 2020, Lau 2020) even more malleable. Although many of us would have
                    preferred an open source alternative (particularly given some of Zoom’s privacy
                    issues, see Doyle et al., 2020), we had to prioritise three core criteria at
                    short notice: reliable performance, rich functionality, and the degree of
                    familiarity of DARIAH communities with the tools in question. We also wanted to
                    ensure we followed best practices shared in our broader communities, such as the
                    experiences of the COPIM team with moving events online and setting up breakout
                    rooms the smoothest possible way (Barnes 2020). </p>
                <p>To keep a delicate balance between giving to our audience the richest possible
                    experience vs. avoiding cognitive overload in online meetings and learning
                    environments (see e.g. Costley 2020), we decided not to involve external tools
                    (e.g. Mentimeter, Miro, Mural etc.) but put the emphasis on maximizing the
                    potentials of Zoom (e.g. via using break out rooms, facilitating exchange in
                    different chat rooms, enabling the audience to share content etc.) instead to
                    facilitate serendipitous discussions of different sorts between and across
                    speakers, breakout chairs and the members of the audience. In doing so, the help
                    of technical facilitators was required. These support roles, forming human
                    bridges between the technical and people, included a technical coordinator who
                    was responsible for the overall smooth running of the online event (setting up
                    and tailoring the virtual environment to our needs, testing, managing different
                    contributor roles and enabling content sharing, setting up the break out rooms
                    and assigning people to them, supporting members of the audience with connection
                    problems or getting lost in the virtual spaces) and technical facilitators
                    (members of the DARIAH Central Office) in each breakout room. They made sure
                    that everyone arrived and felt comfortable in their breakout rooms and also
                    provided help with note taking (using the one additional tool we did allow
                    ourselves, Google documents). </p>
                <p>DARIAH’s well-established routine of conducting virtual scholarly meetings as
                    well as the best practices we incorporated in our technical set-up enabled the
                    smooth running of the synchronous event. However, it is worth mentioning three
                    specificities of online events as take-aways that are worth keeping in mind when
                    organizing future events. Firstly, we saw a significant difference between the
                    number of registrations to the event (with breakout room pre-assignments) versus
                    the actual participants. Although, a discrepancy in registrations and actual
                    online participation is common, it was a challenge to assign the sufficient
                    number of participants to all the seven breakout rooms. Secondly, enabling
                    small-group interactions in itself does not break down academic hierarchy. We
                    observed that not all the attendees researchers felt comfortable joining the
                    discussions in smaller breakout room settings, even with the encouraging and
                    sensible contributions of the breakout chairs. Thirdly, for these sessions to
                    work well, they need to be well staffed, and those contributors need to be well
                    briefed on their specific roles. </p>

                <head> B. Structuring the synchronous event for community building </head>
                <p>Although the preparation phase for this event was given particular attention, we
                    did not feel that any more than a two-hour event would be productive: one of the
                    greatest misunderstandings of the early days of day-long face-to-face meetings
                    being taken virtual was the assumption that an eight hour session in a room
                    could simply be replaced by a similar day of work online. Even within this
                    limited window, we felt that a variety of interaction types would be needed,
                    each no longer than 30 minutes. We therefore ultimately decided on a structure
                    composed of 1) an opening plenary; 2) breakout sessions; 3) a short break
                    followed by a presentation on presence and connection informed by a piece of
                    performing arts research we would commission; and 4) a closing plenary to share
                    the results of the break out groups and wrap up the event. In each of these
                    sessions, we were mindful of what we wanted not only the meeting, but also the
                    virtual medium to achieve, with the results as follows.</p>
                <div>
                    <head> Opening and closing plenaries </head>
                    <p>Given the goal of the meeting to draw people together into a sense of having
                        experienced something communal, we felt that we would not be able to avoid
                        an opening plenary. The risk of this strategy, however, was that people
                        would fall too easily into the habits of large virtual meetings,
                        (over)stretching their cognitive capacities in a state that technology
                        consultant, Linda Stone, has named <quote rend="inline">Continuous Partial
                            Attention</quote> [Stone, 2009]. We therefore deployed a number of
                        specific measures within this block in order to maintain not just shreds of
                        attention, but engagement with the ideas and topics we were hoping to focus
                        on. </p>
                    <p>Firstly, we considered the impact that recording the event may have on the
                        comfort level of participants to exchange semi-formally. The plenaries were
                        the only sessions we recorded, in spite of our desire to have as full a
                        record as possible of the event. Ultimately, we decided that having the
                        comprehensive record that technology <emph>could</emph> give us should not
                        be allowed to exercise a potential chilling effect or over-formality on what
                        the participants <emph>would</emph> give us, particularly in the breakout
                        sessions. In-person conference exchanges are not traced and documented, and
                        the DARIAH VX Event aimed to promote the freedom of the ephemeral.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the plenary moderator (DARIAH Director, Jennifer Edmond) asked all
                        of the participants to pause before the start of the session to take three
                        breaths with her. The idea of using this technique to open the programme was
                        suggested by the arts researcher on the programme committee, Courtney Grile,
                        as a way to bring an element of the shared physical grounding of the
                        face-to-face meeting - the tang of a particular floor cleaner, the waft of
                        an urn of coffee outside the door, the humidity on a rainy day, the shadows
                        through the windows on a sunny day - that we lose in virtual spaces. Breath
                        is a powerful centre point for creating a communal experience, but also had
                        a signalling function for us, indicating that it was our intention to
                        deliver an event that did not abide by the established heuristics by which
                        scholars generally navigate their meetings. </p>
                    <p>Thirdly, we laid the desired foundation for how we wanted people participate.
                        Some of these were simple and general aspects of good virtual behaviour:
                        mute your microphone, turn off notifications to the extent you can, try to
                        keep your attention on the topic, if not on the presentation, be kind, be
                        generous, be empathetic. But we also used this phase to encourage what could
                        have been seen as a new social norm with a <q>rule-breaking</q> role, namely
                        that we encouraged the virtual version of chatting in the back of the
                        plenary room. We drew attention to the participants list and the chat
                        window, and explicitly encouraged people to take advantage of whatever back
                        channels they were comfortable with to reach out to fellow participants they
                        knew. For people who might be new to the community, we explicitly invited
                        them to make contact with one of three programme committee members (the
                        authors of this paper) whose role in that session was specifically to be
                        available for questions and informal conversation. The rationale for this
                        encouragement to not to pay attention to the plenary was twofold: first,
                        full attention was unlikely anyway but second, we wanted to try to emulate
                        the experience of what we referred to as <q>shared social listening,</q>
                        that communal experience of not just hearing the same words and processing
                        the same ideas at the same time, but of also weaving those words and ideas
                        into our own neural and social networks, the intellectual and relational
                        components of our professional identities.</p>
                    <p>After these preliminaries, we moved to the opening plenary presentation of
                        what we wanted the event to achieve and what inspirations underpinned it. In
                        this session as well, however, the emphasis was on the communal experience
                        of knowledge creation, balancing aspects of our formal secondary literature
                        review with the insights from the registration process, described above.
                        This attempt to keep the focus on the knowledge of the group assembled,
                        rather than of the programme committee or of a small group of individuals
                        was continued in the closing plenary as well, which moved through four
                        stepping stones chosen to bring a sense of closure to the group and the
                        experience. </p>
                    <p>The closing included an efficient, open and thought-provoking reporting
                        format from the break-out discussions (see a description of this below); a
                            <q>reveal</q> of how our event had been conceptualised to meet the needs
                        the collected input led us to focus on; a brief report drawn from expert
                        input on the question of what the future technologies for virtual
                        interaction might hold (as provided in advance of the event by Professor
                        Sarah Kenderdine, a member of the DARIAH Scientific Advisory Board), and a
                        brief reflection on some of the lessons the DARIAH VX programme committee
                        felt they had learned in the course of developing the VX content and
                        structure. Recordings of these plenaries were added to the virtual
                        exhibition after the event so participants could re-visit them and reflect
                        upon any key moments or inspired thoughts they had. The advantage of digital
                        media is that participants could use the recordings as memory triggers for
                        any desired follow-up actions, which can be common outcomes after
                        non-virtual conferences. These recordings are available at: <ref

                <head> C. Serendipity and the prepared mind: The Virtual Exhibition &amp; Liveness
                    Investigation </head>
                <p>If engagement, serendipity, discovery and connection all seemed to be
                    impoverished in virtual meetings, The DARIAH VX would need to find some way to
                    encourage its participants to give themselves the time and space to prepare
                    their minds if the event was to be a success. In addition, we realised in our
                    preparations that what we could never recreate in a virtual space was the
                    situated, physical, embodied experiences and learning of the face-to-face
                    meeting, and thus. we had to think from an early moment of how we might bring in
                    an explicit conceptual element to our event to explore these aspects. DARIAH’s
                    position as an infrastructure for the arts as well as the humanities gives us a
                    broad community of practitioners, and no one knows better than theatre
                    practitioners the difference between live engagement and interactions mediated
                    by space, cameras and microphones as well as performing artists. Thus, we
                    engaged in a meta reflection of this through the Liveness Investigation. </p>
                <div>
                    <head>The Virtual Exhibition</head>
                    <p>The intention behind the exhibition was to recreate the sense of anticipation
                        and serendipity in knowledge acquisition that one achieves through
                        conference attendance by creating a <foreign>Wunderkammer</foreign> of
                        resources: offering multiple routes to different items, with no expectation
                        that all participants might engage with every single item on display. To
                        achieve this, a few different platforms were investigated, however, in order
                        to complete this in the limited time available and to keep it simple, it was
                        decided that a Wordpress.org based site was the most feasible and the layout
                        allowed for the serendipitous discovery. </p>
                    <p>The structure of the virtual exhibition was informed by the most common
                        spaces found at face-to-face meetings, and the information one may find in
                        them (see Figures 5-7). For example, the Registration Desk offered lists of
                        fellow participants, practical information such as how to sign up to the
                        main Virtual Exchange event, and a programme of events. It also introduced
                        the organisation (DARIAH) and the team behind the event, and provided some
                        links relevant to the topic of Scholarly Primitives. The main auditorium,
                        renamed here as the Knowledge Exchange Space, had the items related to the
                        themes of the live event grouped thematically, sometimes overlapping, or
                        offering different perspectives on similar topics. Finally came the Coffee
                        Break Space that encouraged interaction and allowed for less formal
                        discussions around the themes of the event (including the participant
                        anecdotes and COVID-19). The Coffee Break section of the virtual exhibition
                        also included resources intended to invoke, if not truly serve, some of the
                        most prominent latent purposes of scholarly meetings, referencing
                        interpersonal connections and a sense of space and place with links to
                        various audio-visual experiences elsewhere on the internet. This included a
                        Spotify playlist compiled by members of the DARIAH Coordination Office, who
                        are themselves dispersed across Europe and offer a wide selection of
                        idiosyncratic musical tastes, and a place to upload a <q>deskie</q> photo
                        that would allow participants to share images of their participation spaces
                        with the wider group. </p>

                    <p>These three elements within the Virtual Exhibition allowed participants to
                        spend as much or as little time as they wanted (without making them feel it
                        was something they needed to <q>complete</q>) finding new perspectives on
                        the theme of the Virtual Exchange. There was discussion among the programme
                        committee as to whether we should include a <q>floor plan</q> that listed
                        all the items on offer, or whether it would be best to allow participants to
                        discover things for themselves, in an <q>easter egg</q> style. Ultimately we
                        decided to keep the sense of serendipitous discovery by not providing this
                        floor plan. Additional challenges in creating this space lay in the
                        decisions around which items best fit into which spaces, and identifying at
                        what point we might start imposing our own biases on the pathways people
                        could take through the exhibition and risk removing the sense of accidental
                        discovery that we wanted to achieve. As ever, knowledge organisation and
                        asset curation is a challenge, so we made sure to flag very clearly to
                        participants the status of these resources as <q>prompts and
                            provocations</q> rather than a complete, fully theorised, scholarly
                        collection. A full list of the assets in the Virtual Exhibition appears in

                    <head> The Liveness Investigation: An arts-based response </head>
                    <p>The ideas of liveness and co-presence are inextricably linked with drama
                        practice. While many theatre arts practitioners have begun to play with new
                        technologies in order to adapt and bring them into arts practice, the
                        COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated innovation and rethinking of how it might
                        be possible to practice the craft in an online setting. Within applied drama
                        praxis, with its focus on embodiment and collaboration, the tools of
                        drama/theatre were specifically utilised in the DARIAH VX event in order to
                        explore ideas and create dialogue amongst participants. The collective
                        knowledge that is generated through this process relies on participants’
                        absorption and interpretation of information through their entire being: all
                        of their senses, body, mind, and feelings/emotions. How is this altered when
                        it is moved into a completely online space? What might be gained? What might
                        be lost?</p>
                    <p>In the spirit of <q>show me, don’t tell me</q> (a mantra of theatre educators
                        around the globe), the <q>Liveness Investigation</q> created specifically
                        for this DARIAH VX event sought to explore this topic as a meta reflection
                        through a presentation and discussion of a piece of research that compared
                        two instances of theatrical collaboration with the same format and
                        participants, but delivered ten years apart. The first collaboration was
                        conducted in a physical space that was captured during the development of a
                        2011 project entitled <title rend="quotes">The Other F Word</title>, and
                        then again with the same participants in a virtual space. The presentation
                        to the DARIAH VX participants also included the reflections from the <title
                            rend="quotes">The Other F Word</title> workshop participants on the
                        adaptation from an in-person setting to an online one, and of the project
                        leaders.</p>
                    <p>The biggest takeaway from this exploration for the participants and the
                        Artist-Researcher who facilitated it was the understanding that moving the
                        practice online created something new, with new possibilities. Many elements
                        of connection that manifest when sharing physical space, such as nuanced
                        nonverbal communication (especially eye contact) and kinetic information
                        relayed through placement, proxemics, and direction were largely lost in the
                        online space. The in-person <q>machines</q>, which were made up of small
                        groups of live performing artists, allowed for each contributor to build
                        upon what the previous person had offered. The creative process for working
                        in shared physical space allowed for deeper co-creation and collaboration
                        intrinsically during the act of creation. This is in contrast with the
                            <q>machines</q> that were created online being much more of a collage of
                        individual contributions to the ideas offered (such as the <q>love
                            machine</q> or <q>hate machine</q>). The online creative process was
                        marked by most individuals responding on their own to create within a kind
                        of vacuum — with the collaboration and meaning-making actually coming
                        afterward in the workshop reflection in which there was an attempt to create
                        understanding about the machine as a whole. The online practice showed signs
                        of potentially further empowering participants to contribute more personal,
                        individualised responses, however.</p>
                    <p>In light of these discoveries, what becomes clear is that the format
                        (in-person or online) which will be most conducive for a meeting, workshop,
                        or gathering depends on the purpose and goals of the gathering. If it is
                        crucial to build a sense of community and co-create contemporaneously, then
                        an in-person setting would be ideal. However, if it is crucial to allow
                        space for each participant to act individually, then an online platform may
                        well be optimal for highlighting that endeavour. The nature of these
                        differences, and the manner in which technological affordances might be
                        modified in order to be more focussed on certain kinds of interaction
                        defined in these terms, is still largely unexplored. While a great deal more
                        remains to be explored in this area, it feels necessary to encourage a
                            <q>both/and</q> way of moving forward with in-person and online
                        gatherings rather than an <q>either/or</q> model when it becomes available
                        post-COVID. Insights from this exploration were further integrated into the
                        DARIAH VX event through the inclusion of a small breathing exercise informed
                        by applied drama praxis. The exercise was shown to be effective in
                        generating a feeling of connectedness in online spaces and was incorporated
                        after the comfort break during the exchange session. The Prezi and videos of
                        the Liveness Investigation can be found here:

                <p>The breakout sessions in the DARIAH VX event were included as a way to encourage
                    engagement and connection among participants on topics that are not commonly
                    appearing in the research-output focused programmes of in-person conference. The
                    same registration form that solicited their input about events and primitives
                    was also used to recruit presentations and to identify and cluster their
                    interests resulting in seven breakout session themes, titled as follows:</p>

                </p>
                <p>Participants were informed before the sessions that discussion would take place
                    in small groups last 30 minutes, and were designed as opportunities to make
                    connections based on common interests and share ideas. Each session was
                    supported by a DARIAH VX organising team member, a chair, a support person who
                    served as rapporteur of the discussions and one or two presenters who opened the
                    discussion with some thought-provoking ideas in a rapid five-minute
                    presentations. The Zoom platform breakout groups function was used to move
                    participants to/from the small group which was pre-selected based on shared
                    interests stated in the pre-attendance questionnaire. Participants were also
                    informed that the sessions would not be recorded and that we had set up shared
                    documents for each group in which they could keep a record of their discussion. </p>
                <p>Each of the seven breakout sessions focussed on some facet of academic
                    conferences, in-person versus virtual, and the impacts these formats have in
                    terms of travel, sustainability, and ability and methods for researcher
                    collaborations, and were designed to provide participants with a chance to
                    emulate the informal discussions that happen in the hallways after conference
                    presentations or at the coffee station, rather than more formal question and
                    answer discussions after a 15-20 minute presentation from each speaker. The
                    breakout sessions were 30 minutes long and participants were pre-divided into
                    groups of less than 10 people each, to ensure the potential for real discussion.
                    The breakout sessions were not recorded but the rapporteur took notes in a
                    shared Google document that all session participants could view and contribute
                    to. Across the seven sessions, four main themes of conversation emerged which
                    were: (1) navigating personal and professional spaces, (2) technical and
                    financial practicalities, (3) methods of communication, and (4) academic
                    status.</p>
                <p>In terms of navigating personal and professional spaces, breakout session
                    participants discussed how working from home during COVID-19 has created greater
                    challenges in separating the formal workspace and time from leisure and family
                    time in the home. Academics may try to multitask during online conferences, but
                    they need to explicitly block out time for virtual conferences as they would
                    when travelling for an in-person conference. The physical separation of
                    colleagues during COVID-19 had made people more conscious about connecting with
                    those whom they would normally meet informally without making specific plans.
                    This extended to the casual relationship building that happens at in-person
                    conferences when new people meet professionally, but serendipitously form
                    friendships through the collective experience of listening to presentations and
                    participating in the social and cultural activities. The consensus was that
                    virtual conferences and meetings could be most useful for people who have
                    already met and established a working relationship, but that establishing this
                    rapport was more difficult to build online when meeting someone for the first
                    time.</p>
                <p>The second theme that arose in discussions surrounded the technical and financial
                    considerations for virtual conferences and meetings. Zoom had emerged as the
                    most popular platform among academics, and video calls often lasted between one
                    to two hours. However, Zoom calls can be exhausting because they take more
                    mental effort to carefully consider what you say since you are in a
                        <q>performance-like</q> situation. There can also be a multitude of possible
                    environmental distractions, including the background views of individuals’
                    personal spaces, and if two people are meeting for the first time on Zoom, these
                    distractions could be considered unprofessional by the other person due to the
                    lack of a pre-existing relationship. If Zoom calls are recorded, it often
                    results in modified behaviours of participants. There have also been technical
                    and security issues with some virtual calls as well as data protection issues,
                    which in some cases resulted in weakened trust. It was noted that funding would
                    be needed to have technical support for large virtual conference calls, which
                    may also have smaller breakout sessions, in order to permit conversations and
                    presentations to flow without interruption.</p>
                <p>In regards to methods of communication, some key differences were highlighted
                    between in-person and virtual conferences. DARIAH VX participants noted that
                    sometimes it can be difficult to read people’s body language when online. Tone
                    of voice alone is not always the best way to understand colleagues or conference
                    participants. Another person said that they can become distracted by seeing
                    their own face and background during a video call. Each academic community,
                    whether it be at an annual conference or the specific disciplinary conventions,
                    has different styles and expectations for presentations and interactions, but
                    across the board, it was noted that ability to digitally access and share
                    content is very important to virtual academic exchanges. Issues of inclusion
                    were very much on the minds of the DARIAH participants as well: the presence of
                    a moderator or chair is often needed for larger groups to ensure each voice is
                    heard and that those with questions or comments from the <q>audience</q> get the
                    chance to speak up. In addition, as when many in-person academic conferences are
                    in English, linguistic marginalisation can flatten diversity in the discussions
                    and the academic discipline more generally, a situation only intensified by the
                    impoverishment of online communications. One possible solution offered was to
                    include slides in another language to allow for better communication to those
                    who may not speak or understand English as their primary language. This would
                    allow them to get more out of the presentation/content if they can follow along
                    in their first language. Finally, it can be difficult to connect with another
                    scholar/participant until they give their presentation, as the ability to
                    discuss ideas flows easier after one hears about the other’s interests in more
                    detail. Collaboration often relies on serendipity, but social distancing has
                    drained much of the serendipity out of our professional lives, with everything
                    needing to be scheduled and social media offering an active space for
                    connection, but one in which diversity, complexity and context might be
                    diminished. </p>
                <p>The final theme that emerged in the discussions was the role of hierarchies and
                    status in academia in relation to attending and playing specific roles in
                    conferences. For example, flying to conferences confers status, yet this culture
                    needs to change for academia to be more inclusive of those who cannot get
                    university funding to travel to exchange knowledge. Another consideration is the
                    limited discussions on academic methods and practice. Early-career researchers
                    may fear that publishing or speaking about their <q>failures</q> or methods that
                    did not produce fruitful research results could have negative consequences for
                    their academic career. On the contrary, in a situation where status or
                    reputation is already assured, it is easier to talk about research shortcomings
                    one has experienced. Without discussing or sharing <q>failures</q> scholarship
                    can fail to move forward, with other scholars making the same mistakes because
                    nobody has documented a similar attempt that did not work. A solution that was
                    offered was that if one scholar does not want to bear the weight of
                        <q>failure</q> alone, they could discuss or publish it as a collective group
                    or write in other venues like on social media.</p>
                <p>The difference in terms of the keynote speakers versus PhD candidates and the
                    lack of informal conversations between senior and early career scholars is a gap
                    at virtual conferences that some felt in-person conferences were perhaps far
                    better able to facilitate, though not without the investment needed to break
                    down barriers. Thoughts on whether a better model could be developed in the
                    virtual context was an exciting opportunity to explore. People, after all, are
                    the focus of collaboration: we do not work with institutions, we work with each
                    other. Even while there may be an enduring valorisation of the solitary scholar,
                    there is also a generation of scholars who recognise that we often work better
                    together.</p>
                <p>These break-out sessions offered the participants opportunities not only to
                    explore the themes of the workshop, and put them into the context of their own
                    words and experiences, but also to connect their current experiences to their
                    wider personal and professional lives. In particular topics like hierarchies,
                    dealing with failures, isolation and mental health, and inclusiveness cut to the
                    heart of not just how we might as a community of scholars navigate the <q>new
                        normal,</q> but also how we might use this moment to improve conditions of
                    the preexisting state of scholarly communities. Many of these topics were not
                    specific to digital humanities, and yet the context and many of the connections
                    made, such as the role of collaboration and the tensions between cultural and
                    communicative signals and the technology that mediated them, most certainly
                    were.</p>
                <p>The DARIAH VX approach to reporting back from the plenaries also reflected our
                    intention to use the opportunity of the COVID-19 forced change in format as an
                    opportunity to rethink the format of the scholarly meeting at a higher level.
                    The group shared a certain frustration with the level of engagement that tended
                    to be accorded to the mechanisms of sharing break-out discussions with a
                    plenary, while also recognising their important role as a social buffer between
                    larger and smaller groups. We therefore asked each group to provide back to the
                    plenary five keywords that reflected central points of their discussion, one
                    challenge statement and one opportunity statement. These inputs were included in
                    the slides for the final plenary, where they were presented and connections
                    between them drawn out, without the opportunity for a longer discussion. The
                    results of this exercise appear in Appendix 2.</p>
                <p>This method had the benefit of allowing the discussions to be seen from an almost
                        <q>distant reading</q> point of view, while also not increasing potential
                    cognitive load on participants with a session of reports that could easily have
                    run long or lacked structure. </p>

                <head>Evaluating the DARIAH VX Experience</head>
                <p>As the DARIAH VX came to an end, the programme committee gathered again to
                    discuss and evaluate the event as an experience both for us as organisers, but
                    also for the audience participating and following the event through social
                    media. What was their experience and how did this compare to ours? Was the event
                    considered meaningful and useful? Had we succeeded in creating an engaging
                    virtual experience? Soon after the event, we launched a post-event survey to
                    capture these reactions and opinions. This survey consisted of eleven multiple
                    choice and three open questions and was left open for two weeks. It welcomed
                    answers from participants but also presenters in the various sessions and
                    organisers. In the end, thirteen people completed the survey and overall they
                    valued positively the event and their participation. Although there was the low
                    response rate, as is also common in optional post-event surveys and not a
                    statistically authoritative sample, it was indicative of another observed
                    phenomenon of the pandemic period, namely a certain virtual activity fatigue and
                    there were enough strong trends in the responses to merit some concluding
                    reflections here.</p>

                    reflections here.</p>
                <p>One of the aims of the event was to encourage informal conversations happening in
                    the background, in parallel to the event, either in social media or in the chat.
                    This was also stressed in the opening keynote, as discussed above. Conferences
                    are great networking opportunities, places to meet colleagues and friends but
                    also make new acquaintances and start new collaborations. Encouraging people to
                    replicate this in the virtual event was again an aspect we hoped to experiment
                    with, to see if we could improve upon the current average standard for this
                    online. In the respective question in the follow up survey (a true/false
                    response to the statement “the event helped me to broaden my scholarly networks
                    and make new contacts”) the answers were very diverse. Despite the fact that
                    people did feel part of a community during the event (nine positive responses),
                    most of them were not able to network and start new discussions/collaborations
                    in the background. </p>
                <p>The whole event, its innovative approach and the rich collection of sources
                    hosted in the virtual exhibition made a very positive buzz on social media and
                    in particular Twitter (the Twitter moment for the event can be found here:
                    https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12528-020-09254-y). Researchers and
                    projects following the event through Twitter or indeed participating in the
                    DARIAH VX had very positive remarks to share about the experimental approach,
                    take away messages and new terminology emerging with this new virtual space for
                    interaction, the need for conferences and why they are vital to a researcher’s
                    work. These responses also included more informal and personal information, such
                    as images of their home offices and reflections on how they adapted to the new
                    situation. With a feeling of <q>we are in this together</q>, the DARIAH VX
                    created a virtual space of sharing scholarly notions, expressing personal
                    remarks and concerns on the future of conferences, traveling, research and the
                    scholarly profession that was greatly appreciated and was in some way comforting
                    at a time when no physical contact was possible. Providing such an opportunity
                    for personal connection, transcending our disciplines and institutions, may have
                    been in fact one of the most important and telling contributions of the DARIAH
                    VX.</p>

                <head>Conclusions</head>
                <p>The DARIAH VX was an exercise in both theorising a new kind of virtual scholarly
                    meeting based upon a scholarly primitives approach, and, simultaneously,
                    building an exemplary event to demonstrate how such a new paradigm might be
                    enacted. While it may therefore have only cast some tentative first seeds on
                    this broad field for experimentation and consideration, we can certainly propose
                    some of the following as key learnings and points for future work to begin from
                    in the consideration of the future of scholarly meetings:</p>
                <p>The DARIAH VX was an exercise in both theorising a new kind of virtual scholarly

                    building an exemplary event to demonstrate how such a new paradigm might be
                    enacted. While it may therefore have only cast some tentative first seeds on
                    this broad field for experimentation and consideration, we can certainly propose
                    some of the following as key learnings and points for future work to begin from
                    in the consideration of the future of scholarly meetings:</p>
                <p>First, we need to better harness the explosion of accepted paradigms for informal
                    scholarly interaction online as resources to hone our virtual and face-to-face
                    meetings. In the realm of written scholarly communications, we are observing a
                    sea change in the rise of informal outlets for sharing scholarly knowledge.
                    While we still may have a long way to go toward protecting this knowledge (in
                    every sense), a better understanding of the interplay between formal and
                    informal layers of scholarship can also improve our practices of meeting.</p>
                <p>Second, we need to still gather people, e.g. in small, virtually connected
                    groups, so as to <q>seed</q> rich experiences and empathetic responses while
                    still respecting the nomadic nature of knowledge (as already proposed by Fraser,
                    et al., 2017) The DARIAH VX <q>Liveness Investigation</q> made clear the
                    essential role of presence in supporting empathy, attention and engagement, but
                    it also asked the question of how much presence we need: is it enough to have a
                    small group around you, to model the kind of trustful, attentive and mindful
                    attitude we should generally approach our scholarly meetings with? Could
                    technology that enabled certain things currently lost, such as <q>real</q> eye
                    contact, make a difference?</p>
                <p>Third, we need to use mobility more deftly, holistically, mindfully and evenly,
                    making it accessible in ways that don’t simply introduce new and different
                    barriers. Better thinking is needed on how to improve access to knowledge
                    exchange opportunities across the board for non-native English listeners,
                    caregivers, participants in non- or less privileged power hierarchy positions
                    such as Early Career Researchers, not to mention people with disabilities, slow
                    or unreliable broadband, or any number of other challenges to participation.</p>
                <p>Fourth, we need interaction technologies to get us beyond the skeuomorphic
                    facsimiles of meetings that we have to become spaces of productive interaction.
                    There is incredible tech out there, but for every collaborator you may have who
                    is dedicated to one platform or another, there is another for whom that new
                    tools may present an annoyance, at least, or barrier at worst, in terms of
                    learning curve, bandwidth or screen management.</p>
                <p>The DARIAH experiment in applying the very central digital humanities paradigm of
                    the scholarly primitive to our interactions rather than our research processes
                    also yielded fruitful and interesting results, bearing out our hypothesis that
                    digital humanities could learn and contribute greater precision to the
                    contemporary debates about how we might optimally adjust to post-incunabular
                    virtual meeting practices. This builds from the foundation where the arts and
                    cultural heritage took an early leadership position in driving social
                    innovations to soften the force of fear and isolation. Cultural heritage
                    institutions from across the world transcended their usual user engagement
                    strategies to innovate and plan virtual paths that would, in the first instance,
                    showcase their content and artifacts and, in the second, make culture a
                    comforting place for people to retreat to and learn from. The challenge of
                    maintaining human contact within and across virtual spaces presented an
                    opportunity and an imperative to understand the art in our science. A recent
                    consideration of art and AI comes to the conclusion that:</p>
                <p><quote rend="block">… art emerged as a way for our Pleistocene ancestors to
                        strengthen their social ties and social status. For example, art can serve
                        as gifts, as fitness signals for mating, and as displays of status and
                        tribal affiliation. In each role, the fundamental purpose of art is to
                        affect peoples' relationships with each other, where the relationships are
                        themselves important.</quote> (Hertzmann, 2020)</p>
                <p>Hertzmann’s ultimate conclusion is that computers can create art, but they don’t
                    need to: people, however, do. And while people do also need to create scientific
                    knowledge, they can’t do this without the communities, contexts and interactions
                    that nurture their minds, bodies and souls. Let us hope that we can find
                    creative ways to usher in new forms of scholarly meetings that combine the
                    incentives of both science and art.</p>
