            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>For the field of game history to mature, and for game studies more broadly to
               function in a scholarly manner in the coming decades, one necessity will be
               improvement of game citation practices. Current practices have some obvious problems,
               such as a lack of standardization even within the same journal or book series. But a
               more pressing problem is disguised by the field’s youth: Common citation practices
               depend on the play experiences and cultural knowledge of a generation of game studies
               scholars and readers who are largely old enough to have lived through the eras they
               are discussing. More sustainable and precise alternatives cannot fall back on the
               tools available for fixed media — such as the direct quotations and page numbers used
               for books or the screenshots (of images that appear to all viewers) and timecode used
               for video. Instead, this essay imagines an alternative approach, working in the
               digital humanities traditions of speculative collections and tool-based
               argumentation. In the speculative future we present, there are scholarly collections
               of software, as well as tools available for citing software states and integrating
               these citations into scholarly arguments. A working prototype of such a tool is
               presented, together with examples of scholarly use and the results of an evaluation
               of the concept with game scholars.</p>

            <head>1 The Changing Archive</head>
            <p>As many institutions contemplate migrating their software collections to digital
               repositories and expanding their born-digital holdings, scholars find new
               opportunities and use cases that leverage these records’ born-digital nature. At the
               same time, as recent surveys of the digital humanist landscape make abundantly clear,
               the future of historical scholarship will be tied to reconciling past, print-based,
               qualitative practices with newer, networked, quantitative ones [Borgman 2007; Owens
               2020; Siemens 2006; Svensson 2015; Warwick 2012]. The meaning of the historical
               archive is changing, and the ways to enable and maximize its exploration must also
               adapt.</p>
            <p>We provide in this article a way forward for the particular case of scholarship in
               video game history — by designing new means for historical citation, reference, and
               source retrieval. As we discuss below, these new means support a new approach to game
               scholarship (including, but not limited to, the history of games). Moreover, this new
               way of understanding game citation generalizes to other computational artifacts that
               will likely be of increasing concern to scholars, such as systems and application
               software, user interfaces, and more.</p>
            <p>Specifically, we outline the current practice and requirements of citation in
               historical game studies works and then suggest a route beyond that practice through
               the description of a tool for the reference and resurrection of game software data.
               This resurrection is used as a shorthand for the re-execution of legacy software data
               inside a new computational context.<note> Resurrection could also apply to the
                  physical reconstruction (or acquisition) of legacy hardware. However, this article
                  is only able to comment on the data resurrection through emulation — for reasons
                  that will become clear below.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Those investigating humanistic citation and authority in digital humanities, like
               Burdick et al. in <title rend="italic">Digital_Humanities</title>, call out the
               coming dissolution of humanistic and preservationist foundations. </p>
            <p>As concepts of authorship, document, argument, provenance, and reference become
               increasingly unstable, concepts that are fluid, iterative, and distributive, but less
                  <quote rend="inline">authoritative,</quote> are taking their place. [Burdick 2012,
               109]</p>
            <p>Game citation directly confronts — and calls for answers to — many of these
                  issues.<note> That “less authoritative records are taking their place” is actually
                  more a symptom of not creating systems and “authoritative” sources that can better
                  deal with new types of records, as we attempt to show through the citation system
                  below and have explored in our prior work on the appraisal of new forms of game
                  development documentation and new descriptive apparatus for game software objects.
                  See [Kaltman 2014, Kaltman 2016]. </note> In this work, we highlight such problems
               of “authorship, document, argument, provenance, and reference.” </p>
            <p>As a motivating example, consider the following text from Pinchbeck's detailed
               account of the 1993 computer game <title rend="italic">Doom</title>:<note> We make
                  extensive use of the computer game <title rend="italic">Doom</title>, more
                  specifically the <title rend="italic">Doom</title> Version 1.9 Shareware, because
                  it is freely distributable, a significant part of game history, and very well
                  documented compared to other historical computer games. </note>
            </p>
            <p>The color palette of browns and grays shouts a level of realism that <title
                  rend="italic">Wolfenstein 3D</title> didn’t get anywhere near. A barrel positioned
               temptingly in the center of the screen just aches to be shot at and delivers a meaty
               crunching explosion that scatters debris across the screen. . . . There are a number
               of linked secrets, establishing that opening up new areas involves not just finding
               and triggering buttons and trip wires but triggering things in sequence. In this
               case, we have a different-colored wall panel, dropping down into a passage that takes
               us to the lake of waste with the superarmor, then a trip wire in the final room that
               lowers the Imp platform, announcing dynamic vertical-level adjustment and opening up
               a little area with a shotgun and shells. . . . In the space of a few short and small
               secrets, the game trains the observant player or completionist to watch for wall
               discoloration, lines of light/shadow and new sectors as trip wires, raising and
               dropping platforms, and linked sequences. [Pinchbeck 2013, 69]</p>
            <p>This passage presupposes comparative knowledge of other early first-person shooters
               and assumes that the reader either accepts Pinchbeck's descriptions at face value or
               will do the legwork required to find a copy of the game, load it into emulation
               software (or find a computer capable of running it!), and reproduce Pinchbeck's
               referenced objects, sites, and narrative arc. This also puts a greater obstacle in
               the reader's path: Is the reader sufficiently dextrous and committed to complete the
               demo chapter and find the secrets? Whom does this type of citation include and
               exclude? Moreover, for game studies more broadly, it is time-consuming, tedious, and
               space-intensive to give detailed accounts of even a single linear playthrough of a
               game.</p>
            <p>Consider, as an alternative, this interactive, augmented version of a longer excerpt
               from the same passage.</p>
            <p>The color palette of browns and grays shouts a level of realism that <title
                  rend="italic">Wolfenstein 3D</title> didn’t get anywhere near. A barrel positioned
               temptingly in the center of the screen just aches to be shot at and delivers a meaty
               crunching explosion that scatters debris across the screen. . . . The lights vary in
               this room — we can see the light from the large window to the right. When we pause by
               this window, the open areas seem huge, and we can see a lake of animated green goo. A
               glowing piece of armor sitting in the lake tells us straight away that we can leave
               the corridors and rooms and actually get outside. . . . We skirt around to the left
               toward the pillars (which are throbbing and glowing with light) and head up the
               staircase to a plinth with animated scrolling textures, to collect some armor. On the
               way, a shaven-headed goon with a shotgun bellows at us. We fire, and he flies
               backward in a gush of blood, dropping the shotgun.<note> This “shaven-headed goon”
                  only appears at this point at certain difficulty levels, so a player selecting
                  easier difficulties will not encounter it. The previous citation is the same
                  position in the level on an easier difficulty setting. Emulated citations in this
                  paragraph therefore reflect more than just the level position and player state,
                  but also macro-level changes to game settings. </note> We collect it and scoop up
               some blue health vials and some archaic metal helmets for an armor bonus, and we’re
               ready to go. </p>
            <p>Other innovations introduced in the first level include multiple vertical levels
               included in the same area. In the third room we enter, Imps stand on a raised
               platform in the far corner, while Zombie soldiers advance along a walkway that
               zigzags over green radioactive waste. There are a number of linked secrets,
               establishing that opening up new areas involves not just finding and triggering
               buttons and trip wires but triggering things in sequence. In this case, we have a
               different-colored wall panel, dropping down into a passage that takes us to the lake
               of waste with the superarmor, then a trip wire in the final room that lowers the Imp
               platform, announcing dynamic vertical-level adjustment and opening up a little area
               with a shotgun and shells. Finally, moving back out of this area and toward the
               second room opens a timed lift in the corner of the secret shotgun area, which we can
               run back to before it raises again (and it only does this once; some secrets are
               nonrepeatable). The lift leads to a short corridor with a couple of small armor
               bonuses before delivering the real reward, a one-way wall with a view over the
               walkway room. In the space of a few short and small secrets, the game trains the
               observant player or completionist to watch for wall discoloration, lines of
               light/shadow and new sectors as trip wires, raising and dropping platforms, and
               linked sequences.</p>
            <p>In preparing this augmentation, the authors used a new browser-based tool — the Game
               and Interactive Software Scholarship Tool (GISST) — to play through the game, record
               our performance and bookmark specific instants, store these bookmarks in a database,
               and hyperlink the textual content to specific moments in that performance. A reader
               has only to load such a bookmark to witness the moment of the game we need for our
               argument; they may then continue to play or simply click the next bookmark. The
               searchable database of performances and game citations itself becomes fuel for future
               arguments and counterarguments, as scholars can start playing from any of these
               bookmarks and take different actions (or, indeed, can apply the same series of
               actions to a different version of the game): “What if we had gone left instead of
               right?” “How does this scene appear differently in the first alpha version versus the
               final released version?” </p>
            <p>Games and other interactive systems have dual lives: on the one hand, they are
               processes (often computer programs) which can generate sequences of emergent
               phenomena bounded only by combinatorics, with each additional choice or instant of
               time branching possible worlds by increasing exponents; on the other hand, every
               experience of a game is not a branching tree, but a linearized sequence of events and
               audiovisual outputs. Considering the game program as a text is not necessarily more
               or less correct than considering a specific play of a game as a text, and GISST
               illuminates the difference between game program and game performance which we explore
               later in this work. </p>
            <p>As Stephen Ramsay and other digital humanists argue, computational tools can
               themselves be arguments for and about new humanistic expression [Ramsay 2011]. This
               sentiment is echoed in convincing terms in the aforementioned polemic on the state of
               digital humanities [Burdick 2012]. The authors assert that “the next generation of
               digital experimenters could contribute to humanities theory by forging tools that
               quite literally embody humanities-centered views regarding the world” [Burdick 2012,
               104]. In this sense, the tool presented below is the embodiment of a potential future
               for the study of game history.</p>
            <p>In creating such a tool, we aim to foreground issues of reference as regards the
               notoriously unstable nature of computer games and software.<note> See [McDonough
                  2010; Newman 2012b].</note> These objects, in their requirements for future
               retrieval and use in historical arguments, call for the ideation of what Bethany
               Nowviskie refers to as a “speculative collections” [Noviskie 2016]. These collections
               are those that do not yet exist, but will be required for future digital scholarship.
               The requirements of both game citation and the tool illustrated below invite the
               creation of a speculative future collection for managed and retrievable historical
               software data. Speculative collections call for the telegraphing of future scholarly
               use, and the creation of criteria for the descriptive, curative, and managerial
               requirements that would likely result. </p>
            <p>The future of scholarship in game history is then not only based on the stabilization
               of records for future retrieval, but also in the ways that that retrieval is enacted
               in practice, and available for further exploration and exploitation by critical
               computational methods and tools. </p>
            <p>We begin this article by identifying key problems in game and software citation. We
               explore these problems by applying theories of reduction and intertextuality. This
               leads us to new approaches for reference and from there to the design of GISST, the
               tool supporting the new kind of games scholarship illustrated above. Finally, we
               present a qualitative evaluation of GISST by other scholars.</p>
            <div>
               <head>2 Citation</head>
               <p>Citation is a foundational act in modern scholarship. Regardless of the
                  discipline, any scholarly argument is based on, or a reaction to, previous work
                  and/or citable primary sources. Different fields use citation practice in
                  different ways, but the major functions remain consistent [Sula 2014, 454-455]. </p>
               <p>Citation operates on two fundamental levels. Within a text, it legitimates the
                  knowledge claims made by an author, and provides support for their arguments and
                  findings. It also, through the connections a citation makes to related works, ties
                  an author to the social organization of the discipline(s) to which they are
                  contributing. In fact, any discipline is essentially constituted by these networks
                  of citations, the collections of links that form being dense enough to support
                  further claims and disclaimers, rebuttals and denials. </p>
               <p>Studies of citation occupy the thoughts of numerous fields, from the quantitative
                  analysis of bibliometrics, with its h-indexes and impact factors, to the applied
                  socio-linguistic study of discourse analysis. The dual roles of citation practice,
                  both in the form and content of knowledge links and as a base for social practices
                  within disciplines, are certainly ripe enough for a pluck into the basket of game
                  historical studies. Before diving into the morass of game citation, and even more
                  specifically, game data citation, the rest of this section will set up some
                  background definitions and support structures from citation-adjacent fields. These
                  will then be leveraged into a fuller discussion of game citation and the citation
                  tool as a speculation and intervention into future practice. </p>

                  <head>2.1 Citation in Use</head>
                  <p>As discussed, citation functions both within a text, as a marker to other
                     sources, and without, as a tie between an author and a discipline. The
                     citations found inside texts follow the prescriptions of the common practices
                     within a field of study. Common guides for the humanities include the Modern
                     Language Association (MLA), American Library Association (ALA), and the
                     University of Chicago Manual of Style. Most engineering disciplines, including
                     Computer Science, follow similarly organized research guides. In CS’s case, a
                     majority of the works are organized around the conference guidelines provided
                     by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) or the Institute of Electrical
                     and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). These guides are the products of the study of
                     bibliography, with its most prominent scholarly effect being the enumerative
                     bibliographies — the “Works Cited” lists — found after the conclusions of
                     monographs or conference publications. The constitution of bibliography entries
                     is the result of practices in descriptive bibliography, a subset of analytical
                     bibliography. </p>
                  <p>While bibliographic practice in the age of the Internet is in some corners
                     lamented as both a lost art and potentially unnecessary [Parks 2014], we
                     believe that coherent, consistent and standardized bibliographic description is
                     still essential.<note> Additionally, the practices of analytical bibliography —
                        probably most impressively displayed in Frank Manchel’s magnum opus, <hi
                           rend="italic">Film Study: An Analytical Bibliography </hi>— can help to
                        reconcile the production and history of academic disciplines [Manchel 1990].
                        Manchel’s four-volume, 2500 page work enumerates and describes the entire
                        breadth of English language film and film studies produced between 1965 and
                        1990. Interestingly, in line with the current project of scholarly support
                        through tools, Manchel’s work is emphatically indebted to SCRIPT/VS word
                        processing system and the IBM 6670 Laser Printer for help in maintaining and
                        organizing the necessary subject and author indexes required for his work
                        [Manchel 1990, 28].</note> The practice of organized analysis of the works
                     in a field can help to reveal new research directions and provide a solid base
                     for future claims. Game historical work needs more time and effort devoted to
                     these foundational, field-constitutive activities. </p>
                  <p>Returning to in-text bibliographic citation practices, we find that an explicit
                     function of citation is the legitimation of claims.<note> In the most recent
                        MLA Handbook, the editors write that citation practice involves,
                        “demonstrating the thoroughness of the writer’s research, giving credit to
                        the original sources, and ensuring that readers can find the [sources] . . .
                        to draw their own conclusions about the writer’s argument” [MLA Handbook
                        2016, 4]. Additionally, authors must provide a “comprehensible, verifiable
                        means of referring to one another’s work . . . to give credit to the
                        precursors whose ideas they borrow, build on or contradict and allow future
                        researchers interested in the history of the conversation to trace it back
                        to the beginning” [MLA Handbook 2016, 5]. </note> Authors need to legitimate
                     their claims, both by crediting original sources and supporting dialogue with
                     other scholars with whom they may agree or disagree. Citation also works as a
                     means to pay an intellectual debt, as any addition to knowledge, being based on
                     previous efforts, should acknowledge others’ contributions [Eco 2015]. </p>
                  <p>In history specifically, the formation of modern historical discourse is
                     founded on the “scientific” practice of accurate historical sourcing. Commonly
                     attributed to Leopold Von Ranke and his continental predecessors, the
                     development of footnote and endnote showed that the author had “done an
                     acceptable amount of work, enough to lie within the tolerances of the field”
                     [Grafton 1997, 22]. Citation persuades others to pay attention to a scholar’s
                     work and thoughts. It cannot “explain the precise course” taken by a historian,
                     but can “give the reader . . . enough hints to make it possible to work this
                     out — in part. No other apparatus can give more information — or more assurance
                     — than this” [Grafton 1997, 23]. Anthony Grafton, in reference to the preceding
                     quotes, notes that the function of footnotes — the historian’s preferred mode
                     of citation — is to give legitimacy to a claim and promote the authority of the
                     claimant. Footnotes also provide means for enforcing the social space of
                     historians through the inclusion or exclusion of particular works. In many
                     cases, a notable omission provides for a deeper criticism than an antithetical
                     reference, because at least the latter claim is being recognized and confronted
                     instead of ignored. </p>

                  <head>2.2 Citation as Discourse</head>
                  <p>Given that this article is devoted to the use and abuse of citation practices
                     in game historical texts, we need to develop a suitable framing and terminology
                     to discuss game citations. As alluded to above, the act of citation involves
                     the coherent and consistent description of a source within a text. This is
                     usually in the form of a bibliographic footnote or endnote, or as a list of
                     entries (enumeration) following a text. Bibliography dictates that there is
                     sufficient description to allow a future researcher to recover the described
                     source. This creation of a knowledge link to another’s work, in light of
                     bibliographic practice, is then a matter of practicality. One needs adequate
                     description for future retrieval. What bibliographic notions do not cover is
                     the use of a citation, a knowledge linkage, within the text itself. The correct
                     form of a description for a source is not the same as how an author activates
                     that source inside their text as a part of their argument. We then have to
                     split the act of citation in two. The first part is “simply” the description
                     and positioning of a citation inside a text, and the other is an analysis of
                     how that citation is used as a way to further the objectives of an author, and
                     by extension that author’s discipline. Fortunately, the discussion of
                     citation’s effect on both textual composition and the social formation of
                     disciplines is addressed in the fields of bibliometrics and discourse studies.
                     In the following paragraphs we will borrow a few key disciplinary concepts,
                     then position them in relation to practices in game historical scholarship.</p>
                  <p>The intersection of one text within another is an instance of intertextuality.
                     Although the term “intertextuality” is used in a number of fields, our
                     definition of it here is drawn from discourse studies. One of the founders of
                     the field, Norman Fairclough, describes intertextuality as “the property texts
                     have of being full of snatches of other texts, which may be explicitly
                     demarcated or merged in, and which may assimilate, contradict, ironically echo,
                     and so forth” [Fairclough 1992, 84]. Intertextuality, in Fairclough’s
                     consideration, implicitly calls to account the production, distribution, and
                     consumption of texts. For production, a key consideration is the “historicity”
                     of texts, how they add to previous knowledge and expand a specific discursive
                     chain of thought.<note> “Discursive chain of thought” is basically the
                        organization of knowledge in a specific discipline. All practitioners are
                        contributing to the historical accumulation that furthers the course of
                        their discipline and the history of its claims.</note> Distribution reflects
                     on the network of texts and how they transform and flow into different types
                     and fields.<note> There are parallels here with Latour and the translation of
                        concepts in networks, as well as the use of inscription in the creation of
                        research works. We will briefly bring in some of the history of science and
                        technology perspective on text formation, with its focus on practice,
                        below.</note> Fairclough uses the example of political speeches transformed
                     into news reports. With consumption, “the intertextual perspective is helpful
                     in stressing that it is not just ‘the text,’ not indeed just the texts that
                     intertextually constitute it, that shape interpretation, but also those other
                     texts which interpreters variably bring to the interpretation process”
                     [Fairclough 1992, 85]. All three implications of Fairclough’s “intertextual
                     perspective” have a significant bearing on the interpretation of citation and
                     reference in academic works. That texts are engaged with a disciplinary train
                     of thought, flow and re-form based on context, and intimately involve
                     presuppositions about the other texts they do (and could) use, are all points
                     of reflection for both the citation practice of games, and the implications for
                     a better use of the tool proposed below; it being a means of a new type of
                     intertextual link for game history. </p>
                  <p>Fairclough’s intertextuality is drawn from a more elaborate framework based in
                     French discourse analysis that traces back to Michel Foucault’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Archaeology of Knowledge.</hi> Rather than retrace this
                     history ourselves, we can lean on Fairclough’s two notions of intertextuality,
                     manifest and constitutive. Manifest intertextuality is “where specific other
                     texts are overtly drawn upon within a text,” forming a “heterogeneous
                     constitution of texts.” To clarify, the quote ending the previous sentence is
                     an example of manifestation, as is “Fairclough’s intertextuality” at the
                     beginning of the paragraph. Both are specific, overt calls out to other texts,
                     with the direct quote being a more emphatic kind of manifestation. Constitutive
                     intertextuality (for Fairclough “interdiscursivity”) is effectively the means
                     of intertextuality for a specific text. How the configuration of its
                     references, allusions, and implications for other texts, both explicitly
                     mentioned and implicitly demanded, align to form a specific type of discourse
                     for a specific audience.<note> We are careful to note that the assumption of an
                        audience here is not only referring to the actions taken by an author, with
                        an audience in mind, to clarify and align their text with others’
                        expectations, but also to the implicit knowledge that a potential reader
                        will bring to a text given that it is in a specific discursive form.
                        Fairclough goes into more depth on discursive types in [Fairclough 1992],
                        specifically in chapters 2 and 3.</note> Bibliographic actions — like
                     enumerative bibliography, footnotes, and in-line citations — are then all types
                     of manifestation while the act of citation itself, as a social and knowledge
                     linking activity, is a constitutive act. </p>
                  <p>Before extending the application of constitutive and manifest intertextuality
                     to game historical discourse, two more key insights from Fairclough are useful.
                     The first is the idea of a “presupposition” of a text. Sometimes
                     presuppositions are just “propositions that are given for, and taken for
                     granted by, text producers.” When engaged in the act of writing and assembling
                     an argument, authors bring into their writing numerous pointers to other works
                     — through manifestation — or ideas from other works that are assumed to be part
                     of the general knowledge of an assumed reader. Or, crucially, part of the
                     knowledge that one is assumed to take from an “other text” that is insinuated
                     in the current one. “In many cases of presupposition the ‘other text’ is not an
                     individual specified or identifiable other text, but a more nebulous ‘text’
                     corresponding to general opinion (what people tend to say, accumulated textual
                     experience)” [Fairclough 1992, 121]. A presupposition, through manifest
                     citation, of a particular “other” author or “other” work, brings with it a host
                     of assumptions based on an expected experience on the part of the reader. As a
                     result, presuppositions are difficult to correct if they go awry because both
                     the reader and the author are under a similar delusion about the content and
                     shape of a reference. </p>
                  <p>This gap between presuppositions, as intended by an author and interpreted by a
                     reader, leads us to a second point about ambiguity and the constitutive
                     “surface” of a text. In drawing together the heterogeneous network of texts
                     that constitute a new one, there are times when certain parts may not fit as
                     well as others. </p>
                  <p>Texts vary a great deal in their degrees of heterogeneity . . . [they] also
                     differ in the extent to which their heterogeneous elements are integrated, and
                     so in the extent to which their heterogeneity is evident on the surface of the
                     text. . . . Again, texts may or may not be “reaccentuated”; they may or may not
                     be drawn into the prevailing key or tone (e.g., ironic or sentimental) of the
                     surrounding text. Or again, the texts of others may or may not be merged into
                     unattributed background assumptions of the text being presupposed. So a
                     heterogeneous text may have an uneven and “bumpy” textual surface, or a
                     relatively smooth one. [Fairclough 1992, 104]</p>
                  <p>That we should pay attention to qualities of a textual surface — and the ways
                     in which its imbricated texts do and do not comport with each other — motivates
                     our framing for the discussion of the citation work below. If we are combining
                     references in text to games, and other systems, based on non-discursive
                     experiences, their constitutive intertextuality needs to be examined, along
                     with its effects on the resulting historical discourse.<note> The organization
                        of citations in a text (and, in our case, the organization of text and
                        running executable programs) does also call out to various traditions
                        relating to visual design and the juxtaposition of text and image,
                        specifically in art criticism see [Berger 1973].</note> We may want the
                     alignment to have a specific texture, but we also need to be aware that that
                     texture, that surface, is something deserving of reflective consideration and
                     thought. How do the citation of games and the juxtaposition of program and text
                     affect the reader’s experience and comprehension of the argument? What does
                     this do to the issues of presupposition and scholarly assumption? Below we
                     discuss the current practice of game citation in light of both manifest
                     intertextuality and presupposition. </p>
                  <p>One last implication of the heterogeneous constitution of texts is that it
                     results in what Fairclough refers to as an “ambivalence” of argumentative
                     meaning. “If the surface of a text may be multiply determined by the various
                     other texts which go into its composition, then elements of that textual
                     surface may not be clearly placed in relation to the text’s intertextual
                     network, and their meaning may be ambivalent; different meanings may coexist,
                     and it may not be possible to determine ‘the’ meaning” [Fairclough 1992, 105].
                     The ambiguity inherent to any textual argument results from the fact that we —
                     as the authors — are removing other texts from their original context and
                     constituting them into our own. As such, the onus is on us, the researchers, to
                     both explain and refine the “other” texts in a way that supports our argument
                     and that is interpretable to the reader. Poking below the surface of the text
                     and retrieving a shared context requires significant effort, and in the case of
                     games, might not currently be possible due to a lack of access [Kaltman 2015;
                     McDonough 2010].</p>

               <p>In the previous section we outlined the function of citation as both an act of
                  descriptive bibliography and as an intertextual mechanism in the creation of
                  textual discourse. This section brings both of those concepts to bear on the
                  current practices of game citation in game studies and game historical texts.
                  While both fields are large, with a significant amount of publication activity,
                  the extent of game citation is currently rather limited. Additionally, in game
                  studies works there is a good deal of presupposition about the accumulated played
                  experiences of both the reader and author. These assumptions are a major reason
                  for the current lack of specific bibliographic guidelines. As Nathan Altice
                  writes, in one of the only other analyses of game citation practice, </p>
               <p>Our familiarity with and access to videogames is taken for granted, since many of
                  us are old enough to recall first-hand experience with the entire history of
                  videogames — a claim that cannot be made by scholars of other media. There is an
                  implicit assumption that we all know what a <hi rend="italic">Super Mario
                     Bros.</hi> cartridge looks like, so why bother with thorough descriptions?
                  [Altice 2015, 334]</p>
               <p>This “implicit assumption” of <hi rend="italic">Super Mario Bros.</hi> is the
                  result of the presupposition at work in game studies texts. It is not uncommon for
                  game references to be scant or potentially non-existent. This is a problem because
                  the assumption of contemporary, tacit experience with historical games cannot hold
                  up past the current generation of scholars. Game citation practices, like those of
                  appraisal and description, need to be addressed with a mind toward future
                  historical scholarship and needs. The rest of this section will describe how
                  citation functions in game studies works, and briefly point to further
                  recommendations for their improvement. All of this lays groundwork for the
                  introduction of the citation tool in the next section — as a tool-assisted
                  intervention into both the issues of citation standardization and presupposition
                  of game play experiences.</p>
               <p>As already noted, computer game bibliography and citation practice needs
                  consistent and thorough standards. Again, from Altice, </p>
               <p>To claim that videogame bibliography demands a closer allegiance to the practices
                  [of enumerative, and analytical bibliography] assumes that a unified practice
                  called “videogame bibliography” even exists. At their best, videogame citations
                  adhere to the barest enumerative models. Even in those texts that most seriously
                  grapple with electronic artifacts as objects that exhibit physical properties
                  worthy of description, such as Kirschenbaum’s <hi rend="italic">Mechanisms</hi> or
                  Montfort and Bogost’s <hi rend="italic">Racing the Beam,</hi> videogames are still
                  afforded scant bibliographic information. [Altice 2015, 333]</p>
               <p>Altice’s claim of the lack of a “videogame bibliography” practice is not difficult
                  to substantiate. As he states, many works that are intimately tied to the
                  exploration of the material constraints and expressive potentials of technical
                  artifacts do not share consistent bibliographic practices. Both works mentioned
                  above, Matt Kirschenbaum’s <hi rend="italic">Mechanisms</hi> — a treatise on the
                  oft-overlooked ambiguities in the expression of digital data — and Ian Bogost and
                  Nick Montfort’s <hi rend="italic">Racing the Beam</hi> — a platform study into the
                  inner workings of the Atari 2600 — come from the same publisher, are intimately
                  involved with the technical distinctions of computer software, and do not share a
                  consistent practice in their bibliographies [Kirschenbaum 2008, Bogost 2009]. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Racing the Beam</hi> is a part of a larger series of works on
                  specific platforms. Each book investigates the constraints that a particular
                  platform imposes on the expressive potential of its software. Each book also takes
                  a different position on the placement, organization and depth of its enumerative
                  bibliography of games. Some volumes, like Jimmy Maher’s on the Commodore Amiga,
                  eschew any explicit listing of the games referenced in the text [Maher 2012].
                  Contrarily, works like Altice’s own <hi rend="italic">I AM ERROR,</hi> on the
                  Nintendo Entertainment System, adopt meticulous, platform- and media
                  format-specific reference schemes. </p>
               <p>Now, given that there is a not a standard set of bibliographic and citation
                  practices for software, and that most major sources of such practices — like the
                  MLA, University of Chicago, and surprisingly even the ACM — lack any guidelines
                  for software bibliography, it is perhaps not unexpected that academic book
                  publishers and authors do not maintain consistent practices.<note> The ACM is
                     currently investigating ways to embed software references into publications
                     through an “artifact review” badging process. See:
                     https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging</note> The
                  work of the Game Metadata and Citation Project (GAMECIP), which looked at hundreds
                  of game studies citations across a variety of online and print sources, also
                  validates Altice’s (and our) assumption about the lack of consistent practice. In
                  fact, even within the same journal, <hi rend="italic">Game Studies, </hi>which
                  does have an explicit bibliographic policy, there was still lax enforcement of
                  descriptive citation practice.<note>
                     http://gamestudies.org/1802/submission_guidelines#GSCitation</note>
               </p>
               <p>Altice also links bibliography and citation to descriptive concerns. He notes, </p>
               <p>As a Famicom scholar, I may possess the terminology to describe that platform’s
                  media but meanwhile lack the platform-specific knowledge to properly cite a
                  PlayStation 2 game. . . . Granting each [reference] its due description poses a
                  sizable research challenge. One solution is to build up a body of
                  platform-specific descriptions that others may use as a model . . . but such
                  shared knowledge will take time and work. [Altice 2015, 337]</p>
               <p>Computer game bibliography is distinct from that for other media forms mainly in
                  the complex of technical requirements needed to retrieve the object. GAMECIP’s
                  platform and format vocabularies, outlined in prior work [Kaltman 2015], speak to
                  Altice’s call in a limited way by attempting to codify and standardize some basic
                  descriptive information for computer games. The larger issue, however, is that
                  “rich bibliographic records require a baseline technical understanding of the
                  objects they describe” [Altice 2015, 336].</p>
               <p>For game scholars concerned with the technical underpinnings and object
                  materiality of software, each new platform, format, and data configuration incurs
                  a significant descriptive cost. For items in Altice’s enumerative bibliography,
                  each specific game is listed according, in part, to the configuration of
                  components inside a Nintendo Entertainment System Game Pak, and in the case of
                  emulated sources, the header information of a particular game data file. Clearly,
                  for his arguments to validate, this level of depth is necessary, and it would
                  benefit future scholarship if others could take advantage of his classification
                  schemes or even extend them into their own specific sub-domain of software. </p>
               <p>Altice and others in the platform studies community are more concerned with the
                  material and technical conditions of games than other historical scholars. What
                  works for platform studies might be overkill for other subdisciplines. However, at
                  the very least, the technical information provided in a bibliography should be
                  correct, and involve a level of detail specific enough to allow an unacquainted
                  reader a fair chance to recover the source.<note> This is in line with the
                     recommendation for “reasonable compatibility” in [Kaltman 2015]. We argue that
                     a game resource in a collection catalog should provide granular enough
                     information to give a researcher a reasonable guess at the technical apparatus
                     required for the resource’s recovery.</note> The lack of consistency in the
                  description of computer game sources can damage the legitimacy of game historical
                  arguments. As mentioned in the last section, one key way that a citation can fail
                  is through a mistaken presupposition about the source it is referencing. This
                  misalignment between the author’s expectation — or recollection — of a game play
                  experience and that of a future reader’s is only exacerbated by incomplete and
                  inconsistent citation practice. </p>
               <div>
                  <head>3.1 Presupposition of DOOM!</head>
                  <p>One significant difficulty in game citation is that games are not as
                     recoverable as other media forms. Many institutions do not have software
                     collections, and those that do struggle against the technical and material
                     constraints of hardware maintenance and access. When these limited access
                     scenarios collide with a lack of rigor in citation practice, the result is that
                     many outputs of game scholarship rely on only the barest descriptions for
                     games. They are used more as pointers to the concept of a particular game, as
                     presupposition, than to an emphatic, playable instance of one. </p>
                  <p>To take a particularly salient example, let us return to Dan Pinchbeck’s book
                        <hi rend="italic">DOOM: SCARYDARKFAST.</hi> This book — a good example of
                     design-focused phenomenological game study — relies, almost exclusively, on
                     presupposition of game citations. The work contains manifest citations, mostly
                     through in-line references, to 130 other computer games. Most are used in
                     passing to articulate how a particular structural, thematic, or kinesthetic
                     element from each game relates to those of <hi rend="italic">Doom</hi>. The
                     in-line references are of the form (Title, Year), leaving the reader to fill in
                     the blanks based on their assumed knowledge of each title. Furthermore, given
                     the breadth of games mentioned, it is likely that nearly all readers have not
                     played, or at least not recently played, many of them. The references hang on a
                     presupposition of past experiences with the titles, and hopefully they still
                     resonate in ways commensurate with his arguments. The references are, as we
                     mentioned above, presupposed shorthand for the shared played experience of both
                     author and reader.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate how this form of manifest, presupposed citation functions, take
                     this set of paragraphs describing the progress of the first-person perspective
                     from Pinchbeck’s book: </p>
                  <p>We need to consider the context into which <hi rend="italic">DOOM</hi> arrived.
                     The very first FPS game was <hi rend="italic">Maze War,</hi> created by Steve
                     Colley, Howard Palmer, and Greg Thompson (and other contributors) at the NASA
                     Ames Research Center. Colley estimates that the first version was built during
                     1973, as an extension of the earlier game <hi rend="italic">Maze,</hi> which
                     offered a first-person exploration of a basic wireframe environment. At some
                     point during ’73 or ’74, networked capability was added, enabling multiplayer
                     FPS play. The genre was born out of networked deathmatching. After Thompson
                     moved to MIT, he continued to develop <hi rend="italic">Maze War,</hi> adding a
                     server offering personalized games, increasing the number of players to eight,
                     and adding simple bots to the mix. Twenty years before <hi rend="italic"
                        >DOOM,</hi> all of the prototypical features of the FPS were in place: a 3D
                     real-time environment, simple ludic activity (look, move, shoot, take damage),
                     and a basic set of goals and win/lose conditions — all this and multiplayer
                     networked combat. </p>
                  <p>Around the same time, Jim Bowery developed <hi rend="italic">Spasim</hi>
                     (1974), which he has claimed to be the very first 3D networked multiplayer
                     game. <hi rend="italic">Spasim</hi> pitted up to thirty-two players (eight
                     players in four planetary systems) against one another over a network, with
                     each taking control of a spaceship, viewed to other players as a wireframe. A
                     second version expanded the gameplay from simple combat to include resource
                     management and more strategic elements. Whether or not Bowery’s argument that
                        <hi rend="italic">Spasim</hi> precurses <hi rend="italic">Maze War</hi> and
                     represents the first FPS holds water, its importance as a game is undiminished
                     — even if for no other reason than because <hi rend="italic">Spasim</hi> is a
                     clear spiritual ancestor of <hi rend="italic">Elite</hi> (Braben and Bell 1984)
                     and its many derivatives. It perhaps even prototypes a game concept that would
                     later spin out into combat-oriented real-time strategy (RTS) or even massively
                     multiplayer online (MMO) gaming. </p>
                  <p>What certainly differentiates <hi rend="italic">Spasim</hi> from <hi
                        rend="italic">Maze War</hi> is the perspective. Like other early
                     first-person games, such as <hi rend="italic">BattleZone</hi> (Atari 1980) and
                     id’s <hi rend="italic">Hovertank 3D</hi> (1991), the game is essentially
                     vehicular, with no representation of the avatar onscreen other than a
                     crosshair. It is interesting that, aside from occasional titles such as <hi
                        rend="italic">Descent</hi> (Parallax 1995) and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Forsaken</hi> (Probe Entertainment 1998), the genre very swiftly settled
                     down into the avatar-based perspective, abandoning vehicular combat more or
                     less completely. It’s also interesting that contemporary shooters often opt for
                     a shift to third-person when including vehicles, such as with <hi rend="italic"
                        >Halo: Combat Evolved</hi> (Bungie 2002) or <hi rend="italic">Rage</hi> (id
                     Software 2011). <hi rend="italic">Half-Life 2</hi>’s (Valve Software 2004)
                     first-person car sequences are actually quite unusual. [Pinchbeck 2013, 6] </p>
                  <p>These three paragraphs reference twelve games spanning a period from 1974 to
                     2011. <hi rend="italic">Doom</hi> does not receive a full in-line citation
                     since it is the topic of the book, and is addressed with in-line references in
                     a previous section. Ignoring the general argument and focusing only on the
                     citations and their relationship to the assertions being made on their behalf,
                     we already encounter some significant issues. </p>
                  <p>Firstly, the citations are not particularly specific. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Descent,</hi> for example, was released in six different versions for three
                     different platforms in three different localities in 1995 alone.<note>
                        According to MobyGames,
                        https://web.archive.org/web/20160421081803/http://www.mobygames.com/game/descent/release-info
                        , Descent has 15 different releases, 6 of which occurred in 1995 in the
                        United States, Japan, and Germany for DOS, Mac, and PC-98.</note> The
                     description “(Descent, 1995)” then does not provide enough information for a
                     reasonable assumption about the particular version Pinchbeck played (or
                     presupposed). Second, the citations presuppose a significant amount of
                     knowledge on the part of the reader. When Pinchbeck remarks, “<hi rend="italic"
                        >Spasim</hi> is a clear spiritual ancestor of <hi rend="italic">Elite</hi> .
                     . . and its many derivatives,” we (the reader) are required to understand —
                     through presupposition — that <hi rend="italic">Spasim</hi>, a first-person,
                     cockpit oriented space exploration game is echoed in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elite</hi>, a similarly-perspectived first-person space simulation game.
                     Clearly, that assertion requires a familiarity with both games, and by
                     extension knowledge of other <hi rend="italic">Elite</hi> derivatives. Finally,
                     even though a game might be recoverable through the sparse citation provided,
                     much of the discussion still presupposes memories of experiences of play, both
                     in Pinchbeck and in his readers. By referencing the vehicular segment of <hi
                        rend="italic">Half-Life 2,</hi> Pinchbeck is implicitly requiring a future
                     researcher, should they want to experience that sequence, to spend many hours
                     of game time reaching and evaluating it. There is nothing inherently wrong with
                     this, but we must highlight the extent of the assumptions being made of the
                     reader. Either you already have contemporary experience of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Half- Life 2</hi>, and incidentally remember this game play sequence, or
                     you are relying on Pinchbeck’s memory of his contemporary play. Both positions
                     presuppose a temporally-situated accumulation of played experiences that aligns
                     with the year of this work’s publication. Future researchers, removed from a
                     contemporary, played understanding of the game, must assume that Pinchbeck is
                     not committing any of the intertextual no-nos — like misinterpretation or
                     incorrect presupposition — listed in the previous section. Otherwise, they will
                     need to recover <hi rend="italic">Half-Life 2</hi> for themselves, and assume
                     that their version contains the vehicular sequence in question and that it is
                     reachable through play. </p>
                  <p>While it may seem that we are being a bit drastic in this example, we cannot
                     take for granted that our own presuppositions about <hi rend="italic">Half-Life
                        2</hi> or any other game discussed in the quote above (or, for that matter,
                     in this text) will align with the presuppositions of future scholars. </p>
                  <p>Pinchbeck’s references are intended to evoke a general idea of a specific
                     title, relying primarily on the presupposition of reader knowledge. The
                     referenced games in these cases stand in metonym for their specific
                     constitutive function in the text. <hi rend="italic">Halo, Rage,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Half-Life 2</hi> for their comparative vehicular segments; <hi
                        rend="italic">Spasim, Elite, Descent,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Forsaken</hi> for their 360-degree cockpit viewpoint; and <hi rend="italic"
                        >HoverTank 3D, BattleZone, Maze,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Maze War</hi>
                     for their advances to first person representation. Concrete, retrievable
                     instances of these games are secondary to the structural or thematic
                     conceptualizations of them as presupposed into Pinchbeck’s argument. </p>
                  <p>In contrast, recalling Altice’s more extensive, object-based citations, we see
                     that many of his claims are rooted in the minutiae of a single platform and its
                     technical constraints. For Altice, his argument is dependent on the specifics,
                     on the material differences between games rather than the higher level concepts
                     they can evoke. He commonly uses emulated versions of games to illustrate
                     points about Nintendo Entertainment System rendering techniques. Because
                     rendering functions differ between the many versions of, say, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Super Mario Bros.,</hi> Altice’s citation of a specific version of the
                     game’s data is important: his analysis would not be possible — or legitimate —
                     without it. </p>
                  <p>The lesson is not that anything Pinchbeck is saying is particularly incorrect,
                     but that the onus for clarification is heavily weighted toward the reader, and
                     in particular, a presupposition about the reader’s accumulated knowledge of
                     games. Pinchbeck’s work is intended for a game savvy audience, and is certainly
                     not attempting to be a rigorous, formal history of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Doom</hi>.<note> Relevantly, Pinchbeck was involved with the KEEP project,
                        an early attempt to provide an emulation framework for the recovery of older
                        games [Pinchbeck 2009]. A specific purpose of KEEP was to insure that people
                        could play old games to explicitly understand their affordances through play
                        and reference their historical context. As such, we wish to reiterate that
                        Pinchbeck’s work is used as an example of a specific type of game historical
                        discourse and not a criticism of the work itself. </note> But the type of
                     underspecified, game-as-shorthand reference structure is endemic to a
                     significant swath of game studies. It will also make these types of work less
                     relevant the farther they are displaced from the contemporary titles to which
                     they refer. Again, in clarification with Altice, “Most contemporary game
                     scholars are old enough to remember most of the entire historical arc of
                     computer games, so further clarification for them, and audiences like them are
                     not currently required.” Those in the future, unversed in the early history of
                     computer games, will need to do a significant amount of work to recover all of
                     the implicit game history embedded within Pinchbeck’s references. </p>
                  <p>Another note is that Pinchbeck’s citations are more the norm in current game
                     citation practice. The GAMECIP study of citation practice analyzed citations in
                     over 300 publications relating to computer games. Of those, 102 different
                     styles of citation were found, and of those only 31 included any information
                     about game platforms. A majority simply focused on title, developer and year of
                     publication. The main problem with this lax citation practice is that without
                     at least a foundational set of descriptive elements tied to some expression of
                     technical constraints and requirements, locating and replaying games referenced
                     in scholarly works might be very difficult in the far future.<note> For more
                        information on recommendations for citation guidelines as a result of the
                        GAMECIP work, please refer to our citation recommendations: Kaltman, Eric,
                        Stacey Mason, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. “The Game I Mean: Game Reference,
                        Citation and Authoritative Access” [Kaltman et al. 2020]. Additionally,
                        recent citation recommendations and a discussion of how citation of games is
                        always a political and discipline-specific act can be found in “How to
                        Reference a Digital Game” [Gualeni et al. 2019]. </note> Altice’s end of the
                     spectrum, with its acknowledgment of computer game materiality grounding out
                     into the literal byte order of a file header, is more historically secure in
                     theory but requires a level of technical understanding that might turn off
                     scholars with less techno-materialist concerns. </p>
                  <p>In the end, a probable solution is to provide a minimally viable set of
                     descriptive bibliographic fields based, again, on assumptions of reasonable
                     compatibility and retrieval. These minimum specifications and recommendations
                     for citation practice can be found in forthcoming work from the GAMECIP
                     project. The main thrust, however, is that for the legitimation of any argument
                     made about or through a game, there is a requisite depth of citation that
                     aligns with the claim. From the above, the depth of Pinchbeck’s arguments dealt
                     with apparent surface characteristics of games — characteristics that would
                     hopefully be apparent to anyone playing one of the games cited. In the case of
                     platform studies arguments, the claims are dependent on citation at a different
                     depth, one close to the actual material existence of the program. </p>
                  <p>Hopefully, this section illuminated some of the problems with current manifest
                     intertextuality in games, most specifically that, due to the current
                     limitations of textual description, the field of game studies is dependent on a
                     presupposition of played knowledge that is not tied to any specific material
                     instances of games. The next section looks at this problem from the perspective
                     of constitutive intertextual relations and provides a basis for our partial
                     solution in the form of a citation tool for executable reference. This
                     constitutive work is the result of confronting the current limitations of
                     citations as they have been described so far. Primarily, when even the citation
                     of specific, material data is not enough or of a kind with the expression of
                     new historical claims.</p>

               <head>4 Reduction and Intertextual Expression</head>
               <p>Intertextuality is a fickle phenomenon. As noted by Fairclough above, when making
                  one text manifest within another, work needs to be done to mold the “other text”
                  in a form commensurate with the discourse surrounding it. Otherwise the textual
                  surface is disturbed, and the flow of thought for the reader becomes more
                  difficult to reconcile and interpret. (Of course in some instances, this might be
                  desired as a way to remark on the disjunction between different textual forms and
                  different ways of reading.) Fairclough looks at newspapers, medical interviews,
                  and other forms of discourse dissimilar from the academic text within which he is
                  operating. He focuses on the ways in which each discourse’s intertextuality
                  contributes to its existence as a distinct genre, a distinct type of expression.
                  This notion of constitutive intertextuality, the ways in which different
                  discourses make use of and interact with other texts, is a fundamental aspect of
                  discourse analysis. The constitutive act of bringing together “other” texts
                  through manifest actions like citation, as noted by Ken Hyland in his study of
                  academic citation practice, </p>
               <p>links text users to a network of prior texts depending on their group membership,
                  and provides a system of coding options for making meanings. Because they help to
                  instantiate or construe the meaning potential of a disciplinary culture, the
                  conventions developed in this way foreclose certain options and make some
                  predictions about meanings possible. [Hyland 2000, 156] </p>
               <p>The organization of disciplines and regions of thought and inquiry, both in the
                  humanities and the sciences, are then dictated through the intertextual relations
                  of publications. These publications organize into networks that then enforce and
                  negotiate the boundaries of disciplines, and the specific intertextual discourse
                  required for group allegiance. We argue that the intertextual surfaces of these
                  genres of discipline make use of certain conventions that can preclude certain
                  types of meaning and the expression of certain types of thoughts. </p>
               <p>By relying on standard conventions of manifest intertextuality, and therefore
                  prescribing limitations on the expression of academic claims, we are preventing
                  certain discussions from taking place. In the interest of this article, we are
                  most concerned with the explanation and historical positioning of computer games
                  as systems and technical objects. We remarked in the previous section that
                  references stand in metonym for more complex thematic components and system
                  interactions. In a sense, the discussion was really about the limitations of
                  current textual discourse about games — discourse that relies on the
                  narrativization of game play or the accumulated knowledge of the reader as player.
                  That game academics use text as the major form of expression is understandable.
                  Michael Lynch, when discussing scientists’ use of text over visuals, notes: </p>
               <p>The fact that writing is the dominant medium of academic discourse is not
                  incidental; while pictorial subject matter is alien to written discourse, and
                  requires a reduction to make it amenable to analysis, written subject matter can
                  be iterated without any “gap” with the textual surface that analyzes it. [Lynch
                  1988, 201] </p>
               <p>Games are even more removed from the textual surface than the visualizations Lynch
                  is investigating. Their insertion into textual discourse filters through many
                  different levels of “reduction.” Lynch’s argument focuses on the reduction of the
                  worked scientific reality of the life sciences to the written page. “Scientific
                  research teams are described as agencies of mediation between an uncertain and
                  chaotic research domain and the schematic and simplified products of research that
                  appear in publications” [Lynch 1988, 204]. Researchers select and distill the
                  appropriate data and reduce it to visualizations and textual description to align
                  with the constraints of printed publications. This reduction of the chaos of a
                  research project to the streamlined and validated prose of research publications
                  is of a kind with the work of some game historical scholars in their attempts to
                  better mind the “gap” between the played expression of games and their appearance
                  and function in text-based academic arguments. Most of the time, game studies uses
                  presupposition as a form of reduction, a way to fit the complex system
                  interactions inherent to the experience of game play into readable discourse. This
                  approach, however, largely limits the field of discussion for these games to their
                  existence as “objects played by a researcher in the past,” preempting other means
                  of using games in argument. </p>
               <p>The notion of reduction is important to the overall discussion of intertextual
                  surfaces and their effects on comprehension and expression. Reduction functions on
                  a spectrum aligning with the goals of a particular discourse. The reduction from
                  computer game to in-line textual citation is the most extreme form. Many others
                  make use of, in progression: still images, sequences (or juxtaposition) of images,
                  video, interactive visualization, and, in limited cases, emulation. In monographs,
                  and examples like Pinchbeck’s and Altice’s above, only still and sequenced images
                  are available. Pinchbeck narrates key areas of <hi rend="italic">Doom</hi> with
                  comparative juxtapositions of different game versions, and single images of key
                  aesthetic and level design features. Altice makes extensive use of emulator tools
                  for the visual display of internal memory states, or again, like Pinchbeck,
                  comparative juxtapositions of key sequences or different passes of a rendering
                  function. </p>
               <p>Outlining the full extent of image usage in game studies monographs is well
                  outside our scope, but the important consideration is the jump in textual
                  mediation that occurs in the transition from collections of images to video,
                  interactive visualization, or emulation. The textual surface described for the
                  majority of this article is one of physical print and the constraints of its
                  intertextuality. The newer forms of reduction are not mentioned by Lynch because
                  they still remain unleveraged in the sciences — there are very few online
                  publications in any field that leverage digital documents’ new textuality. Digital
                  humanists cry out for more active, digital intertextual presentation, but their
                  codified expression is only standardized in a handful of online
                     publications.<note> Prominent examples are <hi rend="italic">Kairos,
                        Scalar,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vectors.</hi>
                     http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/, http://scalar.usc.edu, and
                     http://vectors.usc.edu respectively.</note> Linking back, the expression of
                  academic discussions of games is then dependent on the forms of manifest
                  intertextuality that are available and commensurate with the dominant constitutive
                  discourses that currently exist. When people want to engage with games in ways
                  that are not commensurate with textual description they make use of less
                  encumbering reductions. In our case, when trying to either explain embodied system
                  interactions or complex dynamic processes, it is helpful to move beyond textual
                  discourse as the only tool in the tool chest. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>5 Types and Examples of Reduction</head>
               <p>Taking a step back, there are two key considerations at work in our discussion.
                  The first is the intertextual surface of discourse and how it makes use of
                  manifest actions, like citation, quotation, and images, in the constitution of a
                  text. The flow of an argument is aided by the integration of “other” texts such
                  that the discursive flow is smooth.<note> Unless, as indicated above, the
                     interruption of the flow serves a discursive function — the disjunction of
                     meanings being relevant to some point or elaboration. Sometimes contrasts in
                     discursive presentation inform limitations of either one.</note> Whenever one
                  is reading through a discussion and needs to refer to a figure, table, or other
                  interstitial manifestation, there is then, borrowing from Lynch, a “gap” in the
                  textual flow and thus in the discursive progression. An aim for any apparatus that
                  allows for new types of manifestation must be to consider how that manifestation
                  affects the constitution of a text, and the ways that manifestations can augment
                  or potentially further distort a discursive surface. This surface is also, with
                  advances in on-line technology and distribution methods, not only just a physical
                  sheet of flattened, dead wood, but the transmediatic — interactive — surface of
                  the computer screen and networked document. The medium of expression, in the case
                  of computer games and systems, is now of the same stuff of the medium being
                  described and discussed. There is potential for a better and more forceful
                  alignment of textual surface with digital system expression. </p>
               <p>The second key consideration is how reductions assist intertextual integration to
                  enable new forms of argument. We are not the first to venture down this
                  intermedial path, and by illuminating some further examples we can highlight the
                  new types of expression that we hope to enable with the to-be-described tool. This
                  section is mainly devoted to an elaboration of the second point about methods of
                  reduction in light of the first’s concern for intertextual alignment and
                  comprehension. The following discussion includes a collection of related and
                  motivating work.</p>
               <div>
                  <head>5.1 Video</head>
                  <p>Recall that the methods of reduction not discussed by Lynch are embedded video,
                     interactive visualization, and emulation. “Embedded” is key since this allows
                     us to present them as manifest intertextual objects (and later use some of the
                     discourse analytical apparatus to discuss their effects). Reduction is a
                     reduction of the embodied act of play to a form amenable to the constraints of
                     the particular intertextual surface being created. Video reduction is fast
                     becoming one of the major means for the dissemination of knowledge about how
                     games are played, and the surface characteristics of their presentation to the
                     player. As a phenomenon, this is beneficial to the progress of game historical
                     study since at the very least there will likely be some video remnants of game
                     play available to future preservation efforts.<note> [Newman 2012a] actually
                        calls for game preservation policies to prioritize videos of gameplay on the
                        assumption that executable access is a less likely future scenario.</note>
                     The availability of video has also prompted some academics to begin
                     experimenting with embeddable video as a means for discussion. For example,
                     Doug Wilson, in an extended discussion of the game <hi rend="italic"
                        >Spelunky</hi> for the Polygon website, makes extensive use of embedded
                     YouTube videos to support a discussion and walkthrough of one of the game’s
                     most difficult achievements, a no-death solo eggplant run.<note> As described
                        in [Wilson 2013]. The “solo eggplant run” is a secret completion achievement
                        for the computer game <hi rend="italic">Spelunky</hi>; a rogue-like dungeon
                        exploration game modeled on Indiana Jones and “explore the tomb”-type
                        motifs. The eggplant run involves carrying a useless item from the beginning
                        of the game through completion without losing it or losing one’s life. It
                        was so difficult that it took years before its first completion by
                        Bananasauras Rex in 2013. </note> By interweaving textual description with
                     multiple embedded videos keyed to specifically salient moments, Wilson
                     telegraphs a new type of intertextual surface where narrativized gameplay
                     description is aligned with video supports. The technical mastery at work is
                     made more apparent and visceral through the accompanying videos. </p>

                  <p>Interactive visualizations as embedded arguments, the next step up the
                     reduction ladder, are not a significant practice in academia. Certainly,
                     visualizations — in the form of static images embedded in text — are very
                     common in physical and social sciences, and in humanistic analysis of textual
                     corpora. Woolgar and Lynch preside over two volumes dedicated to representation
                     in scientific practice that are mostly focused on the constitutive power of
                     manifest visualizations in scientific texts. The fact that the volumes are
                     separated by 30 years indicates the continuing influence of visualization on
                     scientific work. Analysis of the effect of visualizations on humanistic
                     practice is probably most expressed in the attention to algorithmic criticism
                     in the works of Stephen Ramsay — for corpora analysis — and David Staley — in
                     historical visualization — among others [Ramsay 2011; Staley 2015]. However,
                     the use of non-static, interactive visualization of dynamic systems is absent
                     from the intertextual presentation of findings in most scholarly fields. The
                     groundwork is actually being laid more by those interested in the pedagogical
                     application of visualizations. </p>
                  <p>Bret Victor and his collaborators are at the forefront of so-called “explorable
                     explanations,” juxtapositions of online text and embedded interactive
                     visualizations designed to reveal the functionality of systems [Victor
                        2011].<note> However, being at the forefront of something is not the same as
                        “inventing” it. And Victor’s work is heavily inspired by Alan Kay’s in
                        “active essays” and Ted Nelson’s educational musings in “No More Teacher’s
                        Dirty Looks” from [Nelson 1974]. For more information on the genealogy of
                        the term see [Yamamiya 2009].</note> Some examples include a long
                     explanation of the basic dynamics of simple animated pathing, and Vi Hart and
                     Nicky Case’s interactive model of Thomas Schelling’s group segregation theories
                     [Hart 2016]. Each example works to mollify the “gap” between the textual
                     presentation inherent to the browser window and the machinations — and
                     interactive features — of the supporting visualizations. Victor’s work espouses
                     a pedagogical philosophy of system comprehension through manipulation and tacit
                     experience. Readers are invited to read the expository prose, and then play
                     with the interactive models of the phenomena on the page. The hope is that
                     through tacit manipulation and play a deeper understanding of the underlying
                     system will develop. </p>
                  <p>Victor refers to his online visualizations as “reactive documents” that allow
                     the reader to test out the various models presented and gain insight through
                     those interactions. The goal is to develop an “active reader,” someone who uses
                     “the author’s argument as a springboard for critical thought and deep
                     understanding” [Victor 2011]. Active reading owes much to the foundational
                     pedagogical insights of Seymour Papert. Papert devoted his career to the
                     development of computational tools to aid in mathematical and algorithmic
                     thinking [Papert 1980]. He also believed that tacit experience with reactive
                     systems would support better modeling capabilities in confronting new problems
                     and challenges. He traced this potential to a youthful fascination with gears
                     that implicitly enforced a tacit understanding of complex differential systems.
                     His gears functioned as a model that enabled a better understanding of math
                     “than anything I was taught in elementary school” [Papert 1980, vi]. The
                     ability to present information in different and interactive ways led to a new
                     model for the exploration of further knowledge. Papert linked this notion with
                     the educational theories of Jean Piaget that espoused the “assimilation” of
                     concepts into a learner’s world view. Papert’s gears functioned as an
                     “affective model,” a mapping (assimilation) between their relational dynamics
                     and other mathematical concepts. Victor’s work is then an attempt to embed
                     these “affective models” as interactive visualizations into online documents. </p>
                  <p>The design and application of affective models that encourage comprehension of
                     technical concepts is important for our larger argument about the potential for
                     new forms of intertextuality to support new argumentation. Victor presents a
                     prototypical means of doing more with online texts, and trying to engage the
                     reader with the systemic processes under discussion. Victor’s reactive
                     documents are a new discursive surface, one populated with interactive features
                     aimed at creating a new type of active reader. They are also the result of a
                     reduction from larger, complex system dynamics to concentrated, pedagogical
                     visualizations designed to support textual arguments. The reduction, however,
                     is much richer than an image or video, since it can support the creation of a
                     tacit, embodied argument. Instead of referencing an image or video of a system
                     processes, a smaller part of the system can be introduced into the discourse
                     describing it — or, better yet, use the interactive surface as an argument in
                     of itself for a particular point of view or affective process. </p>

                  <head>5.3 Emulation</head>
                  <p>Before discussing emulation as a form of reduction — in line with the
                     progression outlined above — we need to clarify some basic technical
                     distinctions and provide some related examples. This is necessary because the
                     use of emulated systems as a form of argumentation about software history — or
                     really any topic for that matter — has not before, to our knowledge, been
                     explored or theorized. </p>
                  <p>Emulation, as a computational process, is the use of one system in reproducing
                     the functionality and output of another.<note> More technically, it is “a
                        technique for implementing a virtual machine on a host computer whose
                        instruction set is different from the host computer’s” [Rosenthal 2015, 2].
                        Although the line between virtualization and emulation does get a bit murky
                        by this definition — the computer I’m typing this on, a MacBook Pro running
                        Apple Mac OS X 10.11, shares the same basic instruction set with a Sony
                        PlayStation 4 — the encapsulation of one system within another is the basic
                        function of emulation.</note> Emulators, the programs responsible for
                     emulation, are used in many corners of the software industry to allow for
                     testing of applications on a variety of devices. For instance, most mobile
                     phone applications are not developed on mobile phones. They are programmed in
                     emulation on laptops and desktops more conducive to long bouts of typing and
                     heartache. As noted by Nathan Altice, emulation has a long history tracing back
                     to the historical origins of software development [Altice 2015, 293]. In the
                     1960s IBM developed the first sets of commercial emulators to allow software
                     written for one mainframe model to be compatible with another. </p>
                  <p>More recently, in the 1990s, enthusiast game communities began to create
                     emulators of popular game systems, like the Nintendo Entertainment System.
                     Targeting then-current operating systems like Windows 95, these emulators
                     allowed for the (re)play of older titles that might no longer be available for
                     purchase, were released in foreign territories, or might otherwise be difficult
                     to acquire. The “games” in this usage were data dumps extracted from the
                     physical cartridges, and other forms of magnetic and optical media. For
                     cartridge systems, these files are known as “ROM”s since they are copies of a
                     cartridge’s read-only memory. A more general term for data extract from a media
                     format is a “data image,” more commonly shortened to “image.”<note> The use of
                        “image” in referring to an extracted data set is drawn from operations in
                        mathematics. When you use a function to operate on a set of numbers, you are
                        mapping the input values with potential outputs. In the case of y = x + 1, y
                        is a function of x (f(x)) with x standing for a range of input values, and y
                        for the output values of the function. The input values in this case “map”
                        through the function to a specific set of output values. This resultant map,
                        which is just the set of inputs each incremented by 1, is an “image” of
                        those inputs in a new domain. Similarly, the data extracted from a physical
                        medium is not the same data (nothing changes from the physical medium’s
                        point of view) but a mapping of the data stored on that medium to an
                        equivalent set of data now migrated from the media to another machine. Thus,
                        “imaging” is very directly the process of mapping the data stored on a
                        specific physical media to an identical configuration on a separate machine
                        with its own storage. This distinction between types of data, and the means
                        by which they are migrated, mapped and translated between machines will
                        become relevant below for issues of reduction.</note> Emulators operate on
                     data formatted for a specific system, and over the last 20 years, emulation
                     development and the extraction of legacy data from physical formats has
                     flourished. Emulators now exist for thousands of different computational
                     platforms, and are a ripe source for the exploration of software history. That
                     is, assuming one ignores some significant legal issues.<note> Emulation,
                        specifically in its copying and use of potentially copyrighted data, is in
                        unclear legal territory. The current GISST system would therefore need to be
                        modified to adapt a BYOD (bring your own data) approach where users provide
                        their own legal game data for citable manipulation. Another alternative
                        would be for GISST to function as a research service, like a more
                        conventional research database, within which executable citations would
                        function for institutions paying for the service. Counterintuitively,
                        providing GISST as a service that draws from data stored on third-party
                        sites elsewhere on the Internet, like ROM sharing sites, may help limit
                        legal risk for institutions. A GISST service tailored to enable only
                        legitimate fair uses would be less exposed to liability than sites that
                        support a broad array of more legally dubious uses. GISST could rely on
                        third-party sites for content without necessarily taking on the risk
                        associated with making the content available for open-ended reuse. For more
                        extensive legal information on this topic, check out the aforementioned
                        [McDonough 2010; Rosenthal 2015].</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Important for our discussion of manifest intertextual presentation are recent
                     developments in web browser technology (and speed improvements in general) that
                     now make it feasible to run emulators inside online documents. The potential
                     for embedded emulation has not yet been exploited or thoroughly explored.
                     However, because most web browsers now run highly optimized JavaScript
                     compilers, in-browser emulation is a growing phenomenon. The most prominent
                     example is the JavaScript Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME) project. MAME
                     began as a system for emulating arcade machines. Complementarily, the Multiple
                     Emulator Super System (MESS), using a fork of MAME’s code base, provided
                     support for most personal computers. MAME was open sourced in 2016 and MAME and
                     MESS are now merged. The combined infrastructure supports thousands of
                     different arcade machines and personal computers released over the last 40
                        years.<note> The MAME project is known for its attention to detail and
                        support for esoteric systems. For example, one addition in 2016 was a Sonic
                        the Hedgehog popcorn vending machine with embedded display, SegaSonic
                        Popcorn Shop, that was marketed only in 1993 in certain Japanese
                        cities.</note> Initially a large C++ project, the Internet Archive, along
                     with a collection of motivated developers, ported key components of MESS —
                     before its integration with MAME — to JavaScript to create the Internet Arcade,
                     a playable archive of the Internet Archive’s imaged software collection. After
                     the open-source combination, JavaScript became one of a number of compilation
                     targets for the entire MAME-MESS code base. </p>
                  <p>Similarly, many other emulators began organizing compilation to JavaScript.
                     This included the emulators DOSBox, for legacy x86 MS-DOS machines; FCEUX, for
                     the Nintendo Entertainment System; and Snes9x, for the Super Nintendo
                     Entertainment System.<note> Many other emulators now have JavaScript versions,
                        the three listed above are the three we use in the citation tool and so are
                        explicitly mentioned. For a full listing of emulators (including JavaScript)
                        check https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_video_game_
                        emulators which keeps a running list of projects and compatibility.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that emulation is available in browsers, it is possible to place both a
                     running program and the text describing or commenting on it onto the same
                     intertextual surface. In the progression of reductions from images to
                     interactive visualization, there was always a clear notion of how each step
                     still represents a deficient copy of some object or system outside the text.
                     For images and video, as mentioned by Lynch above, researchers put in a
                     significant amount of effort to both make their samples more photogenic and
                     thus more interpretable when presented on a textual surface. In dynamic
                     visualizations, there is an implicit understanding that we are being presented
                     with part of a system that has been distilled for comprehension and reader
                     engagement. The very act of visualization is to provide a specific perspective
                     (of many) on the data or system under discussion. With emulation, there does
                     not appear to be a similar process at work. While the emulation is a program
                     designed to conform to the constraints of a digital document, it is not a
                     distillation of a system but a full version of the system itself. This
                     challenges the basic premise of intertextuality presented above, that the texts
                     made manifest in and reduced to a specific discursive surface are under the
                     basic control of the author.<note> The inclusion of full emulated systems in a
                        document might be closer to Ted Nelson’s notion of “transclusion” than to
                        traditional, print-based models of intertextuality. In Nelson’s proposed
                        (and, with Autodesk’s involvement, partially implemented) Xanadu system, a
                        precursor of the World Wide Web, portions of documents could be manifestly
                        represented inside other documents by “transcluding” a portion of a full
                        version of the document. Those reading a Xanadu document could reach a full
                        version of any transcluded document, or change the portion viewed through
                        the transclusion “window,” or pull it up alongside the transcluding
                        document, as easily as we now traverse links on the Web — making the
                        transcluded document somewhat less under the control of the transcluding.
                        For more, see [Nelson 1993].</note> While some manipulation or
                     presupposition — in cases where the author is misremembering or functioning
                     with a divergent set of assumptions in regards to the reader — is always a
                     potential issue, that the manifest references might have a mind or operation of
                     their own was never imagined. In bringing emulation into the text, we therefore
                     encounter a new type of intertextual interaction, and with it a different model
                     of reduction — a model that requires significantly more effort in the
                     legitimation of claims and the interpretive exercise. Presupposition of played
                     experience cannot exert the same power because the system — the same system —
                     is available to both author and reader. </p>
                  <p>The imbrication of emulation into argumentative texts has only been lightly
                     attempted in the past. Nick Montfort wrote an article for the <hi rend="italic"
                        >electronic book review</hi> that embedded a Java plugin-based emulation of
                     the Infocom game Deadline [Montfort 2000].<note> The Java-based plugins are now
                        flagged as security threats, and even forcing the browser to ignore those
                        warnings did not result in the emulations executing correctly.</note>
                     However, his argument does not particularly integrate the emulation so much as
                     position it in the article to simply show such a move is possible. Others have
                     used online emulation for deeper systemic analysis. One notable example is Ben
                     Fry’s early online visualization of the internal memory state of the Nintendo
                     Entertainment System. The “deconstructulator” is a Java-based in-browser
                     emulator based on a modified version of the NESCafe emulator [Fry 2003].<note>
                        On a preservationist note, while the “deconstructulator”
                        (https://www.benfry.com/deconstructulator) is still available, it requires a
                        Java plugin to function. Due to security concerns over the last decade, Java
                        support has been dropped or disabled in many browsers. There is no longer
                        any mention of the NESCafe emulator on its creator’s website, and its most
                        recent update (July 22, 2008 according to
                        https://www.zophar.net/java/nes/nescafe.html) is over 10 years old as of
                        this writing in 2019.</note> The visualization presents three different
                     windows, a rendering of the full sprite memory of <hi rend="italic">Super Mario
                        Bros.</hi>, a playable emulation of that game, and the active memory
                     contents of the NES’s PPU (Picture Processing Unit), a component that manages
                     sprite rendering on positioning on screen. As the player plays <hi
                        rend="italic">Super Mario Bros.</hi>, the contents of the sprite map
                     highlight the currently active sprites in use, and the PPU map shows the
                     current state of each 8x8 tile in the PPU. By moving Mario around, the player
                     can see how the different animations and changes to the game’s background,
                     enemies and platforms modify the NES’s system memory. Fry designed the piece
                     for his “Visually Deconstructing Code” series, a set of small projects aimed at
                     unearthing some of the hidden processes at work in NES code. </p>
                  <p>Other examples of emulation as a revelatory mechanism exist within the
                     communities devoted to forms of what James Newman refers to as “superplay”
                     [Newman 2012a]. Activities like speed-running (both human and tool-assisted),
                     glitch-hunting, sequence-breaking, and other forms of “performative mastery” of
                     games benefit from research conducted with emulation. Many community emulators
                     support tools for memory analysis and even scripting languages for the live
                     manipulation of a running game. This allows player-performers interested in,
                     for example, shaving that last second off of a run or getting past a boss
                     without attacking, to dig beneath the representational surface of the game and
                     mine its system for potential solutions. Some online streamers, like Clyde
                     Mandelin, write custom emulator modifications that allow for live streaming of
                     both their gameplay and aggregated statistics or interactive visualizations of
                     the underlying system.<note> See https://www.youtube.com/user/ClydeMandelin,
                        specifically “Poemato CX's Twitch Stream Magic”
                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX87i71IC7g</note> As we will discuss below,
                     it is becoming clear that a community of practice is developing around the
                     expressive potential of emulators. It’s also a sign that the products of
                     community historical efforts are becoming more aligned with digital humanist
                     insights about technical collaboration between academia and amateurs.<note> See
                        [Rinehart 2014] for a more detailed discussion of the benefits and perils of
                        incidental community archival practices.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, it is also necessary to note that, in placing a running program into
                     an online text, its reduction to that surface may suggest a raft of potentially
                     misleading assertions about the historical play experience. As outlined
                     extensively in the work of preservation-minded historical researchers,
                     emulation, in its erasure of the original executable context, denies the
                     experience of the original hardware [Fernández-Vara 2014; Lowood 2011; Newman
                     2012a; Bogost 2010; Kaltman 2015]. The modern web browser, as a displayed
                     surface, is very different from an Atari-era CRT, and most modern machines do
                     not have a way to interface with original peripherals. Additionally, many
                     emulators try to make the played experience smoother by modifying speed for the
                     sake of accuracy.<note> Some emulators running in constrained environments,
                        like JavaScript emulators in web browsers, need to cut corners to get
                        processing up to an acceptable speed. Other emulators running in native
                        execution contexts, like Microsoft Windows applications, sometimes
                        intentionally slow down processing in order to match the timings of older
                        machines.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>They also remove old constraints on the swapping of disks to load parts of the
                     program in piecemeal and internal memory limitations. However, not all aspects
                     of emulation are a historical loss, since the position of the emulation as
                     running inside a host process allows for the introspection and revelation
                     mentioned in the above examples. The ability that many emulators provide to
                     save and load memory states is also, as we will see, a boon to players and
                     researchers hoping to encounter difficult, confusing or novel locations inside
                     games. </p>
                  <p>A key note about the reductions above is their ability to bring something from
                     “out there in the world” into the text. Usually those studying academic
                     discourse, or the social construction of academic arguments, focus on how that
                     external evidence is transformed into a manifest object in the text. For
                     scientific work, we have mentioned both discourse analysis and science and
                     technology studies as fields that theorize on the reduction and distortion of
                     tacit laboratory knowledge into written discourse.<note> See [Woolgar 1986] for
                        a discussion of the different philosophical roots behind discourse analysis
                        (Continental Philosophy) and STS (Anglo-American Analytic
                        Philosophy).</note> In the humanities, citation and reduction are less
                     epistemologically fraught, since the aim of humanistic discourse is not
                     generally to re-organize some empirical object or finding into a textual form
                     suitable for publication. </p>
                  <p>Within history, the use of manifest intertextuality is critically important to
                     the sustenance of the field, but the act of manifestation does not usually
                     imply a reduction of a finding “out there”; the “out there” of historical
                     sources being mainly other texts. Rarely is the historical object, if there is
                     one, reduced to a form commensurate with the textual surface. In fact, much
                     historical work into objects specifically addresses this issue, a good example
                     being John Law’s work in aircraft design that explicitly constructs different
                     historical strands of documentation to reveal the fractal nature of the object
                     in question. In his case, he looks at the construction of the British TSR2
                     strike and reconnaissance aircraft, and how it exists as an object of
                     engineering, marketing, and an embodiment of the projection of hegemonic force.
                     The aircraft is viewed along different evidentiary axes to support a conclusion
                     about how objects exist in myriad ways depending on how they are documented and
                     narrativized. This again ties back to ideas from discourse analysis, mainly in
                     how the constitutive intertextuality at work in the history of science and
                     technology defines the objects of analysis; a summary from Steve Woolgar: </p>
                  <p>Surely, it is often said, it is absurd to say that we cannot distinguish
                     between a thing and what is said about that thing. But the constitutive view
                     does not prohibit such distinctions. It offers us a way of seeing these
                     distinctions as actively created achievements rather than as pre-given features
                     of our world. In particular, the distinction between talk and objects-of-talk
                     is seen from the constitutive perspective as the upshot, rather than the
                     condition, of discursive work. [Woolgar 1986, 314] </p>
                  <p>The fundamental takeaway is that previously, describing any technical system as
                     a historical object necessitated various forms of reduction and other
                     intertextual strategies to remediate and insert it into a text. With embedded
                     emulation, and to a lesser extent dynamic visualization, embedding the system
                     itself must now be reconciled. When John Law describes his aircraft, he could
                     not bring the aircraft into the text and let the reader hop into the cockpit.
                     With computational systems increasingly the site of construction and reception
                     for scholarly work, and with technical historical objects that are also
                     computational systems, we can literally transcribe discussed objects into
                     discourse and invite the reader to take the flight stick. </p>

               <head>6 Back to Citation and Archives</head>
               <p>In bringing a non-text-based object into textual discourse — like the reductions
                  of image, video, visualization, and emulation above — there is a key link to
                  archives and citation that has not been made explicit. In the case of online
                  documents that incorporate various reductions, those texts are not singular
                  objects but networked organizations contingent on access to the various sources of
                  reduction. If one prints an image alongside text, the image is now part of the
                  textual form, and is, from an archival standpoint, part of the same object. With
                  online work, every page of information is an aggregate object. The basic markup
                  for the page comes from one source, the styling of that page from another, and all
                  the various images and other embedded entities from still others within that same
                  domain or from some other (hopefully trusted) source. When things are embedded —
                  as images, videos, visualizations, and emulations are — they necessitate and
                  depend on the existence and maintenance of stable links to recover their data. </p>
               <p>The maintenance of these links is a significant issue for the stability of
                  knowledge online. Whenever a link leaves its local namespace (assuming that
                  internal network links are maintained, which is not always a given) it relies on
                  the existence, capabilities, and restrictions of a remote hosting repository. For
                  videos, most content links resolve thanks to the embedded link architectures of
                  mass scale video sites like YouTube or Vimeo. This allows the embedder to neither
                  have to maintain their own video server nor provide the bandwidth necessary for
                  playback. It also removes responsibility for intellectual property management and
                  ties access to embedded content to the whims of the content provider. In the <hi
                     rend="italic">Spelunky</hi> example above, Wilson toyed with the constraints of
                  YouTube’s embedded video player to reveal specific salient content inside the
                  game. That action was only made possible by the affordances of YouTube, the
                  repository hosting the content. In the case of historically stable online academic
                  discourse, it should be apparent that any new ability to share or link to digital
                  data incurs a commensurate necessity for a functional and stable repository. The
                  current solutions for video leave a lot to be desired given that they are bound to
                  the corporate imperatives of actors not emphatically concerned with preservation
                  or link stability.<note> This issue must be addressed as we explore the future of
                     academic publishing. An intriguing example is Alexandra Juhasz's <hi
                        rend="italic">Learning from YouTube, </hi>an online book which includes and
                     links to many YouTube videos, published by The MIT Press in partnership with
                     the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture [Juhasz 2011]. Given YouTube’s (and
                     the wider corporate web’s) lack of concern for preservation and stability, one
                     of the first pages readers are likely to encounter (“HOW TO USE THIS
                     VIDEO-BOOK”) suggests that they can “help the project by reporting broken
                     links.” It’s difficult to imagine such a request in a book built on research in
                     a traditional archive. (What form would it even take?) </note>
               </p>
               <p>The tool below is an attempt to organize a prototypical archive for embedded
                  emulated content, and to try and reconcile some of the manifest intertextuality
                  present in game historical work to a more stable set of practices regarding
                  citation and linking. In the case of embedded emulation, the data has similar
                  issues to that of video. Namely, that the IP rights for the distribution of
                  streaming copyrighted gameplay data need to be correctly managed, and that the
                  embedded content be presented in such a way to make it useful for inclusion into
                  texts. The consideration for future scholarly use of emulated content is a way to
                  dictate what a speculative collection of such works would look like at a larger,
                  institutional scale. Additionally, the consistent citation of this content, as an
                  initial condition of the system’s functionality, should be a concern for any
                  future work in the creation of links to new forms of digital expression and
                  reduction. </p>

               <head>7 A Tool for Descriptive and Manifest Citation of Games</head>
               <p>This section outlines the design and functionality of the citation system in the
                  Game and Interactive Software Scholarship Toolkit (GISST). GISST is a suite of
                  tools aimed at helping with common game studies and game historical tasks, and
                  includes a system for the management of manifest citation of both game emulation
                  and game bibliographic references. The citation component of GISST — described
                  below as the “citation tool” — is designed to partially address numerous issues
                  presented above: </p>
               <list type="ordered">
                  <item>The need for more consistent bibliographic citation information for computer
                     games. </item>
                  <item>An example use case for the placement and manipulation of various reductions
                     of computer games into online text (in this case, images, videos and live
                     emulation).</item>
                  <item>The need for a managed archive of the reductions used in (2). </item>
               </list>
               <p>The citation tool functions on three classes of objects — games, performances, and
                  game system states — and resolves issues 1-3 for each. <hi rend="italic">Game
                     objects</hi> are collections of data about a game. This includes both basic
                  descriptive metadata (required for correct bibliographic entries) and links to
                  executable data needed to run the game in browser emulation. <hi rend="italic"
                     >Performance objects</hi> are records of games as played or viewed by a player
                  or group. These records also combine viewable performance data with descriptive
                  metadata. By “viewable performance data” we mean two possible things. One is a
                  collection of image frames — GIFs or video — representing some situated act of
                  play. The other is <hi rend="italic">replay data </hi>— input stream recordings
                  for emulators or replay files for a specific game engine.<note> The term “game
                     engine” is commonly used for software platforms that support particular types
                     of game play experiences. Some are relatively specific, such as the “id Tech”
                     engines primarily used for first-person shooter games. Some are more general,
                     such as the Unity engine, which is used for many types of graphical games — but
                     which would be ill-suited to text adventure or interactive fiction games, for
                     example. However, more broadly, a game’s “engine” can describe the game’s
                     processes as separated from its data. This is why Nathan Altice can describe
                     community-produced data that targets the software and hardware processes of
                     1980s Nintendo Entertainment System games as “spawning fresh games from
                     obsolete engines.” [Altice 2015, 316] (Emulators are discussed in section
                     5.3.)If this sounds like a slippery concept, that’s because it is. As Eike Falk
                     Anderson, Steffen Engel, Peter Comninos, and Leigh McLoughlin put it, “[T]here
                     is disagreement about exactly what a game engine is, with sometimes fundamental
                     differences between definitions” (229). Nevertheless, it remains a useful
                     concept in practice.For any game that displays to a screen, players may attempt
                     to capture game play performances using screen recordings, resulting in a
                     series of image frames. In addition, some games support the creation of “replay
                     files” — which cause the performance to be re-enacted in the game/engine
                     software, reducing file size and making it possible to, for example, change the
                     perspective from which the performance is viewed. Some emulators support
                     interaction through “input streams” — which cause a scripted set of controller
                     events to be executed at particular times. If the input stream is a recording
                     of the controller events of a particular performance, and the game begins from
                     the same computational state, the result will be a reproduction of the
                     performance in the game/engine.</note>
                  <hi rend="italic">Game system states</hi> are snapshots of a game’s run-time
                  memory, either saved by the emulator as a separate file or extracted directly from
                  a system’s memory. </p>
               <p>The tool manages game, performance, and game state records in a database, and
                  allows for the embedding of any of these in a hypertext (assuming executable or
                  viewable performance data is available). The rest of this section briefly accounts
                  for the inclusion of performance in our citation apparatus and then lays out the
                  functionality and potential future work for the tool.</p>
               <div>
                  <head>7.1 Game v Performance</head>
                  <p>The discussion above has mostly dealt with the citation of game objects as a
                     means of presupposing their content and the contours of their gameplay.
                     However, game performances as events are also commonly referenced in scholarly
                     works. Performances result from two activities: games-as-performance, in the
                     case of games tied to explicit geo-temporal contexts (alternate reality games
                     (ARGs), installations, etc.) and gameplay performance. Gameplay performance is
                     the play of a game that is not explicitly tied to a geo-temporal context, but
                     that gains relevance from being situated in one. An example is a particular
                     match at a fighting game tournament, where the event itself highlights game
                     play as performance. The game in this case is not the operative site of
                     performative relevance: its play at the tournament is. If the same match
                     occurred in practice in a dorm room, it would not have the same significance. </p>
                  <p>Game performances as significant historical sources are well discussed in the
                     literature. Clara Fernández-Vara, in her Introduction to Game Analysis, notes
                     that, “we may want to analyze a game that is an event, a be-there-or-be-square
                     type of thing, a performance” [Fernández-Vara 2014, 44]. She describes the
                     need for secondary sources — “paratexts” like video or firsthand description —
                     in helping to reconstruct and corroborate information about a performance. This
                     sentiment is echoed in Henry Lowood’s work on the reconstruction of events that
                     take place in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) [Lowood 2011]. In this
                     case, the study of virtual world game play is more akin to anthropological
                     work. The game itself, while it could be recovered and run through emulation in
                     the future, is devoid of the community that created meaning through the
                     performative space and affordances the world provided. Lowood remarks on the
                     fallacy of an ideal “perfect capture” of every event and input supplied to the
                     virtual world.</p>
                  <p>Even if we save every bit of a virtual world — its software and the data
                     associated with it and stored on its servers, along with a replay of every
                     moment as seen by players — it may still be the case that we have completely
                     lost its history. The essential problem with this approach is that it leaves
                     out the identification and preservation of historical documentation, and these
                     sources are rarely to be found in the data inside game and virtual worlds or on
                     the servers that support them [Lowood 2011, 118].</p>
                  <p>Even with access to game replay files, or reproductions through emulation,
                     evidence of a game performance must also be paired with secondary information
                     to substantiate and analyze it. Our inclusion of performance citations in the
                     tool is to enable a link between the game object’s data and description, and
                     further contextualizing performances. Additionally, the ability to embed
                     emulation in line with historical performance video and description adds
                     further potential for somatic contextualization of game play. By bringing the
                     emulated system to the reader, they can gain a sense of what Steve Swink refers
                     to as “game feel,” an embodied understanding of the game system as felt through
                     the act of play [Swink 2009].<note> Swink’s “game feel” is focused exclusively
                        on continuous input games, like platformers or action titles. Doug Wilson
                        has argued that “game feel” should extend to other types of interactions
                        with computational feedback systems, from menu systems to mouse interaction
                        in strategy games [Wilson 2017]. We take the latter, more liberal view of
                        game feel in the context of providing an emulated system in argument for the
                        significance of a performative act or as a means of elaborating on a deeper
                        understanding of embodied play experiences.</note> Pairing this embodied
                     understanding of a game play system with performances adds another level of
                     intuitive understanding to historical game play acts. </p>

                  <head>7.2 Citation Tool</head>
                  <p>The citation tool has two primary components: </p>
                  <list type="ordered">
                     <item>A command line interface (CLI) responsible for the ingestion of game and
                        performance data, the generation of citations, and the management of the
                        citation database. </item>
                     <item>A web application (the “app”) that enables the live emulation of ingested
                        game data, the live recording of game play performances, and the live
                        recording of computational game states. </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the rest of this section we will use CLI to refer to the first component,
                     and “app” to refer to the second. Their functionality is significantly
                     interrelated, for example the CLI launches the app and the app’s backend server
                     calls the CLI for certain processing tasks. The next two sections provide a
                     very brief technical overview of both components; we refer the reader to our
                     prior work for a more detailed account [Kaltman 2017]. Figure 1 illustrates the
                     relationships between the various components.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Figure 1: GISST components and pipeline. </p>
                  <p>In the GISST pipeline, input resources (1) are fed to the CLI (2), which
                     extracts their information (3) into an extraction table (for URLs) or the
                     citation database (for performance and game data). The Web Application reads
                     from the citation database (4) and the Indexer uses CiteState.js to create
                     further citable resources (5). CiteState.js (the software powering the
                     augmented <hi rend="italic">Doom</hi> walkthrough from our introduction) can
                     then use those resources’ permanent URLs (6) and its own citation function (7)
                     to embed an executable program into a target HTML element (8).</p>
                  <p>Extraction begins with either local filenames or Universal Resource Identifiers
                     (URIs). For games, the extraction files are either game data files or
                     directories containing game data. Providing a URI to the game extraction
                     command assumes that the linked resource hosts information about a particular
                     game; currently, extraction supports game reference URIs for either MobyGames
                     or Wikipedia. Performance extraction only accepts URIs from YouTube presently,
                     but the design is modular and could easily support, for example, archives of
                     game input sequences.<note> http://tasvideos.org/Movies.html contains a listing
                        of different platforms along with downloads for their various “movie”
                        formats, which are usually files of tabulated input sequences. </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Extraction obtains rough, noisy data from the given source or sources, with the
                     assumption that a researcher will clean up the imported metadata. The
                     extraction step is necessary to construct a stable citation because the
                     information provided by a potential resource may exceed the constraints of the
                     database's descriptive metadata scheme or require further disambiguation. As an
                     example, the Wikipedia page for <hi rend="italic">Super Mario Bros.</hi>,
                     originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, combines all
                     information about the title, in all of its different versions and releases,
                     onto a single page. Our Wikipedia extractor presents all of this information to
                     the user and allows them to choose the particular version of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Super Mario Bros.</hi> they wish to later cite. </p>
                  <p>GISST currently allows for extraction from a variety of sources and file types,
                     as shown in Table 1 below:<note> The table does not include game states because
                        the CLI does not ingest arbitrary state data. This is mainly due to the fact
                        that emulated state data is specific to both a game and the emulator
                        supporting it and effectively useless without those dependencies.
                        Additionally, in the case of some of GISST’s supported emulators, like
                        DOSBox, there are no independent save state formats, just data derived from
                        the live emulation during run-time. That said, GISST-saved states should in
                        principle be portable across browsers running the GISST app.</note>

                  <head>7.3 Web Application</head>
                  <p>The GISST app is a standard browser-based web application, with a
                     JavaScript/HTML/CSS front-end designed for use with the Chrome web-browser, and
                     a backend interface that is linked to the same database and ingestion commands
                     as the CLI. This is marked as steps 4 and 5 in Figure 1 above. The app allows
                     for the play, recording and citation of game states through CiteState.js (a
                     suite of automated JavaScript ports of emulators).</p>
                  <p>The app’s interface supports four basic views of citation data: </p>
                  <list type="ordered">
                     <item>A basic listing page for the game and performance citations in the
                        database. </item>
                     <item>A full text search page that includes all citation records and game save
                        state descriptions. </item>
                     <item>A citation listing page that provides active links to previous save
                        states and, for performances, the ability to create quick GIF animations
                        based on a performance video. </item>
                     <item>An indexer page that allows for examination of an emulated game, and the
                        creation of game save states and video recordings. </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Entries 1-3 are mainly presented as data tables supplemented with item 3’s
                     “active links.” The indexer, however, is the primary user interface for game
                     scholars interested in creating new performance data. The indexer integrates
                     live game play with game performance recording, retrieval, and reference tools.
                     The game moments captured in our introductory <hi rend="italic">Doom</hi>
                     example were all acquired and stored via this indexer interface.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>Figure 2: Indexer User Interface. The emulation window is on the left, with a
                     recording of that window displayed on the right. </p>
                  <p>Proceeding to the app’s user interface (displayed in Figure 2), we will briefly
                     describe each button and component. The buttons under the main emulation window
                     provide for most of the data recording features. The user can load the
                     emulation, save a state, load the most recently saved state, control video
                     recording, and mute audio. When a state is saved, it is logged in the
                     “Available States” tab along with a screen shot and generated descriptive
                     information. Clicking on any available state will cause the emulator to
                     immediately load that state into the main window. After a state is selected,
                     the “State” tab in the left side bar lets the user change its descriptive
                     metadata. All changes logged in the side bar are propagated to the server and
                     will show up in search queries. Video recording functions in a similar way. Any
                     time a start-stop sequence is completed, the beginning and ending state of the
                     emulation will be saved along with the video. </p>
                  <p>Each recorded performance appears in the “Available Performances” tab. Clicking
                     on a performance updates the sidebar’s “Performance” tab, allowing for the
                     review of a recorded video and editing of its generated metadata. </p>
                  <p>Any performance or state saved in the analysis tool will appear in the main
                     citation listing page, and on individual pages for each respective game and
                     performance. The state links on each individual page operate as “active links,”
                     in that they will load up the indexer page with the correct state preloaded
                     into the emulator. This makes each active link a link into a running emulation
                     as a specific point. We take up the pedagogical and analytical implications of
                     this in our expert evaluation review (in the next major section of this
                     article). </p>
                  <p>The indexer, in creating and storing the saved states and performance
                     recordings, provides the source material for future links created by the
                     CiteState.js module. The CiteState.js interface allows for a simple description
                     of a target page element and an id from the citation database. CiteState.js
                     then automatically handles the loading of a game, performance, or state, and
                     places it into an HTML element that can be aligned by the user through CSS
                     styling or other means of element positioning (this is steps 6-8 in Figure 1
                     above). This completes the chain from source ingestion through shared linking
                     of a game emulation in a web browser.</p>

                  <head>7.4 Future Work</head>
                  <p>The citation tool opens up numerous opportunities for the dissemination and
                     standardization of game historical sources. For bibliographic record purposes,
                     all the information in a specific citation store could be exported into forms
                     compatible with common citation database formats, like BibTeX, or linked with
                     citation systems, like Zotero.<note> http://www.zotero.org</note> These
                     citations could also automatically include information about a compatible
                     emulator and the file-specific data required by more technical scholars, like
                     the platform and software studies researchers mentioned above. </p>
                  <p>In the realm of reductions, since the emulation is a full computing system
                     running in a web page, its memory and operations are totally available to
                     introspection via other concurrent JavaScript processes. We are already working
                     on including memory manipulation functionality in the CiteState.js interface,
                     which would provide dynamic visualization of a complete program to occur
                     coincidentally in the browser surface. </p>
                  <p>Lastly, since each of the citation types, games, performances, and game states
                     also require a linkage between the citation and some form of born-digital data,
                     new forms of storage and retrieval will be necessary. There is some work on
                     storing and loading emulated systems or sharing the results of emulation
                     produced on cloud-based servers, but still no general solutions for the storage
                     and retrieval of executable software, nor support for citation as envisaged in
                     the functionality of the tool above. </p>
                  <p>The next section — an expert evaluation of GISST’s citation component by
                     practicing game studies scholars and library professionals — also presents some
                     significant ideas for future work. </p>

            <div>
               <head>8 Evaluation</head>
               <p>As described, the citation component of GISST is an argument for more rigorous
                  citation of computer games, and for the augmentation of their expression in game
                  studies discourse. We believe the tool can ease the citation burden for game
                  scholars and allow them to create new types of arguments and expressions about
                  games. To corroborate this belief, we conducted a speculative expert evaluation of
                  the tool, inviting comment from a group of professionals engaged with game study
                  and preservation. The goal of the study was to ascertain if the intentions of the
                  tool were clear, if our thoughts above aligned with those of practicing scholars,
                  and to invite constructive commentary. This section outlines the evaluation and
                  its responses, and how those responses aligned with our goals and ignited ideas
                  for future work and collaboration. </p>
               <p>The evaluation consisted of a set of 11 questions to be answered based on a
                  5-minute introduction to the CLI and web app components of the tool. We sent the
                  evaluation to a select group of practitioners consisting of game designers, game
                  studies scholars, and librarians. These groups align with those we hope will
                  benefit most from the citation tool. All those chosen were already aware of GISST,
                  and the video served as a reminder of functionality that had at some point been
                  demonstrated to them in person. Responses were collected from seven people through
                  an online form. Respondents included: Henry Lowood, curator of the History of
                  Science and Technology and Film and Media Collections at Stanford University;
                  Chaim Gingold, a game designer and historical researcher; Nathan Altice, a
                  professor and game historian at the University of California, Santa Cruz; James
                  Newman, a professor and game historian at the University of BathSpa; Glynn
                  Edwards, head of technical services in Special Collections at Stanford University
                  Libraries; Shane Denson, a professor of Art History at Stanford; Douglas Wilson, a
                  game designer and lecturer at RMIT University; and a professor who wished to
                  remain anonymous.<note> Reviewers commented on the gender imbalance (6:2
                     male/female) among the evaluation set. Initial requests for commentary were
                     sent to a slightly more diverse set (9:5) of evaluators, however limits due to
                     publishing deadlines prevented further pursuit of more gender parity. Continued
                     evaluative work on the GISST tool set will be sure to more suitably address
                     this disparity. </note> The remainder of this section will describe the
                  responses to the tool, followed by recommended improvements. </p>
               <div>
                  <head>8.1 Discussion</head>
                  <p>Overall, the responses were overwhelmingly positive, with one game studies
                     scholar stating that the availability of the tools “could be huge” for the
                     field. The respondents hailed from an overlapping set of backgrounds, but the
                     responses aligned along two basic paths. The first was how the tool could
                     affect game studies and game historical practices in citation, and what the
                     tool could contribute, through state citation and retrieval, to students and
                     game studies scholars. The second turned toward more of the potential for
                     preservation that the tool presents in its management of game citation and game
                     states.</p>
                  <p>The potential influences noted for game studies practice included (1) the
                     formalization of game citation practices, (2) the removal of obstacles to game
                     access, (3) the automation of game history tasks currently taken on in an
                     ad-hoc manner, and (4) the presentation of deeper, and more comprehensive,
                     historical analysis. Multiple respondents noted the tool’s implicit call for a
                     more “formal and robust” citation practice for games, with Henry Lowood stating
                     that the tool provided a first take on a “citation framework where there was
                     none.” The tool functioned as a way to call attention to the potential of
                     better citation practices. James Newman explained, “a contribution of the tool
                     will surely be to heighten discussion of citation and [its] limits and
                     variations in current practices.” This therefore aligns with our arguments for
                     more consistent citation practice in the game studies section above. </p>
                  <p>Altice, Newman and Shane Denson highlighted the tools’ ability to provide an
                     easier route to specific game locations and gameplay sequences. Altice and
                     Denson specifically work on comparative analysis of game versions and
                     emulators, so the potential for the tool to make parts of games more reachable
                     was appreciated [Altice 2015; Denson 2017]. This concern for access to game
                     history also extended to the other scholars, who all remarked on the ability of
                     the tool to make classroom lectures more engaging, and according to Altice
                     provide for “in-class play that isn’t contingent upon equipment or playing
                     skill.” He felt this allowed for a “wider breadth of examples” since lengthy
                     equipment set up or hours spent trying to get to a particular spot in a game
                     could be removed from the equation. Altice also felt that this approach could
                     make exploring games like “flipping to a relevant page in a book, which could
                     make citation more prolific and illustrative.” He also believed that playing a
                     game’s citation would have a more powerful rhetorical effect than other forms
                     of reduction, nicely pairing with our claims about rhetoric and game feel
                     above. Chaim Gingold also felt that the tools provided a significant new way to
                     share content with students. He imagined providing state citations to students
                     in the future as one might today assign videos on YouTube or Twitch. </p>
                  <p>The tools as an automated solution for citation also struck a chord with the
                     researchers who already use an assortment of ad-hoc solutions for emulation,
                     and gameplay recordings and analysis. Newman already organizes a rather complex
                     chain of tools for gameplay capture and analysis, and the tools provided a way
                     to alleviate some of the burden in getting multiple programs and systems to
                     work together. Gingold also noted that the tools could allow students to engage
                     in the types of historical analysis that are only available to
                     interdisciplinary scholars with programming and humanities backgrounds.
                     Students could incorporate “their interaction into their scholarship (like
                     us!),” and provide them a starting point for more detailed analysis of design
                     and game play interactions. </p>
                  <p>The last major response area (in this first thread of responses, on game
                     studies and game historical practices) was about the ability for the tools to
                     provide a new level of analysis for game studies and game history. Newman noted
                     that having access to a GISST-like system would remove the need to engage in
                     extended descriptions of game play or game scenes. If a citation is also a
                     playable instance, he could rely on the reader to play what he was talking
                     about, and then focus his time on deeper analysis instead of front-loading
                     arduous amounts of descriptive text to set up his points. </p>
                  <p>Newman suggested that being able to refer to a persistent recording or
                     savestate would give him increased confidence in writing more detailed analyses
                     of sequences of gameplay and would, hopefully, alleviate some of the need for
                     description in favour of close commentary and annotation. </p>
                  <p>Denson concurred, stating that “arguments can [now] be illustrated directly
                     (through video, for example) and even mounted through hands-on engagement
                     (gameplay) rather than merely discursive description.” </p>
                  <p>The second major thread in the responses highlighted the tools’ implicit
                     effects on game preservation and the organization of game history. Some viewed
                     the tools as an argument for more robust digital repositories able to handle
                     and retrieve executable content. One noted that the tools displayed the power
                     of centralizing documentation about games and how the coordination of tools
                     could foster new expressions through the linkages of different technologies. In
                     this case, the concordance of emulation, documented citation, and gameplay
                     videos invited a discussion of the need for coherent underlying infrastructure
                     to support preservation of those outputs. Lowood agreed, saying that the tools
                     put “issues around documentation, archiving and gameplay preservation front and
                     center.” Glynn Edwards also focused on the needs to create consistent metadata
                     schemes for the emulated save states and companion documentation. There was a
                     general agreement among the preservation professionals that the tools’
                     existence, in and of themselves, functioned as an argument for better
                     preservation practice, and they were excited to begin working towards
                     solutions.</p>
                  <p>Another small preservation note was that of the tools’ ability to allow for
                     quick validation of game files, and game data integrity. By ingesting an
                     executable into the system, one can easily check if it is compatible with a
                     specific emulator, and if it is actually the file it claims to be. Lowood also
                     noted that the tool could push repositories to negotiate better IP rights
                     access to executable software, or, at the very least, further reveal the need
                     for that work to be figured out (see footnote 25). </p>

               <div>
                  <head>8.2 Improvements and Future Work</head>
                  <p>Given the positive response to the work, most of the critical discussion of the
                     tools pointed solely to means of immediate improvement and new features. In the
                     main, many respondents wanted the tools to continue development of better UI
                     and user accessibility features. Right now, most of the ingestion apparatus
                     occurs on the command line, and Altice correctly felt that “freeing the tool
                     from dependence on the CLI” would be necessary since “this would be a
                     non-starter for many (most?) scholars without a technical background.” Many
                     also pointed out that while the technology had obvious potential, as noted in
                     the last section, it needed a set of coherent examples and illustrative case
                     studies. The tools represented more of a “starting point” for new discussions
                     in game studies and game preservation but were not really yet a solution
                     (though with work they could be). This appears to show that the tools are a
                     ripe ground for future work, as just making them more accessible and easier to
                     use excited many of the respondents. One even requested a basic tutorial for
                     the current alpha prototypes since they felt they required hands-on access to
                     fully appreciate the prototypes’ potential use cases. </p>
                  <p>Another general request was for the inclusion of more emulators than the four
                     currently available to allow both for comparison of the emulators themselves,
                     and to help with further preservation questions in the description of the
                     configured environments needed to support game data. Many noted that the tools,
                     in both their analytic and preservation potential, pointed to uses outside of
                     games, and would be a boon for software studies and general software
                     preservation. This was edifying, since another thread of our overall thesis is
                     that most advances for game software history are also significantly applicable
                     to broader classes of software. </p>
                  <p>Future work dovetailed with the requests for more system support and usability.
                     Many wanted to see what a larger, shared repository of game state citation
                     could afford, either in a classroom setting or for executable collections in
                     libraries and archives. There was also a call for more explanation of the
                     citation description formats, and perhaps even integration with current
                     scholarly citation tool sets like Zotero. Multiple respondents also mentioned
                     the potential for annotation tools to add voice overs to videos, and record and
                     remark on game play input traces. Gingold specifically was excited about the
                     ability to introspect on the running emulations, and visualize their system
                     dynamics and memory states, similar to our own thoughts on future work
                     above.</p>
                  <p>In closing, the responses to the tool essentially agree with the arguments
                     presented above. Respondents believed that embedded emulations represent a new
                     form of expression for game history, and that tools themselves function as an
                     argument for further work on technical system visualization, documentation
                     management, game citation, and preservation. We believe that this suitably
                     validates the tools, the methodologies they support, and theories behind them
                     in ways that not only legitimate them as contributions to multiple fields, but
                     as a starting point for more significant future work, and perhaps even future
                     research areas. </p>

               <head>9 Conclusion</head>
               <p>At the beginning of this article, we argued that game and game performance
                  citation are underdeveloped, immature aspects of scholarly practice. This
                  proceeded through a more in-depth discussion of the purpose and functionality of
                  citation in both scholarly discourses in general, and towards the ways in which
                  games are a new and special case. As a result, the system we described to manage
                  and create playable manifest citations required not just novel engineering effort
                  but a theoretical consideration of the types of objects within and around games
                  that could be leveraged in arguments. The initial prototypes of the GISST system
                  actually preceded and evolved in dialogue with our new conceptualization of game
                     citation.<note> Note that this is conceptualization of GISST as a system and
                     not “conceptualization” in the ontological sense.</note> In attempting to find
                  ways to cite games, we incidentally were forced to create the technical means for
                  those citations, and to figure out how those citations could be made available and
                  useful for argumentation. This then contributed new means of historical
                  expression: we realized that the results of the citation system creation
                  represented a new general class of activity in the design of systems to support
                  game scholarship. The citation system is a central component of GISST because we
                  believe that citation work is a necessary precondition for a whole range of
                  possible tools for game history, game studies, and software studies works. </p>
               <p>The citation work elaborated on a means for the manifest citation of new objects
                  into scholarly discourse, but it also supported those objects’ creation and
                  storage. As a result, this opened up those objects (performance videos, executable
                  game play, and indexed game states) to further analysis. In addition to
                  functioning as a form of reduction in supporting textual discourse, the objects
                  are also now organized and manipulable by any potential future extensions of
                  GISST’s toolset. As mentioned in Future Work above, this could mean input analysis
                  and replay of game play — a means to further look at instances of “superplay” like
                  speed running or glitch-hunting — and introspection on the game’s system state and
                  run-time memory. In tracking the needs for a citable base of games, performance,
                  and states, we have opened up a whole new set of resources and opportunities for
                  exploration and expression through scholarship. This provides yet another example
                  of how the stabilization of historical resources can lend itself to new uses and
                  articulations.</p>
               <p>GISST resolves many key issues in game citation, but more importantly it comprises
                  a compelling argument in the ongoing development of norms and standards in game
                  scholarship. It encodes in its database schema and user interface a view of what
                  it means to talk about a game or game performance in a recoverable, useful way
                  which is not prone to presupposition. It is an instance of the rhetorical approach
                  promoted by Ramsay and by Burdick et al: we “contribute to humanities theory by
                  forging tools that quite literally embody humanities-centered views regarding the
                  world” [Burdick 2016, 104].</p>
