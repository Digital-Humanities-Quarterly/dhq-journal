                  <p>Black graduate students from all disciplines, particularly Black women, who may otherwise
                     be isolated in our respective institutions, have taken to the digital as a space to
                     resist the marginalizing ways of the Academy as it exists. We fight, but we also care
                     for each other, promote transparency about the graduate school process, lift as we
                     climb, build professional networks and friendships alike. We utilize the digital in
                     innovative ways to transform our separate experiences into collectives. Blogs, podcasts,
                     Instagram accounts, twitter threads, digital writing groups, and more all serve as
                     methods of resisting and engaging in carework. This essay will explore the various
                     ways Black graduate students have decided that the “revolution will not be televised” -- but it will be online. [<a class="ref" href="#everett2002">Everett 2002</a>]</p>

                     identify myself as a digital humanist was a direct result of crafting, curating and

                     It practices a form of Black digital feminism, which communications scholar Catherine
                     Knight Steele argues centralizes agency and our ability to prioritize ourselves in
                     digital spaces [<a class="ref" href="#steele2021">Steele 2021</a>]. Our digital media making is as Moya Bailey argues, “a form
                     of self-preservation and harm reduction that disrupts the onslaught of the problematic

                     use Twitter, Instagram, blogs, vlogs and podcasts to “spill the tea” on all aspects of
                     graduate life. An entire network of Black graduate digital content creators exists,
                     who
                     produce resources on everything from wellness and finance, to practical skills like

                     my claims (which take the form of articles, tweets, blog posts, and more ephemeral
                     digital media, such as Instagram Live videos) reflect my experience building networks
                     on
                     Twitter, via blogs, and connecting with other content creators for other engagements:
                     webinars, podcast episodes, and digital writing groups, to name a few. In the years
                     since beginning my journey to the doctorate, Black women graduate students online
                     have
                     been integral to my success: they have sent me care packages during difficult moments
                     in
                     the program, they have forwarded my name for opportunities because they saw my tweets
                     on
                     the topic, we have held weekly pandemic watch parties using Twitter hashtags like
                     #KorraKickback and #CrystalGemCrew, and we have organized together to support each
                     other’s individual ventures, appearing on each other’s blogs and podcasts and online
                     summits.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e249">[1]</a> Simply put, the sources critical to this project were
                     selected because of their personal impact on me — my personal orientation towards
                     what
                     qualifies as academic work, as well as, my well-being as a person. Though one may
                     dismiss the value of personal connections as the premise for a scholarly study, I
                     will
                     note that collectives, particularly those who center marginalized people, take seriously
                     (Black) feminist ethics seriously. Think of the Combahee Collective, <a href="https://femtechnet.org/" onclick="window.open('https://femtechnet.org/'); return false" class="ref">FemTechNet</a>, and more recently the digital
                     project and online community curated by digital humanities scholar and historian,
                     Jessica Marie Johnson, and scholar of Afro-Latinx literature, Yomaira C. Figueroa,

                     collectives are intentional about developing digital havens of care while promoting
                     rigorous intellectual inquiry and centering joy, tasks which I find present in the
                     online networks Black women graduate students have created. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> This essay also takes cues from digital autoethnographic methodologies used by theorist
                     Moya Bailey to self-reflexively examine my own place in this network of Black graduate
                     students and how we occupy and use online spaces [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2015">Bailey 2015</a>]. The essay draws from the
                     multi-modal nature of Black Studies and uses narrative to underscore salient pieces
                     of
                     theory, as personal narrative is important to both Critical Race Theory as well as
                     Black
                     Feminist Theory. “Anecdotes,” as many like to call storytelling and narrative, are at
                     the heart of Black digital humanities. If, as Brock writes, “all technologies are
                     culturally and socially shaped,” then it follows that the stories which create our
                     cultures and social realities are integral to how we use technology and how our use
                     of
                     these technologies reshape them <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#brock2020">#brock2020</a></span>. Therefore, the stories and shared experiences
                     that unite Black women graduate students inform how we have used technology to resist,
                     work, and celebrate together.</div>

                     <cite class="title italic">Bodies of Information: Intersectional Feminism and the Digital
                        Humanities </cite> [<a href="#losh2019">2019</a>], offers an important insight to the way work is often parceled
                     in the Academy. Brown here points to the fact that women and femme scholars are often
                     saddled with additional service labor unlike their male counterparts. This includes,
                     for
                     example, serving on diversity committees, panels on status of gender (or race) in
                     the
                     Academy/one’s given field, or doing work for university projects that may not count
                     towards one’s tenure file. However, Brown’s argument does not quite address the
                     intersections of race with this statement. Scholars of color often shoulder the extra
                     emotional labor of service positions related to their racial or ethnic identities,
                     as
                     well as providing mentorship for undergraduate students that come to them in search
                     of a
                     professor that can understand them. These additional services begin as we take on

                     outside of the classroom <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bailey2020">#bailey2020</a></span>. Legal scholar and critical race theorist
                     Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw aptly describes, spaces meant for Black people are often

                     Black women find ourselves often as the sole representative of either or both Black

                     Black
                     people or women, ignoring the heterogeneity of both groups. As Patricia Hill Collins
                     [<a href="#collins1991">1991</a>] informs us, “Despite the common challenges confronting African-American women as

                     While many Black women graduate students are unified by common themes of gendered

                     violence, difficulty navigating controlling images of Black women based stereotypes,
                     such as perceptions about our anger, and the resulting frustration and fatigue of

                     For
                     some, Black studies methodologies and Black life is critical to the core of our

                     anthropology, humanities scholars, for example. For students of the hard sciences,
                     as

                     difficult to combine issues of race with their objects of study. In a recent
                     #ShareTheMic event in collaboration with the graduate wellness and lifestyle blog,
                     @PhDBalance, Whitmore spoke to the feeling of being torn: being <em class="emph">either
                        </em>an engineer <em class="emph">or </em>someone whose life is impacted by issues of
                     race. The academy encourages, <em class="emph">forces, </em>us to compartmentalize when
                     Black feminist theory tells us that multiple truths may exist at once. We are not
                     able
                     to separate out our identities, in the same way that Black women are both Black and
                     woman at the same time without needing to choose “which comes first.”</div>

                     women in “the digital and future,” examining questions of fantasy, digital culture, and
                     what could be. It attracted many students, particularly Black women undergraduates,
                     looking for a space in which they could be intellectual rigorous about issues of
                     personal concern and importance to them while also feeling safer than they might in
                     other spaces. The uniqueness of the course was also indebted to its digital nature;
                     we
                     organized via Blackboard, our content management system, utilized a class Tumblr blog

                     It
                     was a situation that did not call for translation but imaginative speculation and

                     intuitive which would lead to greater self-expression, offering more space for
                     reflection with themselves and their peers. There is always much to learn from
                     discipline, but more, I think, from freedom. As much as I learn from my Black woman
