                  <h2>Abstract</h2>


                  <p>This brief, invited “metareflection” identifies the most exciting questions in
                     digital humanities and cultural heritage as those opened up by a potential
                     redistribution of power and redesign of our social and technological
                     infrastructure inspired by Black Studies, arts, and digital practice. What
                     might it mean to shift from extractive and controlled modes of digital research
                     and curation to ones that are generative, healing, and truly open-ended? What
                     will happen if we succeed in empowering and centering individuals, collections,
                     and community concerns that have long been marginalized? What might the DH
                     community build next, if we make necessary changes in capital, focus, and
                     control — and embrace the shaping role of the choices that each of us make
                     within living systems every day?</p>
               </div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">The necessary project of <em class="emph">reshaping and
                     reforming our digital humanities and cultural heritage infrastructure</em> —
                  along the more liberatory, generative, reparative, equitable, and critically
                  informed lines of what Jessica Marie Johnson calls “Black digital practice” — has
                  barely begun [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson2018</a>].</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">By <em class="emph">infrastructure</em>, I mean the full
                  suite of social and technological systems that converge in DH and the work of
                  memory institutions: platforms and tools, certainly; but also systems of
                  selection, arrangement, and description of cultural materials deemed worthy of
                  attention — and the practices that shape those decisions at scale, distributing or
                  reifying authority, security, and privilege. These latter range from our very
                  conception of how funding and resourcing can function in this sphere, to our
                  practices of hiring, evaluating scholars for tenure and promotion, and instituting
                  organizational habits and patterns that either retain and uplift people of color
                  or harm and drive them away. It is tempting to frame this complex and eroded
                  infrastructure — in all its overwhelming fullness — as something the present
                  generation of DH scholars, librarians, archivists, museum workers, technologists,
                  and administrators has simply inherited and must drag along. But that would be to
                  diminish the shaping role of the choices we make within living systems, every
                  day.</div>

                  an activist Black or Africana studies offers the digital humanities. Black
                  scholarship and organizing on the one hand, and human survival and flourishing on
                  the other are deeply interlinked. Professions and institutions that persist in old
                  patterns without surcease — despite overwhelming evidence that change is needed
                  and a better world is possible — participate in the same willfully
                  self-destructive logics that drive environmental degradation, piss-poor pandemic
                  response, and emboldened White supremacy.</div>

               <div class="ptext" id="p4">I offer here — as an invited “meta-reflection” — a brief
                  set of concepts and concerns that have become most meaningful to me as an academic
                  and administrator, in setting my own agendas and the organizational ones I am able
                  to influence.</div>

               <div class="ptext">
                  <ol class="list">
                     <li class="item">First, thanks to scholars like Johnson, Moya Bailey, Kim
                        Gallon, Marisa Parham, and Safiya Noble, we can feel increasingly confident
                        that an unfruitful techno-utopianism in DH is well and truly dead. It is now
                        evident that the same tools and systems that make generative and
                        counter-cultural Black digital practice possible have the potential to be
                        (or already are) technologies of misrepresentation and misogynoir, of the
                        continued quantification of BIPOC bodies, and of surveillance and control.<br />
                        <br />But that is not to say that more hopeful, technological futures have
                        been foreclosed. I hang my hopes on a core tenet of Afrofuturism, as
                        outlined by Kodwo Eshun and other artists and thinkers: that <em
                           class="emph">the primary marker of a people’s autonomy lies in their
                           ability to craft and control their own, collective intellectual
                           infrastructure</em>. I therefore ask: what generational imaginations will
                        be liberated, for the benefit of everyone, when cultural heritage systems,
                        digital libraries, and techno-social platforms of all kinds are built around
                        new philosophies of organization and community ownership — for instance, no
                        longer on progress narratives and master-slave or parent-child paradigms, or
                        on admin/moderator-based models of control, but on frameworks with roots in
                           <em class="emph">ubuntu</em>, cooperatively governed, holistically
                        understood, and nurtured to new ends? <br />
                        <br />The implications for our digital libraries, archives, museums, and
                        research infrastructures are extreme. As just one example — which, inspired
                        by Rasheedah Phillips, I have explored in a number of talks and essays —
                        truly supporting Black futures will not only require ceding ownership over
                        history and its digital delivery mechanisms, but even challenging regulated,
                        linear time.</li>
                     <li class="item">Doing this needed design work requires <em class="emph">a
                           fundamental shift, not only in institutional but in personal
                        control</em>. I believe that the majority-white generation of leaders who
                        presently dominate cultural heritage and DH need to make this shift
                        possible, by deliberately leveraging our power and privilege to resource
                        Black-led projects and to position BIPOC, queer, and other minoritized
                        colleagues as voices of authority. Then, most importantly, we need to get
                        out of the way. <br />
                        <br />The same systems that have positioned us to do this work will — at a
                        moment when “diversity” efforts have become institutionally trendy —
                        reinforce and reward our remaining in loci of power past our usefulness in
                        supporting others. Alternately, such systems will remove us prematurely when
                        it becomes evident we do not support <em class="emph">them</em>. Therefore,
                        we must commit to the project, wherever it takes us. It is also crucial we
                        recognize and vocally acknowledge that our (perhaps newly) good and earnest
                        intent does not wipe away past harms or preclude new ones, nor does it
                        substitute for the embodied experiences and deep expertise of scholars and
                        archivists of Black culture. </li>
                     <li class="item">
                        <em class="emph">Capital, too, can be shifted</em>, as we have recently seen
                        through the altered priorities and patterns of decision-making that have
                        come with changes in leadership in our major funding agencies. This shift
                        needs to happen in our libraries, digital humanities centers, museums, and
                        archives as well — for budgets are moral documents. Resourcing cannot
                        productively proceed along the charity-based frameworks that groups like the
                        Shift Collective identify as problematic in funding community archives, and
                        which have propped up what <cite class="title italic">INCITE!</cite> terms
                        the “nonprofit industrial complex.” Scholars of race, class, and labor
                        (whose work reinforces the expressed, lived experiences of presumed
                        beneficiaries of such partnerships and gifts) demonstrate compellingly that
                        large organizations too often work against their ostensible and noble aims —
                        serving instead to extract resources and, in the case of nonprofits, not to
                        elevate dissent, but to channel and quell it. <br />
                        <br />Instead, robust networks of <em class="emph">mutual aid</em> — based
                        in equity and reciprocity, and meeting actual, core needs of our communities
                        — are as necessary in DH and digital libraries as they are in the urban and
                        rural settings of our failing state. The daily maintenance and long-term
                        sustainability of digital humanities projects (not merely as technical
                        systems but as <em class="emph">human</em> ones) is an unsolved problem in
                        our institutions and town-gown collaborations as currently configured.
                        Top-down funding models, well directed, can spark desperately needed,
                        momentary change — but may never sustain nor truly serve the goals of a new,
                        grassroots Black digital practice. </li>

                  and the political, ecological, and interdisciplinary projects of decolonization
                  are on trajectories long and broad. We have pathways forward and tantalizing
                  hints, but can scarcely imagine what it will mean to shift from extractive modes
                  of digital research and curation — quantifying, fragmenting, pinning, hoarding —
                  to ones that are generative, healing, open-ended, and which make us whole. What
