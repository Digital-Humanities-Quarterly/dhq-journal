            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>This paper presents a <q>virtual archive</q> of women’s epistolary exchange in
               19th-century Finland. By harmonising metadata from over 1.2 million letters and over
               100,000 correspondents across key cultural heritage organisations and leveraging
               linked open data, we gain an unprecedented view of 19th-century epistolary
               communication and 20th-century archival practices. Using quantitative analysis,
               enriched metadata, and network visualisations, we explore the gendered nature of
               these collections. Are women archival protagonists, or are their materials embedded
               within the collections of male relatives? Do the data reveal overlooked women with
               extensive archival networks absent from historical narratives? We introduce the
               framework of <q>critical collection history,</q> which combines theoretical debates
               and research interests from critical archival studies and digital history and
               combines them with contemporary digital methods. This approach underscores the
               necessity for scholars using data-driven methods in historical research to critically
               engage with digitised archives. Moreover, critical collection history highlights how
                  <q>big cultural heritage metadata</q> can expose archival biases and enhance our
               understanding of source limitations – biases that digital scholarship may
               unintentionally perpetuate.</p>

            <p>Who gets remembered in the archives? This article explores how 1.2 million letters
               reveal hidden networks of 19th-century Finnish women — and what their traces (or
               absence) say about history, memory, and digital methods.</p>

      <body>
         <div>
            <head>1. Introduction</head>
            <p>A few years ago, we contacted the key cultural heritage organisations in Finland and
               asked what we thought was a simple question touching on central historical source
               material: <q>How many nineteenth-century letters do you have in your collections?</q>
               The answer was simple, though not quite what we expected: <q>There is no way of
                  knowing.</q> This means that neither the organisations nor the humanities scholars
               who regularly use these materials have a comprehensive view of the extent or basic
               structural characteristics of these collections. Consequently, we cannot assess their
               inherent biases or distortions, nor can we evaluate the representativeness of the
               collections in relation to nineteenth-century <q>epistolary cultures</q>.</p>
            <p>A reasonable follow-up question is why information about archived material is
               important. After all, scholars have successfully used the contents of epistolary
               collections to answer a wide variety of historical research questions since the
               establishment of national and other archival institutions and the development of
               historical methods based on primary sources. A lack of interest in the <q>logics</q>
               or <q>ethnographies</q>
               <ptr target="#dirks2002"/>of complete archival collections is likely due to
               hermeneutic and microhistorical research interests among scholars immersed in
               historical epistolary exchange. It is also due to the difficulty of obtaining
               accurate and comparable quantitative data on vast and diverse materials accumulated
               over decades or even centuries and catalogued in astonishingly diverse ways. However,
               when combined with the latest digital humanities technologies, collection-level
               archival metadata offers untapped potential for historical enquiry.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we suggest that the research agenda of digital historians should be
               expanded to include questions about the composition of archival collections. We
               analyse a new digital archive constructed by combining letter metadata (e.g.
               information about senders, recipients, dates and quantities of letters) from
               databases, finding aids and archival catalogues of person and family archives held in
               various Finnish cultural heritage organisations. This <quote rend="inline">big
                  metadata</quote>
               <ptr target="#enqvist_pikkanen2024"/> transcends organisational boundaries, enabling
               us to obtain quantifiable and comparable information about the collections. When we
               transform it into linked open data and connect it to external sources, such as
               biographical and other datasets and ontologies, we can enrich the data with
               categories not present in the archival metadata, such as the gender of letter writers
               and recipients. This allows us to observe relations that are simply not detectable in
               traditional archives of printed finding aids or organisational archival
               databases.</p>
            <p>This paper argues that a fruitful intersection exists between digital humanities,
               computational humanities, and critical archival studies, which we refer to as <quote
                  rend="inline">critical collection history</quote>. While it may be possible to
               conduct such research using traditional methods, we aim to demonstrate that, at its
               most effective and ambitious, critical collection history is digital collection
               history. Repurposing information stored in archival finding aids and other
               repositories of archival metadata using computational methods provides us with an
               unprecedented and powerful tool with which to explore the interplay between
               historical source criticism and the archival politics of inclusion and exclusion
               (Whose materials are preserved by cultural heritage organisations and made available
               for scholarly and other purposes?). This approach also allows us to gain new
               perspectives on the interaction of historical actors within past contexts.</p>
            <p>There is a well-established international scholarly tradition of compiling and
               editing carefully curated collections of correspondence. In the last 15 years, such
               data have been published as digital research resources and, in many cases, as linked
               open data. Projects such as the EU-funded large-scale Reassembling the Republic of
               Letters (RRL), the Dutch Circulation of Knowledge and Learned Practices in the
               17th-century Dutch Republic (CKCC) and the German correspondence metadata aggregator
               correspSearch, mainly focus on the epistolary materials of learned men, because
               traditional epistolary editions have centred on this group.</p>
            <p>Our material allows us to adopt a more comprehensive perspective. In what follows, we
               will address the gendered aspects of nineteenth-century epistolary collections in
               Finland. We are particularly interested in the traces that nineteenth-century women
               left in archival collections. The nineteenth century has been characterised as the
               golden age of letter writing <ptr target="#lahtinen_etal2011"/> and women have been
               identified as the main protagonists of this development <ptr
                  target="#monagle_etal2023"/>. Does quantitative analysis of the collected
               epistolary metadata confirm these qualitative findings? Based on our data, did women
               play a prominent role in epistolary communication? Do they <q>own</q> their
               collections and archives? By delving into the collected metadata, can we find
               individuals who are not part of our current scholarly canon? Throughout the paper, we
               will revisit a broader question: Does the material tell us more about
               twentieth-century archival practices or particular developments in nineteenth-century
               society?</p>
            <p>Compared to previous publications of linked open data on epistolary metadata, there
               are certain methodological and interpretative difficulties associated with the use of
               large collections of metadata gathered directly (<q>bottom-up</q>) from cultural
               heritage organisations. The primary challenges pertain to the commensurability of the
               archival collections themselves and the validation of the results. There are no
               comparable epistolary metadata datasets that we can use to measure the significance
               and/or Finnish and nineteenth-century specificity of our findings. The best approach
               is to use the entire dataset to provide context and calibration for its constituent

            <head>2. Literature Review</head>
            <p>The rapid expansion of big data and digital humanities since the early 2000s has
               emphasised the importance of understanding the shape or contours of (digital)
               archives and corpora. The research framework proposed in this paper is similar to
               recent studies that have examined the <quote rend="inline">anatomies</quote> of
               historical data collections and the processes involved in their creation, both before
               and during digitisation (e.g. <ptr target="#tolonen_etal2022"/>, <ptr
                  target="#beelen_etal2023"/>, <ptr target="#ortolja-baird_nyhan_2022"/>). It has
               been suggested that large digital datasets require a new kind of critical attitude;
               those who produce and use such data must pay particular attention to its local
               context: how it was acquired and prepared, its strengths and weaknesses, and whether
               it is fit for purpose <ptr target="#loukissas_2019" loc="8, 195"/>, <ptr
                  target="#ahnert_etal2020" loc="54-55"/>. At the same time, it has been recognised
               that much digitised historical material can be analysed using computational methods.
               Indeed, quantitative analysis is particularly effective when we want to interrogate
               the characteristics, structures, and properties of digital archives and collections
               and reflect on the relationship between datasets and the phenomena they represent or
               model <ptr target="#hyvonen_etal2021" loc="53"/>, <ptr target="#guldi_2023" loc="29"
               />, <ptr target="#bode_2020" loc="4-5"/>.</p>
            <p>Over the past few decades, researchers in archival and cultural studies have been
               addressing the same questions, albeit mostly in the context of analogue archives,
               close-reading individual collections. Since the archival turn of the 1990s and early
               2000s, there has been growing interest in analysing the processes involved in
               creating, organising, appraising, and describing archival holdings, as well as the
               ways in which these processes reproduce and/or challenge existing hierarchies,
               dominant discourses, and ideologies (<ptr target="#edquist_2021" loc="109"/>; see
               also <ptr target="#schwartz_cook2002"/>, <ptr target="#taavetti2016"/>; <ptr
                  target="#ketelaar2017"/>; <ptr target="#mikkola_etal2019"/>. Critical archival
               studies pay attention to the processes prior to the possibility of digitisation. Like
               critical theory on a wider social scale, these studies are emancipatory in nature
                  <ptr target="#caswell_etal2017" loc="2"/>. They seek to highlight injustices in
               current archival research and practice, offering recommendations for improvement. As
               with researchers working with large digital corpora, the importance of analysing the
               logics, classification systems and exclusions of archival collections has been
               emphasised <ptr target="#dirks2002"/>. Recently, digital techniques have emerged for
               studying curatorial practices and the historical and cultural context of museum
               curation and archival appraisal (e.g. <ptr target="#salway_baker2020"/>; <ptr
                  target="#lange_etal2022"/>, <ptr target="#enqvist_pikkanen2024"/>). Paradigmatic
               quantitative studies of letter collections are the results of the aforementioned RRL
               project (e.g. <ptr target="#hotson_aallnig2019"/>), as well as various case studies
               that use network analysis (e.g. <ptr target="#ahnert_ahnert2019"/>).</p>

            <p>3 Description of dataset</p>
            <p>Our study uses information from letter catalogues and databases from the Grand Duchy
               of Finland (1809–1917). However, as sets of correspondence often extend beyond the
               designated end year of 1917, we have also included these data where available.<note>
                  The data has been collected and processed in the digital humanities consortium
                  project Constellations of Correspondence: Large and Small Networks of Epistolary
                  Exchange in the Grand Duchy of Finland (2021–2025), funded by the Research Council
                  of Finland (decision numbers 339828, 340834 and 339918).</note> The dataset is
               available online<note> The dataset has been published on Zenodo: <ref
                     target="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15210589"
                     >https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15210589</ref>.</note>, <quote rend="inline"
                  >upcycling</quote> these collections for reuse as FAIR data for research, as
               suggested by <ptr target="#scheltjens2023"/>. The current version of the dataset
               comprises around 1.2 million letters featuring approximately 114,052 unique actors
               (senders and recipients) from nine organisations and four digital editions (see Table
                  1)<note> The dataset does not include archives from public entities, as these were
                  excluded from the data collection process due to project resource
                  constraints.</note>.</p>
            <p>Letter catalogues have also been used to create datasets in various other projects.
               The information in these catalogues varies considerably (see <ptr
                  target="#kudella2019"/> for more on modelling in the RRL project, for example). In
               our case, the archival metadata includes basic information about the senders and
               recipients (whether individuals, groups, or families). While dates are often clearly
               delineated in some well-curated collections, more often than not, they are given as
               the span of a set of correspondence (e.g., 25 letters between 1870–1895). Beyond
               archival organisations, we have knowledge of the archival collections in which the
               letters are held. In Finnish cultural heritage organisations, personal materials,
               including letters, are organised in separate <quote rend="inline"
               >collections</quote>, or <quote rend="inline">archives</quote> as they are usually
               called. In the Anglophone world, such collections are often referred to as <quote rend="inline">papers</quote>
               (for example, <quote rend="inline">the Cecil Papers</quote>, referring to a collection gathered by William Cecil
               (1520–1598) and his son, Robert Cecil (1563–1612)). However, to avoid conceptual
               confusion between organisations and their collections, the term <quote rend="inline">fonds</quote> will be used
               when discussing a body of records created and accumulated organically, reflecting the
               functions of its creator <ptr target="#fonds2024"/>.</p>

            <p>The metadata are transformed into linked open data by an automatic transformation
               pipeline (see Drobac et al., 2023b for a detailed description). The resulting data
               model builds on international standards, such as CIDOC CRM (Doerr, 2003), Dublin Core
               and ICA Records in Contexts, to promote interoperability with other datasets. The
               data model aims to facilitate the modelling of relevant metadata properties collected
               from source datasets. The most central classes in the current data model are
               ‘Letter’, ‘Actor’, ‘Place’, and ‘Time-Span’. Provenance (the MetadataRecord class)
               and archival/collection-level information (the Series, Fonds, and Organisation
               classes) are also included.</p>
            <p>To represent actors (senders and recipients of a letter) in different source
               datasets, we use an adapted version of the proxy concept from the Open Archives
               initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) specification. In our case, a proxy
               signifies a particular viewpoint on a person or group within a designated source. In
               the harmonisation process, proxies that are identified (through
               deduplication/disambiguation workflow (Drobac, Leskinen, and Wahjoe, 2023a), matching
               based on a trained probabilistic data linkage Splink model<note> See information on

               of the class ProvidedActor. This class is an adaptation of the Europeana Data Model’s
               (Doerr et al., 2010) class ProvidedCHO (Provided Cultural Heritage Object). In
               Europeana, the ProvidedCHO ‘represents the Cultural Heritage Object that Europeana
               collects descriptions about’. In practice, a proxy represents a ‘local’, or
               source-specific, view of an actor (with metadata ingested from that source), whereas
               a ProvidedActor represents a ‘global’ view of the actor by assembling all the
               information about the actor from various sources. The core classes and properties of
               the data model are presented in Table 2.</p>

            <p>Our study is based on the availability of epistolary metadata as Linked Open Data
               (LOD). Having transformed the metadata collected from various cultural heritage
               organisations into a harmonised data model, we can analyse the resulting dataset as a
               whole, while taking into account the differences in archival practices between the
               organisations that provided us with data. As illustrated in Figure 1, our research
               can be extended from examining a single collection or the collections of a single
               archival organisation to exploring the combined dataset (or union catalogue), thereby
               capitalising on the inherent links between collections and organisations.</p>
            <p>Figure 1 shows how many person-actors the different organisations have in common.
               Making the data available in a machine-readable, structured format (RDF) and in a
               SPARQL endpoint means that we have a multidimensional dataset that enables evolving
               historical research questions and allows us to query the data in rich and meaningful
               ways. Linking the data entities (e.g. person-actors) to external sources enriches the
               dataset with contextual information, providing ways to obtain details such as the
               biographical background of the people in the dataset. At the same time, possible
               links to external data sources, such as the National Biography of Finland or
               Wikidata, indicate that the person in question is recognised as relevant, at least
               from today’s perspective. The data for the studies reported in this paper were
               generated by formulating SPARQL queries to select subsets of the dataset. </p>

               dataset (19 February 2025). Note: The size of the edges represents but is not
               proportional to the amount of shared person-actors. The edge labels describe the
               amount of shared person-actors between the two organisations. The graph includes
               organisations with at least 10 shared person-actors.</p>
            <p>In addition to SPARQL queries, we use the LetterSampo Finland semantic portal<note>
                  The portal is available online: LetterSampo Finland. Finnish Nineteenth-Century
                  Letters on the Semantic Web: <ref target="https://kirjesampo.fi/en/"
                     >https://kirjesampo.fi/en/</ref>.</note>. Based on the Sampo model (Hyvönen,
               2022), the portal is implemented using the Sampo-UI programming framework (Ikkala et
               al., 2022). It allows users to search, browse and analyse letters, actors (people and
               organisations), archival organisations and collections (fonds), and places in the
               dataset. The interface is based on the faceted search paradigm (Tunkelang, 2009) and
               enables users to search for letters from a specific time period, sent by a particular
               person and archived by a particular organisation, for example. Visualisations include
               the yearly distribution of letters, top correspondents, and correspondence networks.
               Data including letter-sending locations can be visualised on a map.</p>
            <p>Some cultural heritage organisations have built up their collections over decades or
               even centuries, during which time cataloguing practices, descriptive concepts and
               standards have changed. In some cases, the material was initially handled by
               non-specialists. Combined with the creative individualism of archivists, this has
               resulted in a wide variety of finding aid formats, presenting one of the challenges
               of data modelling work and transforming letter catalogues into machine-readable data.
               The solution is to engage in continuous dialogue about humanistic knowledge interests
               and the emerging data model. A linked open data solution has proven suitable for
               modelling cultural heritage metadata relating to archives and historical figures.
               However, perhaps even more important is the way in which the modelling process forces
               us to consider the ‘things’ being modelled. What are the catalogued collections of
               letters, and how can we conceptualise phenomena such as epistolary culture? As
               Arianna Ciula et al. (2018, p. 345) write, models can be learnt from ‘at two
               different stages, in the creation of the model and in its application and successive
               manipulation’. In the case of epistolary metadata, modelling the letter collections
               has led us to focus on specific aspects of the collections themselves.</p>
            <p>In addition to the properties provided by the linked data, we use network analysis to
               construct specific correspondence networks. These networks illustrate changes in
               women’s centrality over time, helping us to visualise the gendered structure of
               nineteenth-century archival collections. Our focus is on contacts established through
               correspondence rather than on the direction of interaction through letter-writing.
               The main reason for this is the partiality of our collections (more on this below).
               The intention behind these network visualisations is not to examine how the network
               functions, but rather to offer an alternative viewpoint on the women in our
               collection data through their interconnectedness. The layout used is a force-directed
               model, meaning that the most important nodes in terms of connectivity remain at the
               centre of the network. Although our primary focus is on the networks as collections,
               we also highlight other themes relating to nineteenth-century women’s historical
               correspondence as reflected in our dataset.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>5 Case study</head>
            <p>One way to challenge the boundaries of archival organisations and their collections
               is to create a virtual collection of metadata relating to women’s letters. We will
               proceed in three steps, firstly discussing the quantitative results in terms of the
               total number of women actors and women as so-called records creators, then examining
               the ten most active women in terms of letters, and finally exploring the position of
               women in specific correspondence networks over time. Our findings will be
               contextualised in relation to archival practices, scholarly focus, and the
               modernisation of nineteenth-century society. Finally, we will assess the
               representativeness of our dataset as a whole. To this end, the Åbo Akademi University
               Library and the Finnish Literature Society will serve as sample datasets and main
               points of comparison. These organisations have exceptional collections covering
               different geographical regions and representing the two national languages, Swedish
               and Finnish.</p>
            <p>The current dataset comprises 114,052 actors, 24.1% of whom are female. While this
               figure is higher than that observed in previous European projects, it is less
               pronounced than expected based on research emphasising that women’s epistolary
               activity peaked in the nineteenth century (Monagle et al., 2023). However, when we
               filter out groups and administrative units, and consider all person-actors in the
               dataset, the percentage of female actors rises to 29%. In the Åbo Akademi data, the
               proportion of female actors is 31.7%, and in the Finnish Literature Society data, it
               is 32.5%. Furthermore, of the 1,246,573 letters, on average 38% were sent by women
               (alone or together with someone), and the corresponding percentage of letters
               received was 36%.</p>
            <p>In addition to examining the characteristics of the entire pool of person-actors,
               collecting and enriching epistolary metadata gives us access to another class of
               actors. In archival parlance, these are known as ‘records creators’ or ‘entities of
               origin’. These are individuals, families, corporations or administrative units that
               ‘create, receive or accumulate a body of records, personal papers or objects’
               (Entity, 2024). Their names are usually found in catalogue headings and indexes of
               letter collections. Archival fonds contain letters received by such entities, but
               often also letters sent by them. These may be copies kept by the entity or originals
               added to the collection at a later date. Often, there are also letters sent and
               received by other entities that may have had a family or other connection with the
               original records creator. The Finnish Literature Society provides a basic list of
               records creators on its website to serve as an entry point to its epistolary
               material. In contrast, the Åbo Akademi University Library provides online access both
               to its epistolary database and the database of records creators; however, it remains
               difficult to find and combine information about actors who are not records creators,
               even if they had extensive collections.</p>
            <p>By comparing the total dataset of person-actors with that of records creators, we can
               see that the status of records creator is granted to a select few. Although the
               number of actors varies greatly between our two sample organisations, only around 2%
               of them are also records creators in both cases. In the case of the Åbo Akademi, we
               can see that the gender of records creators is relatively close to that of the
               overall actor data, but it is significantly higher in the Finnish Literature
               Society’s collections (37.5% female). By contrast, the National Library of Finland
               has a very ‘masculine’ catalogue of epistolary fonds: 85% of records creators are
               men, with only 14.6% being women. These differences can be explained by the archival
               policies and constituencies of these organisations. The Åbo Akademi University in
               Turku was founded in 1919 to serve the Swedish-speaking minority in newly independent
               Finland. Its collections include materials representing the old Swedish-speaking
               aristocracy and intelligentsia — the country’s early political and cultural elite. In
               contrast, the Finnish Literature Society, founded in 1831, has a very different
               profile. Its collections reflect the ideas of nineteenth-century Finnish-language
               nationalists in the fields of folklore studies and Finnish language and literature.
               The collections include the personal archives of literary writers, translators,
               literary critics, and others. Through the National Library’s connection to the
               University of Helsinki, professors, researchers, and other academics are well
               represented in the library’s archival collections as professional groups.</p>
            <p>​​Linking to external data sources provides additional insight into the actors and
               records creators, as well as the general characteristics of the entire dataset. Only
               19% of all actors can be enriched with information provided by links to databases and
               repositories of historical narratives that can be captured with digital methods.
               However, these individuals are responsible for 85% of all letters. This means that we
               have a very prominent group of individuals who have left an extensive trace of
               themselves in the form of letters and other personal papers, despite being few in
               number, and a large number of individuals with few letters and connections. Such
               ‘long tails’ have been observed in other epistolary collections of a different nature
               (Ahnert and Ahnert, 2019, p. 31). When it comes to the narrower group of records
               creators, however, about 80% of them can be linked to external resources, suggesting
               a continuing scholarly interest in them. Collected lists of records creators can
               therefore serve as a kind of ‘who’s who’ of nineteenth-century Finland and
               nineteenth-century studies. The collections of prominent records creators have also
               preserved the correspondence of individuals who would otherwise have left little or
               no archival trace.</p>
            <p>Thus, we can see that nineteenth-century epistolary collections in general, and the
               group of records creators in particular, are dominated by literate elites and the
               middle classes. This is consistent with what we know about the development of
               literacy in this north-eastern corner of Europe. At the beginning of the nineteenth
               century, writing skills were still rare, despite the fact that half of all Finns
               could read. It was not until the introduction of primary schools in the 1860s that
               literacy and text comprehension really began to spread. Statistics from the
               Evangelical Lutheran Church indicate that, by 1880, 86.3% of the population could
               read, though only 12.4% were literate. By 1900, the literacy rate had risen to 38.6%,
               reaching 55.3% ten years later. (Latomaa and Nuolijärvi, 2002). The educated elite
               and middle classes also appear to have taken care to preserve their correspondence in
               personal, family and manor archives. These archives were transferred to cultural
               heritage organisations when they began collecting private archival material in the
               late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
            <p>These organisations operate under the principle of provenance (<hi rend="italic"
                  >respect des fonds</hi>), which emphasises preserving records according to their
               origin and within the units in which they were collected. However, a digital, virtual
               metadata archive provides an opportunity to challenge established practices and offer
               new perspectives on archival materials. For instance, we can explore the collections
               of notable politicians and academics, or large family holdings, and ‘liberate’
               mothers, sisters, and daughters by granting them independent status as virtual
               records creators, thereby ensuring their immediate visibility and discoverability.
               One such individual is Aline Reuter (née Procopé).</p>
            <p>Table 3 presents the ten most active women in the entire dataset, ranked by the
               number of letters. Interestingly, only half of these women are linked to content-rich
               external resources; that is to say, they have a Wikipedia page or an entry in the
               National Biography of Finland. For these women, we have readily available
               occupational information. In contrast, much less information is at our disposal for
               the other four women – the ‘dark horses’ of our virtual archive. Aline Reuter’s
               correspondence at the Åbo Akademi comprises 8,178 letters (3,072 sent and 5,106
               received). This makes it one of the largest collections of letters from a
               nineteenth-century woman in our current dataset. You might think that such a large
               collection, covering a period considered so formative for Finnish nationalism and
               studied by generations of historians, would be used extensively. This does not seem
               to be the case, however. The few mentions that shed light on her life can be found in
               the National Biography entries of her three famous professor sons and in the Reuter
               family entry (see, for example, Autio, 1997a and 1997b). There are also Wikipedia
               pages (e.g. ‘Edvin Titus Feodor Reuter’) and a Geni.com profile (‘Aline Reuter’)
               which, for technical reasons, cannot be used to enrich the data. These sources
               provide information about her lifespan (1828–1916) and some details about her family
               (husband and four sons).</p>

            <p>However, obituaries of Aline Reuter in the newspapers provide further insights into
               her life. She had 13 children in total, many of whom died young. She homeschooled the
               surviving children until they reached grammar school age, and she acquired such
               excellent skills in subjects such as Latin and mathematics that, when her son Odo
               Reuter, a professor of zoology, became blind, Aline Reuter (now in her 80s) took over
               his professional correspondence and proofread his papers. However, more than her
               obvious intellectual agility, the obituaries emphasise her ‘rich inner life’ and
               remind readers that ‘there were no great events in her life’ (see, for example, <hi
                  rend="italic">Dagens Press</hi>, 1916). This statement alone arouses curiosity
               about the contents of Reuter’s extensive collection of letters, tempting one to
               immerse oneself in her ‘epistolary space’ (How, 2003) and reflect on its
               representativeness, for example with regard to the experienced, personal nationalism
               of nineteenth-century women (Eiranen, 2021) or other significant ways of discursively
               shaping oneself and one’s surroundings (Monagle et al., 2023, p. 12).</p>
            <p>‘Mother Aline’ is thus a prime example of a marginalised or forgotten person who only
               becomes clearly visible when we recontextualise her letters in the collected and
               enriched metadata. Indeed, it is only through the combined metadata that we can
               confirm the extraordinary quantity of surviving correspondence. By way of comparison,
               the most extensive set of male correspondence is that of Senator Leopold (Leo)
               Mechelin (1839–1914), whose entire collection of letters from various organisations
               totals 14,399.</p>
            <p>We can make further observations about the gender distribution in the Finnish
               nineteenth-century data with the help of network analysis and simple degree metrics,
               which build on the above analysis of the number of contacts each person had. This
               enables us to visually assess the extent to which the women in our letter collections
               were connected. As our dataset spans over a hundred years, we decided to examine two
               periods in more detail: 1830–1860 and 1880–1910, which reflect the socio-economic,
               legal and social changes that affected women’s correspondence in the modernising
               Grand Duchy of Finland. From the 1860s onwards, women gradually gained access to
               higher education. As the country’s economy liberalised, women’s legal and economic
               rights were strengthened, and they participated in associations and societal
               movements. Hypothetically, this meant that women’s epistolary networks became more
               similar to those of men, and we were interested to see if we could find traces of
               this in the archived epistolary material.</p>

               layout is Yifan Hu generated with Gephi 0.10.1. See Appendix 2 for statistics.</p>
            <p>As expected, looking at the position of women in the correspondence networks reveals
               that their connectivity increases as we move from the first to the second period. At
               the same time, the ‘archival status’ of the most well-connected women and their links
               to external biographical databases undergoes a significant change. As illustrated in
               Figure 2, during the initial period of letter correspondence (1830–1860), men
               dominate the centre of the network, with most women (represented by blue nodes)
               situated in the middle and outer spheres. The ten most connected women are also not
               central figures from an archival perspective (see Appendix 2, Table 2). As they are
               not records creators, the bulk of their letters have been archived as part of their
               families’, husbands’ or sons’ fonds. Furthermore, linking to external databases has
               only resulted in links to genealogical databases. Professional information was only
               found for two women (Fredrika Runeberg and Elisabeth Blomqvist), who have also
               attracted academic interest (e.g. Klinge, 2006; Konttinen, 2000). The situation is
               quite different for the ten most connected men of this period (see Appendix 2, Table
               1): they are all records creators; their letters originate from 7–9 archival
               organisations; and they are well linked to external sources, including Wikipedia.</p>

               core network, with the size of the nodes relative to their degree (non-weighted): the
               number of correspondence contacts of the person. The highest degree is 528. The
               layout is Yifan Hu generated with Gephi 0.10.1. See Appendix 2 for statistics.</p>
            <p>During the second period (1880–1910), women were more centrally positioned within the
               network, as illustrated in Figure 3. The profile of the women with the most
               connections in this later period is very different to that in the earlier period:
               nine out of ten of these women are records creators, and their letters are widely
               distributed across different archival organisations (see Appendix 2, Table 4). These
               women are well-known cultural figures – artists, writers and politicians – and are
               well connected to external data sources. They also have a Wikipedia entry. Their
               network profiles thus differ significantly from those of lesser-known figures such as
               ‘Mother Aline’, who, despite her extensive correspondence, plays a more peripheral
               role in the network. In both periods, the biggest difference in our metadata between
               men and women is that women have significantly fewer contacts, even those who worked
               in the public and private sectors in the late nineteenth century (such as the social
               activist and politician Aleksandra Gripenberg; see Table 3 and Appendix 2, Table 4
               and Appendix 3, Table 2). Based on archival materials, women’s epistolary networks
               were narrower. However, as noted above, the ties were proportionally stronger in
               terms of the number of letters exchanged.</p>
            <p>In addition, networks consisting exclusively of correspondence between women provide
               further insight into the organisation of archival collections, the focus of scholarly
               interest and the changes brought about by the modernisation of the country. The
               configurations of women’s correspondence networks are illustrated in Figure 4 for the
               periods 1830–1860 and 1880–1910. During the earlier period, women exchanged
               significantly less correspondence, and their networks formed several distinct but
               small clusters. While most of the women are the same as in the full network, the
               shape of the network now suggests a predominance of family networks, as previous
               research (Monagle et al., 2023) has suggested. However, further data analysis and
               qualitative research are needed to confirm this. Additionally, many of the women’s
               letters are uniquely archived at Åbo Akademi, likely due to the institution’s
               substantial collection of family archives from the Swedish-speaking population. For
               the second period (1880–1910), the situation is very different, as can be seen from
               the shape and size of the network in Figure 4. The women were highly interconnected,
               with significant nodes at the centre of the network. Examining the most central women
               reveals that, with the exception of two individuals, all of those in the ‘women's
               network’ and the broader network remain the same during this period, albeit with
               slightly different rankings (see Appendix 3). Therefore, in the latter period, it is
               not possible to identify separate clusters of women’s correspondence. Instead,
               women’s correspondence is interwoven with the networks of the country’s artistic and
               cultural elite, whose correspondence is spread across all the archival organisations
               in our dataset.</p>

            <p>Despite these extensive collections, archived materials only provide patchy and
               partial access to nineteenth-century epistolary communication. When we compare the
               dataset — and thus the collections of the largest Finnish cultural heritage
               organisations — with statistics on all letters sent in the Grand Duchy of Finland, it
               is clear that coverage and representativeness are low (Figure 5). The collected
               metadata does not reflect the growth in letter correspondence in the country, which
               was driven by the expansion of trade, commerce and administration, as well as the
               development of technologies that supported easy and affordable letter exchange, such
               as cheap postage and stationery, prepayment of letters and increasing delivery speeds
               (Pietiäinen, 1988). After the mid-1880s, when literacy rates began to rise, archival
               coverage decreased further still. It appears that archival organisations lacked the
               means or interest to preserve everyday correspondence in the Grand Duchy, and
               lower-class individuals and small businesses may not have had the inclination to
               create personal archives. Therefore, an interesting question is whether we can
               estimate what materials are missing. Can we see what is not there?</p>

            <p>At the start of the data collection, we asked cultural heritage organisations to
               estimate the proportion of their collections that were unorganised and uncatalogued
               (see Appendix 1). The results of this survey clearly demonstrate a growing shortage
               of resources for the labour-intensive work of archival description. However, it is
               reasonable to assume that letters added to collections since the nineteenth century,
               perhaps up to the 1980s, were more thoroughly indexed due to the greater availability
               of human resources relative to the size of the collections. Nevertheless, the
               collections do not represent a random sample of nineteenth-century epistolary
               culture, as evidenced by the social and cultural status of most of the records
               creators. Therefore, while cultural heritage organisations’ collections are not
               representative of the majority of letters sent, especially in the late nineteenth
               century, they do reflect the membership of the elite and upper middle classes
               relatively well.</p>
            <p>However, what has been preserved of the total body of correspondence that once
               existed is often coincidental, even among the literate elite. For instance, Senator
               Mechelin received 12,129 letters, which are kept in his family’s collection at the
               National Archives. However, we only have 2,270 of his letters (mainly in the
               collections of other individuals in five different organisations). Assuming that
               people mostly replied to the letters they received, this kind of disparity in the
               material points to definite gaps in the collections. Conversely, it is more
               challenging to determine whether the proportion of female actors (24% of the total,
               and 29% of those for whom gender can be identified) and the proportion of letters
               sent and received by them (38% and 36%, respectively) is indicative of missing
               material. Similar, large-scale datasets of epistolary metadata from other European
               countries are lacking, making it difficult to compare our findings and results. The
               closest we have are the results of the ambitious RRL projects mentioned above, which
               provide a rare insight into the gender distribution of epistolary material from
               earlier centuries. The datasets currently available in Germany and the Netherlands
               show an overwhelmingly male correspondence of 85%, but this is understandable given
               the projects’ premises.</p>

            <head>6 Discussion</head>
            <p>In the era of flourishing research on LGBTQIA+ histories, exploring the role of women
               as archival protagonists may not seem very revolutionary. In fact, the first attempt
               to enable sustained research on women’s history in Finland was made in the mid-1990s
               with the publication of <hi rend="italic">Naisia, asiakirjoja, arkistoja: Suomen
                  naishistorian arkistolähteitä</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Women, Documents, Archives:
                  Sources for Women’s History in Finland</hi>, Härkönen, 1994), which identified
               various archival collections of potential interest to the emerging field of gender
               history. However, as we have demonstrated, applying data science methods can render
               the process of critically revising archival collections much more systematic and
               powerful. Epistolary metadata is, of course, only one type of information that can be
               used to interrogate the role and visibility of different social, cultural, or ethnic
               communities in our social narratives. Indeed, cultural heritage metadata may offer a
               more affordable and realistic way of making dispersed archival and museum collections
               accessible and researchable than mass digitisation projects. However, metadata alone
               can be frustrating for scholars accustomed to interrogating vast textual archives,
               and a dialogue between digital and more traditional research methods is required.
               Nevertheless, using ‘pure’ metadata enables us to ‘map missing bricks in the wall of
               knowledge’, for instance by categorising individuals and social groups whose
               biographies do not yet exist (Guldi, 2024, p. 525) – a task we have begun with the
               help of Aline Reuter, among others.</p>
            <p>Jo Guldi has recently referred to such digital approaches as ‘counting the silences’
               (Guldi, 2024, p. 524). ‘Silence’ is a buzzword used by scholars to refer to missing
               data or issues that archives cannot or will not ‘talk about’. It is often used
               interchangeably with terms such as ‘gaps’, ‘bias’ and ‘occlusion’ (see also Carter,
               2006, p. 217). To clarify, Guldi (2023, pp. 30–37) distinguishes between occlusion
               and bias. For Guldi, a digital humanist who works with large textual corpora, the
               Occluded Archive is an archive that is closed to view. It consists of materials that
               we cannot access for various reasons. Occlusion operates at the level of political
               and historical factors, as well as archival organisation (e.g. which social groups
               are literate, which archives are preserved, and how relevant documents are hidden in
               separate datasets). For Guldi, bias is ‘dirt’ or ‘filth’ in the textual content. This
               powerful metaphor refers to racist, misogynistic and other expressions and narratives
               that carry a heavy ideological burden. Historians are usually aware of such omissions
               and biases, which they identify as part of their work. However, these factors are not
               always considered when data science methods are applied to materials.</p>
            <p>Our data consist of metadata from the letter collections; we do not have the content
               of the letters in our dataset. This means that we need to introduce an additional
               feature of occlusion: the partly accidental and partly selective nature of the entire
               life cycle of historical and archived materials. Many archival theorists interpret
               ‘silences’ as tangible gaps in the archival record. These gaps can arise from
               everyday practices such as the accidental disappearance or deliberate destruction of
               materials prior to and after archiving, or from appraisal and subsequent rejection in
               a cultural heritage organisation (Fowler, 2017; Edquist, 2021). The historical
               reasons for this kind of fundamental, irreversible non-preservation vary, and there
               is little evidence of such processes producing structural bias in historical sources.
               However, it may be possible to model some gaps using digital methods or conduct the
               time-consuming task of searching organisational records for traces of decision-making
               processes. In this paper, we have identified both gaps (in the representativeness of
               the data, compared with the information available on nineteenth-century postal
               activity and literacy) and silences (in the lack of research on certain notable women
               in our dataset) by examining what has been preserved in the collections of Finnish
               cultural heritage organisations. A persistent ‘silence’ is often only recognised in
               retrospect, for example, when a paradigmatic change in theory or technology allows a
               new view of the archived material.</p>
            <p>​​It is true that material separated into different repositories or organisations is
               a strong occluding factor. However, occlusion also occurs within individual
               organisations. A key factor here is how organisations prioritise the creation of
               metadata and categorise catalogued documents as open and accessible or closed (e.g.
               Sherratt, 2019). Only collections that have been organised and described can be made
               available to researchers and other users (see Appendix 1). Furthermore, it has been
               argued that creating a fonds and assigning a records creator carries significant
               intellectual and hegemonic weight, yet these decisions often remain invisible
               (Drucker, 2021, p. 326; Friedrich, 2021, pp. 312–317).</p>
            <p>Digital humanities scholars often work with materials that were originally indexed in
               a library context. While these bibliographic databases, catalogues, and digitised
               repositories are incomplete and less representative than many scholars might hope
               (see, for example, Bode, 2020), they do comprise fairly homogeneous sets of
               materials. Furthermore, issues of archival access and its political constraints are
               frequently examined in the context of sensitive government records (e.g. Risam, 2019;
               Sherratt, 2019). However, it is also important to recognise these mechanisms in
               relation to cultural heritage materials and those held in private archival
               organisations. All organisations whose letter metadata are included in our dataset
               have their own acquisition policies, enabling them to accept or reject archival
               material offered to them, provided they justify their decisions. Compared to material
               generated in library contexts and governmental organisation records, archival
               organisations’ vast collections, particularly person and family collections, seem
               more ‘wild’, especially when considering material beyond the high research canon.
               Cataloguing categories vary, information comes in different formats, and many
               collections are only partially organised, with huge backlogs of unorganised
               material.</p>

            <head>7 Conclusion</head>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce the framework of Critical Collection History. Using the
               powerful qualities of Linked Open Data, this framework finds relevant features in a
               dataset comprising over a million letters and over 100,000 actors. It is motivated by
               discussions in the fields of critical archival studies and digital humanities. We
               argue that critical collection history occurs when the boundaries of cultural
               heritage organisations and their collections are erased and the structure of
               traditional paper archives is challenged and ‘weirded’. At the most general level,
               critical collection history asks whose actions and experiences are important enough
               to be archived and catalogued, and which individuals and groups are visible in
               finding aids, indexes and external research repositories. Digital technologies enable
               us to examine archival collections individually and collectively as large sets of
               historical data, not as static and inherently objective entities providing direct
               access to the past, but as multi-layered, dynamic and processual entities resulting
               from various historical, socio-economic and political processes. Similar to many
               contextualising approaches to digital collections (e.g. Beelen et al., 2023), the aim
               is not to ‘correct’, but to identify how such processes and layers manifest in the
               collections in question. Furthermore, we are not merely users of archival data; we
               are also actively involved in making the archival record more visible (or ‘louder’)
               in the digital space (Johnson, 2017). For instance, we make decisions about modelling
               the data and solving problems related to resource constraints when obtaining source
               data (Drobac et al., 2023b).</p>
            <p>This article discusses materials that mainly comprise person and family collections
               held in private archival organisations. These collections are widely used by scholars
               and favoured as case studies in archival research (Edquist, 2021), yet they are
               rarely considered in postcolonial and other critical approaches. As a case study, we
               have created a virtual archive of ‘epistolary women’. Our analyses suggest that the
               collections available to us as linked data are relatively representative of the upper
               echelons of nineteenth-century society. However, it is more difficult to assess
               whether the proportion of female person-actors (29% of all actors and 26–34% of the
               more filtered group of records creators in two sample organisations) accurately
               represents women’s epistolary activities. Nevertheless, network analysis indicates
               that the available epistolary metadata reflects changes in women’s societal roles
               brought about by modernisation. This demonstrates that even partial datasets can
               reveal significant historical phenomena and be profitably used by humanists, provided
               the gaps or ‘missingness’ are understood and acknowledged (Ryan and Ahnert,
               2021).</p>
            <p>In addition, we have identified certain epistemic silences: women who do not feature
               in our current research canon but who have substantial archival collections that
               could offer valuable insights into a variety of historical topics. Overall, the
               results are tentative but promising. However, we must bear in mind that the current
               data include four online publications of letters and letter metadata from only nine
               cultural heritage organisations – albeit the largest and most central – and only from
               those collections that have been indexed at the level of individual letter exchanges.
               Nonetheless, despite all the gaps and omissions discussed in this paper, the
               collected metadata provides the most comprehensive sample available of who actually
               sent and received letters in nineteenth-century Finland.</p>
            <p>This article has demonstrated the potential of linked open data and critical
               collection history in identifying gendered structures within epistolary metadata
               collections. In the future, we can continue to explore women’'s correspondence as a
               historical phenomenon by focusing more qualitatively on the women we identify using
               data-driven methods. Furthermore, we can direct our historical research towards
               archival collections as the outcome of specific political, cultural, and
               socio-economic pressures – pressures that leave their mark, turning the archives
               themselves into artefacts of history (Burton, 2005, p. 6). To achieve this, we should
               digitise the acquisition registers of various organisations and study their
               decision-making processes relating to archival appraisal where possible. While many
               organisational histories touch on these issues – most recently Petra Hakala’s (2023)
               study of the Swedish Literature Society in Finland’s archival collections – a
               combined history focusing on private epistolary collections as a case study remains
               to be written. A critical collection history is also always a history of the
               construction of collective identity; it can reveal whose experiences are available to
               us as historians, and also whose experiences have been narrativised as history at
               different stages in the past.</p>

                  Networks of Epistolary Exchange in the Grand Duchy of Finland </hi>(CoCo) has
               launched a survey on nineteenth-century letter collections in Finnish cultural
               heritage organisations. To date, 57 archives, libraries and museums have responded.
               The survey contains 18 questions to help understand the current situation and the
               challenges of aggregating collection metadata. Here, we present results relevant to
               this paper in Figures 1–3. In summary, 86% of respondents either have or possibly
               have nineteenth-century letters in their archival collections. The word ‘possibly’ is
               explained by the fact that only 33% have catalogued all their letters. Conversely,
               14% have not catalogued them at all. Regarding archival finding aids, only 36% of
               respondents with nineteenth-century letters have catalogues in electronic form, such
               as databases, Excel files, or Word documents. This makes the content
               machine-readable, but additional structuring and harmonising is required.</p>
