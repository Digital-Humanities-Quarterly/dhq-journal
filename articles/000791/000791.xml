            <p>This paper presents a <quote rend="inline">virtual archive</quote> of women’s epistolary exchange in
               19th-century Finland. By harmonising metadata from over 1.2 million letters and over
               100,000 correspondents across key cultural heritage organisations and leveraging
               linked open data, we gain an unprecedented view of 19th-century epistolary
               communication and 20th-century archival practices. Using quantitative analysis,
               enriched metadata, and network visualisations, we explore the gendered nature of
               these collections. Are women archival protagonists, or are their materials embedded
               within the collections of male relatives? Do the data reveal overlooked women with
               extensive archival networks absent from historical narratives? We introduce the
               framework of <quote rend="inline">critical collection history,</quote> which combines theoretical debates
               and research interests from critical archival studies and digital history and
               combines them with contemporary digital methods. This approach underscores the
               necessity for scholars using data-driven methods in historical research to critically
               engage with digitised archives. Moreover, critical collection history highlights how
                  <quote rend="inline">big cultural heritage metadata</quote> can expose archival biases and enhance our
               understanding of source limitations – biases that digital scholarship may
               unintentionally perpetuate.</p>

            <p>Who gets remembered in the archives? This article explores how 1.2 million letters
               reveal hidden networks of 19th-century Finnish women — and what their traces (or
               absence) say about history, memory, and digital methods.</p>

      <body>
         <div>
            <head>1 Introduction</head>
            <p>A few years ago, we contacted the key cultural heritage organisations in Finland and
               asked what we thought was a simple question touching on central historical source
               material: <quote rend="inline">How many nineteenth-century letters do you have in your collections?</quote>
               The answer was simple, though not quite what we expected: <quote rend="inline">There is no way of
                  knowing.</quote> This means that neither the organisations nor the humanities scholars
               who regularly use these materials have a comprehensive view of the extent or basic
               structural characteristics of these collections. Consequently, we cannot assess their
               inherent biases or distortions, nor can we evaluate the representativeness of the
               collections in relation to nineteenth-century <quote rend="inline">epistolary cultures</quote>.</p>
            
            <p>A reasonable follow-up question is why information about archived material is
               important. After all, scholars have successfully used the contents of epistolary
               collections to answer a wide variety of historical research questions since the
               establishment of national and other archival institutions and the development of
               historical methods based on primary sources. A lack of interest in the logics
               or <quote rend="inline">ethnographies</quote> <ptr target="#dirks2002"/> of complete archival collections is likely due to hermeneutic and microhistorical research interests among scholars immersed in
               historical epistolary exchange. It is also due to the difficulty of obtaining
               accurate and comparable quantitative data on vast and diverse materials accumulated
               over decades or even centuries and catalogued in astonishingly diverse ways. However,
               when combined with the latest digital humanities technologies, collection-level
               archival metadata offers untapped potential for historical enquiry.</p>
            
            <p>In this paper, we suggest that the research agenda of digital historians should be
               expanded to include questions about the composition of archival collections. We
               analyse a new digital archive constructed by combining letter metadata (e.g.
               information about senders, recipients, dates and quantities of letters) from
               databases, finding aids and archival catalogues of person and family archives held in
               various Finnish cultural heritage organisations. This <quote rend="inline">big
              metadata</quote> <ptr target="#enqvist_pikkanen2024"/> transcends organisational boundaries, enabling
               us to obtain quantifiable and comparable information about the collections. When we
               transform it into linked open data and connect it to external sources, such as
               biographical and other datasets and ontologies, we can enrich the data with
               categories not present in the archival metadata, such as the gender of letter writers
               and recipients. This allows us to observe relations that are simply not detectable in
               traditional archives of printed finding aids or organisational archival
               databases.</p>
            
            <p>This paper argues that a fruitful intersection exists between digital humanities,
               computational humanities, and critical archival studies, which we refer to as <quote
               rend="inline">critical collection history</quote>. While it may be possible to
               conduct such research using traditional methods, we aim to demonstrate that, at its
               most effective and ambitious, critical collection history is digital collection
               history. Repurposing information stored in archival finding aids and other
               repositories of archival metadata using computational methods provides us with an
               unprecedented and powerful tool with which to explore the interplay between
               historical source criticism and the archival politics of inclusion and exclusion
               (Whose materials are preserved by cultural heritage organisations and made available
               for scholarly and other purposes?). This approach also allows us to gain new
               perspectives on the interaction of historical actors within past contexts.</p>
            
            <p>There is a well-established international scholarly tradition of compiling and
               editing carefully curated collections of correspondence. In the last 15 years, such
               data have been published as digital research resources and, in many cases, as linked
               open data. Projects such as the EU-funded large-scale Reassembling the Republic of
               Letters (RRL), the Dutch Circulation of Knowledge and Learned Practices in the
               17th-century Dutch Republic (CKCC) and the German correspondence metadata aggregator
               correspSearch, mainly focus on the epistolary materials of learned men, because
               traditional epistolary editions have centred on this group.</p>
            
            <p>Our material allows us to adopt a more comprehensive perspective. In what follows, we
               will address the gendered aspects of nineteenth-century epistolary collections in
               Finland. We are particularly interested in the traces that nineteenth-century women
               left in archival collections. The nineteenth century has been characterised as the
               golden age of letter writing <ptr target="#lahtinen_etal2011"/> and women have been
               identified as the main protagonists of this development <ptr
               target="#monagle_etal2023"/>. Does quantitative analysis of the collected
               epistolary metadata confirm these qualitative findings? Based on our data, did women
               play a prominent role in epistolary communication? Do they <quote rend="inline">own</quote> their
               collections and archives? By delving into the collected metadata, can we find
               individuals who are not part of our current scholarly canon? Throughout the paper, we
               will revisit a broader question: Does the material tell us more about
               twentieth-century archival practices or particular developments in nineteenth-century
               society?</p>
            
            <p>Compared to previous publications of linked open data on epistolary metadata, there
               are certain methodological and interpretative difficulties associated with the use of
               large collections of metadata gathered directly (<quote rend="inline">bottom-up</quote>) from cultural
               heritage organisations. The primary challenges pertain to the commensurability of the
               archival collections themselves and the validation of the results. There are no
               comparable epistolary metadata datasets that we can use to measure the significance
               and/or Finnish and nineteenth-century specificity of our findings. The best approach

            <p>The rapid expansion of big data and digital humanities since the early 2000s has
               emphasised the importance of understanding the shape or contours of (digital)
               archives and corpora. The research framework proposed in this paper is similar to
               recent studies that have examined the <quote rend="inline">anatomies</quote> of
               historical data collections and the processes involved in their creation, both before
               and during digitisation (e.g. <ptr target="#tolonen_etal2022"/>, <ptr
                  target="#beelen_etal2023"/>, <ptr target="#ortolja_baird_nyhan2022"/>). It has
               been suggested that large digital datasets require a new kind of critical attitude;
               those who produce and use such data must pay particular attention to its local
               context: how it was acquired and prepared, its strengths and weaknesses, and whether
               it is fit for purpose <ptr target="#loukissas2019" loc="8, 195"/>, <ptr
                  target="#ahnert_etal2020" loc="54–55"/>. At the same time, it has been recognised
               that much digitised historical material can be analysed using computational methods.
               Indeed, quantitative analysis is particularly effective when we want to interrogate
               the characteristics, structures, and properties of digital archives and collections
               and reflect on the relationship between datasets and the phenomena they represent or
               model <ptr target="#hyvonen_etal2021" loc="53"/>, <ptr target="#guldi2023" loc="29"
               />, <ptr target="#bode2020" loc="4–5"/>.</p>
            
            <p>Over the past few decades, researchers in archival and cultural studies have been
               addressing the same questions, albeit mostly in the context of analogue archives,
               close-reading individual collections. Since the archival turn of the 1990s and early
               2000s, there has been growing interest in analysing the processes involved in
               creating, organising, appraising, and describing archival holdings, as well as the
               ways in which these processes reproduce and/or challenge existing hierarchies,
               dominant discourses, and ideologies (<ptr target="#edquist2021" loc="109"/>; see
               also <ptr target="#schwartz_cook2002"/>, <ptr target="#taavetti2016"/>; <ptr
                  target="#ketelaar2017"/>; <ptr target="#mikkola_etal2019"/>. Critical archival
               studies pay attention to the processes prior to the possibility of digitisation. Like
               critical theory on a wider social scale, these studies are emancipatory in nature
                  <ptr target="#caswell_etal2017" loc="2"/>. They seek to highlight injustices in
               current archival research and practice, offering recommendations for improvement. As
               with researchers working with large digital corpora, the importance of analysing the
               logics, classification systems and exclusions of archival collections has been
               emphasised <ptr target="#dirks2002"/>. Recently, digital techniques have emerged for
               studying curatorial practices and the historical and cultural context of museum
               curation and archival appraisal (e.g. <ptr target="#salway_baker2020"/>; <ptr
                  target="#lange_etal2022"/>, <ptr target="#enqvist_pikkanen2024"/>). Paradigmatic
               quantitative studies of letter collections are the results of the aforementioned RRL
               project (e.g. <ptr target="#hotson_wallnig2019"/>), as well as various case studies
               that use network analysis (e.g. <ptr target="#ahnert_ahnert2019"/>).</p>

            <p>3 Description of dataset</p>
            
            <p>Our study uses information from letter catalogues and databases from the Grand Duchy
               of Finland (1809–1917). However, as sets of correspondence often extend beyond the
               designated end year of 1917, we have also included these data where available.
               
               <note>
                  The data has been collected and processed in the digital humanities consortium
                  project Constellations of Correspondence: Large and Small Networks of Epistolary
                  Exchange in the Grand Duchy of Finland (2021–2025), funded by the Research Council
                  of Finland (decision numbers 339828, 340834 and 339918).</note>
               
               The dataset is available online<note> The dataset has been published on Zenodo: <ref
                     target="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15210589"
                     >https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15210589</ref>.</note>, <quote rend="inline"
                  >upcycling</quote> these collections for reuse as FAIR data for research, as
               suggested by <ptr target="#scheltjens2023"/>. The current version of the dataset
               comprises around 1.2 million letters featuring approximately 114,052 unique actors
               (senders and recipients) from nine organisations and four digital editions (see Table
                  1)
               <note> The dataset does not include archives from public entities, as these were
                  excluded from the data collection process due to project resource
                  constraints.</note>.</p>
            
            <p>Letter catalogues have also been used to create datasets in various other projects.
               The information in these catalogues varies considerably (see <ptr
                  target="#kudella2019"/> for more on modelling in the RRL project, for example). In
               our case, the archival metadata includes basic information about the senders and
               recipients (whether individuals, groups, or families). While dates are often clearly
               delineated in some well-curated collections, more often than not, they are given as
               the span of a set of correspondence (e.g., 25 letters between 1870–1895). Beyond
               archival organisations, we have knowledge of the archival collections in which the
               letters are held. In Finnish cultural heritage organisations, personal materials,
               including letters, are organised in separate <quote rend="inline"
               >collections</quote>, or <quote rend="inline">archives</quote> as they are usually
               called. In the Anglophone world, such collections are often referred to as <quote
                  rend="inline">papers</quote> (for example, <quote rend="inline">the Cecil
                  Papers</quote>, referring to a collection gathered by William Cecil (1520–1598)
               and his son, Robert Cecil (1563–1612)). However, to avoid conceptual confusion
               between organisations and their collections, the term <quote rend="inline"
                  >fonds</quote> will be used when discussing a body of records created and
               accumulated organically, reflecting the functions of its creator <ptr
                  target="#fonds2024"/>.</p>

            <p>The metadata are transformed into linked open data by an automatic transformation
               pipeline (see <ptr target="#drobac_etal2023b"/> for a detailed description). The
               resulting data model builds on international standards, such as CIDOC CRM (<ptr
                  target="#doerr2003"/>), Dublin Core and ICA Records in Contexts, to promote
               interoperability with other datasets. The data model aims to facilitate the modelling
               of relevant metadata properties collected from source datasets. The most central
               classes in the current data model are <quote rend="inline">Letter</quote>, <quote rend="inline">Actor</quote>, <quote rend="inline">Place</quote>, and
                  <quote rend="inline">Time-Span</quote>. Provenance (the MetadataRecord class) and

            <p>To represent actors (senders and recipients of a letter) in different source
               datasets, we use an adapted version of the proxy concept from the Open Archives
               initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) specification. In our case, a proxy
               signifies a particular viewpoint on a person or group within a designated source. In
               the harmonisation process, proxies that are identified (through

               (Doerr et al., 2010) class ProvidedCHO (Provided Cultural Heritage Object). In
               Europeana, the ProvidedCHO <quote rend="inline">represents the Cultural Heritage

            <head>4 Methodology</head>
            <p>Our study is based on the availability of epistolary metadata as Linked Open Data
               (LOD). Having transformed the metadata collected from various cultural heritage
               organisations into a harmonised data model, we can analyse the resulting dataset as a
               whole, while taking into account the differences in archival practices between the
               organisations that provided us with data. As illustrated in Figure 1, our research
               can be extended from examining a single collection or the collections of a single
               archival organisation to exploring the combined dataset (or union catalogue), thereby
               capitalising on the inherent links between collections and organisations.</p>
            
            <p>Figure 1 shows how many person-actors the different organisations have in common.
               Making the data available in a machine-readable, structured format (RDF) and in a
               SPARQL endpoint means that we have a multidimensional dataset that enables evolving
               historical research questions and allows us to query the data in rich and meaningful
               ways. Linking the data entities (e.g. person-actors) to external sources enriches the
               dataset with contextual information, providing ways to obtain details such as the
               biographical background of the people in the dataset. At the same time, possible
               links to external data sources, such as the National Biography of Finland or
               Wikidata, indicate that the person in question is recognised as relevant, at least
               from today’s perspective. The data for the studies reported in this paper were
               generated by formulating SPARQL queries to select subsets of the dataset.</p>

                  proportional to the amount of shared person-actors. The edge labels describe the
                  amount of shared person-actors between the two organisations. The graph includes
                  organisations with at least 10 shared person-actors.</head>

            <p>In addition to SPARQL queries, we use the LetterSampo Finland semantic portal<note>
                  The portal is available online: LetterSampo Finland. Finnish Nineteenth-Century
                  Letters on the Semantic Web: <ref target="https://kirjesampo.fi/en/"
                     >https://kirjesampo.fi/en/</ref>.</note>. Based on the Sampo model <ptr
                  target="#hyvonen2022"/>, the portal is implemented using the Sampo-UI programming
               framework <ptr target="#ikkala_etal2022"/>. It allows users to search, browse and
               analyse letters, actors (people and organisations), archival organisations and
               collections (fonds), and places in the dataset. The interface is based on the faceted
               search paradigm <ptr target="#tunkelang2009"/> and enables users to search for
               letters from a specific time period, sent by a particular person and archived by a
               particular organisation, for example. Visualisations include the yearly distribution
               of letters, top correspondents, and correspondence networks. Data including
               letter-sending locations can be visualised on a map.</p>
            
            <p>Some cultural heritage organisations have built up their collections over decades or
               even centuries, during which time cataloguing practices, descriptive concepts and
               standards have changed. In some cases, the material was initially handled by
               non-specialists. Combined with the creative individualism of archivists, this has
               resulted in a wide variety of finding aid formats, presenting one of the challenges
               of data modelling work and transforming letter catalogues into machine-readable data.
               The solution is to engage in continuous dialogue about humanistic knowledge interests
               and the emerging data model. A linked open data solution has proven suitable for
               modelling cultural heritage metadata relating to archives and historical figures.
               However, perhaps even more important is the way in which the modelling process forces
               us to consider the <quote rend="inline">things</quote> being modelled. What are the catalogued collections
               of letters, and how can we conceptualise phenomena such as epistolary culture? As
                  <ptr target="#ciula_etal2018" loc="345"/> write, models can be learnt from <quote
                  rend="inline">at two different stages, in the creation of the model and in its
                  application and successive manipulation</quote>. In the case of epistolary
               metadata, modelling the letter collections has led us to focus on specific aspects of
               the collections themselves.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to the properties provided by the linked data, we use network analysis to
               construct specific correspondence networks. These networks illustrate changes in
               women’s centrality over time, helping us to visualise the gendered structure of
               nineteenth-century archival collections. Our focus is on contacts established through
               correspondence rather than on the direction of interaction through letter-writing.
               The main reason for this is the partiality of our collections (more on this below).
               The intention behind these network visualisations is not to examine how the network
               functions, but rather to offer an alternative viewpoint on the women in our
               collection data through their interconnectedness. The layout used is a force-directed
               model, meaning that the most important nodes in terms of connectivity remain at the
               centre of the network. Although our primary focus is on the networks as collections,
               we also highlight other themes relating to nineteenth-century women’s historical
               correspondence as reflected in our dataset.</p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <head>5 Case study</head>
            <p>One way to challenge the boundaries of archival organisations and their collections
               is to create a virtual collection of metadata relating to women’s letters. We will
               proceed in three steps, firstly discussing the quantitative results in terms of the
               total number of women actors and women as so-called records creators, then examining
               the ten most active women in terms of letters, and finally exploring the position of
               women in specific correspondence networks over time. Our findings will be
               contextualised in relation to archival practices, scholarly focus, and the
               modernisation of nineteenth-century society. Finally, we will assess the
               representativeness of our dataset as a whole. To this end, the Åbo Akademi University
               Library and the Finnish Literature Society will serve as sample datasets and main
               points of comparison. These organisations have exceptional collections covering
               different geographical regions and representing the two national languages, Swedish
               and Finnish.</p>
            
            <p>The current dataset comprises 114,052 actors, 24.1% of whom are female. While this
               figure is higher than that observed in previous European projects, it is less
               pronounced than expected based on research emphasising that women’s epistolary
               activity peaked in the nineteenth century <ptr target="#monagle_etal2023"/>. However,
               when we filter out groups and administrative units, and consider all person-actors in
               the dataset, the percentage of female actors rises to 29%. In the Åbo Akademi data,
               the proportion of female actors is 31.7%, and in the Finnish Literature Society data,
               it is 32.5%. Furthermore, of the 1,246,573 letters, on average 38% were sent by women
               (alone or together with someone), and the corresponding percentage of letters
               received was 36%.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to examining the characteristics of the entire pool of person-actors,
               collecting and enriching epistolary metadata gives us access to another class of
               actors. In archival parlance, these are known as <quote rend="inline">records
                  creators</quote> or <quote rend="inline">entities of origin</quote>. These are
               individuals, families, corporations or administrative units that <quote rend="inline"
                  >create, receive or accumulate a body of records, personal papers or
                  objects</quote>
               <ptr target="#entity_origin2024"/>. Their names are usually found in catalogue
               headings and indexes of letter collections. Archival fonds contain letters received
               by such entities, but often also letters sent by them. These may be copies kept by
               the entity or originals added to the collection at a later date. Often, there are
               also letters sent and received by other entities that may have had a family or other
               connection with the original records creator. The Finnish Literature Society provides
               a basic list of records creators on its website to serve as an entry point to its
               epistolary material. In contrast, the Åbo Akademi University Library provides online
               access both to its epistolary database and the database of records creators; however,
               it remains difficult to find and combine information about actors who are not records
               creators, even if they had extensive collections.</p>
            
            <p>By comparing the total dataset of person-actors with that of records creators, we can
               see that the status of records creator is granted to a select few. Although the
               number of actors varies greatly between our two sample organisations, only around 2%
               of them are also records creators in both cases. In the case of the Åbo Akademi, we
               can see that the gender of records creators is relatively close to that of the
               overall actor data, but it is significantly higher in the Finnish Literature
               Society’s collections (37.5% female). By contrast, the National Library of Finland
               has a very ‘masculine’ catalogue of epistolary fonds: 85% of records creators are
               men, with only 14.6% being women. These differences can be explained by the archival
               policies and constituencies of these organisations. The Åbo Akademi University in
               Turku was founded in 1919 to serve the Swedish-speaking minority in newly independent
               Finland. Its collections include materials representing the old Swedish-speaking
               aristocracy and intelligentsia — the country’s early political and cultural elite. In
               contrast, the Finnish Literature Society, founded in 1831, has a very different
               profile. Its collections reflect the ideas of nineteenth-century Finnish-language
               nationalists in the fields of folklore studies and Finnish language and literature.
               The collections include the personal archives of literary writers, translators,
               literary critics, and others. Through the National Library’s connection to the
               University of Helsinki, professors, researchers, and other academics are well
               represented in the library’s archival collections as professional groups.</p>
            
            <p>​​Linking to external data sources provides additional insight into the actors and
               records creators, as well as the general characteristics of the entire dataset. Only
               19% of all actors can be enriched with information provided by links to databases and
               repositories of historical narratives that can be captured with digital methods.
               However, these individuals are responsible for 85% of all letters. This means that we
               have a very prominent group of individuals who have left an extensive trace of
               themselves in the form of letters and other personal papers, despite being few in
               number, and a large number of individuals with few letters and connections. Such
                  <quote rend="inline">long tails</quote> have been observed in other epistolary
               collections of a different nature <ptr target="#ahnert_ahnert2019" loc="31"/>. When
               it comes to the narrower group of records creators, however, about 80% of them can be
               linked to external resources, suggesting a continuing scholarly interest in them.
               Collected lists of records creators can therefore serve as a kind of<quote
                  rend="inline">who’s who</quote> of nineteenth-century Finland and
               nineteenth-century studies. The collections of prominent records creators have also
               preserved the correspondence of individuals who would otherwise have left little or
               no archival trace.</p>
            
            <p>Thus, we can see that nineteenth-century epistolary collections in general, and the
               group of records creators in particular, are dominated by literate elites and the
               middle classes. This is consistent with what we know about the development of
               literacy in this north-eastern corner of Europe. At the beginning of the nineteenth
               century, writing skills were still rare, despite the fact that half of all Finns
               could read. It was not until the introduction of primary schools in the 1860s that
               literacy and text comprehension really began to spread. Statistics from the
               Evangelical Lutheran Church indicate that, by 1880, 86.3% of the population could
               read, though only 12.4% were literate. By 1900, the literacy rate had risen to 38.6%,
               reaching 55.3% ten years later <ptr target="#latomaa_nuolijarvi2002"/>. The educated
               elite and middle classes also appear to have taken care to preserve their
               correspondence in personal, family and manor archives. These archives were
               transferred to cultural heritage organisations when they began collecting private
               archival material in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
            
            <p>These organisations operate under the principle of provenance (<hi rend="italic"
                  >respect des fonds</hi>), which emphasises preserving records according to their
               origin and within the units in which they were collected. However, a digital, virtual
               metadata archive provides an opportunity to challenge established practices and offer
               new perspectives on archival materials. For instance, we can explore the collections
               of notable politicians and academics, or large family holdings, and ‘liberate’
               mothers, sisters, and daughters by granting them independent status as virtual
               records creators, thereby ensuring their immediate visibility and discoverability.
               One such individual is <name>Aline Reuter</name> (née Procopé).</p>
            
            <p>Table 3 presents the ten most active women in the entire dataset, ranked by the
               number of letters. Interestingly, only half of these women are linked to content-rich
               external resources; that is to say, they have a Wikipedia page or an entry in the
               National Biography of Finland. For these women, we have readily available
               occupational information. In contrast, much less information is at our disposal for
               the other four women – the <q>dark horses</q> of our virtual archive. <name>Aline Reuter</name>’s
               correspondence at the Åbo Akademi comprises 8,178 letters (3,072 sent and 5,106
               received). This makes it one of the largest collections of letters from a
               nineteenth-century woman in our current dataset. You might think that such a large
               collection, covering a period considered so formative for Finnish nationalism and
               studied by generations of historians, would be used extensively. This does not seem
               to be the case, however. The few mentions that shed light on her life can be found in
               the National Biography entries of her three famous professor sons and in the Reuter
               family entry (see, for example, <ptr target="#autio1997a"/> and <ptr
                  target="#autio1997b"/>). There are also Wikipedia pages (e.g. <quote rend="inline">Edvin Titus
                  Feodor Reuter</quote>) and a Geni.com profile (<quote rend="inline">Aline Reuter</quote>) which, for
               technical reasons, cannot be used to enrich the data. These sources provide
               information about her lifespan (1828–1916) and some details about her family (husband
               and four sons).</p>

            <p>However, obituaries of <name>Aline Reuter</name> in the newspapers provide further insights into
               her life. She had 13 children in total, many of whom died young. She homeschooled the
               surviving children until they reached grammar school age, and she acquired such
               excellent skills in subjects such as Latin and mathematics that, when her son Odo
               Reuter, a professor of zoology, became blind, Aline Reuter (now in her 80s) took over
               his professional correspondence and proofread his papers. However, more than her
               obvious intellectual agility, the obituaries emphasise her <quote rend="inline">rich
                  inner life</quote> and remind readers that <quote rend="inline">there were no
                  great events in her life</quote> (see, for example, <ptr
                  target="#dagens_press1916"/>). This statement alone arouses curiosity about the
               contents of Reuter’s extensive collection of letters, tempting one to immerse oneself
               in her <quote rend="inline">epistolary space</quote>
               <ptr target="#how2003"/> and reflect on its representativeness, for example with
               regard to the experienced, personal nationalism of nineteenth-century women <ptr
                  target="#eiranen2021"/> or other significant ways of discursively shaping oneself
               and one’s surroundings <ptr target="#monagle_etal2023" loc="12"/>.</p>
            
            <p><quote rend="inline">Mother Aline</quote> is thus a prime example of a marginalised
               or forgotten person who only becomes clearly visible when we recontextualise her
               letters in the collected and enriched metadata. Indeed, it is only through the
               combined metadata that we can confirm the extraordinary quantity of surviving
               correspondence. By way of comparison, the most extensive set of male correspondence
               is that of Senator Leopold (Leo) Mechelin (1839–1914), whose entire collection of
               letters from various organisations totals 14,399.</p>
            
            <p>We can make further observations about the gender distribution in the Finnish
               nineteenth-century data with the help of network analysis and simple degree metrics,
               which build on the above analysis of the number of contacts each person had. This
               enables us to visually assess the extent to which the women in our letter collections
               were connected. As our dataset spans over a hundred years, we decided to examine two
               periods in more detail: 1830–1860 and 1880–1910, which reflect the socio-economic,
               legal and social changes that affected women’s correspondence in the modernising
               Grand Duchy of Finland. From the 1860s onwards, women gradually gained access to
               higher education. As the country’s economy liberalised, women’s legal and economic
               rights were strengthened, and they participated in associations and societal
               movements. Hypothetically, this meant that women’s epistolary networks became more
               similar to those of men, and we were interested to see if we could find traces of
               this in the archived epistolary material.</p>

            <p>As expected, looking at the position of women in the correspondence networks reveals
               that their connectivity increases as we move from the first to the second period. At
               the same time, the <quote rend="inline">archival status</quote> of the most
               well-connected women and their links to external biographical databases undergoes a
               significant change. As illustrated in Figure 2, during the initial period of letter
               correspondence (1830–1860), men dominate the centre of the network, with most women
               (represented by blue nodes) situated in the middle and outer spheres. The ten most
               connected women are also not central figures from an archival perspective (see
               Appendix 2, Table 2). As they are not records creators, the bulk of their letters
               have been archived as part of their families’, husbands’ or sons’ fonds. Furthermore,
               linking to external databases has only resulted in links to genealogical databases.
               Professional information was only found for two women (Fredrika Runeberg and
               Elisabeth Blomqvist), who have also attracted academic interest (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#klinge2006"/>
               <ptr target="#konttinen2000"/>). The situation is quite different for the ten most
               connected men of this period (see Appendix 2, Table 1): they are all records
               creators; their letters originate from 7–9 archival organisations; and they are well
               linked to external sources, including Wikipedia.</p>

            <p>During the second period (1880–1910), women were more centrally positioned within the
               network, as illustrated in Figure 3. The profile of the women with the most
               connections in this later period is very different to that in the earlier period:
               nine out of ten of these women are records creators, and their letters are widely
               distributed across different archival organisations (see Appendix 2, Table 4). These
               women are well-known cultural figures – artists, writers and politicians – and are
               well connected to external data sources. They also have a Wikipedia entry. Their
               network profiles thus differ significantly from those of lesser-known figures such as
                  <quote rend="inline">Mother Aline</quote>, who, despite her extensive
               correspondence, plays a more peripheral role in the network. In both periods, the
               biggest difference in our metadata between men and women is that women have
               significantly fewer contacts, even those who worked in the public and private sectors
               in the late nineteenth century (such as the social activist and politician Aleksandra
               Gripenberg; see Table 3 and Appendix 2, Table 4 and Appendix 3, Table 2). Based on
               archival materials, women’s epistolary networks were narrower. However, as noted
               above, the ties were proportionally stronger in terms of the number of letters
               exchanged.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, networks consisting exclusively of correspondence between women provide
               further insight into the organisation of archival collections, the focus of scholarly
               interest and the changes brought about by the modernisation of the country. The
               configurations of women’s correspondence networks are illustrated in Figure 4 for the
               periods 1830–1860 and 1880–1910. During the earlier period, women exchanged
               significantly less correspondence, and their networks formed several distinct but
               small clusters. While most of the women are the same as in the full network, the
               shape of the network now suggests a predominance of family networks, as previous
               research <ptr target="#monagle_etal2023"/> has suggested. However, further data
               analysis and qualitative research are needed to confirm this. Additionally, many of
               the women’s letters are uniquely archived at Åbo Akademi, likely due to the
               institution’s substantial collection of family archives from the Swedish-speaking
               population. For the second period (1880–1910), the situation is very different, as
               can be seen from the shape and size of the network in Figure 4. The women were highly
               interconnected, with significant nodes at the centre of the network. Examining the
               most central women reveals that, with the exception of two individuals, all of those
               in the <quote rend="inline">women's network</quote> and the broader network remain
               the same during this period, albeit with slightly different rankings (see Appendix
               3). Therefore, in the latter period, it is not possible to identify separate clusters
               of women’s correspondence. Instead, women’s correspondence is interwoven with the
               networks of the country’s artistic and cultural elite, whose correspondence is spread
               across all the archival organisations in our dataset.</p>

            <p>Despite these extensive collections, archived materials only provide patchy and
               partial access to nineteenth-century epistolary communication. When we compare the
               dataset — and thus the collections of the largest Finnish cultural heritage
               organisations — with statistics on all letters sent in the Grand Duchy of Finland, it
               is clear that coverage and representativeness are low (Figure 5). The collected
               metadata does not reflect the growth in letter correspondence in the country, which
               was driven by the expansion of trade, commerce and administration, as well as the
               development of technologies that supported easy and affordable letter exchange, such
               as cheap postage and stationery, prepayment of letters and increasing delivery speeds
               (Pietiäinen, 1988). After the mid-1880s, when literacy rates began to rise, archival
               coverage decreased further still. It appears that archival organisations lacked the
               means or interest to preserve everyday correspondence in the Grand Duchy, and
               lower-class individuals and small businesses may not have had the inclination to
               create personal archives. Therefore, an interesting question is whether we can
               estimate what materials are missing. Can we see what is not there?</p>

            </figure>

            <p>At the start of the data collection, we asked cultural heritage organisations to
               estimate the proportion of their collections that were unorganised and uncatalogued
               (see Appendix 1). The results of this survey clearly demonstrate a growing shortage
               of resources for the labour-intensive work of archival description. However, it is
               reasonable to assume that letters added to collections since the nineteenth century,
               perhaps up to the 1980s, were more thoroughly indexed due to the greater availability
               of human resources relative to the size of the collections. Nevertheless, the
               collections do not represent a random sample of nineteenth-century epistolary
               culture, as evidenced by the social and cultural status of most of the records
               creators. Therefore, while cultural heritage organisations’ collections are not
               representative of the majority of letters sent, especially in the late nineteenth
               century, they do reflect the membership of the elite and upper middle classes
               relatively well.</p>
            
            <p>However, what has been preserved of the total body of correspondence that once
               existed is often coincidental, even among the literate elite. For instance, Senator
               Mechelin received 12,129 letters, which are kept in his family’s collection at the
               National Archives. However, we only have 2,270 of his letters (mainly in the
               collections of other individuals in five different organisations). Assuming that
               people mostly replied to the letters they received, this kind of disparity in the
               material points to definite gaps in the collections. Conversely, it is more
               challenging to determine whether the proportion of female actors (24% of the total,
               and 29% of those for whom gender can be identified) and the proportion of letters
               sent and received by them (38% and 36%, respectively) is indicative of missing
               material. Similar, large-scale datasets of epistolary metadata from other European
               countries are lacking, making it difficult to compare our findings and results. The
               closest we have are the results of the ambitious RRL projects mentioned above, which
               provide a rare insight into the gender distribution of epistolary material from
               earlier centuries. The datasets currently available in Germany and the Netherlands
               show an overwhelmingly male correspondence of 85%, but this is understandable given
               the projects’ premises.</p>

            <head>6 Discussion</head>
            
            <p>In the era of flourishing research on LGBTQIA+ histories, exploring the role of women
               as archival protagonists may not seem very revolutionary. In fact, the first attempt
               to enable sustained research on women’s history in Finland was made in the mid-1990s
               with the publication of <hi rend="italic">Naisia, asiakirjoja, arkistoja: Suomen
                  naishistorian arkistolähteitä</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Women, Documents, Archives:
                  Sources for Women’s History in Finland</hi>, <ptr target="#harkonen1994"/>), which
               identified various archival collections of potential interest to the emerging field
               of gender history. However, as we have demonstrated, applying data science methods
               can render the process of critically revising archival collections much more
               systematic and powerful. Epistolary metadata is, of course, only one type of
               information that can be used to interrogate the role and visibility of different
               social, cultural, or ethnic communities in our social narratives. Indeed, cultural
               heritage metadata may offer a more affordable and realistic way of making dispersed
               archival and museum collections accessible and researchable than mass digitisation
               projects. However, metadata alone can be frustrating for scholars accustomed to
               interrogating vast textual archives, and a dialogue between digital and more
               traditional research methods is required. Nevertheless, using <quote rend="inline"
                  >pure</quote> metadata enables us to <quote rend="inline">map missing bricks in
                  the wall of knowledge</quote>, for instance by categorising individuals and social
               groups whose biographies do not yet exist <ptr target="#guldi2024" loc="525"/> – a
               task we have begun with the help of Aline Reuter, among others.</p>
            
            <p>Jo Guldi has recently referred to such digital approaches as <quote rend="inline"
                  >counting the silences</quote>
               <ptr target="#guldi2024" loc="524"/>. <quote rend="inline">Silence</quote> is a
               buzzword used by scholars to refer to missing data or issues that archives cannot or
               will not ‘talk about’. It is often used interchangeably with terms such as ‘gaps’,
               ‘bias’ and ‘occlusion’ (see also <ptr target="#carter2006" loc="217"/>. To clarify,
                  <ptr target="#guldi2023" loc="30–37"/> distinguishes between occlusion and bias.
               For Guldi, a digital humanist who works with large textual corpora, the Occluded
               Archive is an archive that is closed to view. It consists of materials that we cannot
               access for various reasons. Occlusion operates at the level of political and
               historical factors, as well as archival organisation (e.g. which social groups are
               literate, which archives are preserved, and how relevant documents are hidden in
               separate datasets). For Guldi, bias is <quote rend="inline">dirt</quote> or <quote
                  rend="inline">filth</quote> in the textual content. This powerful metaphor refers
               to racist, misogynistic and other expressions and narratives that carry a heavy
               ideological burden. Historians are usually aware of such omissions and biases, which
               they identify as part of their work. However, these factors are not always considered
               when data science methods are applied to materials.</p>
            
            <p>Our data consist of metadata from the letter collections; we do not have the content
               of the letters in our dataset. This means that we need to introduce an additional
               feature of occlusion: the partly accidental and partly selective nature of the entire
               life cycle of historical and archived materials. Many archival theorists interpret
                  <quote rend="inline">silences</quote> as tangible gaps in the archival record.
               These gaps can arise from everyday practices such as the accidental disappearance or
               deliberate destruction of materials prior to and after archiving, or from appraisal
               and subsequent rejection in a cultural heritage organisation (<ptr
                  target="#fowler2017"/>; <ptr target="#edquist2021"/>). The historical reasons for
               this kind of fundamental, irreversible non-preservation vary, and there is little
               evidence of such processes producing structural bias in historical sources. However,
               it may be possible to model some gaps using digital methods or conduct the
               time-consuming task of searching organisational records for traces of decision-making
               processes. In this paper, we have identified both gaps (in the representativeness of
               the data, compared with the information available on nineteenth-century postal
               activity and literacy) and silences (in the lack of research on certain notable women
               in our dataset) by examining what has been preserved in the collections of Finnish
               cultural heritage organisations. A persistent <quote rend="inline">silence</quote> is
               often only recognised in retrospect, for example, when a paradigmatic change in
               theory or technology allows a new view of the archived material.</p>
            
            <p>​​It is true that material separated into different repositories or organisations is
               a strong occluding factor. However, occlusion also occurs within individual
               organisations. A key factor here is how organisations prioritise the creation of
               metadata and categorise catalogued documents as open and accessible or closed (e.g.
                  <ptr target="#sherratt2015"/>). Only collections that have been organised and
               described can be made available to researchers and other users (see Appendix 1).
               Furthermore, it has been argued that creating a fonds and assigning a records creator
               carries significant intellectual and hegemonic weight, yet these decisions often
               remain invisible <ptr target="#drucker2021" loc="326"/>, <ptr target="#friedrich2021"
                  loc="312–317"/>.</p>
            
            <p>Digital humanities scholars often work with materials that were originally indexed in
               a library context. While these bibliographic databases, catalogues, and digitised
               repositories are incomplete and less representative than many scholars might hope
               (see, for example, <ptr target="#bode2020"/>), they do comprise fairly homogeneous
               sets of materials. Furthermore, issues of archival access and its political
               constraints are frequently examined in the context of sensitive government records
               (e.g. <ptr target="#risam2019"/>; <ptr target="#sherratt2015"/>). However, it is also
               important to recognise these mechanisms in relation to cultural heritage materials
               and those held in private archival organisations. All organisations whose letter
               metadata are included in our dataset have their own acquisition policies, enabling
               them to accept or reject archival material offered to them, provided they justify
               their decisions. Compared to material generated in library contexts and governmental
               organisation records, archival organisations’ vast collections, particularly person
               and family collections, seem more <quote rend="inline">wild</quote>, especially when considering material beyond
               the high research canon. Cataloguing categories vary, information comes in different
               formats, and many collections are only partially organised, with huge backlogs of
               unorganised material.</p>

         <div>
            <head>7 Conclusion</head>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce the framework of Critical Collection History. Using the
               powerful qualities of Linked Open Data, this framework finds relevant features in a
               dataset comprising over a million letters and over 100,000 actors. It is motivated by
               discussions in the fields of critical archival studies and digital humanities. We
               argue that critical collection history occurs when the boundaries of cultural
               heritage organisations and their collections are erased and the structure of
               traditional paper archives is challenged and <quote rend="inline">weirded</quote>. At the most general
               level, critical collection history asks whose actions and experiences are important
               enough to be archived and catalogued, and which individuals and groups are visible in
               finding aids, indexes and external research repositories. Digital technologies enable
               us to examine archival collections individually and collectively as large sets of
               historical data, not as static and inherently objective entities providing direct
               access to the past, but as multi-layered, dynamic and processual entities resulting
               from various historical, socio-economic and political processes. Similar to many
               contextualising approaches to digital collections (e.g. <ptr
                  target="#beelen_etal2023"/>), the aim is not to <quote rend="inline">correct</quote>, but to identify
               how such processes and layers manifest in the collections in question. Furthermore,
               we are not merely users of archival data; we are also actively involved in making the
               archival record more visible (or ‘louder’) in the digital space (Johnson, 2017). For
               instance, we make decisions about modelling the data and solving problems related to
               resource constraints when obtaining source data (<ptr target="#drobac_etal2023b"
               />).</p>
            
            <p>This article discusses materials that mainly comprise person and family collections
               held in private archival organisations. These collections are widely used by scholars
               and favoured as case studies in archival research <ptr target="#edquist2021"/>, yet
               they are rarely considered in postcolonial and other critical approaches. As a case
               study, we have created a virtual archive of <quote rend="inline">epistolary
                  women</quote>. Our analyses suggest that the collections available to us as linked
               data are relatively representative of the upper echelons of nineteenth-century
               society. However, it is more difficult to assess whether the proportion of female
               person-actors (29% of all actors and 26–34% of the more filtered group of records
               creators in two sample organisations) accurately represents women’s epistolary
               activities. Nevertheless, network analysis indicates that the available epistolary
               metadata reflects changes in women’s societal roles brought about by modernisation.
               This demonstrates that even partial datasets can reveal significant historical
               phenomena and be profitably used by humanists, provided the gaps or ‘missingness’ are
               understood and acknowledged <ptr target="#ryan_ahnert2021"/>.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, we have identified certain epistemic silences: women who do not feature
               in our current research canon but who have substantial archival collections that
               could offer valuable insights into a variety of historical topics. Overall, the
               results are tentative but promising. However, we must bear in mind that the current
               data include four online publications of letters and letter metadata from only nine
               cultural heritage organisations – albeit the largest and most central – and only from
               those collections that have been indexed at the level of individual letter exchanges.
               Nonetheless, despite all the gaps and omissions discussed in this paper, the
               collected metadata provides the most comprehensive sample available of who actually
               sent and received letters in nineteenth-century Finland.</p>
            
            <p>This article has demonstrated the potential of linked open data and critical
               collection history in identifying gendered structures within epistolary metadata
               collections. In the future, we can continue to explore women’'s correspondence as a
               historical phenomenon by focusing more qualitatively on the women we identify using
               data-driven methods. Furthermore, we can direct our historical research towards
               archival collections as the outcome of specific political, cultural, and
               socio-economic pressures – pressures that leave their mark, turning the archives
               themselves into artefacts of history <ptr target="#burton2005" loc="6"/>. To achieve
               this, we should digitise the acquisition registers of various organisations and study
               their decision-making processes relating to archival appraisal where possible. While
               many organisational histories touch on these issues – most recently <ptr
                  target="#hakala2023"/> study of the Swedish Literature Society in Finland’s
               archival collections – a combined history focusing on private epistolary collections
               as a case study remains to be written. A critical collection history is also always a
               history of the construction of collective identity; it can reveal whose experiences
               are available to us as historians, and also whose experiences have been narrativised
               as history at different stages in the past.</p>

               heritage organisations. To date, 57 archives, libraries and museums have responded.
               The survey contains 18 questions to help understand the current situation and the
               challenges of aggregating collection metadata. Here, we present results relevant to
               this paper in Figures 1–3. In summary, 86% of respondents either have or possibly
               have nineteenth-century letters in their archival collections. The word ‘possibly’ is
               explained by the fact that only 33% have catalogued all their letters. Conversely,
               14% have not catalogued them at all. Regarding archival finding aids, only 36% of
               respondents with nineteenth-century letters have catalogues in electronic form, such
               as databases, Excel files, or Word documents. This makes the content
               machine-readable, but additional structuring and harmonising is required.</p>
