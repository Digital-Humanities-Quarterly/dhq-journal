                  <p>This paper discusses a recent project which applied computational methods to catalogue
                     data in an attempt to generate new information on the 
                     provenance of Islamicate manuscripts in UK repositories. Using a subset of records taken from the Fihrist Union 
                     Catalogue as a dataset, we analysed and grouped together manuscript descriptions which shared
                     selected physical features, then examined 
                     the occurrence of records with secure provenance within those groups to see if information
                     on the place of origin could be extrapolated across 
                     them. While we gained useful information regarding the provenance of manuscripts,
                     the chief conclusion of the project was that catalogue data, 
                     in its current state, poses serious challenges for quantitative analysis. This is
                     partly due to the various purposes for which data has 
                     traditionally been collected (in contexts where codicological descriptions had a different
                     purpose) and partly due to inconsistencies in the 
                     dataset. In our conclusion we put forward strategies for working with inconsistent
                     data, make suggestions for changes to cataloguing practices to 
                     answer the requirements of digital methods, and propose new research questions addressing
                     the history of catalogues and cataloguing practices 
                     which came into focus during the project. We also make a case for the potential of
                     digital methods to enable new approaches to decolonisation, 
                     focusing on data modelling, data provenance, and accessibility.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In <cite class="title italic">Islamic Codicology</cite>, François Déroche calls upon the creators of manuscript catalogues to produce 
                     “... coherent sets of documents that shed light on one another” [<a class="ref" href="#deroche_2006">Déroche 2006</a>, 17]. Given the 
                     complex relationships between historical manuscript cultures and collections of manuscripts,
                     between collections of manuscripts and the 
                     catalogues which describe them, and between catalogues as datasets and the outputs
                     of digital methods, what is the nature of this 
                     “light”? What new insights do we gain by using data derived from manuscript catalogues to
                     generate new information 
                     at scale? And in doing so, what do we learn about historical manuscript cultures,
                     about the history and formation of collections of 
                     manuscripts, about the processes by which catalogues are created, and about our own
                     motivations as expressed in our digital methodologies?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">This paper discusses a recent project, funded by the Cambridge Humanities Research
                     Grants scheme, which applied computational methods to 
                     catalogue data in an attempt to “shed light” on the provenance of Islamicate manuscripts in UK repositories. While its focus 
                     was on manuscript history, the project was created in the context of contemporary
                     concerns around the decolonisation of collections in cultural 
                     heritage institutions, which have given a new importance to research on the origins
                     of manuscripts in UK collections. However, 
                     establishing the provenance of Islamicate manuscripts presents particular challenges
                     for both cultural and historical reasons. The places and 
                     dates of production are rarely mentioned in the texts themselves — and tracing the
                     biography of Islamicate manuscripts held in UK 
                     repositories is further complicated not only by the texts' migration to the UK but also their previous movement within the 
                     Islamicate world. As a result, we rely heavily on the physical features of manuscripts
                     when attempting to ascertain their place and date of 
                     production as well as their wider history.

                     Islamicate World in UK Repositories as a dataset, we used computational methods to analyse and group together manuscript
                     
                     descriptions which shared selected physical features (size, script, orientation etc.),
                     then examined the occurrence of records with secure 
                     provenance within these groups to see if information on the place of origin could
                     be extrapolated across them. We also investigated how new 
                     information generated by this process could be integrated back into the dataset, while
                     retaining a clear sense of its own data provenance. 
                     Although we gained useful information regarding the provenance of manuscripts, the
                     chief conclusion of the project was that catalogue data, in 
                     its current state, poses serious challenges for quantitative methods. However, our
                     engagement in the process also raised interesting questions 
                     about the history and nature of the collections described, about cataloguing practices
                     and data modelling, and about the relationship between 
                     digital methods and research questions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">There are a number of reasons for the existence of large collections of Islamicate
                     manuscripts in UK repositories. First, the 
                     Islamicate manuscript tradition is in itself very large, partly due to the early adoption
                     of paper as writing support (from the 8th century 
                     onwards) and partly due to the late adoption of printing at industrial scale, which
                     led to the survival of a tradition of copying manuscripts 
                     by hand into the 20th century. This is further amplified by the historical expansion
                     of Islam and the subsequent dominance of Arabic as the 
                     language of scholarship across a large geographical area. We therefore find a vast
                     number of handwritten texts, some of which have travelled on 
                     trade or pilgrimage routes, while others remained in their area of production. In
                     a UK context, empire, trade, and missionary 
                     activities led to a long-standing engagement with Islam and the Islamicate world,
                     which in turn led to the development of large manuscript 
                     collections.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Collections in Western libraries and archives, which are the focus of this study,
                     are typically made up of items from across the Islamic world. 
                     Here we find related texts, copied in different countries, which bear typical features
                     of the craft, materials, and artwork relating to the 
                     local environment in which they were produced (the Qur'an being perhaps the best example of a text which was produced extensively 
                     across a wide geographical area). While the text has traditionally been the basis
                     of philological and bibliographic research, a focus on the 
                     physicality of the book as a carrier of text allows us to investigate the material
                     culture both of the texts themselves (as different texts 
                     tend to have different material contexts), and of the contexts which produced them.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">With the rise of Islamic codicology as an evolving discipline, physical aspects of
                     manuscripts are attracting more attention, especially in a 
                     Western context. Western collections of Islamicate manuscripts often contain a diverse
                     mixture of traditions both in terms of places of origin 
                     and eras of production. Compared to bodies of material which have remained in their
                     original contexts, these collections can appear 
                     idiosyncratic and require a different approach when investigating their origins and
                     subsequent histories. Given the comparative lack of 
                     indications of geographical origins in the text of Islamicate manuscripts, analysis
                     of physical features has become a key method for 
                     establishing provenance.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Manuscript collections from the Islamicate world demonstrate an enormous variety of
                     physical features in terms of shapes, orientations, 
                     materials, layouts, and binding. The long history of paper production and use in the
                     Middle East adds an additional layer of 
                     complexity to the texts' codicological makeup. While in their current context the
                     places of origin have often been obscured, these manuscripts 
                     have nevertheless been produced within a coherent tradition. Codicology gives us a
                     framework to establish criteria for comparative observation 
                     and analysis which can give clues to these traditions. This framework, captured in
                     machine-readable form, provides the basis for a flexible 
                     and expandable data model which can respond to new discoveries and approaches.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Quantitative codicology is concerned chiefly with the statistical analysis of the
                     correlations between a subset of physical characteristics of 
                     a corpus, as well as what the relationships between those characteristics might tell
                     us about a) the items themselves, and b) the social, 
                     economic, and cultural contexts of their production [<a class="ref" href="#ornato_2020">Ornato 2020</a>]. In addition to studies based on particular manuscript 
                     cultures, quantitative codicology has been widely applied in comparative research
                     that attempts to isolate features that are the particular 
                     result of the context of production (from those which are common to all contexts)
                     and to trace the effect of cross-cultural influences and 
                     borrowings on manuscript cultures [<a class="ref" href="#beit-arie_2020">Beit-Arié 2020</a>]. Existing computational work has tended to follow this model, concentrating 
                     either on what can be inferred from relationships within a single dataset, or on combining
                     information from two or more datasets to generate 
                     new information.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">One of the chief challenges of quantitative work on manuscript collections is the
                     tension between individualising and generalising modes of 
                     enquiry raised by Daston and Galison in the context of the history of science [<a class="ref" href="#daston_galison_2007">Daston and Galison 2007</a>].  
                     Although our methodology is largely based on shared features of manuscripts, manuscripts
                     themselves are, by their very nature, unique objects 
                     which resist general approaches. Burrows has pointed to the dominance of individual or small-scale approaches in manuscript
                     
                     studies [<a class="ref" href="#burrows_2018">Burrows 2018</a>], but, as Daston and Galison point out, there are features which only reveal 
                     themselves at scale: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>Some significant historical phenomena are invisible at the local level, even if their
                           manifestations 
                           must by definition be located somewhere, sometime. There are developments that unfold

                     Scientific analysis of physical aspects of manuscripts, such as watermark imaging

                        mapping, from TEI into RDF, described in detail in a separate paper [<a class="ref" href="#burrows_et_al_2021">Burrows et al. 2021</a>]. However, the work also highlighted 
                        fundamental problems in establishing identity, not just of the manuscripts themselves,
                        but also for entities described in manuscript 
                        catalogues. Burrows focuses on people and works, but our own research encountered similar difficulties
                        in finding robust 
                        identification schemes or consistent vocabularies for describing physical aspects
                        of manuscripts such as layout, script, material, and 
                        binding. What we learned from this project is that variations in metadata format are
                        less problematic in the analysis of manuscript 
                        catalogue data than variations in the identification and description of specific aspects
                        of manuscripts — a factor which came into sharp

                        between Cambridge University Library and the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford to build an online catalogue 
                        for manuscripts from the Islamicate world. Descriptions and indexes of manuscripts
                        in these collections had previously only existed in 
                        out-of-print catalogues, handlists, and card indexes, some dating back to the 18th
                        century. The idiosyncratic structuring of information 
                        and lack of accessibility in these resources made them difficult to use and navigate.
                        The aim of the project was to find an open, digital 
                        solution to the issue of discovering both the manuscripts themselves and the texts
                        they contained, which went beyond the limitations of 
                        bibliographic cataloguing as applied to modern publications.

                        this, we embarked on the process of manually

                        Fihrist has grown to be a union catalogue for manuscripts from the Islamicate world in UK repositories, 
                        containing over 15,000 manuscript descriptions from 22 institutions. While many of
                        these records are based on legacy data drawn from 
                        existing catalogues, the data in Fihrist has also been enriched by descriptions resulting from new research and cataloguing
                        
                        projects. The most obvious point of interaction with the resource is through the web
                        interface, which has done much to facilitate discovery 
                        of and access to the manuscript material. However, in this article, our focus is on
                        Fihrist as a dataset for research — and

                        of texts in digital 
                        form”, expressed in a set of guidelines for the encoding and description of text. The fact
                        that Fihrist was initially 
                        developed as a stand-alone resource meant that it did not have to conform to the restrictions
                        imposed by existing library systems, which 
                        tended to use more restrictive metadata standards such as MARC or EAD. This allowed
                        us to take advantage of the flexibility and 
                        expandability of TEI in integrating manuscript research into the descriptive records.

                        <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:21f5f0f8-3dac-4977-a7c1-dff494ac5851" onclick="window.open('https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:21f5f0f8-3dac-4977-a7c1-dff494ac5851'); return false" class="ref">Enrich</a>, a project focused on the description and 
                        encoding of European manuscript resources. While this served as a basis, it was felt
                        that a more customised approach was required for 
                        Islamicate manuscripts, following an established mindset focused on the differences
                        between manuscript cultures rather than what they might 
                        have in common. A schema was commissioned which contained specialised elements for
                        “distinct” features, such as the encoding of 
                        patronymic names and ruling practices.

                        a conceptual error and that a standardised and 
                        consolidated approach across manuscript cultures was a more effective data model which
                        would foster the kind of interdisciplinary work we 
                        were interested in. This approach focussed on the remodelling of data to make it responsive
                        to digital methods and research questions, 
                        rather than trying to replicate the organisation and structures present in the legacy
                        data. Our consolidated approach has generated 
                        interesting discussions about the feasibility and/or desirability of using a single
                        schema a) across manuscript cultures, and b) to answer 
                        a variety of research questions. We address some of these issues in our conclusion.

                        you to use the Manuscript Description (msDesc) module 
                        either in the header (the descriptive metadata part of the record) or in the <span class="monospace">&lt;text&gt;</span> element (as a transcription of the source 
                        document). At an early stage we made the pragmatic decision to encode manuscript descriptions
                        in the header, thus treating them as 
                        descriptive metadata rather than as source texts, in large part to allow the <span class="monospace">&lt;text&gt;</span> element to be used for transcription of the 
                        manuscript itself. However, this decision to treat catalogue descriptions only as
                        metadata <em class="emph">about</em> manuscripts rather than as 
                        texts to be transcribed (and described) in their own right is perhaps the source of
                        some of the confusion which can surround the use of 
                        manuscript catalogues as datasets (the same would apply to the transformation of manuscript
                        catalogues into MARC or EAD records, or into 
                        other metadata formats).

                        them to give values that would group effectively 
                        (see below for details). Quantitative analysis of general patterns in this subset
                        of data (such as proportion of manuscripts originating 
                        from different countries, number of decorated manuscripts, etc.) gave us pointers
                        as to which features were likely to be indicators of 
                        place of origin and should therefore be included in the grouping process.

                        on the place of origin was significant. At this stage, 
                        the subject specialists fed back into the grouping process, suggesting new or refined
                        features, and the grouping was re-run until 
                        satisfactory results were obtained. The final stage was to integrate the newly-generated

                        lacked a firm provenance.

                        essential to one of the core aims of the project: to ensure that our own activities
                        and methods were explicitly recorded in the dataset to 
                        inform future research. By default, TEI provides a limited range of values for <span class="monospace">@cert</span>: “low”, “medium” and 
                        “high”. In this test project, we used the value “medium” by default, as we were not confident that the results of our processes 
                        could be classified as producing results with a high level of certainty, and where
                        the correlation was tenuous we did not feed the results 
                        back into the dataset. It may be that a more granular approach to certainty would
                        be necessary for a larger project with a broader range 
                        of results.

                        of the richness of the descriptive records, having 
                        been the subject of a recent cataloguing project led by Jake Benson. The collection is also geographically diverse,

                        Persian having richer records than manuscripts in Arabic 
                        and other languages. Secondly, cataloguing is a work in progress, based partly on
                        new research and partly on legacy data derived from 
                        historical catalogues.

                        originating in large part from the Crawford Collection 
                        of Alexander Lindsay, 25th Earl of Crawford (1812–1880), with later additions from the collections of 
                        Samuel Robinson of Wilmslow (1794–1884) and of manuscripts formerly held at Manchester's 
                        Chetham Library. The Crawford Collection, itself the product of the acquisition of several preceding
                        collections, had been 
                        the subject of previous cataloguing activities: a descriptive handlist drawn up by
                        Michael Kerney and a list of titles, 
                        authors, and scribes published in 1898 [<a class="ref" href="#benson_2021">Benson 2021</a>].

                        between manuscripts which come from two closely related traditions: Indian and Iranian.
                        We would expect manuscripts from these traditions 
                        to share many features, such as script and language, but our proposition was that
                        codicological information might allow us to hypothesise 
                        about which unplaced manuscripts belong to which tradition.

                        Of these, 190 are recorded as originating in 
                        India (59% of placed manuscripts) and 38 from Iran (12% of placed manuscripts). This might lead us to assume 
                        that of the 1,000 unplaced manuscripts, c.590 would be likely to be of Indian origin
                        and c.120 of Iranian origin. However, it may, for 
                        example, be that the larger number of manuscripts recorded as being from India are not a reflection of general patterns in 
                        the collection but of a range of other factors, such as: a) it being easier to identify
                        Indian manuscripts from textual or other data, 
                        b) an expertise in the identification of Indian manuscripts on behalf of the cataloguers
                        who have described the collection, and/or c) 
                        extra attention being paid to the cataloguing of Indian manuscripts for funding or
                        institutional reasons. While they do not help us 
                        directly in predicting the origin place of manuscripts, these overall statistical
                        features of the dataset come in useful when assessing 
                        the significance of patterns which emerge in the grouping stage.

                        effectively group — a common problem in the dataset as a whole, discussed below. There
                        are a handful of manuscripts recorded as 
                        originating in other contexts: 4 from Afghanistan, 8 from Britain, 4 from Pakistan, 10 from 
                        Turkey, and 1 from Uzbekistan. It is worth noting that the Geolocation API's allocation of manuscripts with 
                        more general origin places (such as “Indian Subcontinent”) to India rather than to 
                        Pakistan highlights general issues with the translation of historical areas to modern nation
                        states. The same issue applies 
                        to the allocation of manuscripts recorded as originating in the “Ottoman Empire” to Turkey — we 
                        address these issues and offer some possible strategies in Section 9.

                        and 100% of Iranian manuscripts are in Farsi, 
                        reflecting the Mughal Empire's adoption of Persian as a state language. Script follows

                        combinations of features (for instance small, 
                        decorated manuscripts with 11-20 lines per page) were more effective in distinguishing
                        between manuscripts from India and 
                        Iran.

                        values for the two traditions). This produced 7 groups 
                        representing sets of 10 or more manuscript records which shared identical values for
                        all of these features. Of the 1,324 records in the 
                        dataset, 169 (or 13%) were represented in the output groups — with other records either
                        forming groups of fewer than 10 or lacking the 
                        necessary information to be included in the grouping process.

                        to manuscripts which were from one of the two 
                        traditions (e.g., manuscripts that were <em class="emph">either</em> from India <em class="emph">or</em> Iran). Of the 169 records 
                        which formed groups of 10 or more, 136 had a place of origin recorded, with the majority
                        from India (104) or 
                        Iran (25) and only a few from other countries (1 from Afghanistan, 1 from Pakistan, 3 from 
                        Turkey, and 1 from Uzbekistan), and 33 records lacking a place of origin. However, looking at cataloguing 
                        practices within the collection, it is possible that a major cause of this effect
                        is the concentration of cataloguing activity on Persian 
                        and Indian material, leading to fuller records which are more likely to form into
                        larger groupings.

                     (15%), the groups do exhibit some clear tendencies. Manuscripts in Groups 1, 3, and
                     4 have a higher chance of being recorded as originating in 
                     India (with Group 3 at 86% being at first glance the most compelling example), and manuscripts
                     in Groups 2, 5, 6, and 7 have a 
                     higher chance of being recorded as originating in Iran (Group 6 showing the strongest tendency at 50%). However, even for Groups 
                     3 and 6, the size of the groups (14 manuscripts in each) makes it difficult to make
                     a strong case for the generation of hypotheses on the 
                     place of origin of “unplaced” manuscripts within these groups. This highlights the central problem with our analysis:
                     the number of 
                     catalogue records, even in a collection which has been the subject of a recent and
                     comparatively large-scale cataloguing project, that have 
                     sufficiently detailed codicological descriptions to form the basis of effective quantitative

                     practices — the most obvious examples being the 
                     different terms for paper used in the records (“chart” and “paper”) and the mixed use of 
                     both two- and three-letter language codes (e.g., “fa” and “per”). This is a wider 
                     problem in the description of manuscripts. Bridget Whearty, discussing similar variability in descriptors for parchment 
                     (“parchment”, “parch”, “membrane”, 
                     “vellum”), references Ben Albritton's assertion that “… manuscript studies, as a 
                     field, is not interoperable with itself” [<a class="ref" href="#whearty_2022">Whearty 2022</a>, 171]. The second is the concentration of cataloguing efforts 
                     on certain parts of the collection, which then inevitably feature more heavily in
                     the analysis — in this case, Iranian and Indian 
                     manuscripts. As a result, our test case is a microcosm of the larger Fihrist dataset, where, despite documentation of practices 
                     and the use of common standards, inconsistencies in the recording of values in the
                     data are common, and there is enormous variability in the 
                     depth of cataloguing even within the collections of single institutions.

                     in the description of key codicological features. 
                     For Islamicate manuscripts, the classification of manuscripts as being written on
                     “paper” (or 
                     “chart”, see above) is so broad as to be meaningless in terms of analysis, with 100% of manuscripts
                     in our test 
                     dataset exhibiting this feature. Other features, such as script or type of decoration
                     would also benefit from more granular classification 
                     schemes, such as those suggested by Déroche and Gacek [<a class="ref" href="#deroche_2006">Déroche 2006</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#gacek_2001">Gacek 2001</a>]; 
                     see also the work on script classification done by [<a class="ref" href="#prebor_zhitomirsky-geffet_miller_2020">Prebor, Zhitomirsky-Geffet, and Miller 2020</a>]. In some cases, such as the 
                     descriptions of inks, seals, and bindings, prose descriptions are not accompanied
                     by formal classification schemes, making it almost 
                     impossible to include these features in computational analysis.

                     perhaps inevitably, a mixture of very broad categories 
                     (e.g., “Indian Subcontinent”) and more specific terms (“Delhi”, 
                     “Lucknow”, “Isfahan”), and the inclusion of values denoting 
                     historical political entities (“Mughal Empire”, “Safavid Empire”, 
                     “Ottoman Empire”) alongside modern national classifications (“India”, 
                     “Iran”, “Turkey”). Issues regarding the derivation of 
                     meaningful entities for computational analysis from historic place names have been
                     discussed at length in the context of the

                     focussed on resolving place names as they appear in text, rather than places which
                     we assert as the sites of origins of manuscripts, there is 
                     considerable overlap here as a number of origin places in our dataset are transcribed
                     from colophons, stamps, or other text found in the 
                     manuscript. Our problems here were compounded by the lack of a comprehensive use of
                     a formal identifier scheme for places in the 
                     Fihrist dataset. This led us to rely on automated conversion (using the GeoPy library) of
                     the prose text in 
                     <span class="monospace">&lt;originPlace&gt;</span> elements into codes relating to modern nation states for the generation of consistent
                     units for analysis. In addition to 
                     a considerable error rate, this also raised the issue of the applicability of modern
                     national boundaries to historical manuscript cultures. 
                     Some possible approaches to this problem are discussed in Section 9.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p66">In common with the majority of catalogue datasets (and digital editions), Fihrist's current use of identifiers and vocabularies 
                     concentrates mainly on the intellectual contents of the manuscripts rather than on
                     their history or physical manifestation. It makes extensive 
                     use of identifiers, both internal and external, for people and works — including VIAF identifiers where available. 
                     Machine-readable forms of dates are given, and there has been some effort to be consistent
                     in the recording of language codes (ISO two-letter 
                     codes), the roles people have with regards to the manuscript (MARC relator codes),
                     and material and script types (local schemes). However, 
                     one of the results of our analysis was to highlight considerable variance of practice
                     even in these limited areas. In addition to the need for 
                     more granular vocabularies for material and scripts, as mentioned above, future work
                     would benefit from similar controlled vocabularies or 
                     identifier schemes for the description of other codicological featuresk, with decoration,
                     binding, inks, and seals being just a few examples. 
                     Put simply, if a feature is not consistently classified according to a controlled
                     vocabulary, then even if it is described in detail it is 
                     almost impossible to include it in any kind of quantitative analysis, and if these
                     vocabularies or identifier schemes are not standard across 
                     datasets, then the kind of large-scale comparative analysis promised by computational
                     approaches becomes very difficult.

                     potential to “shed light”, though perhaps not on the

                     and historical manuscript cultures is complex — and 
                     catalogue data has much to tell us about the processes by which collections of manuscripts
                     come to us in their present forms and about the 
                     motivations and practices of those (including ourselves) who have created, described,
                     and used those collections. The application of digital 
                     methods to catalogue data also highlights some important general issues in data-driven

                     <div class="ptext" id="p70">While many of the data issues which became clear during the project point towards
                        the need for changes in cataloguing practices in 
                        response to the requirements of digital methodologies (see Section 9.2 below), there
                        are some practical steps that could be taken with 
                        the current dataset to improve the results of quantitative analysis in the short term.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p71">In the first instance, automated approaches to the identification and correction of
                        inconsistencies in the data would produce a more 
                        reliable resource. One of the advantages of applying digital methodologies to datasets
                        is that inconsistencies and errors of this kind 
                        tend to be highlighted at an early stage. Two examples that came up in the course
                        of the project are the consistent use of two-letter 
                        language codes (e.g., “fa” rather than “per”) and attribute values for materials 
                        (e.g., “paper” rather than “chart”). Across the whole of the Fihrist 
                        dataset (c. 15,000 records), the identification and correction of inconsistencies
                        arising either from mistakes in data entry or in 
                        variations in cataloguing practices is likely to make a significant difference in
                        terms of the reliability of the results of 
                        quantitative analysis.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p72">Another possible strategy would be the use of natural language processing to extract
                        standard attribute values from the textual 
                        content of elements. The project identified a number of fields where standardised
                        attribute values were present but were not granular 
                        enough to be useful in quantitative analysis. The most striking example was “paper”, which was so ubiquitous 
                        in the dataset as to be almost useless in terms of categorising material. Similar
                        problems were encountered with the values used for 
                        script and decoration. The textual content of the elements often provides additional
                        information (for instance, on the type of paper or 
                        sub-categorisation of script) which could be drawn upon to generate a more specific
                        and granular attribute value. The same logic would 
                        apply to the generation of new attribute values where none currently exists for fields
                        likely to give important information about the 
                        provenance of manuscripts, such as seals, inks, and bindings. However, the use of
                        natural language processing to auto-generate values at 
                        scale needs to be approached with caution, as the free text content of elements may
                        contain nuances that require an understanding of the 
                        context of specific terms within a sentence or paragraph (e.g., distinguishing between
                        cases where a manuscript is <em class="emph">on</em> 
                        European paper from cases where European paper has been used for repairs).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p73">One specific problem encountered in the project was the reconciliation of place names
                        as recorded in the manuscripts with historical 
                        regions appropriate to our analysis. As described above, we used the GeoPy Python
                        library to attempt to derive a broad idea of the 
                        regions of origin from the values recorded in the dataset. However, the returned values
                        tended to reflect modern national boundaries, 
                        which were not always useful in the context of our research question. The building
                        of project- or subject-specific gazetteers (along 
                        the lines of the <cite class="title italic">Pelagios</cite> project) and/or the inclusion of suitable identifiers at the point of cataloguing
                        
                        are probably the best long-term strategies to address this problem (see Section 9.2
                        below), but for large sets of legacy data, automated 
                        reconciliation against existing resources could provide at least a partial solution.
                        One possible route could be the Wikidata 
                        reconciliation functionality provided by tools such as OpenRefine, though we would
                        then be relying both on the presence of the 
                        placenames in Wikidata and on the level of historical context provided in the entry.
                        With similar caveats, automated reconciliation of 
                        values in the dataset against external resources could also be an option for other
                        values in the dataset, such as scripts, seals, and 
                        materials. This would have the additional advantage of allowing us to automatically
                        enrich our analyses with data from external 
                        sources.

                        question. These are neatly summed up by 
                        Ezio Ornato (our emphasis): “… everything in a book is theoretically measurable, or, better yet, … 
                        each characteristic observed in a book may be formalized to extract measurable data
                        from it, <em class="emph">provided it is worth the

                        of things you can record about pretty much any object — what you choose to record
                        (and how you choose to record it) depends on what you 
                        want to find out. Manuscript cataloguing is a type of data modelling, and, as Flanders and Jannidis say, 
                        “ … the formalized model determines which aspects of the subject will be computable
                        and in what form” 
                        [<a class="ref" href="#flanders_jannidis_2015">Flanders and Jannidis 2015</a>, 229]. Given an infinite number of possibilities, deciding on what is 
                        “<em class="emph">worth the effort</em>” to record relies on an idea of the purpose of the model — what we want to 
                        “be computable and in what form”. The blueprint of the model lies in the questions you want to ask.

                        in a collection which has been the subject of a

                        challenge.

                        identification, authority, and method. 
                        We select which features we want to describe, we identify those features according

                        of quantitative methods by putting them in the context of the situations and motivations
                        that produced them. In this we would argue 
                        against Drucker's distinction between the identification of “trends in the data” against 
                        “phenomena in the actual and lived world” [<a class="ref" href="#drucker_2021">Drucker 2021</a>, 115]. Data are phenomena of the 
                        actual and lived world and deserve our attention as such. A catalogue record for a
                        manuscript is just as “real” as the manuscript 
                        itself.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p84">Our project raised several potential research avenues in this area. In selecting our
                        sample dataset, the inconsistency of depth and 
                        detail of description across the corpus became apparent — both between manuscript
                        catalogues and within single catalogues themselves. 
                        Even in our sample dataset, there was a distinct difference between the level of information
                        recorded about manuscripts written in 
                        Persian and other parts of the collection. An analysis of the relationship between
                        types of material and level of detail recorded might 
                        produce interesting insights both at the micro and macro level, allowing us to trace
                        the interests and specialities of individual 
                        cataloguers within catalogues and to analyse broader cultural and historical patterns
                        of interest and engagement (including patterns in 
                        contemporary funding of collection description).

                     <div class="ptext" id="p85">In addition to providing information on manuscripts, catalogues are also texts with
                        their own historical and cultural context. The use 
                        of language in catalogues of Islamicate collections could be a valuable resource for
                        allowing us to trace European attitudes to the Near 
                        and Middle East over time. A useful study could also be made of the type of person who was involved
                        in the cataloguing of 
                        collections and by what “authority” (institutional, academic or cultural) they made their assertions about the manuscripts.
                        Of 
                        particular interest here would be the identification of “lost” voices in the catalogues, including native speakers who made 
                        unacknowledged contributions to the work.

                        Decolonisation is often framed in terms of 
                        “fixing” historical biases in data, but it would be valuable to take a more reflective and
                        critical stance on the meaning and 
                        purposes of “decolonisation” as it relates to our project. Description and classification rely on sets of rules,
                        and as 
                        Daston argues, “the island[s] of stability and predictability” created by rule-sets are 
                        “... the arduous and always fragile achievement of political will, technological infrastructure
                        and internalized 
                        norms” [<a class="ref" href="#daston_2022">Daston 2022</a>, 5]. Brown and Davis-Brown point to the political nature of 
                        this “achievement”, arguing that “...classifications never emerge solely from the 
                        material to be classified since our ways of defining the material itself are shaped
                        by the dominant intellectual or political paradigms 
                        through which we view it” <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#davis_davis-brown_1998">#davis_davis-brown_1998</a></span> — with our own classifications no exception. As we 
                        try to put the sources upon which our conclusions are based into their historical
                        context, it is crucial that we acknowledge the 
                        “dominant intellectual or political paradigms” which shape our own activities.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p87">Data models and data modelling were central to many aspects of our project. The creation
                        of the TEI dataset that formed the basis of our 
                        analysis was an act of data modelling, as was our own manipulation of the data in
                        preparation for analysis. The legacy data that makes 
                        up much of the dataset has its own models, which encapsulate particular mindsets and
                        attitudes and anticipate particular approaches. 
                        Data models in manuscript catalogues tend to divide collections into categories that
                        are the embodiment of colonial classifications, 
                        such as the grouping of materials originating in diverse geographical contexts under
                        the label “Oriental”. They also often claim 
                        authority over the content without referencing indigenous sources or contributions.
                        Finally, they tend to anticipate that the study of 
                        different “manuscript cultures” will be undertaken separately, mitigating against interdisciplinary approaches across
                        traditions. 
                        Digital data models often replicate these mindsets rather than challenging them.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p88">We see an opportunity in the digital context to embark on data modelling activities
                        that address decolonisation from a data-driven 
                        perspective. As we have seen, data modelling is not just about preparing content for
                        publication and analysis; data modelling also 
                        frames what it is possible to do with the data. By using text encoding we can create
                        descriptions that are based on conceptual models 
                        rather than strict hierarchies and formulations, and by working collaboratively across
                        disciplines we can use this flexibility to create 
                        data that is inclusive and interoperable. We also advocate an open approach both to
                        data availability and licensing which opens it up to 
                        audiences beyond the academic sphere — though there are real issues around the need
                        for documentation, technology, skills, and 
                        infrastructure for new audiences to make use of the data.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p89">In practical terms, this means moving away from traditional data models and towards
                        structures, vocabularies, and identifiers that allow 
                        us to capture the individual characteristics of different manuscript traditions, while
                        also facilitating interdisciplinary and 
                        comparative approaches. This is partly encapsulated in our collaborative work on the
                        schema, but it also extends towards the 
                        establishment and use of vocabularies and identifier schemes — in particular a move
                        towards taxonomies, which can group related 
                        phenomena together using numerical identifiers rather than relying on domain-specific
                        language and terminology. A good example of the 
                        potential of these approaches was an analysis we undertook of the intellectual network
                        of authorship of manuscripts from 
                        Cambridge's Islamicate collections and Oxford's Western medieval manuscripts (see Figure 5). This relied not 
                        only on these collections sharing a data model, but also on their use of VIAF identifiers, which allowed us to resolve the 
                        identity of authors who had been described in very different ways in the legacy data
                        from which the datasets were constructed.

                        origins of manuscripts, but the origins of data 
                        turned out to be equally if not more important. We have talked about the value of
                        addressing the context in which legacy data was 
                        produced, and we also need to extend the same mechanisms to our own data modelling
                        activities. Practically speaking, this means adopting 
                        a transparent and non-hierarchical model of recording contributions directly into
                        the data, whether they be by people or by processes, 
                        and taking advantage of the versioning capabilities of modern repositories to record
                        the various stages in the development of our 
                        datasets. As well as fostering a collaborative and iterative approach, this should
                        mean that people using the data for similar projects 
                        in the future will have a more solid foundation for their analyses and a better idea
                        of their point of departure.
