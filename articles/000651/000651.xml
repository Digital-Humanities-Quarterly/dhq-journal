Three methods frequently used to perform this task are: 1. Reading large amounts of source texts and manually collating the relevant passages; 2. Reading prior research (henceforth: books) on the subject, collating references from these books, and locating source texts according to these references; 3. Searching by keyword in full-text corpora (usually in the source language, such as Perseus, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, papyri.info, or Ma’agarim). (Green 2000; Dalton &amp; Charnigo 2004; Sinn &amp; Soares 2014).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Each of these methods has certain disadvantages. Many researchers’ continued recourse to methods 1 and 2 demonstrates the current limits of full-text keyword search (Green 2000). Further criticisms of keyword searches describe forcing historians to retrieve texts in a specific way, producing biases, blind spots and false positives (Hitchcock 2013). “[Historians’] topics of interest are described through words but cannot be pinpointed through simple keywords alone. Yet, once sources have been digitized, entering isolated keywords often becomes a prerequisite for access” (Huistra and Mellink 2016:224).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In this paper, we describe Tiresias, a novel database created by juxtaposing back-of-book indices in scholarly books. Tiresias’ aims are to provide simple and efficient retrieval of ancient sources by subject, and to be a tool useful for beginners, advanced students and researchers in the disciplines of ancient history, epigraphy, papyrology, theology, and kindred areas, as a complement to full text keyword searches. First, we shall describe how the database was created and the possibilities it affords for the study of ancient history. We then review some of the available databases and their limitations and describe how Tiresias fills the gap of providing a digital search tool while maintaining the intellectual value of book indices.</p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold underline color(222222)">Tiresias</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">Tiresias (<ref target="https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/">https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/</ref>), named after the mythological blind prophet, is a detailed, searchable database of subject tags to ancient texts and artifacts, currently consisting of almost 140,000 subject tags for about 16. million references to sources. The search form allows for searches of several keywords, filtering by various fields (e.g., author, work, subject, keyword), and immediate full-text retrieval for efficient perusal of the relevant sources. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The database was constructed through the following innovative method. Many research books in the fields of ancient history, classics, or biblical studies, are published with two indices: one for subjects (called a subject index, index of terms, or <hi rend="italic">index rerum</hi>) and one for ancient source references (also known as an <hi rend="italic">index locorum</hi>). Through these indices, each page of the indexed book was identified as relating to certain subjects as well as certain sources, indicating with a high probability that these source references can be tagged as related to these subjects. This probability was improved by a validation method which we describe and assess in this article. Using this method, we produced a <hi rend="italic">subject tag</hi> for each source reference, i.e., a short description of a subject highly relevant to the source reference. For example, the source reference “Genesis 1.3” could be tagged with the subjects “light” and “creation.” With the help of a computer program, the tags were combined to create a general database of subject tags for ancient sources. The subject-source database is thus based on existing expert-made back-of-book indices, unified and assisted by digital means. </p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold underline">Corpora and methods</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">The creation of Tiresias can be divided into the following stages: </p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold">Selection and retrieval of books</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">The database focuses on ancient Mediterranean religion. This appeared to be a relatively well-defined area with many academic books, of which many have both subject and source indices. The books used are mostly by leading publishers in the field (Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Brill and De Gruyter), all of which have a strong presence in digital publishing, from the following areas: classics, biblical studies, Jewish studies, patristics, and ancient history. The Ancient Near East is not included for technical reasons – too few indices meeting the relevant criteria.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, there were two essential criteria for inclusion of books: a. the existence of both an <hi rend="italic">index locorum</hi> and a subject index. b. Cheap, convenient, and legal access to a high-quality scan of the indices. It was clearly preferable to use books for which PDFs with embedded text are readily available, in order to skip the stage of OCR of scanned text. This meant that the books used were usually published after 2000, as indicated in Figure 1. About 600 books were identified as meeting all these criteria and their indices were downloaded via subscriptions of the Younes &amp; Soraya Nazarian Library at the University of Haifa. Additional book indices are continuously entered with expanded availability and continued publication of new books.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note> Figure 1: Books indexed in Tiresias per book publication year (total: 459; data for 2022 is up to August)</p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold">Index parsing</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">Indices are relatively structured data, and this facilitates reading them algorithmically.

Therefore, in order to include all the information in the index, it was necessary to correctly identify subject headings and sub-headings. This was done algorithmically in Python 3.10, with human input and supervision. The stages were as follows: </p><list rend="numbered"><item>Algorithmic conversion of PDF to text format (.txt).</item><item>Human identification of subject index format: whether sub-headings exist; whether each sub-heading is on a separate line and marked by an indent; if not, what character is used to mark sub-headings. </item><item>If the sub-headings are marked with a character, this is used to algorithmically differentiate them from main headings. Otherwise, since the order of the main headings is always alphabetized, a human marks on which row the first letter of the subject headings begins and this marking is used to identify main headings (beginning with this letter) and sub-headings (not beginning with this letter). Also, lines beginning with propositions (“and”, “by”, etc.) are identified as sub-headings, and additional minor corrections are applied (e.g., identifying sub-headings when they start with the same letter as the heading). </item></list><p rend="List Paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the process, the subject headings and sub-headings were joined by a comma, and page ranges were expanded. </p><figure><graphic n="1002" width="5.942647222222222cm" height="3.016836111111111cm" url="media/image1.png" rend="inline"/></figure><p style="text-align: justify;">Figure 2: An example of a main subject heading and sub-headings, with each sub-heading on a separate line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Table 1 provides an example of data entry for the output appearing in Figure 2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Table 1: Example of subject entry and corresponding page numbers from a book subject index</p><table rend="rules"><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Subject</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Book #</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Page #</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">100</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, Christian</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">90</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, Christian</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">91</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, Jewish</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">93</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, Jewish</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">94</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, Jewish</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">95</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, with fire</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">12</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, with fire</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">13</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">Baptism, with fire</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;" rend="List_Paragraph">14</cell></row></table><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="underline">Source indices</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">Every reference in the source index was parsed and divided into the following columns: 1. author and title identifying number, 2. reference, and 3.

The source indices contained more than 12 thousand unique ancient works from different traditions and languages. For example, The New Testament book, First Corinthians, can be written in various abbreviated forms such as “1 Cor.”, “First Corinthians”, “I Cor.”, etc. Many ancient works have several naming conventions for the title and for the author. Furthermore, the chapter and verse number can also be written according to different conventions, using Roman or Arabic numerals, and different types of dividers. To meet this challenge, we constructed an author-title database of modern naming conventions and abbreviations of ancient authors and works, which the program consults to identify the references included in the indices. This database utilized and collated existing free databases such as the TLG canon of Greek Authors and Works, abbreviation tables from various Greek and Latin dictionaries available online, the Classical Works Knowledge Base, SBL handbook, and other lists. Many additional authors and titles for Greek, Latin, Coptic, Hebrew and Syriac works were added incrementally to the database as more indices were processed and additional authors and titles were identified manually.  The script checked each line in the source index against this database to identify authors and titles. When a match was made of both author and title, a work number was assigned. Fuzzy matches were not used because different works can have very similar titles (e.g., 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians). Lines which were not identified as authors or titles were assumed to be of references and page numbers. These were distinguished by manually inputting the differentiating character (usually a whitespace) between them. This script generally produces good results, but with some errors as a result of unrecognized authors or titles, or incorrect differentiation of reference and page numbers, usually in cases of unusual references. Therefore, an expert examined the outputs (in csv format) to delete or correct wrong rows. </p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold">Database construction</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">The main database, in a flat csv file, was constructed by combining the subject and source indices along the page column. <hi rend="color(222222)" xml:space="preserve">This database currently contains 16,420,264 rows.

Moreover, references may be supplied as examples for some side point in the discussion, having no link at all to the main subject of the page. Another problem is that references are not always consistent, with different editions dividing the source text in different ways.

For example, as seen in table 4, if the source reference “1 Cor. 10:2” was tagged with the subject tags “baptismal, spirit” and “spiritual life” from one book,  then “1 Cor. 10.2” will be entered into the table of validated references with the token “spirit”, and the following rows in the validated table could be added as seen in Table 6.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)">Table 6: validated database rows</hi></p><table rend="rules"><row><cell style="text-align: justify;">Row #</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">Ancient Work #</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">Reference</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">Book #</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">Page #</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">subject</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">token</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;">1</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">8056</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">10.2</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">7</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">150</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">baptismal, spirit</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">spirit</cell></row><row><cell style="text-align: justify;">2</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">8056</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">10.2</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">8</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">70</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">Spiritual life</cell><cell style="text-align: justify;">spirit</cell></row></table><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)" xml:space="preserve">The two rows in the validated table were derived from rows 4 and 5 in the unvalidated table, which have the same source reference, an identical token (“spirit”) and derive from different books (7 and 8).

Furthermore, communities of closely connected subjects are determined using the Louvain method for community detection and marked by color. This creates a mapping of the whole field based directly on the scholarly research, intuitively displaying the centrality or marginality of specific subjects, the relationship between subjects, and the different sub-disciplines of the study of ancient religion. The visualization is also instructive concerning subjects which are on the borders between sub-disciplines, that is, which are shared by one more of these sub-disciplines, as opposed to subjects which are in the core area of each.

The color shade corresponds to the number of references tagged by unique subjects, divided by all references from this century, serving as a normalized measure of the salience of the connection between the two subjects in a certain period. Figure 9 displays the heatmap of the word ‘oath’ with other words through the centuries.

Prime examples for these are the TLG for ancient and medieval Greek works (currently including more than 110 million words from over 10,000 works); the Brepols Library of Latin text (over 60 million words from 3100 works); </hi><hi rend="italic color(222222)">Ma’agarim</hi><hi rend="color(222222)">, for Hebrew works (over 9 million words from 4500 works as of 2008); CAL lexicon, for Aramaic (3 million words). Many other databases exist, but these examples stand out for offering parsing, lemmatization, searches by lemma, advanced searches with wildcards, filtering by author, period, genre, and other tools. Also notable is the Perseus site, which is at the forefront of facilitating access to Greek and Latin texts in the original and in translation, allowing the insertion of commentary, browsing and searching by reference, and linking to relevant artworks. A large percentage of published Greek and Latin papyri and epigraphical material are online via Trismegistos, PHI searchable Greek inscriptions, Papyri.info, and other sites, with lemmatization and extensive metadata for each of the documents. However, all of sites hardly provide information on the subject of the text, and therefore do not allow for searching by primary texts according to subject, or, in other words, searching through a controlled vocabulary as opposed to a free text search (unusual in this regard are the papyri search sites, where the metadata of each document occasionally includes a description of the text and keywords of its subject, usually in German(. Research has shown that user retrieval of information is best accomplished through a combination of controlled vocabulary and free text searches, as these methods retrieve different types of data or have complementary functions (Croft 2002; Gross, Taylor and Joudrey 2015).</hi> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)" xml:space="preserve">As opposed to primary sources, much effort has been expended in the past decades on subject indexing and categorizing of secondary literature by controlled vocabularies. An important function of all the online databases for articles and book chapters (e.g., JSTOR, Wiley Academic, Atla databases, L’Annee Philologique, RAMBI, Index Islamicus, etc.), as well as of library catalogues, is to help the user locate secondary literature on a specific subject. There has been extensive research on best practices of subject indexing in the context of such databases and catalogues (see Yu and Young, 2004; Landry, Bultrini, O’Neill and Roe, 2011) as well as thought on alternative visualizations of indices and searches (Merčun, Žumer, Aalberg, 2016; Włodarczyk 2013). A central question that arises from this research is how to create comprehensive, efficient and understandable subject trees, while minimally imposing the viewpoint of its creator, in order to assist researchers rather than constrain them to a specific taxonomy. Researchers have recommended basing subject indices on topic maps, semantic webs or universal thesauri, which represent the language as a whole, rather than ad-hoc subject headings (Włodarczyk 2013, Nilbe and Tarkpeia 2013). This question is even more significant in the case of a primary source index, as the source texts are the objects of study and not only, as in secondary literature, assisting instruments. In Tiresias, we currently use the subjects presented in the indices without any attempt at constructing a subject tree or topic map as an aid for subject retrieval. However, in the future we may attempt to parse the structure of the subjects and sub-headings of indices themselves as an innovative method to construct subject trees or ontologies of specific scholarly fields. </hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)">A number of digital tools have been developed in the past decade for linking ancient sources to secondary literature or to other ancient sources. Biblindex is an index for locating quotations and allusion of biblical verses in early Christian literature, created at first manually and then using dedicated software. The Proteus project developed a quotation detection tool for locating quotations of classical Greek and Latin texts (in original and English translation) in the Internet Archive, which includes 16 million open access documents. The Tesserae project (Scheier, Forstall, Coffee 2014) has developed tools for comparing identical passages in two ancient texts, and even for locating similar passages which are not verbatim quotes through topic modeling (however, the tool does not actually identify the topics discussed, only the similarity in vocabulary of two passages). The Cited Loci project locates all the articles on JSTOR discussing specific words or lines of an ancient text, and then allows reading the text in the central pane while scrolling through the relevant paragraphs of the articles discussing it in a side pane (Colavizza and Romanello 2019). These projects demonstrate the current scholarly interest in utilizing computation to locate, compare and link ancient and modern texts, but also that these tools are based directly on the lexical level of the texts or on quotation, neglecting the level of topic or subject.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)">A small number of projects have attempted to harvest back-of-the-book index data for various aims. Piotrowski (2010) has used place names listed in indices of a Swiss law book corpus in order to geo-tag the texts and has discussed some of the challenges and possibilities of utilizing indices in this way. Romanello, Berti, Babeu and Crane (2009) have discussed how to extract information from indices of critical editions to locate and identify fragments of ancient authors. Both publications provide important technical information on the tools needed to read and mine the information in indices. Michael Huggett and Edie Rasmussen (2013) constructed a small “meta-index” of subjects from the indices of a hundred open access books to allow users to approach the relevant pages of these books directly from the meta-index. They also studied the responses of users to their meta-index. This publication is especially useful regarding the challenges this project encountered in unifying different indices and their solutions, as well the features users most appreciated.</hi> </p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold underline color(222222)">Tiresias in Context</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)" xml:space="preserve">Tiresias has several salient advantages compared to existing tools: </hi></p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="color(222222)" xml:space="preserve">Tiresias is not based on keyword searching of full text.

Here, he sees that “sacrifice”, “women” and “witnesses” and “law court” are subjects strongly linked with oaths. Moreover, he sees that almost all the references linked to oaths are from before the 4th century BCE. This can lead to the research question: are oaths in decline after this period?

Currently there are 13 validated results for this search, and 220 unvalidated results (see above for an explanation of the validation process). </hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)">He starts from investigating the validated results using the texts provided and can also go directly from the results to the modern publications in which they were discussed. After studying these, he turns to the unvalidated results, which were mentioned only in one book as connected to the subject. Some of these results do not appear relevant to the subject and can be discarded, but some of them are relevant, and considering their large number this facilitates location of relatively less known texts on the subject.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="underline color(222222)">Case no. 2: BA student</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)" xml:space="preserve">A BA student in religion, writing a term paper on conceptions of resurrection from the dead in early Christianity. The student reads scholarly literature on the subject, but as this is a large subject is finding it difficult to cope with the large and varied literature. Furthermore, the term paper instructions called for engagement with primary sources on the subject, and (beyond the New Testament) she is finding such sources difficult to locate. She turns to sites for searching the full text of Greek and Latin literature, and searches for “resurrection”. This supplies her with some texts for analysis, but these are limited to cases in which the keyword explicitly appears in the text, and only in translations of Greek and Latin texts; furthermore, some of the cases turn out to be not actual discussions of resurrection but random mentions. </hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)">Turning to Tiresias, she searches the same keyword among the validated results. She receives 76 results, with texts from the Hebrew Bible, second temple literature, the New Testament, Church fathers and rabbinic literature. She can read these texts in the original language (Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic) and in facing English translations. These results are not limited to cases in which the keyword appears in the text, but include texts discussing the subject without the keyword. Furthermore, all the results are relevant to the subject. Of these, she chooses two ancient sources for further study, assisted by the detailed sub-heading tags. After choosing these, she clicks on to the modern publication in which these ancient sources were discussed, to find scholarship on the subject.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="underline color(222222)">Case no. 3: Teaching</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)" xml:space="preserve">An instructor is building a new module on the history of emotions in antiquity. The study of the ancient sources is central in the module, as she is also interested in a broad, comparative view of several ancient cultures. When thinking of the general subjects and structure of the module, she turns to the heatmap and network visualizations to gain a general feeling of the subject. Here she sees connections with Stoic and Platonic thinkers, but also the connections between emotion, the body and nature (Figure 10). Searching for “anger”, “love” and other emotions provides more information.  </hi></p><figure><graphic n="10010" width="12.435416666666667cm" height="12.435416666666667cm" url="media/image8.png" rend="inline"><desc>A picture containing scatter chart

Some of these she finds useful for background discussion, others for study together with her students, with texts and translations already available. Here too, searching for several other terms linked to emotions (some of them obvious such as “love” or “fear”, others found from the network, the heatmap or the subject subheadings of the validated results) leads to further texts on more specific subjects.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)">In class, the instructor asks her students to search themselves for the term “anger” on Tiresias and to explore the results (for digital humanities usage in the classroom, see Locke 2017, Fyfe 2018). This leads to a discussion of the validity of using english terms of emotion to describe ancient phenomena and to how using different types of indices can direct our focus and structure our worldview, as well as more specific questions concerning the validity of the the method used by Tiresias to locate subjects and texts.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="color(222222)">In summary, the usage scenarios were developed based on our experience in academic research and teaching. Scholars are likely to become highly skilled in using the continually developing functionality of Tiresias and adopt it as one of their standard tools for aiding research based on primary sources. Users with simpler needs can also benefit substantially from access. For example, the BA student will realize that studying in the humanities can be supported uniquely by innovative digital technologies that were developed in academia, thus forming a mental link between humanities and innovation. Further, usage of Tiresias in addition to library databases will sharpen the understanding regarding the difference between primary and secondary sources. The teacher would be able to show younger learners that novel technology can help uncover historical knowledge and that the study of history may involve interactive assignments to promote curiosity and literacy, while problematizing the methods used to create such technologies and their impact on our thought.</hi></p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold underline color(222222)">Generalizability</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">Book indices are a long-time subject of extensive research as part of the broader domain of information retrieval. Our contribution to this vein of research is both specific and generalizable. Specifically, we constructed a novel database based on book indices which aids in intellectually describing the content of ancient texts. This paper explains through description and usage scenarios how this improved access to ancient texts in Tiresias serves scholars and students of ancient history, helping them to save considerable research time, to raise new questions and to achieve a broader view of the field.  </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The generalizable aspect of our work is the notion to automatically construct new knowledge based on joining data from two independent indices pointing to the same book page, adding a contextual level to an otherwise technical reference. One may envision the applicability of the current approach to additional fields of research. For example, art books containing a picture index and subject index are good candidates for a similar approach, promoting a solution for another longstanding issue, the challenge of assigning meaning to visual materials. The 2016 scandal surrounding Facebook’s removal of the Pulitzer prize winning, iconic photograph known as “napalm girl” is a vivid reminder for the critical importance of context and the poor ability of algorithms to contextualize, especially when visual materials are concerned. Another example could be literary, scientific or engineering books that contain a subject index and an author index. By crossing subject and author indices, one might draw inferences in two directions: 1) authors’ areas of knowledge; 2) the prolific authors writing about a certain subject.  </p><p style="text-align: justify;">A practical contribution of this research concerns publishers who may find value in applying Tiresias logic to their collections of books as an added-value service to readers. Publishers could leverage their existing data to combine additional sources such as academic journals to enrich and further validate the data.</p><list rend="numbered"><item><hi rend="bold underline color(222222)">Summary</hi></item></list><p style="text-align: justify;">In summary, Tiresias offers access to ancient primary texts through the lens of humanistic scholarship described in the subject indices of academic books. It is a valuable tool for researchers wishing to gain fast and broad retrieval of sources combined with modern interpretations of their meaning. The database provides opportunities for filtering and visualization which aid the research process. In future research, we aim to further augment the validity of the source-subject pairs as well as investigate aspects of historical knowledge extraction. We encourage our readers to visit the Tiresias web site (<ref target="https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/">https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/</ref>) and send us feedback. Finally, the method of cross-indexing may apply to other research fields and offers opportunities for developing databases on other fields of science.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><hi rend="bold">Bibliography</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Colavizza, G., Romanello, M. and Kaplan, F. 2017. “The References of References: A Method to enrich Humanities Library Catalogs with Citation Data.” <hi rend="italic">International Journal on Digital Libraries</hi><hi rend="color(333333)">.</hi></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Colavizza, G. and Romanello, M. 2019. “Citation Mining of Humanities Journals: The Progress to Date and the Challenges Ahead”, <hi rend="italic">Journal of European Periodical Studies</hi> 4(1).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Croft W.B. 2002. “Combining Approaches to Information Retrieval”.
