                  <p>Tiresias (<a href="https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/" onclick="window.open('https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/'); return false" class="ref">https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/</a>) is a free database designed and
                     constructed as an efficient tool to access and understand ancient texts for
                     research purposes. It uniquely associates end-of-book subject indices with the
                     index locorum. Based on indices of about 460 scholarly books in fields such as
                     history, religion, biblical studies and more, Tiresias is multilingual, contains
                     about 140,000 subject tags and about 16.4 million references to ancient primary
                     sources, including non-digitized sources. It is especially helpful for
                     comparative research between areas, cultures or languages, or for scholars
                     working on long-term trends, who are therefore less familiar with sources which
                     are not in their area of specialization. The paper describes three usage
                     scenarios employing this newly available resource as an integral part of
                     historical research and study. Tiresias provides inspiration for the
                     construction of other databases making use of multiple book indices in various
                     areas of the humanities and social sciences.</p>

                     labor-intensive. Three methods frequently used to perform this task are: 1. Reading
                     large amounts of source texts and manually collating the relevant passages; 2. Reading
                     prior research (henceforth: books) on the subject, collating references from these
                     books, and locating source texts according to these references; 3. Searching by keyword
                     in full-text corpora (usually in the source language, such as Perseus, Thesaurus Linguae
                     Graecae, papyri.info, or Ma'agarim) [<a class="ref" href="#green2000">Green 2000</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#dalton2004">Dalton and Charnigo 2004</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#sinn2014">Sinn and Soares 2014</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Each of these methods has certain disadvantages. Many researchers' continued recourse
                     to methods 1 and 2 demonstrates the current limits of full-text keyword search [<a class="ref" href="#green2000">Green 2000</a>]. Further criticisms of keyword searches describe forcing historians to retrieve texts
                     in a specific way, producing biases, blind spots and false positives [<a class="ref" href="#hitchcock2013">Hitchcock 2013</a>]. “[Historians'] topics of interest are described through words but cannot be pinpointed
                     through simple keywords alone. Yet, once sources have been digitized, entering isolated
                     keywords often becomes a prerequisite for access” [<a class="ref" href="#huistra2016">Huistra and Mellink 2016</a>].</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In this paper, we describe Tiresias, a novel database created by juxtaposing back-of-book
                     indices in scholarly books. Tiresias' aims are to provide simple and efficient retrieval
                     of ancient sources by subject, and to be a tool useful for beginners, advanced students
                     and researchers in the disciplines of ancient history, epigraphy, papyrology, theology,
                     and kindred areas, as a complement to full text keyword searches. First, we shall
                     describe how the database was created and the possibilities it affords for the study
                     of ancient history. We then review some of the available databases and their limitations
                     and describe how Tiresias fills the gap of providing a digital search tool while maintaining
                     the intellectual value of book indices.</div>

                     of subject tags to ancient texts and artifacts, currently consisting of almost 140,000
                     subject tags for about 16 million references to sources. The search form allows for
                     searches of several keywords, filtering by various fields (e.g., author, work, subject,
                     keyword), and immediate full-text retrieval for efficient perusal of the relevant

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The database was constructed through the following innovative method. Many research
                     books in the fields of ancient history, classics, or biblical studies, are published
                     with two indices: one for subjects (called a subject index, index of terms, or <em class="term">index rerum</em>) and one for ancient source references (also known as an <em class="term">index locorum</em>). Through these indices, each page of the indexed book was identified as relating
                     to certain subjects as well as certain sources, indicating with a high probability
                     that these source references can be tagged as related to these subjects. This probability
                     was improved by a validation method which we describe and assess in this article.
                     Using this method, we produced a <em class="term">subject tag</em> for each source reference, i.e., a short description of a subject highly relevant
                     to the source reference. For example, the source reference “Genesis 1.3” could be tagged with the subjects “light” and “creation.” With the help of a computer program, the tags were combined to create a general database
                     of subject tags for ancient sources. The subject-source database is thus based on
                     existing expert-made back-of-book indices, unified and assisted by digital means.

                        well-defined area with many academic books, of which many have both subject and source
                        indices. The books used are mostly by leading publishers in the field (Oxford University
                        Press, Cambridge University Press, Brill and De Gruyter), all of which have a strong
                        presence in digital publishing, from the following areas: classics, biblical studies,
                        Jewish studies, patristics, and ancient history. The Ancient Near East is not included
                        for technical reasons – too few indices meeting the relevant criteria.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p8">There were two essential criteria for inclusion of books: a. the existence of both
                        an <span class="foreign i"><em class="term">index locorum</em></span> and a subject index. b. cheap, convenient, and legal access to a high-quality scan
                        of the indices. It was clearly preferable to use books for which PDFs with embedded
                        text are readily available, in order to obviate the stage of OCR of scanned text.
                        This meant that the books used were usually published after 2000, as indicated in
                        Figure 1. About 600 books were identified as meeting all these criteria and their
                        indices were downloaded via subscriptions of the Younes &amp; Soraya Nazarian Library
                        at the University of Haifa. Additional book indices are continuously entered with
                        expanded availability and continued publication of new books.</div>

                           identify subject headings and sub-headings. This was done algorithmically in Python

                                 alphabetized, a human marks on which row the first letter of the subject headings
                                 begins and this marking is used to identify main headings (beginning with this letter)
                                 and sub-headings (not beginning with this letter). Also, lines beginning with propositions
                                 (“and”, “by”, etc.) are identified as sub-headings, and additional minor corrections are applied
                                 (e.g., identifying sub-headings when they start with the same letter as the heading).

                           use highly varied conventions to refer to ancient authors, works, and references [<a class="ref" href="#romanello2018">Romanello 2018</a>]. The source indices contained more than 12 thousand unique ancient works from different
                           traditions and languages. For example, The New Testament book, First Corinthians,
                           can be written in various abbreviated forms such as “1 Cor.”, “First Corinthians”, “I Cor.”, etc. Many ancient works have several naming conventions for the title and for the
                           author. Furthermore, the chapter and verse number can also be written according to
                           different conventions, using Roman or Arabic numerals, and different types of dividers.
                           To meet this challenge, we constructed an author-title database of modern naming conventions
                           and abbreviations of ancient authors and works, which the program consults to identify
                           the references included in the indices. This database utilized and collated existing
                           free databases such as the TLG canon of Greek Authors and Works, abbreviation tables
                           from various Greek and Latin dictionaries available online, the Classical Works Knowledge
                           Base, SBL handbook, and other lists. Many additional authors and titles for Greek,
                           Latin, Coptic, Hebrew and Syriac works were added incrementally to the database as
                           more indices were processed and additional authors and titles were identified manually.
                           The script checked each line in the source index against this database to identify
                           authors and titles. When a match was made of both author and title, a work number
                           was assigned. Fuzzy matches were not used because different works can have very similar
                           titles (e.g., 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians). Lines which were not identified as
                           authors or titles were assumed to be of references and page numbers. These were distinguished
                           by manually inputting the differentiating character (usually a whitespace) between
                           them. This script generally produces good results, but with some errors as a result
                           of unrecognized authors or titles, or incorrect differentiation of reference and page
                           numbers, usually in cases of unusual references. Therefore, an expert examined the
                           outputs (in csv format) to delete or correct wrong rows. </div>

                        rows. For example, in Figure 3 the source index of a certain book tells us that the
                        1 Corinthians 10:2 is discussed on p. 90, while the subject index tells us that “baptism, Christian” is discussed on pages 90-91 (Table 1). Juxtaposing this data provides a certain probability
                        that First Corinthians 10:2 deals with, is connected with, or relates to, Christian
                        baptism. 1 Corinthians 10:2 is therefore tagged with the subject tag “baptism, Christian”. The resulting rows in the database are shown in Table 3. </div>

                        usually discuss several subjects, and source references on these pages may be connected
                        to a specific subject and not to the others. Moreover, references may be supplied
                        as examples for some side point in the discussion, having no link at all to the main
                        subject of the page. Another problem is that references are not always consistent,
                        with different editions dividing the source text in different ways. Therefore, the
                        juxtaposition of indices alone will provide a large proportion of irrelevant, or only

                        them into word tokens, removed non-significant words, and morphologically stemmed
                        the words to capture variants such as plural/singular, or different verb forms. For

                              to the subject tag, (for example, a scene from the Hebrew Bible which was later explained
                              by Christian writers as relating to baptism or a text discussing pagan rituals similar

                        moderate validation rate are: a. subject tags which are semantically similar but not
                        identical were not identified by the validation script; b. references to the same
                        text which used different conventions and are not covered by the author-title database
                        described above (Section 3.2b) and were therefore not identified as identical. The
                        validation rate can be improved by solving these problems i.e., by semantic pairing,
                        which will allow matching non-identical but synonymous subject tags, and by expanding
                        the author-title database. </div>

                              the subject tag. While this is not its main function, Tiresias becomes a gateway not
                              only to ancient sources but also to the scholarly literature (albeit only in books,
                              not articles). Though Google Books allows only partial access to the books, this is
                              currently the only way known to us for general users to directly access non-open access

                              the text is readily available in machine readable format – about 50% of the references.
                              The user can thus search for a subject and immediately read the relevant texts, without
                              the need to search for the text in other sites or offline. Full texts for Hebrew Bible
                              and rabbinic texts is kindly supplied by Sefaria; for Greek and Latin texts, by Perseus
                              Scaife; for the Quran, by Tanzil.net; for Syriac, from the Digital Syriac Corpus;
                              for Coptic, from the Coptic Scriptorium. These projects provide large amounts of texts
                              with TEI markup, which is essential for extracting the texts according to reference.
                              Full texts for epigraphy and papyri is not yet supported but is planned in the future.
                              English translations were provided for Rabbinic texts by Sefaria; for Greek and Latin
                              texts by Perseus Scaife and Bill Thayer's website Lacus Curtius; for early Christian
                              and Patristic texts, from publicly available 19th century translations.</li>

                        the subject tags in the database are connected to each other, and thus identify links
                        of which they were unaware. Each type of visualization has its advantages: networks

                        and their relative importance, while heatmaps can be used to understand changes in

                           of the graph, words from subject tags which share the most references are adjacent
                           on the network, while subjects not sharing references are far apart. The size of each
                           node is determined according to the number of incoming and outgoing links (edges),
                           so that subjects (nodes) with the most source references appear largest. Furthermore,
                           communities of closely connected subjects are determined using the Louvain method
                           for community detection and marked by color. This creates a mapping of the whole field

                           marginality of specific subjects, the relationship between subjects, and the different

                           produce heatmaps of the subjects sharing many references with a specific subject,
                           per century of the reference. This is based on the same network graph file from the

                           was written. The color shade corresponds to the number of references tagged by unique

                           that most of the studies of oaths focused on Classical Greece rather than on later
                           periods. It may also indicate that the sources speak of women swearing oaths only
                           in sources from the 5th century BCE and not earlier, or that oaths by goddesses Persephone
                           and Kore were less popular before this period. The heatmap cannot, of course, demonstrate
                           actual historical trends, but it can provide pointers, questions and intriguing phenomena

                        wildcards, filtering by author, period, genre, and other tools. Also notable is the
                        Perseus site, which is at the forefront of facilitating access to Greek and Latin

                        information on the subject of the text, and therefore do not allow for searching by
                        primary texts according to subject, or, in other words, searching through a controlled

                        user retrieval of information is best accomplished through a combination of controlled
                        vocabulary and free text searches, as these methods retrieve different types of data

                        An important function of all the online databases for articles and book chapters (e.g.,
                        JSTOR, Wiley Academic, Atla databases, <span class="foreign i">L'Annee Philologique</span>, RAMBI, Index Islamicus, etc.), as well as of library catalogues, is to help the
                        user locate secondary literature on a specific subject. There has been extensive research
                        on best practices of subject indexing in the context of such databases and catalogues
                        (see [<a class="ref" href="#yu2017">Yu and Young 2017</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#landry2011">Landry et al. 2011</a>]) as well as thought on alternative visualizations of indices and searches [<a class="ref" href="#mercun2016">Merčun 2016</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#wlodarczyk2013">Włodarczyk 2013</a>]. A central question that arises from this research is how to create comprehensive,
                        efficient and understandable subject trees, while minimally imposing the viewpoint
                        of its creator, in order to assist researchers rather than constrain them to a specific
                        taxonomy. Researchers have recommended basing subject indices on topic maps, semantic
                        webs or universal thesauri, which represent the language as a whole, rather than ad-hoc
                        subject headings [<a class="ref" href="#wlodarczyk2013">Włodarczyk 2013</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#nilbe2014">Nilbe and Tarkpea 2014</a>]. This question is even more significant in the case of a primary source index, as
                        the source texts are the objects of study and not only, as in secondary literature,
                        assisting instruments. In Tiresias, we currently use the subjects presented in the
                        indices without any attempt at constructing a subject tree or topic map as an aid
                        for subject retrieval. However, in the future we may attempt to parse the structure
                        of the subjects and sub-headings of indices themselves as an innovative method to
                        construct subject trees or ontologies of specific scholarly fields. The source indices
                        alone can also be used to build innovative co-citation networks of source and research
                        literature. See [<a class="ref" href="#blidstein2022">Blidstein and Zhitomirsky-Geffet 2022</a>] for an analysis of the different options based on the indices from the Tiresias project</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p36">A number of digital tools have been developed in the past decade for linking ancient
                        sources to secondary literature or to other ancient sources. Biblindex is an index
                        for locating quotations and allusion of biblical verses in early Christian literature,
                        created at first manually and then using dedicated software. The Proteus project developed
                        a quotation detection tool for locating quotations of classical Greek and Latin texts
                        (in original and English translation) in the Internet Archive, which includes 16 million
                        open access documents. The Tesserae project [<a class="ref" href="#scheirer2016">Scheirer et al. 2016</a>] has developed tools for comparing identical passages in two ancient texts, and even
                        for locating similar passages which are not verbatim quotes through topic modeling
                        (however, the tool does not actually identify the topics discussed, only the similarity

                        and identify fragments of ancient authors. Both publications provide important technical
                        information on the tools needed to read and mine the information in indices. Michael

                              It can therefore facilitate study of various subjects across periods, cultures and
                              languages and help in reducing barriers between historical sub-disciplines. It can
                              be especially helpful for comparative research between areas, cultures or languages,
                              or for scholars working on long-term trends, who are therefore less familiar with

                              the inherent difficulties of researching a subject in texts in various ancient languages,

                              languages such as Aramaic, Coptic, Persian, Georgian, Armenian and Arabic, but even
                              Greek and Latin works are far from fully digitized. These texts are therefore less
                              accessible to the general researcher and even to the expert, who is frequently simply
                              unaware of the contents of many texts (or even of their existence). The database helps
                              researchers recognize the relevance of these texts for their subjects and seek them

                           were developed in academia, thus forming a mental link between humanities and innovation.
                           Further, usage of Tiresias in addition to library databases will sharpen the understanding
                           regarding the difference between primary and secondary sources. The teacher would
                           be able to show younger learners that novel technology can help uncover historical
                           knowledge and that the study of history may involve interactive assignments to promote
                           curiosity and literacy, while problematizing the methods used to create such technologies
                           and their impact on our thought.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p51">Book indices are a long-time subject of extensive research as part of the broader
                        domain of information retrieval. Our contribution to this vein of research is both
                        specific and generalizable. Specifically, we constructed a novel database based on
                        book indices which aids in intellectually describing the content of ancient texts.
                        This paper explains through description and usage scenarios how this improved access
                        to ancient texts in Tiresias serves scholars and students of ancient history, helping
                        them to save considerable research time, to raise new questions and to achieve a broader
                        view of the field.  </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p52">The generalizable aspect of our work is the notion to automatically construct new
                        knowledge based on joining data from two independent indices pointing to the same
                        book page, adding a contextual level to an otherwise technical reference. One may
                        envision the applicability of the current approach to additional fields of research.
                        For example, art books containing a picture index and subject index are good candidates
                        for a similar approach, promoting a solution for another longstanding issue, the challenge
                        of assigning meaning to visual materials. The 2016 scandal surrounding Facebook's
                        removal of the Pulitzer prize winning, iconic photograph known as “napalm girl” is a vivid reminder for the critical importance of context and the poor ability of
                        algorithms to contextualize, especially when visual materials are concerned. Another
                        example could be literary, scientific or engineering books that contain a subject
                        index and an author index. By crossing subject and author indices, one might draw
                        inferences in two directions: 1) authors' areas of knowledge; 2) the prolific authors
                        writing about a certain subject.  </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p53">A practical contribution of this research concerns publishers who may find value in
                        applying Tiresias logic to their collections of books as an added-value service to
                        readers. Publishers could leverage their existing data to combine additional sources
                        such as academic journals to enrich and further validate the data.</div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p54">In summary, Tiresias offers access to ancient primary texts through the lens of humanistic
                        scholarship described in the subject indices of academic books. It is a valuable tool
                        for researchers wishing to gain fast and broad retrieval of sources combined with
                        modern interpretations of their meaning. The database provides opportunities for filtering
                        and visualization which aid the research process. In future research, we aim to further
                        augment the validity of the source-subject pairs as well as investigate aspects of
                        historical knowledge extraction. We encourage our readers to visit the Tiresias web
                        site (<a href="https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/" onclick="window.open('https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/'); return false" class="ref">https://tiresias.haifa.ac.il/</a>) and send us feedback. Finally, the method of cross-indexing may apply to other research
                        fields and offers opportunities for developing databases on other fields of science.</div>
