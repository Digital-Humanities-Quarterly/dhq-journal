                  <p>This article illuminates the ways that digital humanities labs might foster
                     experiences for graduate students that fulfill what Alexander Reid (2002)
                     postulates as the “central task” of the digital
                     humanities graduate education. We argue that while the digital humanities lab as
                     an institutional economic model does not necessarily promote a focus on graduate
                     student professionalization, it uniquely has the capacity to push back against
                     competing discourses of neoliberal vocationalism, funding and labor precarity on
                     one hand, and technological utopianism and tool fetishization on the other, to
                     train students agile, contextual, and rhetorical mindsets with which to enter
                     technologically-mediated workplaces and lives. To begin, we review the
                     discussion of digital humanities labs in the literature: digital humanities
                     institutional models, how these models are practiced, lab funding, and the
                     resultant position of labs as sites of training for graduate students. From
                     there, we offer a teaching case from the Lab’s fall 2015 “Stories from Data”
                     workshop in order to render visible a set of principles to guide
                     professionalization of graduate students in the digital humanities lab. We
                     conclude with reflections on how these principles might alter current
                     discussions of the success or failure of the Mellon Foundation and NEH ODH
                     digital humanities funding initiatives in the United States.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In <cite class="title italic">The Big Humanities: Digital Humanities/Digital
                        Laboratories</cite>, Richard J. Lane discusses a number of types of “humanistic labs, centres, projects, and products,” but
                     he maintains a striking focus on the possibilities of the digital humanities
                     (DH) lab. For Lane, the digital humanities lab provides an opportunity to bring
                     a Big Science research model to the humanities, which includes a shift to “lab-based” knowledge production [<a class="ref" href="#lane2017">Lane 2017</a>]. Everything is larger: the research teams, the data sets, the duration of
                     projects, the funding — evolution, so to speak, of what we might call a “lab ethos”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lane2017">Lane 2017</a>]. In addition, the construction of <cite class="title italic">Big Humanities</cite> as a topic area correlates closely with a shift in
                     philanthropy in higher education, which is “less concerned
                     about creating in-perpetuity funds than solving a large, intractable
                     problem”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#thorp2010">Thorp 2010</a>, 145]. DH funders such as the Mellon Foundation
                     will fund projects for impact, which is viewed as highly interdisciplinary, with
                     high levels of engagement, and market-consciousness [<a class="ref" href="#thorp2010">Thorp 2010</a>].
                     The more scientific the model and technical the discourse, the more likely STEM
                     funding may also be available [<a class="ref" href="#thornham2017">Thornham 2017</a>]. For this reason,
                     Big Humanities are in great demand, and labs compete for large-scale funding
                     through the constructive and imagineering nature of their grants. Inevitably,
                     the paradigm of funding shapes the kind of work that is done, and the tools and
                     methods that are used.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">Of course this is not the only value that institutions see in digital humanities
                     labs. By comparison, a Big Humanities lab, much like a Principal Investigator's
                     (PI's) scientific laboratory, one need only inspect the technologies in a given
                     DH lab to know what kinds of projects in which the lab is participating or able
                     to support. A large, funded project will support the tools and methods needed to
                     get the specific work of that project done. There may even be development of
                     specific packages or software. By contrast, a lab that fits the computing
                     support model will offer a broader range of technologies, tools, and personnel
                     to fit a broad range of DH interests. An example of the former can be found in
                     the humanities college-funded Digital Environmental Humanities Lab at California
                     State University-Northridge, where students under the mentorship of one
                     professor used XMIND software to visualize data related to the creation of the
                     national park system in order to expose the exclusion of people of color in this
                     narrative [<a class="ref" href="#ruiz2017">Ruiz 2017</a>]. An example of the computing support model
                     may be found in the press release issued by Bowling Green State University to
                     announce their Digital Humanities Lab: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           “The goal of the Digital Humanities
                           Lab is to encourage and support innovative, interdisciplinary
                           research projects that make creative use of technology,” said
                           Colleen Boff, associate dean for University Libraries. “We focus on supporting projects that are enhanced by
                           visualization tools, multimedia applications, and manipulating data
                           acquired through application programming interfaces
                           (API).”
                            [<a class="ref" href="#bowlinggreenstateuniversity2015">Bowling Green State University 2015</a>]
                           
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> The press release then lists the training offerings for faculty and
                     students related to the software that supports these kinds of projects. By
                     comparison, a Big Humanities lab, much like a PI’s scientific laboratory, may
                     not necessarily have tools, methods, or training offerings for a wider academic
                     audience at their institution. The DH lab, then, is fairly well-understood as a
                     mechanism for advancing individual research goals, supporting faculty
                     enrichment, striving for institutional alignment with scientific paradigms for
                     enterprise-level research, as well as a hub for postdoctoral and postgraduate
                     training — even in institutions where it is lacking.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">However, what do we see when we de-emphasize the institutional and faculty
                     aspirations so often associated with DH labs? The relationship between
                     institutional role and research activity operates amidst other dynamics of
                     research variation, and the DH lab is not uniform across it. As Mary Jo Deegan
                     notes, the literature in DH in the United States (she mentions specifically
                     Gold’s edited collections <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital
                        Humanities</cite>) tends to be more focused on theory and more focused on
                     the Modern Languages Association and North America, whereas European DH tends to
                     be more project and practice-focused [<a class="ref" href="#deegan2014">Deegan 2014</a>]. The examples
                     of DH labs offered by Claire Warwick tend to be more focused on the practices of
                     large-scale projects [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2012">Warwick 2012</a>]. Postgraduate and postdoctoral
                     students tend to be situated as participants on these projects, who learn from
                     PIs on the job.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In this article, we consider what invisible or less visible work becomes
                     illuminated when practitioners understand the DH lab as a space for prioritizing
                     graduate student needs. Graduate student perspectives may be sufficiently
                     overlooked in the debates of “what,”
                     “why,” and “who” is the digital
                     humanities, despite the importance of graduate students to most DH teams reliant
                     upon their labor. Thus, this article examines the ways that the DH lab can
                     foster unique experiences for graduate students that fulfill what Alexander Reid
                     postulates as the “central task” of DH — graduate
                     education [<a class="ref" href="#reid2012">Reid 2012</a>]. More specifically, we argue that the DH lab
                     as an institutional economic model does not necessarily promote a focus on
                     graduate student professionalization, but that it can and should have a profound
                     capacity to carve out space for deep thought in mixed-methods thinking, pushing
                     back against competing discourses of neoliberal vocationalism, funding and labor
                     precarity on one hand, and technological utopianism and tool fetishization on
                     the other. Thus, as a critical and technological space committed to practices
                     and capacities rather than a more exclusive emphasis on scholarly DH, the lab
                     can train students in agile, contextual, and rhetorical mindsets with which to
                     enter technologically-mediated workplaces and lives.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">It is difficult to discuss the DH lab in a vacuum from the forces that create,
                     shape, and reshape it over time. Here, we will review how the lab as a specific
                     form of DH institution comes into being, with specific focus on funding models
                     and projected inputs and outcomes from that funding. We will consider how the
                     practice of DH in the United States and outside of it may affect the composition
                     of labs and their graduate training. The graduate students who come to labor in
                     the lab are a visible and direct result of the synergistic forces of funding and
                     institutional shaping rather than consideration for the goals and objectives of
                     graduate education. Based on these considerations, we will take a look at how
                     various labs have approached graduate training and education as a part of that
                     institutional model. We then argue that much of that graduate training and
                     education is invisible because it is not tied to these funding models and
                     resultant lab practices.

                     with the Bowling Green example, a computing support lab model tends to support
                     general training offerings for the academic community related to “particular types of software or specialist tools”
                     provided by the lab itself [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2012">Warwick 2012</a>]. A Big Humanities lab,
                     on the other hand, might offer graduate students the opportunity to work as RAs
                     on a particular large scale sponsored research project, and be trained to
                     support that particular project. These are the two polar opposites, and there
                     can be a blending of these offerings, and other kinds of offerings as well.

                     [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2015">Nowviskie 2015</a>]. Yet this same condition raises several
                     questions regarding graduate student education: In the post-tenure university,
                     Who does and should train graduate students, and to what ends? Who are graduate
                     students to become (i.e., paid research assistants on Big Humanities projects,
                     researchers on their own projects, future faculty in disciplines,
                     “alt-ac” research professionals in higher education or
                     industry)? At an institution like Arizona State University, for example, that
                     has seen radical restructuring of its academic programs to as to create space
                     for fostering interdisciplinary work, how do future faculty become effectively
                     trained and usefully integrated into explicitly interdisciplinary spaces?
                     Finally, why might a Big Humanities-focused DH lab participate in graduate
                     student professionalization at all, if not incentivized under its funding model?
                     These questions, answered or not, do much to influence how the DH lab views its
                     mission in the university vis-à-vis its own disciplinary structure, and
                     furthermore raise additional questions about the value of promoting such work
                     and about the possibilities for the DH lab model. It is here where we begin our
                     discussion of our own graduate training experiment that sought to make the work
                     of graduate training visible in our DH lab.

                     guide professionalization of graduate students in the DH lab. The context for
                     this case study is the Nexus Lab at Arizona State University. During our time
                     employed at the Nexus Lab (as Director and Postdoctoral Fellow), it worked
                     largely within the Big Humanities model: teams sought out large-scale and
                     long-term funding; faculty partnerships for research spanned humanities and STEM
                     disciplines; and upper administration aligned the lab with other units at the
                     University invested in broad-reaching and big-impact work. However, part of the
                     mission of the lab was to operate in a Big Humanities space while at the same
                     time integrating technologies and lessons learned from that activity into
                     graduate student training.

                     spanned fifteen weeks, beginning in the second week of classes. Hosted in the
                     Lab, sessions took place from 1:00-3:00 p.m. on Friday afternoons. Attendance
                     was free and open to all university staff, students, and faculty. We did not
                     require consistent attendance in order to participate. We believe this
                     contributed to enormous initial interest, from which emerged a steady cohort of
                     staff, faculty, and students. The workshop began with seventy five participants,
                     and after steady attrition, concluded with a group of twelve who remained
                     consistent attendees and participants. Their backgrounds included rhetoric,
                     sustainability, industrial engineering, computer science, and literature.

                     with the process and tools for decision making with data. In many ways, we
                     sought to provide as much value as possible to participants by using the
                     workshop as a way of codifying into the recognizable skillset of
                     “visualization” the critical thinking, collaboration
                     skills, and mixed methods analysis that unfolds perpetually in the context of
                     interdisciplinary research. While the concept of
                     “interdisciplinarity” can seem esoteric and elusive, the
                     ideas of “visualization” and “data
                     visualization” have a more immediate appeal outside academia and
                     possess crosscutting benefits even within university research.

                     for the workshop engaged the cognitive, cultural, design, and narrative
                     dimensions of visualization: 1) understand the tendencies and capabilities of
                     users; 2) produce visualizations that help us think, not merely present
                     information; and 3) learn how to tell a story from data that considers visual
                     and non-visual narrative parts.

                     referred to the audience of visualizations as “users” rather
                     than “viewers” to foreground the idea that visuals are rarely
                     passively consumed.

                        capabilities and limitations of visualization users. In this phase of the
                        workshop, we used ineffective visualizations as negative examples. We
                        solicited students to discuss the charts with the goal of understanding the
                        relationship between the data and visual elements, identifying the story
                        produced from the data, and producing recommendations for how to improve
                        each example. For instance, we discussed the world economy voronoi plot (see
                        Figure 1) as visually impressive, but hardly navigable visually. The
                        circular shape of the chart and the irregular shapes of the cells make it
                        difficult to understand the relationship between the data and the area
                        assigned to each country. The voronoi layout also makes the countries with
                        smaller economies crowded and illegible, possibly recreating the perception
                        perhaps the visualization was hoping to remedy. Participants also raised a
                        concern about the use of red and green colors together that would pose
                        accessibility concerns for colorblind users. The group wondered what a bar
                        chart or hierarchical chart might clarify about the data, as well as
                        discussed potential questions that could mobilize a revised visualization in
                        a story: is the goal to call attention to inequity? To power dynamics? To
                        correlations among large economies?

                        limitations that humans face when apprehending visualizations. For example,
                        Johnson calls attention to the limitations of human abilities to recall
                        visual information, making it all the more important to facilitate
                        comparisons rather than recollections. Additionally, once users learn a
                        format and spatial layout, maintaining consistencies across multiple charts
                        — and multiple points in a story — can be seen as a technique for aiding
                        comprehension [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2010">Johnson 2010</a>]. Alongside these issues, we
                        discussed other sources of limitations in users, such as pre-existing
                        assumptions — understood as “bias” to some participants
                        and expanded upon as ideological, cultural, and linguistic contingencies by
                        others — and how a user’s prior conditioning can affect interpretation and

                        of a visualization as an opportunity to engage, understand, question, and
                        refine data. In this phase, participants spent time evaluating the data from
                        which visualizations were designed. This involved understanding the
                        structure of the data; namely, what constituted an object or series in the
                        data, and what dimensions of the data are available. Conversations about
                        data progressed to form questions about planning visualizations, and the
                        specific insights they mean to enable. In other words, before we can begin
                        visualizing, we have to decide the problem we are approaching.

                        what visual roles it will play are necessary considerations. But what data
                        is missing, or the conceptualization of the problem itself required critical
                        thinking and reflection on participant expertise. During one session, we
                        presented the group with data and charts about the global production and
                        circulation of food from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture’s
                        2015 survey [<a class="ref" href="#khoury2016">Khoury 2016</a>]. In this exercise, there were
                        multiple spreadsheet files, each derived from both the survey and some
                        statistical analysis of the survey data. These files by themselves included
                        historical, geographical, agricultural, and economic data; the group had to
                        decide together what kinds of visual problem solving were allowed or
                        silenced by the state of the data.

                        the end of the day’s session, the group did not ever reach the point of
                        sketching out or brainstorming possible visuals. Instead, they conducted a
                        lively discussion about the representative limitations of the data in its
                        current state (see Figure 2). A sustainability view challenged the
                        explanatory value of any visualizations that selectively presented
                        countries, while rhetorical considerations advised against presenting all
                        countries at once in a display that looked impressive but communicated
                        little. Additionally, some were reluctant to show spatial relationships
                        without also showing those relationships unfold over time. At stake in each
                        of these threads in the conversation is how to make a series of
                        representations (first data, then any visualization of that data) relevant

                        to consider the cultural biases and prior assumptions of visualization
                        users. Each participant, as part of a final project, was responsible for
                        presenting a data visualization of their making that was part of a broader
                        narrative. The narrative would tell a story about a problem, relate that
                        problem to an audience, and punctuate that story with a visualization that
                        helped its users reason through data relevant to both the problem and the
                        story about the problem. For instance, in working through the global
                        agriculture data from earlier in the semester, one student produced a Sankey
                        diagram (see Figure 3) that diagrammed the total breakdown of global produce
                        by calorie type. In this story, understanding the contours of global
                        nutrition was the problem, and the student chose a small subset of the data
                        with only a handful of dimensions (by crop: total calories, carbohydrate
                        calories, protein calories, and fat calories). From the much larger dataset
                        about global calories and flows among countries and regions, the student was
                        able to tell a straightforward story about the kinds of plant-based calories
                        available globally. The final idea that non-carbohydrate calories are
                        scarcer is clear from the framing of the narrative, the selection of the
                        data, and the visual presentation of the data.

                        much as Mary Louise Pratt described as “social spaces
                        where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in

                        and STEM in the same learning environment forces students to confront not
                        only the epistemological differences between the disciplines, but the way
                        the student’s own discipline circulates and is taken up (or not) across the
                        humanities-STEM divide, a divide fraught with competing value systems and
                        cultures. The students can see how they are heard across difference in the
                        academy, and be able to make better sense of their place in the wider world
                        outside of it with the training they have received in their discipline.

                        difference — mixing methods or juxtaposing competing ideas within the same

                        disciplines can fall apart. As Bendix et al. notes, “Thrown into strange company without preparation, ongoing guidance, or
                        long-term professional incentives, researchers fall back onto
                        disciplinary habits and raise disciplinary defenses”

                              suggest. I suppose that one would no longer become a specialist in
                              American literature, a “Shakespeare man,” or a
                              “compositionist.” Rather, people’s areas of
                              focus would be determined by the kinds of rhetorical problems in
                              which they were interested.

                        graduate students, but instead, that the DH lab has great potential to
                        enable the kind of work that Bizzell describes should order the focus of
                        graduate study. In fact, the DH lab model for extracurricular
                        cross-disciplinary inquiry has two benefits that altering the curriculum
                        does not. First, it alleviates the concern posed earlier about training
                        academics with a disciplinary identity. Here, we show that
                        cross-disciplinary work in the contact zone of the lab accentuates a
                        graduate student’s understanding of their discipline and how it travels.
                        Further, organizing a workshop like Stories from Data with the
                        “rhetorical problem” of how data is visualized and
                        used also fulfills the kind of large-scale problem solving that funders of
                        the labs themselves seek out. In this way, the DH lab alleviates concerns of
                        those anxious about interdisciplinarity while also doing exactly what
                        funders hope the DH will do.

                        the dataset, it revealed that it is much more complicated to collaborate

                        gained a greater intercultural proficiency around the context of use of the
                        tool, a proficiency that will serve graduate students in all disciplines

                        other disciplinary orientations towards technology. When humanities students
                        critiqued the racial or gendered characteristics of a data visualization,
                        students in STEM — not frequently exposed to cultural concerns — took
                        notice. The reverse also took place, where students in STEM readily noticed
                        that humanities students would be much more recalcitrant when it was time to
                        build, instead reading or talking through the hands on components of the
                        exercises. On the other hand, STEM students were much quicker to build
                        first, question later (or never), which humanities students also found
                        difficult to understand. However, over time, it helped each set to see how
                        certain practices and activities made certain disciplines more comfortable,

                        (meaning, the workshop was not geared toward either), we aimed to create a
                        workshop that was a space for graduate students to explore the material
                        conditions of their education and employment. Inevitably — and likely
                        because no one in the room was in a position of power over anyone else, as
                        the workshop was not-for-credit and lab professionals were not affiliated
                        with the disciplines or the tenure stream in the university — discussions
                        became as much about labor in and out of the academy as well as the tools
                        and methods for performing that labor.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p30">Why do graduate students come to the DH lab? When graduate students arrived
                        in our lab, they voiced concerns. Worried about the academic job market,
                        about the kinds of work in industry they feel they may or may not be
                        prepared to do, and about the kinds of menial work they already had, as RAs
                        or as staff at the university. We are not alone, as Nowviskie writes about
                        The Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia: 
                        <blockquote>
                           <p>
                              In the Scholars’ Lab, we work for the betterment of
                              the individual graduate students who come our way — conscious that
                              they are laboring within larger systems that are broken and that can
                              wound them. We want to broaden then their options and help them
                              build the technical and conceptual skills that will enable their
                              active engagement with the humanities well into its digital future.
                              We hope to render them more capable of constructing new systems and
                              of resisting inappropriate ones, from wherever they may
                              land.
                               [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2015">Nowviskie 2015</a>, 126]
                              
                           </p>
                        </blockquote> In this way, we agree with Nowviskie that
                        “inappropriate” systems exist not just in the
                        academy, but in industry and public life as well, and it is the work of
                        professionalizing graduate students to be able to recognize inequities and
                        injustices in their workplaces and in civic life, particularly as they
                        surround the making, circulation, and use of digital technologies.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">In the last several years, several essays have been written about the state of
                     the DH initiative in the United States and its successes and challenges. In
                     2011, Alan Liu issued a report and a critique of DH. He asked, “Are the digital humanities ready to live up to their
                     responsibility to represent the humanities and higher education as the
                     latter negotiates a new relation to postindustrial society?”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 11]. Liu’s critique stemmed from what he saw as a
                     divide between those who came out of humanities computing, who “lacks almost all cultural-critical awareness” and those
                     working from new media studies, who are “indiscriminately
                     critical of society and global informational ‘empire’ without
                     sufficient focus on the specifically institutional — in this case, higher
                     education — issues at stake”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 11]. Many other critiques of the Mellon
                     Foundation-funded American DH initiative have been raised in recent academic
                     trade publications, such as Brennan’s recent polemic “The
                     Digital Humanities Bust” in <cite class="title italic">The Chronicle of
                        Higher Education</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#brennan2017">Brennan 2017</a>]. These critiques range from upbraiding a system
                     that would fund particular types of scholarship perceived as lacking the rigor
                     of more conventional forms of critique, to the questioning of the value of
                     methods in DH for textual analysis [<a class="ref" href="#brennan2017">Brennan 2017</a>].
                  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">The workshop model and its set of principles for professionalization offer an
                     opportunity to visualize a DH that does a different kind of work than what is
                     often targeted in these criticisms. Much of the unrest and debate mentioned
                     above focuses almost exclusively on past or current PI-driven, sponsored
                     research projects in DH. What a workshop like Stories from Data makes visible is
                     how DH might inform a digital future populated with professionals who do
                     different kinds of work, in the academy, in industry, and in public life. The
                     graduate students we trained experienced a curriculum that was skill-oriented,
                     but anchored in a commitment to critical thinking and articulating their own
                     expertise to the skills at hand. As graduate students assessing their
                     professional trajectories and employment prospects, they experienced and
                     interrogated the political, economic, and cultural realities of working with
                     digital technologies, inside and outside of the humanities. They recognize the
                     changing face of the neoliberalized university as well as industry hiring
                     practices that largely reward experience with up-to-date technology tools devoid
                     of the context of use. And, by working as a place for student development, the
                     DH lab had given them opportunities to prepare for both.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Indeed, a key value of this kind of training is that it connects <em class="emph">ways of
                        thinking</em> in addition to instilling a <em class="emph">specific skill set.</em>
                     The Stories from Data curriculum has since been taken up in multiple venues on
                     our campus across disciplines and participant groups. It formed the foundations
                     of a subsequent workshop, “Decision Design for
                     Sustainability Approaches,” produced in concert with the School of
                     Sustainability at Arizona State University. Additionally, the materials and
                     lessons from the workshop continue to inform and be refined by
                     interdisciplinary, data-driven research and leadership training among humanities
                     doctoral students, STEM students, active-duty military, and student-veterans at
                     the Library’s Unit for Data Science (co-author Simeone serves as current

                     can render visible to the public how the academy contributes to knowledge
                     production vis-à-vis technology. This is not a new argument; in fact, many
                     digital humanists on large-scale projects echo this call to improve the public’s
                     understanding of and engagement in DH projects. [<a class="ref" href="#oh2013">Oh 2013</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2013">Flanders 2013</a>]. Further, on the week of the submission of this
                     article, data scientist and author Cathy O’Neil wrote an op-ed for <cite class="title italic">The New York Times</cite> titled “The
                     Ivory Tower Can’t Keep Ignoring Tech.” In this piece, she argues
                     “We need academia to step up to fill in the gaps in our
                     collective understanding about the new role of technology in shaping our
                     lives...It’s absolutely within the abilities of academic research to study
                     such examples and to push against the most obvious statistical, ethical or
                     constitutional failures and dedicate serious intellectual energy to finding
                     solutions”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#oneil2017">O'Neil 2017</a>]. While controversial in several respects (including
                     her description of how data science is taught in higher education), O’Neil
                     points to exactly the issue Stories from Data is designed to combat — our
                     graduate students can identify and translate their role in exactly this work to
                     multiple stakeholders after they leave the lab, and in a way that communicates
                     their value as problem solvers in the issues of concern that O’Neil outlines
                     here. In the case of the lab, then, the impact on the issues of “math
                     destruction” and data and society is not measured in what is
                     formally studied and published by faculty with the help of graduate students,
                     but the subsequent conduct of participants in the world outside of academia or a
                     home department. This helps DH labs to envision the training of graduate
                     students toward careers in their own right, driven by their convictions and
                     talents rather than labs focusing on what faculty teach or research [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2016">Anderson 2016</a>]. As a way of engendering reflective technological
                     practice, the workshop space is designed to avoid replication of any model,
                     either industry-based or academic. No graduate student in Stories from Data is
                     pursuing a PhD in data science. Their work with data — and extracting knowledge
                     from data — is meant to enrich their understanding of storytelling and reasoning
                     with data. Crucially, that understanding includes critique, production, and
                     translation. While we hope that scholars based in universities continue to shed
                     light into the need for more deliberation and oversight when it comes to the
                     power that big data, artificial intelligence, and algorithms hold over the lives
                     of individuals. But it has been our mission that the graduate students we train
                     in the lab — who eventually become professionals and citizens in any number of
                     spaces — meaningfully intervene in those same systems as they continue to
                     challenge our ethics, values, and possible futures.
