                  <p>Named entity recognition is an advantageous technique with an increasing presence
                     in
                     digital humanities. In theory, automatic detection and recovery of named entities
                     can provide new ways 
                     of looking up unedited information in edited sources and can allow the parsing of
                     a massive amount of 
                     data in a short time for supporting historical hypotheses. In this paper, we detail
                     the implementation
                     of a model for automatic named entity recognition in medieval Latin sources and we
                     test its robustness
                     on different datasets. Different models were trained on a vast dataset of Burgundian
                     diplomatic charters
                     from the 9th to 14th centuries and validated by using general and century <em class="term">ad hoc</em> models tested on short
                     sets of Parisian, English, Italian and Spanish charters. We present the results of
                     cross-validation in each
                     case and we discuss the implications of these results for the history of medieval
                     place-names and personal names.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In this paper, we introduce a new model for the automatic recognition of named
                     entities in medieval Latin charters. The named entity concept involves all physical
                     and real objects which can be designated with a specific name. A named entity
                     recognition (NER) model detects entities in the text and classifies them (e.g., a
                     person's name, a location name, an organization's name, a date). It becomes
                     possible, then, to index the resulting information units and to extract
                     relationships between them. In that sense, automatic NER systems can help to improve
                     current information systems by building a knowledge base of all the spatial, social
                     and personal entities in a set of documents; this enables a searchable and quotable
                     corpus matrix using actors and places as dynamic keywords which help to provide
                     meaningful answers to questions asked on a large textual database.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">In recent years, some projects have entailed the production of structured data
                     through manual tagging of named entities in thousand-item historical corpora. This
                     manual operation takes years for an entire team and can obviously not be scaled up
                     to the almost 500,000 (and increasing) medieval digitized documents. This lengthy
                     process can be completed only with massive acceleration through a computational
                     operation of converting automatically thousands of documents in raw data format into
                     structured data in a short time. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In the present project we use one of these hand-annotated corpora as our dataset:
                     the
                     CBMA (<cite class="title italic">Corpus Burgundiae Medii Aevi</cite>), which contains a
                     collection of medieval charters and cartularies produced in Burgundy. From the 11th
                     century on, many ecclesiastical institutions started
                     to compose cartularies in which they transcribed their own documents, especially
                     titles relating to their property and their land rights, in order to better preserve
                     written deeds and keep legal proof of ecclesiastical possessions and social
                     relationships. Today, these registers stand as one of the major sources for medieval
                     studies. Among the texts collected in the CBMA we isolated a set of 5300-items (1,2
                     million words), which correspond mostly to cartularies from Cluny. This large
                     sub-set contains mainly donations, exchanges and sales, that is, written records
                     dealing with the transfer of lands, goods and rights between ecclesiastical
                     institutions and between private and public actors. While these documents are
                     relatively formulaic, with only limited vocabulary and a relatively small number of
                     turns of phrase, their geographical provenance is as diverse (more than one hundred
                     different places) as the chronological scope of their production is wide (from the
                     early 10th century to the middle of the 13th century). Moreover, they include many
                     different kinds
                     of documents: charters, notices, bulls, diplomas, letters, lawsuits, etc.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">As we will show, developing a model able to achieve entity recognition for this
                     corpus presents several challenges. The need to choose a single corpus for stability
                     and coherence can affect the ability of the model to be generalized to a wide range
                     of documents, because it reduces the variety of samples and can hide more specific
                     phenomena. Constructing a robust model requires finding a technical and intellectual
                     compromise between collecting sufficiently varied data and avoiding extreme training
                     on some similar structures [<a class="ref" href="#plank2016">Plank 2016</a>]. This issue becomes even more complicated if
                     we consider the particular characteristics of our main corpora: on the one hand,
                     diplomatic charters combine formulaic structure and variable lists of named entities
                     [<a class="ref" href="#zimmermann2003">Zimmermann 2003</a>], which can be an advantage regarding iteration in training. But it
                     also means fitting problems of recognition over other corpora, because there are
                     many formulaic traditions, different models in according to juridical actions and
                     regional redactional dependencies. On the other hand, because Latin is a
                     low-resource language in natural language processing, the work must be conducted
                     using tools and vocabularies not initially developed for Latin or developed for
                     classical Latin literature [<a class="ref" href="#eger2015">Eger et al. 2015</a>]; not to mention the technical
                     adaptations required for the specificities of medieval Latin due to several
                     linguistics alterations. Above all, less technical but more extended, pre-processing
                     must be completed, such as the normalization of textual spelling, the manual
                     validation of much inflected language arbitrariness, and the listing of difficulties
                     due to overlapping and to textual ambiguities. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The construction of a proper validation environment, proving the robustness of our
                     model, has led us to build several corpora and sub-corpora variations and to
                     annotate manually other smaller corpora. We finally developed a validation protocol
                     with an extensive set of evaluations in order to show that our model can be applied
                     to a wide range of unannotated charters with different typologies and belonging to
                     different scriptural traditions and regional origins.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">This paper describes, first, the historical nature of our corpus and the features
                     of
                     our gold-standard corpus. It explains the method adopted in generating the model
                     with a machine-learning approach based on conditional random fields (CRF). We detail
                     the construction of the model and sub-models, as well as the results obtained by the
                     application of our general model and by the different experiments using
                     cross-validation. In the discussion, we try to develop a broader argument for
                     results by referring to current onomastic studies, historical and scriptural usages,
                     and language variations, thus offering a contextualized explanation that can help
                     to
                     clarify, from a non-technical and humanistic perspective, matches and errors
                     obtained in the application of the model. The constitutive models of this project

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Named entity recognition (NER) is one of the most promising technical tools in the
                     digital humanities field. Some classical digital humanities projects have been
                     conducted with NER, thereby opening new ways to explore and query large databases.
                     Actively used in the medical, biological and journalistic domains [<a class="ref" href="#abacha2011">Abacha et al. 2011</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#eltyeb2014">Eltyeb et al. 2014</a>], named entities prove to be meaningful pieces of
                     information intimately connected to the main issues addressed by humanistic studies.
                     NER techniques are an excellent way to provide an overview of a corpus. On the one
                     hand, they help to classify data into pre-defined categories, which is primordial
                     to
                     indexing and describing data and eventually to building structured databases. On the
                     other hand, they can activate data exploration at different scope levels. For
                     example, NER techniques can be used to identify core concepts and cluster them into
                     vocabularies, ontologies, and actor's attributes on documentary series They are also
                     indispensable in the pre-treatment of texts since they provide pieces of information
                     that do not appear in the language dictionaries. Alternatively, at a corpora level,
                     NER techniques can serve to build thick social, spatial and semantic relationship
                     networks using named entities as nodes. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">NER work in the digital humanities community consists of two subtasks: (i) detection
                     and classification of named entities in classical and modern language texts and (ii)
                     entity linking towards already existing knowledge databases. Concerning the first
                     task, experiments have proven that supervised approaches are more suitable for
                     large-scale databases than rule-based or unsupervised ones [<a class="ref" href="#nadeau2007">Nadeau et al. 2007</a>]. In
                     these supervised methods, especially statistics-sequential methods, algorithms use
                     labelled data and meta-information obtained by different types of syntactical
                     analysis, such as POS tagging, parsing, chunking, from word-based to sentence-based
                     levels. The system then builds a statistical model based on these labelled data and
                     suggests the best labels for a new, unlabelled sequence of words. Some digital
                     humanities projects in recent years [<a class="ref" href="#curran2003">Curran et al. 2003</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#won2018">Won et al. 2018</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#rayson2017">Rayson et al. 2017</a>]
                     produce supervised models exceeding 80% on the F-measure (harmonic mean
                     of precision and recall).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Nevertheless, because of the lack of annotated data, rule-based or dictionary-based
                     models are still very popular, despite the fact that they generally achieve a low
                     recall ratio (for the former) or a low precision ratio (for the latter). Training
                     a
                     dictionary-based recognition model against a list of names can lead to a high ratio
                     of recognition for a particular corpus, but the model is often not robust when
                     applied to unseen texts or different types of data. On the other hand, rule-based
                     models trained using rule definitions and descriptions to categorize entities show
                     a
                     valid global recall, but a slight tendency to poor precision-ratio on unseen texts.
                     In spite of that, these methods have proven very useful for rapid textual annotation

                     protocol – where the writers of acts can express ideological motivations of actions
                     by using quotation of authority texts, the acts do not include personal or narrative
                     details. That gives the impression that we are facing a repetitive and modularly
                     constructed source. This <em class="emph">dryness</em> is a
                     necessity in documents that aim to become proofs of rights. The formulary pattern
                     shapes the notarial written expression, and it is the named entity that specifies
                     and individualizes the document. As we can notice in the above example, conventional
                     structures also include hierarchical and referential elements and provide support
                     for a dynamic use of named entities in each part of the charter. Indeed, the
                     recovery of one named entity can involve the recovery of one piece of a complex
                     regional landscape, the name of one tenant of a shared property, one node of a
                     familiar or communal network, or one named participant in a long series of
                     ecclesiastical transactions. Put together, these pieces can help to rebuild
                     topographical indices and villas layouts, to propose social, juridical and economic
                     frameworks established around land possession, or to describe a more detailed image
                     of economic life in abbeys. From this, we can easily imagine the power of detection
                     and recovery of named entities to quickly and extensively examine large databases

                     13th century. This is a process very well described by recent studies [<a class="ref" href="#bourin1996">Bourin 1996</a>]. 
                     Roughly speaking, the single

                     was replaced around the late 10th century by a new
                     tradition using the bi-name with two or more components (usually fathers’ names and
                     locatives), and this new tradition was consolidated throughout the 11th and 12th centuries.
                     From
                     the mid-12th century on, this formulaic denomination
                     adopted more complex modes using periphrasis, familiar references, professions,
                     regional origin, even surnames, to form personal names with three to six components.

                     testifying to a property donation to the church takes place within the alms-giving
                     doctrine [<a class="ref" href="#magnani2002">Magnani 2002</a>]. Because cartularies gather together ecclesiastical property
                     documents, a substantial part of our corpora follows this model. With the donation,
                     the donor gives a property to a saint, who acts as an intermediary, and not directly
                     to the church, and this property becomes part of lands under a saint’s <em class="term"><span class="foreign i">dominium</span></em>, which is managed by a monastery or an abbey acting
                     as a juridical person. In this panorama, charters contain extensive lists of named
                     entities mixing personal, geographical and institutional functions under one name
                     (ex. <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">rebus Sancti Vincentii Matiscensis, terra de Sancta Maria de

                     more classes, and that is not always possible. If we take into account only the
                     largest entity (in these cases, a personal name), we could lose thousands of

                     which almost entirely concern ecclesiastical
                     patrimony, are very close to the formulary; personal changes and adaptations are

                     the redaction of charters [Bange 1984]. The broad nature of these changes in Western

                           necessary to obtain good results. With our 5300-document corpus, we experimented
                           with different sizes of training corpus: 4000, 2500, 1500, 1000 and 500

                           application of the model to a wider temporal range. For this reason, we built
                           century models, that is, learning models using only documents from the same
                           century. The accuracy of this experiment may be questioned because, in many
                           cases, the date of a document’s creation is not certain, and the document is
                           dated, then, using a time interval. This problem was corrected by building
                           sub-corpora, considering a charter inside two corpora if its estimated date was
                           near a transition period. For example, a charter dated around 980-1020 was
                           considered to be in both the 10th- and 11th-century
                           models. Thus, we obtained a biased result in contiguous model comparison due to
                           the portion of shared charters, but, in compensation, we obtained sub-corpora
                           that were more representative of each century, since changes of style or
                           scriptural practices do not follow rigid chronological divisions. The

                     corpus to our sub-corpora, we expected to assure a chronological variety of smaller
                     corpora and to avoid the loss of scriptural varieties. For that reason, documents
                     were chosen in the decades that were the least represented in the original corpus.
                     This supplementary corpus was also divided by centuries and each part was added as
                     an auxiliary group to the century corpora.</div>

                     from the same corpus. The robustness of these models had to be compared using
                     non-Burgundian charters. To accomplish this task, four new small-sized corpora were
                     annotated by hand. These documents were extracted from Parisian, English, Lombard
                     and Castilian charters from four regions with an intense charter production
                     displaying different scriptural models. They are part of four of the most complete

                     we
                     did a manual validation of doubtful items in the training data, mostly for detecting
                     nested, overlapping entities and ill-formed annotations. For example, the
                     description of territorial boundaries with abuse of possessive genitive (or
                     nominative) forms leads to overlapping entities, but also to entities with unclear
                     boundaries, and is due to a much freer order in the phrase and use of declensions
                     than in classical Latin (see examples in Table 5). Overlapping entities are usually
                     connected to names serving different functions, frequently saints’ names. They can
                     refer to a personal name or the name of an abbey, a piece of land, a feudal
                     territory, or even a festivity date. On the other hand, the texts from philological
                     and diplomatic editions can contain paratextual data such as special characters,
                     glosses, titles, etc., that can introduce noise into the model. A process of
                     normalization in textual spelling is completed through scripts. This normalization
                     decreases error rate and makes the transformation of the original format corpus
                     easier.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p53">We then split the main corpus into three sets necessary for the creation of the
                     model, i.e., training set, development set, and test set. We randomly selected a
                     training corpus of 4,000 documents (<span class="monospace">&gt;</span>one million words), a test corpus of 1,000
                     documents, a development corpus of 300 documents forming the development set, used
                     to avoid overfitting, i.e. a model that is too close to the test set and thus not
                     robust to new data. To ensure the chronological presence of documents in each
                     sub-corpus, we also tested semi-random distribution by creating clusters of
                     documents every 25 years, but this approach did not show significant differences in
                     the results. That is why we preferred the random method in order to maintain the
                     original distribution of data. The temporal distribution of the three datasets turns
                     out to be very similar to the distribution of the entire corpus.</div>

                     use the well-known BIO format to represent the data. In this format, each token (in
                     our case, each word) is assigned to a BIO class: B-entity, I-entity, and O-entity,
                     respectively, representing the beginning (B), continuation (I as “inside”), or
                     absence (O as “outside”) of named entities (See Table 2). We then apply Conditional
                     Random Fields [<a class="ref" href="#lafferty2001">Lafferty et al. 2001</a>], one of the most popular methods for this
                     category of problems. To apply this supervised machine-learning approach, each word
                     in a sentence must be regarded as a token. The entire corpus was converted into a
                     tabular format, providing lexical, syntactical, and morphological information at a
                     token-level. Each word was represented by the following:</div>

                     cross-validation experiments on century models. For each one of the four considered
                     centuries (from the 10th to the
                     13th centuries), we applied a model
                     trained on one century to another century set. Cross-results did not show a
                     considerable heterogeneity, and the results are very close to those obtained with
                     big-sized models. The main differences are detected while evaluating datasets and
                     models formed on the basis of charters from the 10th and 13th centuries. Here there
                     are three highlights: first, the 10th-century model
                     constructed from the largest dataset gives us the worst results when applied to the
                     other charters, especially to the 12th- and 13th-century datasets; second, the application
                     of the
                     10th-, 11th-, and 12th-century models to the 13th-century dataset offers the lowest
                     compared performance; third, the
                     worst individual performance is obtained by crossing the 10th-century model with the
                     dataset of the 13th-century charters.</div>

                     maintaining a regular detection of naming phenomena that produces results similar
                     to
                     those of single-century models; (ii) in consequence, detection problems are
                     concentrated at a feature-level in irregular denominations and in severe changes in
                     the name's composition (or in its textual disposition) that have taken place in the

                     the general CBMA datasets (two models with different sizes) and the four,
                     single-century sub-corpora trained from the same dataset. The six results obtained
                     show great proximity among them. General models provide better coverage, normally
                     around 3%-5% superior to the century models, and again, we can see that the model
                     trained on 1,500 charters shows a small decrease in performance (1-2 points)
                     compared to the full model. The use of a smaller set of annotated documents could
                     be

                     recognition reaches results between 85% and 82%, and exact-match recognition is
                     between 81% and 73%. Analysing only the numerical results from single-century
                     models, we noticed many similarities to the results obtained in previous century
                     model evaluations: (i) the best performance models are the central models from the
                     11th and 12th centuries; (ii) boundary models (from the 10th and 13th centuries) are
                     less adequate for
                     recognition, especially of compound entities; and (iii) the model from the 10th
                     century, trained with the largest number of documents, offers the lowest efficiency
                     on foreign corpora recognition. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p70">We also noticed a correlation between single-century models and regional corpora.
                     For
                     example, the Parisian corpus, composed mostly of later medieval charters, offered
                     slightly higher numbers when evaluated with the 12th-
                     and 13th-century models; the Lombard corpus,
                     concentrated in the 11th and 12th centuries without any 13th-century
                     charters, showed lower performance when evaluated by 13th century model, while the
                     English and Hispanic corpora, with the most
                     balanced chronology (the Hispanic corpus is not really an organic corpus), presented
                     greater distance between partial and exact matches when evaluated with all four of
                     the century models. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p71">To summarize, the similar results obtained from the six models help to reinforce the
                     hypothesis about the results of century model evaluations: (i) there are long series
                     of features in documents that resist changes in the chronology, size and origin of
                     the charters, features that are better treated by an iterative model based on the
                     formulary and on established scriptural traditions, assuring thereby an initially
                     acceptable ratio of recognition; (ii) there are more discrete sets of features,
                     added to previously mentioned ones, determined by local specificities, document
                     changes and highly specific phenomena, which become the primary source of errors.
                     In
                     addition to these, the set of particularities from the four external corpora were
                     treated without a considerable decrease in the general performance, suggesting that
                     there are global similarities in the composition of the name that are much stronger
                     than differences suggested by each regional tradition.</div>

                     detection are almost the same as the classification of the entity. In the case of
                     complex entities (two or more components), complete classification is less efficient
                     than detection by around 5-10 points (the difference between partial and exact

                  <div class="ptext" id="p75">(1) As we mentioned above (section 3.1), the most widely diffused type of complex
                     name is formed by the association of two or three single entities. In fact, around
                     86% of the compound personal names in the CBMA corpus have between two and three
                     parts. This denomination format is generally composed of
                     <em class="emph">name + de + toponym</em> (ex. <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">Bertrannus de Verziaco</span></em>). But in other cases, this double name
                     format can be produced though declension, syntagmatic or periphrastic denominations,
                     or even adding a second component using a genitive or nominative. There is a
                     juxtaposition of two single names in the <em class="emph">name + name</em> (or <em class="emph">noun</em>) or <em class="emph">name + nexus + name</em>
                     (or <em class="emph">noun</em>) formats (ex. <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">Rudericus Didaci, Bellonus Mangacii, Gariardus de loco

                     form part of a personal name. The <em class="emph">name + de + toponym</em> format
                     enjoyed great success until the 13th century. In this format, we generally consider
                     the last name as a location indicator (usually a micro-toponym or hagio-toponym),
                     which means that well-performed boundary detection for a double name involves full
                     geographical entity detection (that is a B-PERS + <em class="emph">de</em> + B-LOC

                     extensive and precise vocabulary of co-occurring words. This is a necessity in legal
                     texts about properties where donors must be clearly identified, properties must be
                     well-described, and signatures and signs of validations must be included. Lands and
                     people are identified by using terms and titles of presentation expressed in a
                     common vocabulary that responds to a spatial and social reality, but also to the

                     the most widely diffused name format in medieval times since the 11th century: the
                     double name in all its variations. We can also confirm a model able, on the other
                     hand, to recognize the non-complex entities associated with a large, social, and
                     professional vocabulary. (See Table 4.)</div>

                     to lemma and termination (or declension), capital letters and grammar features is
                     usually enough for the model to accomplish named entity recognition on compound

                  <div class="ptext" id="p81">Taking that into account, the most frequent errors in recognition must necessarily
                     be
                     linked to long, complex denominations and specific phenomena such as grammatical
                     forms in the Latin phrases or to changes in underlying textual structures. In Table
                     5, we can see displayed some examples of frequent errors made by the system. For
                     example, in Lombard texts the prevalence of periphrastic denominations produces a
                     lower ratio for the recovery of inside parts of named entities because of the high
                     frequency of non-entity words between names (see examples 1 and 2). In 11th- and 12th-century
                     charters, the increasing use of the genitive in naming entities produces a large
                     group of entities without particles. In addition, the coexistence in medieval Latin
                     of the inflectional rules of classical Latin, the expansion in the use of
                     prepositions, and the gradual extinction of Latin cases can all lead the model to
                     some confusions (see example 4). </div>

                     named entity recognition: grammatical categories, lemma, case, entity categorization
                     and n-gram observations. A model based on a probabilistic CRF-approach that extracts
                     correlations dependencies between this information and observations leads us to high
                     performance in the process of categorizing entities. High percentages in the
                     results, after having tested the model on corpora of different geographical origins
                     and different periods, demonstrate that the linguistic and statistical algorithmic
                     approach has proven to be robust. In fact, the results are quite conclusive, but the
                     evaluation process involves an important level of heterogeneity needing an
                     explanation that exceeds the most technical level and requires the use of humanistic
                     knowledge. We need to answer why a model created from a regional corpus can obtain
                     a

                     variations can provide a more meaningful explanatory context, enriching the evidence
                     obtained by machine-learning methods. Reviewing the literature about historical
                     names is a good first step. Anthroponymic studies suggest a double movement in
                     Western Europe after the 10th century: first, a
                     reduction of name stock and consequently a reduction of the variety of common names;
                     and second, an extension of double names in variable forms: <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">nomen
                           paternum</span></em> (name + name of father), locatives (name + place-name) and
                     nicknames (name + profession, qualities or titles). In fact, the nature of the
                     second element in bi-names distinguishes several naming traditions in Europe. In
                     France, the meridional tradition incorporated the <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">nomen
                           paternum</span></em> quickly, that is, the hereditary second name coming from the
                     father, but central and northern regions (like Burgundy and Île-de-France) developed
                     a preference for locatives and periphrastic forms [<a class="ref" href="#bourin1996">Bourin 1996</a>]. </div>

                     and nominal entities. The first are used to describe or to locate a property,
                     whereas the second appear as a locative complement of a compound name. Indeed, a
                     large proportion of geographical entities is linked to the rise of double names
                     between the 11th and 13th
                     centuries, when the locative complement became a form of familial or personal social
                     distinction. The expansion and precise definition in Europe of the <em class="emph">name + locative</em> combination through use of the <em class="emph">de</em>
                     particle (genitive or nominative without preposition) produced a very strong
                     increase in binomial name entities combining personal and geographical components.
                     This is a process that quickly produces great variety by proposing the origin,
                     residence, feudal, or ethnic place as locative complement (v.g. <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">Iohannes Allemanus</span></em>) 
                     completing the information about an individual person.
                     In fact, all these locatives are generally real places, but they are usually defined
                     as hagio-toponyms, old toponyms, and micro-toponyms hardly connected with real

                     words or co-occurrences are closely related in charters (see Table 5) because
                     cartularies produce, by classifying records geographically and transcribing them in

                     one century before it does in Central France. Both regions form bi-names with two
                     nominal components, and the incorporation of locatives entails triple or quadruple
                     names (v.g. <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">Guilielmi de Sancto Satiro</span></em>, <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">Martinus Garciez de Stallaia</span></em>). 
                     In Lombardy, the formation of complex names
                     never takes root, but the addition of periphrastic composition (through <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">dicitur, nominatur, filius, de loco</span></em>, etc.) 
                     creates some long
                     entities impossible to dissolve. Almost the same thing happens in central French
                     regions where representative quantities in triple names are not present before the
                     13th century. But the use of locatives and
                     periphrastic forms since the 11th century contributes to
                     the apparition of complex entities of up to five elements (v.g. <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">Adalbertus de vico Camonaco filii Iohanni</span></em>).</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p93">93</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p93">Nonetheless, the most complex entity format is related to overlapped and nested
                     entities (see Section 4.2). Personal entities, acting as possessive genitive or
                     nominative, can be found fulfilling the function of a geographical entity in the
                     land and boundary land descriptions in donations, purchases, inheritances, or legal
                     disputes (v.g <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">a mane terra Bertrannus; sub domi ipsius
                           Ansaldi</span></em>). Furthermore, since the 10th century,
                     saints and ecclesiastical institutions were currently present in the <em class="term"><span class="foreign i">formulae</span></em> of the
                     <em class="emph"><span class="foreign i">donationes pro anima</span></em>, where they
                     performed the function of intermediate receptors and defenders of properties. Their
                     presence in charters contributes to creating complex entities with four or more
                     elements taking, associating, or superimposing a saint’s name, an institutional
                     name, and a geographical name.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p94">In part, this complexity is, even more, a result of medieval variants of the Latin
                     language. The gradual expansion of use of the genitive since the 11th century
                     created large groups of entities without intermediate particles; at the same time,
                     there was an increase in prepositions and the extinction of many Latin case endings,
                     all of which lead the model, in many instances, to recognize the words of
                     non-entities as named entities. Latin phrase order is irregular, and exceptions in
                     medieval variants are almost infinite; consequently, training taking into account
                     grammatical rules, co-occurrences, and context can generate many false positives
                     even with an approach that is not rule-based.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p95">The difficulty in recognizing entities involved in these complex phenomena lies not
                     so much in their quantity as in their extensive consequences. The percentage of
                     complex entities (more than three elements) does not exceed 11% of the total in our
                     corpora, but the statistical impact on results due to bad recognition of such
                     entities is more elevated when they are composed of more than four elements: B-PERS
                     + (3) I-PERS (that means three inside-entity errors for each non-recovered entity).
                     Moreover, the impact of these phenomena is increased if we consider that the
                     original mark-up of our database, in which non-physical personal names and juridical
                     actors are classified as place-names, can elevate the number of false positives in
                     automatic recognition of complex place-names.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p96">96</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p96">The influence of these circumstances is more evident in the different tests of
                     temporal variability that we have performed. On one hand, the results of century
                     models applied to European charters are very stable, which confirms, first, the
                     presence of important homogeneous structures in name compositions and formulaic
                     patterns and, second, the presence of a larger stock of name compositions than we
                     would have expected in the Burgundy region in each century, which provides more
                     variety in the training process. On the other hand, in all cases, the model
                     developed with charters from the 10th century, when the
                     double name was not yet established, is less adequate for recognition in other
                     centuries; at the same time, the models from the 10th,
                     11th, and 12th centuries
                     are less efficient when used on 13th century charters,
                     because larger and more complex compositions increased in this century. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p97">Finally, the excellent statistical results in spite of temporal variability also show
                     that there is a high degree of iteration in late medieval formulaic discourse. This
                     characteristic helped us to form a valid model starting from an incomplete and not
                     very structured corpus. We obtained an acceptable ratio of recognition when we
                     tested the model on charters representing different legal acts: donations,
                     transactions, royal orders, deeds and notarial actions from four European regions.
                     That leads us to assume a vast radius of application for our model on Western
                     European legal acts of various types. In addition, single-century models do not show
                     substantial improvements compared to the results of general models when applied to
                     documents from each century, which confirms that our general model can provide the
                     best ratios of recognition along a temporal line of at least four centuries, from
                     the 10th to the
                     13th century.</div>

                     and
                     we implement an adequate evaluation environment. The model produced from long data
                     sets of Burgundian medieval charters is able to accomplish a high ratio of
                     recognition of the personal and geographical names of medieval Latin documentary
                     sources, especially from the 10th to the 13th century. The evaluation is focused on
                     demonstration of the robustness of the model in diverse situations. We performed
                     different cross-validation experiments modifying size, chronology, typology, and
                     regional origin in several sub-corpora, obtaining a very acceptable ratio of
                     recognition in each case, which confirms that our model has a wide range of
                     applications with respect to medieval documentary sources. By crossing results, we
                     can confirm that the model supports an accurate semi-automatization of named
                     entities recognition and, in consequence, that it can provide a primordial level of
                     structuration of data, saving many human efforts.</div>

                     confirm that the most significant problems in recognition are an expression of the

                     and not only on linguistic or statistical concerns. Several historical and
                     philological conclusions helped us to refine and normalize algorithmic approaches
                     and to understand numerical results provided by the machine. This also led to
                     corrections of the original dataset and to complement it by the integration of the

                     Humanities, including, in particular, recovery information systems, automatic
                     indexing and distant reading. Since named entities are not subject to a lot of
                     variation, they can be used as keywords and meaningful terms improving internal
                     workflows of search engines. A NER model which can automatically spot these keywords
                     within a large dataset, becomes a useful tool to speed up, classify and refine
                     requests on ancient documents that are available in plain text editions. The
                     recovery of entities, acting as nodes of action, can serve as a first step in the
                     production of historical GIS-maps, and the reconstruction of event timelines or
                     social networks. These widely used forms of data visualization can benefit from
                     automatic tagging while automatic tagging can also help to solve questions
                     concerning the production or the dating of ancient texts by providing data that
                     scholars have traditionally used in their textual or manuscripts studies – mention
                     of persons, places, words or formulas. Since it enriches datasets with specific
                     linguistic and semantic features, our NER model can even be integrated into a
                     pipeline of tasks, such as topic classification of ancient texts, automatic
                     handwriting recognition or word sense disambiguation.</div>
