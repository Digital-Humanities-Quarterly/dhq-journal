        <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
        <p>Silk holds significant historical importance in European history, fostering economic growth, innovation in weaving
          techniques, and the creation of exceptional artifacts. Despite the conservation efforts of numerous institutions,
          silk heritage remains at risk due to its fragile nature. This paper outlines the methodology employed by the
          Horizon 2020 SILKNOW project aimed at enhancing the promotion and preservation of silk-related cultural heritage
          collections. We present the development of a CIDOC CRM-based data model for the creation of a comprehensive
          knowledge graph. We also introduce the SILKNOW extension, designed to encapsulate the intricate semantics
          associated with the production processes of silk fabrics. Our results demonstrate the potential of Semantic Web
          technologies in safeguarding and enriching the visibility of silk heritage through improved data interoperability
          and accessibility.</p>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>For the past ten years, the history of fashion has attracted a growing public <ptr target="#petrov2019"/> <ptr
          target="#stewart_etal2012"/>. But despite the interest shown in these collections, the Textile Heritage remains
          under threat. This is particularly true of the Silk Heritage, whose fragility poses major conservation problems and
          whose protection requires substantial investment. Few materials are of such historical, cultural and artistic
          importance; but a significant part of the silk-related collections are preserved by small institutions, lacking
          generally the means to promote their collections <ptr target="#portales_etal2018"/> <ptr target="#gaitan_etal2019"
          /> <ptr target="#pagan_etal2020"/>. Outside of the major events devoted to them, we also note the under-use of
          textile collections by visitors <ptr target="#stewart_etal2012"/>. This is why the digitization of Cultural
          Heritage has become one of the crucial issues for its promotion <ptr target="#eastermann2015"/>.</p>
        <p>When users are interested in textile Cultural Heritage online, they are generally faced with two situations. The
          large generalist museums have the technical, financial and human resources to disseminate their data on the Web,
          but they do not systematically highlight their textile collections on their websites. Conversely, small museums do
          not have the same resources as their better-endowed counterparts <ptr target="#claerr_etal2010"/> to promote
          specialized collections online, which can be particularly rich. This is particularly the case for Silk Heritage, as
          the example of the Rhône-Alpes region clearly illustrates <ptr target="#foron-Dauphin_etal2016"/> <ptr
          target="#fournier_etal2016"/>. These institutions do describe their collections, but the digital data they produce
          is, most of the time, inaccessible online. Without a digital presence, these collections remain generally unknown,
          except to a few connoisseurs and specialists.</p>
        <p>The Semantic Web offers particularly interesting prospects in this domain; it proposes to Cultural Heritage
          institutions to increase the visibility of their metadata on the Web by “freeing” it from catalogs; to aggregate
          this data with others and provide access to it in a federated way; to interconnect data with each other and,
          ultimately, to enrich this information more easily thanks to the links created between them. By encouraging the
          dissemination of structured data, Semantic Web technologies indeed facilitate the creation of links between
          dispersed historical sources <ptr target="#merono-Penuela_etal2015"/>. The Semantic Web is not a new Web that
          replaces the current Web, but an extension of it <ptr target="#berners-Lee_etal2001"/>, enabling navigation not
          between documents via hypertext links, but directly between data. This implies that all information is provided
          with a well-defined meaning, making it interpretable and reusable by data consumers, both human and machine, who
          will then be able to process it automatically and develop new applications and services <ptr target="#bermes2013"
          />. Museums are particularly interested in the aggregation possibilities offered by Semantic Web technologies <ptr
          target="#freire_etal2019"/>, especially for heterogeneous metadata <ptr target="#peroni_etal2013"/>. For example,
          the <hi rend="italic">Europeana Fashion</hi> portal provides access to the collections of over thirty European
          institutions. However, it primarily aggregates data from major European museums only <ptr target="#suls2017"/>,
          resulting in a notable exclusion of smaller museums. This approach neglects the promotion of more specialized
          collections, notably those focusing on silk. To address this deficiency, the H2020 SILKNOW project<note> <hi
          rend="italic">Silk Heritage in the Knowledge Society: from punched card to Big Data, Deep Learning and
          visual/tangible simulations</hi>: <ref target="https://silknow.eu/">https://silknow.eu/</ref>. </note> has
          developed ADASilk, an innovative exploratory search engine. This engine offers federated searches across diverse
          Cultural Heritage collections, with a specific emphasis on silk-related artifacts.</p>
        <p>ADASilk is based on a knowledge graph that enables data from a variety of sources to be aggregated and presented
          online. A knowledge graph is a set of interconnected descriptions of entities - objects, people, events, concepts
          or situations - which can be enriched by a retrospective acquisition of information and integrated into ontologies
          <ptr target="#gruber1993"/>. This approach has proven particularly successful for other types of Cultural Heritage
          data: for example, bibliographic data describing musical works for the DOREMUS project <ptr
          target="#achichi_etal2018"/>, archival data for the ArchOnto project <ptr target="#koch_etal2020"/>, or historical
          data for the WarSampo project <ptr target="#hyvonen_etal2021"/>. The SILKNOW Knowledge Graph represents the data
          contained in the catalogues of 21 Cultural Heritage institutions<note> A full list of these institutions can be
          found here: <ref target="https://ada.silknow.org/fr/museums">https://ada.silknow.org/fr/museums</ref>. </note> ,
          following a subset of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model or CIDOC-CRM. Collected online or provided directly by
          the institution concerned<note> Datasets have been made available to the project by <hi rend="italic"
          >Garin1820</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Sicily Cultural Heritage</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Musée d'Art et
          d'Industrie de Saint-Etienne</hi>.</note>, the data describe objects that may be entirely made of silk, or
          incorporate other textile materials (natural fibers, metal threads), or be made of composite materials (e.g. wood
          in the case of furniture). The SILKNOW project focused on objects produced or consumed in Europe between the
          mid-15th to the middle of the 19th century.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we present the different steps that allowed us to build the SILKNOW data model. We also describe
          the methodology we used to create a conceptual model extending the CIDOC CRM, and to integrate the annotations
          produced with machine learning methods. In a first part, we discuss the contributions of Semantic Web technologies
          for the protection and enrichment of Silk Heritage. In a second part, we explain the approach we adopted to develop
          the SILKNOW data model. In the third part, we show how we used the Provenance Data Model or Prov DM to integrate
          the semantic annotations produced on these data thanks to the analysis of texts and images. We also propose to
          extend the CIDOC CRM with new classes and properties, so as to be able to express the complex semantics of the data
          describing the production process of silk fabrics.</p>

        <div>
          <head>Heterogeneous metadata</head>
          <p>The records produced by all these institutions generally provide the same types of information: type of object,
            place and date of production, materials and techniques used, dimensions, and illustration(s). But the way in
            which this metadata is structured can vary greatly depending on the practices of its producers. These data come
            from institutions using various cataloguing standards and respecting their own description standards. Figure 1
            illustrates this problem by comparing the list of metadata describing two objects (here, two damasks<note> For a
            definition of “damask”, please consult the SILKNOW thesaurus: <ref
            target="https://skosmos.silknow.org/thesaurus/en/page/168"
            >https://skosmos.silknow.org/thesaurus/en/page/168</ref>. </note>) held respectively by the <hi rend="italic"
            >Museu Tèxtil Terrassa</hi> <note> <ref target="http://imatex.cdmt.es/">http://imatex.cdmt.es/</ref> </note> and
            by the <hi rend="italic">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</hi> <note> <ref target="https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections"
            >https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections</ref>. </note> . The same types of information are used to describe these two
            objects, but they are expressed differently by the two museums. For example, the <hi rend="italic">Victoria &amp;
            Albert Museum</hi> indicates in the same field the material and technique used, whereas the <hi rend="italic"
            >Museu Tèxtil Terrassa</hi> clearly separates this information.</p>
          <figure>
            <head>Metadata describing the techniques and materials used: examples from the Museu

            <figDesc>side-by-side screenshots of museum webpages</figDesc>
          </figure>
          <p>In other words, the <hi rend="italic">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Museu Tèxtil
            Terrassa</hi> do not use the same data model. This is because the catalogues are designed as separate data silos,
            which are not supposed to communicate with each other. If one wants to collect this metadata on a large scale, it
            will therefore be difficult to process it automatically due to the heterogeneity of its structure, but also due
            to the lack of structure of the metadata. Different types of information are often found in the same field (as
            shown in Figure 1), which makes it difficult to automatically process the data. By nature, Cultural Heritage data
            are heterogeneous: they are produced by various institutions, they describe various objects - which does not make
            them easily accessible by search engines <ptr target="#freire_etal2018"/>. To improve the discoverability of this
            data online, Semantic Web technologies offer the possibility of aggregating and providing access to metadata from
            different sources <ptr target="#freire_etal2019"/>. This is in this context that the SILKNOW project has created
            an exploratory search engine that enables a federated search of 21 collections dedicated to the conservation of
            European Silk Heritage.</p>

        <div>
          <head>An ontology to build a knowledge graph</head>
          <p>Since the emergence of the Semantic Web, we have seen new changes in the use of the Web by museums, particularly
            the increasing openness of the data produced by these institutions <ptr target="#marden_etal2013"/> <ptr
            target="#eastermann2015"/>. The Semantic Web implements linked data <ptr target="#bizer_etal2009"/>, with the aim
            of enabling machines to understand the semantics of information published on the Web, and thus to create new,
            even unexpected, links between this information. The Semantic Web thus opens up new perspectives for the
            visibility of Cultural Heritage online, by making Cultural Heritage data available to all - and not only in a
            museum context -; by aggregating, publishing and enriching this data on the Web to facilitate its reuse; by
            linking this data to each other and to other data, so as to constitute an information network; and finally by
            making proposals for enriching this data.</p>
          <p>SILKNOW hypothesized that the use of Semantic Web technologies, and more specifically the creation of a
            knowledge graph, could facilitate the integration, exploration and retrieval of data describing historical silk
            artefacts. By containing this data, the SILKNOW Knowledge Graph is intended to create a single access point to
            this data. The implementation of the Semantic Web is based on distinct principles and standards, leading to what
            is known as the “Web of Data” or Linked Data <ptr target="#bizer_etal2009"/>. This framework is made possible by
            RDF, a graph model designed by the W3C to describe Web resources and their metadata. In RDF, each unit of
            information is represented by a three-element assertion (or “triplet”) comprising a subject, a predicate (or
            property) and an object. These elements are represented as URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), thus becoming
            “resources”. These resources are then organized into "classes", conceptualized as collections of individuals or
            objects. The Web of Data doesn't establish fixed definitions for classes and properties; similarly, RDF's
            versatility doesn't dictate specific usage rules for classes and properties <ptr target="#bermes2013"/>.
            Consequently, the adoption of a knowledge representation technology becomes essential. Ontologies play a crucial
            role here, enabling the declaration of classes, properties, their behaviors and hierarchy in languages such as
            RDF Schema (RDFS) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). The selection of specific classes and properties from an
            ontology to represent the desired information leads to the creation of a data model <ptr target="#bermes2013"
            />.</p>
          <p>An ontology is a mutually shared conceptual model used to represent all information in a specific application
            domain by means of defined hierarchical concepts <ptr target="#gruber1993"/>. Consequently, the use of ontologies
            helps to solve the problem of semantic heterogeneity arising from diverse data sources, and to improve the
            interoperability of systems and applications. With the expansion of the Semantic Web, ontologies have been
            developed for a variety of purposes <ptr target="#wang_etal2014"/>. In the Cultural Heritage domain, reference
            ontologies have been established to detail objects and their relationships. The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model
            or CIDOC-CRM, used to describe objects in museums collections, is a striking example <ptr target="#doerr2003"/>.
            When a domain-specific ontology is available, it is possible to create more restricted subsets or specializations
            tailored to particular sub-domains <ptr target="#messaoudi_etal2019"/> <ptr target="#kergosien_etal2019"/>. </p>
          <p>In the framework of SILKNOW, data is downloaded or collected from partner institutions; and these files are
            converted to create the knowledge graph using the Resource Description Framework as the data model. The graph,
            which contains all the metadata, is then loaded into a triple store. The converted data is then accessible online
            via ADASilk. The creation of the knowledge graph requires an RDF conversion, which is based on a manual mapping
            of the data. This mapping consists in putting in equivalence the data models describing similar objects <ptr
            target="#christen2012"/>. When working with two data sources A and B, data mapping can consist of matching each
            field in database A with those in database B. In the SILKNOW project, we are using many different sources; we
            have chosen to use a pivotal data model that makes it easier to perform this mapping between all the collected
            datasets. We have thus created a subset of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) ontology, which is
            instantiated at the time of the RDF conversion <ptr target="#schleider_etal2021b"/> <ptr
            target="#schleider_etal2021c"/>.</p>

            Cultural Heritage by the International Committee for Documentation (CIDOC) of the International Council of Museum
            (ICOM). An ISO standard since 2006, renewed in 2014<note> <ref target="https://www.iso.org/standard/57832.html"
            >https://www.iso.org/standard/57832.html</ref> </note>, the CIDOC CRM is today a standard intended to ensure the
            interoperability of Cultural Heritage data. However, this standard is not set in stone; thus, at the time of
            writing this article, version 7.2.3 has been published<note> <ref
            target="https://www.cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-7.2.3">https://www.cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-7.2.3</ref>
            </note> . However, we used version 6.2<note> <ref target="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-6.2.3"
            >http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-6.2.3</ref> </note> - the most recent version at the time of the start
            of the project in 2018. CIDOC CRM is also a flexible and extensible model. If necessary, this model can be
            extended by creating new classes and properties to express new information, without changing the basic structure
            of the model. These features allow the creation of specialized extensions such as FRBRoo (Functional Requirements
            for Bibliographic Records), a conceptual model for bibliographic data<note> IFLA Study Group on the Functional
            Requirements for Bibliographic Records, <hi rend="italic">Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records:

          <p>CIDOC CRM allows the underlying semantics of Cultural Heritage information to be expressed, and thus
            heterogeneous data to be modelled in a homogeneous way. If we take the descriptions of the two damask fabrics
            preserved by the <hi rend="italic">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Museu Tèxtil
            Terrassa</hi> (Figure 1), we can express in a unique way with CIDOC CRM the information about the technique and
            the materials used during the weaving process. CIDOC CRM allows to model each of the descriptive fields with
            triplets Class (C) - Property (P) - Class (C), which can be represented as graphs as in Figure 2.</p>
          <figure>

            <figDesc>a diagram linking material and technique to two examples</figDesc>
          </figure>
          <p>In this figure, we can see that we have chosen to use the E22_Man Made Object class to represent the object
            described by the museum metadata. In version 6.2 of CIDOC CRM, this class is indeed used to model “physical
            objects purposely created by human activity” <ptr target="#leboeuf_etal2015"/>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>What classes and properties to represent this information?</head>
          <p>As a conceptual model, CIDOC CRM is intended to model all kinds of Cultural Heritage data and should be able to
            cover most cases. CIDOC CRM thus provides a wide range of classes and properties. For example, there are 89
            classes and 153 properties offered by version 6.2<note> A list of these classes and properties can be found on
            the OntoMe website: <ref target="https://ontome.net/namespace/1">https://ontome.net/namespace/1</ref></note>. In
            general, therefore, we do not need to use all the classes and properties offered by CIDOC CRM.</p>
          <p>To select the classes and properties needed to model the metadata collected by the project, it is first
            necessary to list the descriptive fields used to describe the textile objects. To do this, we analyzed and
            compared a large number of records, based on the documentation used by Cultural Heritage institutions to create
            this metadata (notably <ptr target="#grant_etal1995"/>). This analysis allowed us to draw up a list of
            descriptive fields commonly used to describe textile objects, while eliminating descriptive fields that were not
            relevant to the project - namely, fields providing information on the administrative management of the
            object.</p>
          <p>These descriptive fields were then classified into Information Groups<hi rend="italic">,</hi> which form the
            Data Dictionary of the SILKNOW project. These information groups allowed us to identify the categories used by
            Cultural Heritage institutions to describe ancient textiles. We defined 22 Information Groups, from the most
            commonly used (e.g. “Object Title Information Group” or “Object Measure Information Group”) to the most rarely
            encountered (e.g. “Object Missing Part Information Group” or “Exhibition Information Group”). These Information
            Groups then allowed us to rely on the Functional Overviews provided by the official CIDOC CRM documentation<note>
            The functional overviews are available online: <ref target="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/functional-units"
            >http://www.cidoc-crm.org/functional-units</ref>. </note>, and to more easily select the most appropriate classes
            and properties to represent these information groups. Functional Overviews classify CIDOC CRM classes and
            properties into information categories that can be easily aligned with the Information Groups in our data
            dictionary. For example, the Functional Overviews provide an “Object Title Information” category that corresponds
            to our “Object Title Information Group”.</p>
          <p>The SILKNOW data model consists of the classes and properties selected to represent the information groups we
            have previously defined. It is accessible and documented online <ptr target="#puren_etal2021b"/> thanks to OntoME
            <ptr target="#beretta2021"/>, which is an ontology manager developed and maintained by the LARHRA laboratory. The
            SILKNOW data model is mainly based on the CIDOC CRM Core version 6.2 (71 properties and 21 properties). We also
            selected two classes and one property from an extension of CIDOC CRM, the Scientific Observation Model (CRMsci)
            version 1.2.3<note> The latest version 1.5 was released in January 2022.</note> <ptr
            target="#kritsotaki_etal2017"/>. The CRMsci, which is a conceptual model designed to integrate the metadata
            produced by scientific observations, seemed to us to be very appropriate for modelling the historical and
            technical analyses formulated by experts in the field on ancient textiles (Figure 3)<note> For example, the
            record describing a tapestry (“<hi rend="italic">lé de tenture</hi>” in French) preserved in the collections of
            the Château de Versailles includes a “History” field (“<hi rend="italic">Historique</hi>”) and a “Comment” field
            (“<hi rend="italic">Commentaire</hi>”). Using the CIDOC CRM and CRMsci models, we have expressed this information
            with the following triplets: <hi rend="italic">S4_Observation O8_observed E22_Man-Made Object; S4_Observation
            P2_has type E55_Type (Historique / Commentaire); S4_Observation P3_has note E62_String</hi>.</note>. We chose to
            use the <hi rend="italic">S4_Observation</hi> class provided by the CRMsci extension because it is defined as
            “the activity of gaining scientific knowledge about particular states of physical reality gained by empirical
            evidence, experiments and by measurements” <ptr target="#kritsotaki_etal2017"/>. The observations made by the
            experts on ancient textiles thus seemed to us to fall under this type of scientific activity.</p>

          <head>Evaluating the ontology</head>
          <p>The quality and robustness of this ontology is then assessed by a mapping process. This process consists of
            verifying that it is possible to represent all the metadata fields using the classes and properties selected in
            the ontology. The mapping is produced manually by domain experts, who then provide mapping rules for each of the
            collected datasets. Concretely, we chose two objects described extensively<note> That is, with the highest number
            of descriptive fields filled in the records.</note> in the catalogues of the selected institutions. Then, we
            interpreted each of the descriptive fields in the form of triplets Entity (E) - Relation (R) - Entity (E). To do
            this, we relied on the collected metadata files, converted into an intermediate JSON format. Figure 4 shows an
            extract corresponding to the metadata contained in Table 1.</p>

            <graphic url="resources/images/figure04.jpg"/>
          </figure>
          <p>As shown in Table 1, we have therefore decomposed the whole metadata schema with Class (C) - Property (P) -
            Class (C) triples from the SILKNOW data model.</p>

          <p>After providing these mapping rules, we found that all the metadata fields could be expressed using the SILKNOW

        <head>SILKNOW's contribution to textile heritage: the example of religious fabrics</head>
        <p>The benefits of using this type of technology are particularly apparent when it comes to religious textiles.
          Religious textile collections are preserved in a wide variety of institutions. While collections of "ordinary"
          textiles are generally preserved in fashion museums, they can also be found in ethnological or decorative art
          museums. Religious textiles are preserved not only in national heritage institutions, but also in small and
          medium-sized ecclesiastical museums. In addition, churches, cathedrals and convents may use these fabrics as part
          of their liturgy and daily devotions. There are also collections preserved by companies that produced these
          fabrics: such is the case of the Garín archives - one of the SILKNOW consortium's partners - which conserve very
          rich samples of religious fabrics representative of Spanish silk manufacturing in the 18th and 19th centuries <ptr
          target="#alba_etal2020"/>. The integration of the inventories produced by these structures into the SILKNOW
          Knowledge Graph enables them to be displayed via ADASilk, thus improving the accessibility and visibility of their
          collections.</p>
        <p>In some cases, small heritage structures do not have a catalog or even an inventory, which makes it extremely
          difficult to determine the origin of the fabrics kept there. These fabrics, widely dispersed across Europe, are
          even incomplete<note> Religious vestments have often been conceived as ensembles: for example, a chasuble is
          accompanied by a stole.</note>. As a result, information is fragmented and disconnected, making it difficult in
          many cases to correctly identify and date these artifacts, and hence to catalogue them. ADASilk enables smaller
          organizations, particularly church museums and religious institutions, to trace the links between the objects they
          conserve and other artifacts held in distant collections, and to integrate them into a renewed chronology. This can
          help create new synergies for ecclesiastical collections, cathedrals and parishes that are custodians of this
          heritage <ptr target="#alba_etal2020"/>.</p>
        <p>Small parishes and diocesan museums often lack the resources - both financial and human - to properly conserve
          these works. This information is also indispensable when these establishments want to restore the fabrics they
          conserve, as they rarely have experts capable of carrying out the appropriate research. This results in a lack of
          appropriate methodology and restoration that should stem from a thorough knowledge of weaving techniques,
          materials, design and historical and artistic links in order to better preserve these assets <ptr
          target="#alba_etal2019"/>. ADASilk enables them to compare the fabrics they conserve with those in other
          collections, and thus obtain the information they need to launch better-documented restoration campaigns. It can be
          very difficult to distinguish the origin and technique of certain fabrics without applying a technical analysis
          which, in some cases, leads to the destruction of part of the textile <ptr target="#alba_etal2020"/>. Comparing
          fabrics held in other collections - and already catalogued - is therefore particularly useful when it comes to
          analysing and identifying old and rare fabrics without having to damage them.</p>
        <p>In addition to integrating heterogeneous data into the knowlegde graph, the SILKNOW ontology provides a structure
          for automatic image recognition, facilitating the discovery of similarities between several textiles preserved in
          various European institutions. Image recognition performed on images from Garín's collections and images from
          public museums <ptr target="#dorozynski_etal2019"/> <ptr target="#clermont_etal2020"/> enabled <ptr
          target="#alba_etal2020"/> to highlight the great similarities between an 18th-century dalmatic preserved by the
          Centro de Documentación y Museo Textil (CDMT) in Terrassa (Spain) and Garín's 19th-century Francia model. The
          similarity of these two objects based on their motifs shows that Garín imitated models from Lyon to decorate its
          religious textiles. A comparison of these two objects through their motifs reveals that Garín drew inspiration from
          Lyonnais motifs for its religious textiles. These images help us to understand the link between Valencian and
          French motifs. On the other hand, during the 19th century, silk industries turned to revivals, reembracing ancient
          motifs that may have appeared obsolete and reinterpreting them to suit the tastes of each period. This complicates
          the process of dating and attribution. Sometimes, textiles found in geographically distant locations exhibit
          strikingly similar features; and the same fabric design can be observed in both secular and ecclesiastical
          garments. These confusing scenarios prompt researchers to question whether these designs are original or,
          alternatively, imitations of other textiles.</p>

            about objects from the metadata describing them, so as to enrich the existing metadata. If we examine the record
            shown in Figure 6, we find the following information in the “Technique” field: Damask 71% and Embroidery 52% and
            in the “Depiction” field: Floral motif 51% and Vegetal motif 57% (see Figure 7).</p>

            <figDesc>an example of SILKNOW image analysis</figDesc>
          </figure>
          <p>This new information was obtained using convolutional neural networks trained on the data (texts and images)
            contained in the knowledge graph. Based on textual descriptions of silk objects or on images representing them,
            text <ptr target="#rei2021"/> or image <ptr target="#dorozynski_etal2021"/> classification models are able to
            predict the values of certain properties: the period of production, the place of production, the technique and
            the material for the text classification model; the previous properties, plus the patterns represented for the
            image classification model. Each of these predictions is associated with a confidence score expressed as a
            percentage. In the previous example, the text classification model predicted the “damask” value with a confidence
            score of 71% for the “Technique” property; the image classification model predicted the floral motif value with a
            confidence score of 51% for the “Depiction” property.</p>
          <p>It was crucial to incorporate this new information into the data model, so that it could be integrated into the
            knowledge graph. We also aimed to make a clear distinction between these predictions and the original data. We
            also want to provide ADASilk users with information on the degree of reliability of the results of these
            analyses. To model these annotations, we have chosen to use the conceptual data model Provenance Data Model (Prov

          <head>The SILKNOW extension</head>
          <p>During our examination of the metadata, we noticed that the technical and historical analyses written in free
            text were particularly rich. These sometimes very long blocks of text provide information about the weaving
            process, such as which weave(s)<note> The term “weave” refers to the way in which the weft and warp threads are
            interwoven. This is called satin weave, for example. For more information on this term, please consult the
            SILKNOW thesaurus: <ref target="https://skosmos.silknow.org/thesaurus/en/page/318"
            >https://skosmos.silknow.org/thesaurus/en/page/318</ref>. </note> , or which type(s) of yarns were used. However,
            this semantic richness is difficult to capture in the CIDOC CRM<note> The SILKNOW data model proposes to use the
            two triplets <hi rend="italic">S4_Observation O8_observed S4_Observation</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
            >S4_Observation P3_has note E62_String</hi> to model the data provided by the metadata fields corresponding to
            these analyses (cf. Figure 3).</note>. To integrate these descriptions into our data model, we use the P3_has
            note property, which is “a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed
            in terms of CRM constructs” <ptr target="#leboeuf_etal2015"/>. It is used to model the way in which an object is
            characterized (e.g. its appearance, structure, etc.), but it does not allow to express “in a structured form,
            everything that can be said about an item”. This is one of the consequences of the CIDOC CRM formalism which does
            not have the function of capturing everything that can be said about an object.</p>
          <p>These blocks of free text provide particularly precise information on the techniques used to produce the
            textiles described; often, they also provide detailed iconographic descriptions. The textual analysis carried out
            on these texts has thus made it possible to extract technical information (weaves and weaving techniques) and
            other information relating to iconographic description (motifs and styles), as illustrated in figure 9. These
            different types of information may be of interest to the general public looking for particular patterns, textile
            specialists working on the history of techniques, or designers and creative industries wishing to draw
            inspiration from a historical style. Access to this information via a search engine would also offer a richer
            user experience by enabling the user to perform more refined queries on the data.</p>
          <p>When the data is integrated into the knowledge graph, some information (techniques and patterns) is annotated
            using the SILKNOW thesaurus (for more information on this thesaurus, see <ptr target="#leon_etal2019"/>). This
            semantic enrichment is achieved in the following way: if the value of a character string for a technique or
            pattern can be associated with one of the character strings proposed by the thesaurus, this value is replaced by
            a unique identifier. Modelling these concepts by means of a formal language would make it possible to integrate
            these annotations into the knowledge graph, to give access to this new data via the exploratory search engine,
            and to create links between these concepts and the thesaurus more easily.</p>

          <p>The inherent flexibility of CIDOC CRM allows for the creation of new classes and properties to express new kinds
            of information. The aim is not to capture everything that can be said about an object, but to express some of the
            things that have been said about it - in this case, information about the process that led to the production of a
            silk fabric. Based on the results of the text analysis and the resulting data annotation, we created a CIDOC
            CRM-compatible model to formally express the process of creating and producing a silk fabric. This specialised
            extension, accessible via OntoME, offers 23 classes and 12 properties <ptr target="#puren_etal2021a"/>. To create
            this extension, we adopted a bottom-up approach, relying primarily on the examination of collected data. We also
            worked with domain experts to verify the validity of these new classes and properties.</p>
          <p>Among these 23 classes and properties is class <hi rend="italic">T1_Weaving</hi>, which is a subclass of <hi
            rend="italic">E12_Production</hi>. <hi rend="italic">T1_Weaving</hi> refers to the activity of interlacing at
            right angles the warp threads (the threads along the length of the fabric, which are stretched on the loom) and
            the weft threads (the perpendicular threads that run alternately between the warp threads). This activity is
            usually carried out using a loom<note> The “weaving” entry can be found in the SILKNOW thesaurus: <ref
            target="https://skosmos.silknow.org/thesaurus/en/page/526"
            >https://skosmos.silknow.org/thesaurus/en/page/526</ref>.</note>. The product of the weaving is a fabric,
            represented by the class <hi rend="italic">T7_Fabric</hi>, itself a subclass of <hi rend="italic">E22_Man-Made
            Object</hi>. The production of this fabric is carried out following a technical procedure(s) (<hi rend="italic"
            >T25_Weaving Technique</hi>). The weaving process always includes the use of at least one specific weave (<hi
            rend="italic">T21_Weave</hi>). It then produces a fabric that is often decorated with patterns (<hi rend="italic"
            >T18_Motif</hi>), sometimes characteristic of a style (<hi rend="italic">T11_Style</hi>) identified by experts in
            the field (<hi rend="italic">T13_Style Assignment</hi>). In Figure 10, we express this information with these new
            classes and associated properties, for a set of tapestries for the Grand salon of the apartment of the
            Empress<note> Marie-Louise I, Duchess of Parma, and second wife of Napoleon I.</note> in Versailles<note>

        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>Silk Heritage is of crucial importance for understanding European history and culture. But some conservation
          institutions lack the means to promote it and make it accessible to the public. More generally, Silk Heritage
          suffers from a lack of visibility, especially online, which has become the preferred tool for searching and
          discovering new information. Semantic Web technologies, however, offer the possibility of disseminating Cultural
          Heritage data more easily on the Web by improving its discoverability, but also of enriching this data by linking
          it to other information.</p>
        <p>The SILKNOW project wished to exploit these potentialities to enhance the visibility of the European Silk
          Heritage, by developing the exploratory search engine ADASilk dedicated to these specialised collections. ADASilk
          is based on a knowledge graph, whose creation is based on the SILKOW ontology - a subset of the CIDOC CRM and
          CRMsci ontology. The richness of the metadata contained in the knowledge graph has also led us to develop the
          SILKNOW extension, a conceptual model for the description of ancient silk textiles. We believe that this
          specialized extension represents a first step in the development of a domain ontology for textile Cultural
          Heritage. Data reusers indeed play a vital role in data modeling. They can suggest collaborative and shared models
          to ensure this data is interoperable and completely reusable in the context of the Semantic Web. We have thus
          conceived the SILKNOW extension as a first step towards the creation and dissemination of a new compatible model
          recognized by the CIDOC CRM SIG. To achieve such recognition, it is essential to extend the SILKNOW framework to
          create an ontology that encompasses not only the results of textile manufacture, but also the places and methods of
          production, the circumstances surrounding this production and the memories associated with it. In addition, we have
          placed special emphasis in this article on the methodology we have used to create this specialized extension, so as
          to enable other research projects and institutions to adopt the same approach. We believe that such an approach
          could be systematized when the aim is to promote and protect an endangered heritage using the Web.</p>
        <p>By creating the ADASilk exploratory search engine, SILKNOW has demonstrated the value of using Semantic Web
          technologies to aggregate heterogeneous heritage data, provide access to it and increase its visibility. It follows
          in the footsteps of other projects that also aim to promote fragile and endangered heritage and demonstrates the
          validity of this type of approach for large-scale processing of Cultural Heritage data. SILKNOW also illustrates
          the important work that needs to be done on heritage data if the objectives of the Semantic Web are to be achieved.
          But to bring this kind of project to fruition, a strong institutional commitment is required. Not only from the
          point of view of producing open, high-quality data, which is the essential fuel for this type of project, but also
          from an organizational and technical point of view. Such a commitment is not accessible to small and medium-sized
          conservation institutions <ptr target="#sebastian-Lozano_etal2023"/>. Indeed, such projects require significant
          investments, and therefore remain inaccessible to small institutions, which would be the first to benefit from
          them. Having demonstrated the value of these approaches, it is therefore necessary to consider the development of
          tools to access these technologies, and thus make them accessible to the greatest number of people.</p>
        <p>The integration of data into the SILKNOW Knowledge Graph could be considerably facilitated by the use of automatic
          classification tools, based on the exploitation of Linked Open Data. Case studies have demonstrated the value of
          developing such methods for creating links (or properties) between entities <ptr target="#bianchini_etal2021"/>.
          But they have also shown the need for semantic data to be available from a high-quality standard and as complete as
          possible <ptr target="#freire_etal2020"/> <ptr target="#bianchini_etal2021"/>; without this, crucial aspects of the
          data may be left out, and links between data may thus be missing. We must be aware, however, that the diversity of
          cataloguing practices - and sometimes errors in metadata - as well as the inherent complexity of historical data,
          often unstructured or a little structured <ptr target="#merono-Penuela_etal2015"/>, can be a brake on this kind of
          approach, both from the point of view of automatic classification and the development of a knowledge graph based on
          CIDOC CRM.</p>
