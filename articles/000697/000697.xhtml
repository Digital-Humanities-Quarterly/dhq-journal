                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  <p>Charles Stewart Parnell was one of the most controversial and effective leaders in
                     the
                     United Kingdom in the second half of the nineteenth century. Almost single-handedly,
                     he transformed 
                     the proposal of Home Rule for Ireland from a languishing irrelevance to a mass-supported
                     cause. 
                     Though the historiography on Parnell is substantial, his speeches – the main primary
                     sources for 
                     accessing both his thinking and strategies – have never been collected or edited.
                     One of the core 
                     questions in working towards an edition of his speeches was whether it would be possible
                     
                     to use automated methods on these fragmentary sources to reconstruct what Parnell
                     actually said in them. 
                     We were also interested in how the reports varied, and what that variation might tell
                     us about 
                     the practices and biases of the journalists who wrote them and the newspapers which
                     published them. 
                     This article discusses the use of two digital tools in our attempts to answer these
                     
                     research questions: CollateX, which was designed by Digital Humanities practitioners
                     for the comparison 
                     of textual variants, and SBERT Sentence Transformers, which establishes levels of
                     similarity between texts. 
                     In this article we talk about how the application of digital methods to the corpus
                     led us away 
                     from the idea of producing definitive reconstructions of the speeches, and towards
                     a deeper 
                     understanding of the corpus and the journalistic practices which went into its creation.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Charles Stewart Parnell (1846-1891) was one of the most controversial and effective
                     leaders 
                     in the United Kingdom in the second half of the nineteenth century. Almost single-handedly,
                     
                     he transformed the proposal of Home Rule for Ireland from a languishing irrelevance
                     to 
                     a mass-supported cause. The political backing which he secured was sufficient to persuade
                     
                     one of the two major British parties, W.E. Gladstone’s Liberals, to adopt Home Rule
                     from 1886. 
                     Their opponents, the Tories, felt compelled to respond to the extent that they eventually
                     
                     redefined their identity in reaction to the Parnell programme, and became the Conservative
                     
                     and Unionist party, and yet were forced to accept and implement some of Parnell’s
                     demands, 
                     specifically with reference to land reform and the democratisation of local government.
                     
                     What is even more extraordinary is that the remapping of the United Kingdom’s political
                     
                     landscape that Parnell provoked proved long-lasting, if not permanent. The idea of
                     Home Rule 
                     survived both Parnell himself and Gladstone and came to epitomise the quintessential
                     British 
                     and Irish road to constitutional reform from 1920 (when it was adopted for Northern
                     Ireland) 
                     and 1998 (when it was applied, in a modified form, to both Scotland and Wales) [<a class="ref" href="#jackson2003">Jackson 2003</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jackson2012">Jackson 2012</a>]. Moreover, Parnell’s parallel campaign for land reform not 
                     only succeeded beyond his own hopes and expectations, but was also exported to other
                     parts of 
                     the British Empire, providing the blueprint for the negotiation of late-colonial agrarian
                     
                     conflicts from India to Kenya and Uganda [<a class="ref" href="#low1991">Low 1991</a>].

                     both his thinking and strategies – have never been collected or edited. Though they

                     been

                     biased 
                     and sometimes tendentious. In 2020 we secured a Cambridge Humanities Research Grant

                     remedy this situation by working towards the first critical edition of Parnell’s speeches.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the project was that the digital methods did
                     not 
                     generally reveal the implicit bias in reporting the content of the speeches that we
                     were 
                     looking for (with one significant exception, described in Section 6.2), nor did they
                     allow 
                     us to construct single reliable texts of the speeches. Instead, they gave us insight
                     into 
                     the process of reporting Parnell’s speeches, and how the practices and methods of
                     newspapers, 
                     editors and journalists, their approaches, mistakes and omissions, might help historians
                     
                     to better understand the speeches as a corpus. This highlights the role of digital
                     humanities 
                     methods and approaches in generating new perspectives, even if they appear to be unsuccessful
                     
                     in answering our original questions – as Willard McCarty has said, “a good 
                     model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening
                     its 
                     theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The adaptation of the scholarly edition to the digital age has led to an emphasis
                     on viewing 
                     the text within the context of its creation, and an understanding of textual boundaries
                     as 
                     both mutable and extensible. Recent approaches to digital scholarly editing position
                     editorial 
                     work as a dynamic, creative process, with hybridity and differing textual versions
                     given a 
                     new prominence [<a class="ref" href="#nabugodi2022">Nabugodi and Ohge 2022</a>]. This is also true of the edition in itself, 
                     which is increasingly approached as a multifaceted object, with a “final” text presented 
                     alongside manuscript variants, related texts, images and digital tools. This movement
                     towards 
                     a mutable vision of the text has a clear relevance to what might be seen as the “limitations” 
                     of the Parnell speech source material - the ephemeral nature of the speech itself,
                     and the 
                     lack of any canonical version of the text against which to compare witnesses. While
                     recent 
                     literature emphasises the importance of digital approaches to the scholarly edition,
                     
                     it is also clear that editorial intervention is an important factor, both in the 
                     interpretation of results and in feeding back to the digital processes themselves.

                     is a 
                     problem which increasingly preoccupies the producers of modern scholarly editions.
                     James 
                     Cummings draws a distinction between the “document” as 
                     “a particular instance of a physical manifestation of this text” and 
                     the “work” as “an abstraction as understood by readers 
                     (including authors and editors)” [<a class="ref" href="#cummings2019a">Cummings 2019a</a>]. From this viewpoint, 
                     the edition is continually destabilised by the contextual environment from which it
                     
                     originates and continues to be formed. While in some ways this is true of all editions,
                     
                     it is presented as being particularly true of the digital edition, which has the potential
                     
                     “[to] be near-infinitely refactorable and dynamically to provide different 
                     views depending on external interactions”. This can be expanded to the process of 
                     creating the digital edition and the foregrounding within the edition itself of the
                     research 
                     methods and techniques, such as collation, which are used as part of the editorial
                     process. 
                     Dirk van Hulle asserts the potential of modern editions to simulate “a 
                     process, such as the creative and imaginative process of a literary work ”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#vanhulle2019">Van Hulle 2019</a>]. This reflects our own experience of the automated collation of
                     an edition as a research method which raises new questions about the corpus, rather
                     than 
                     a tool for providing definitive versions of texts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">CollateX is the most commonly used software for the collation of texts in the digital
                     
                     humanities. It was conceived within the Interedition research group, a cross-institutional
                     
                     initiative created with the aim of developing tools for textual scholarship in a collaborative
                     
                     environment. In “Computer-supported collation of modern manuscripts: 
                     CollateX and the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project,” members of the group outline the 
                     implementation of the software in relation to a digital edition of Samuel Beckett’s
                     manuscripts 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dekker2014">Dekker et al. 2014</a>]. Their approach is based on the “Gothenburg Model”, created 
                     to explore the “conceptual commonalities” between fields relating to collation in digital 
                     textual scholarship. Here, the collation process is broken up into five steps: 
                     
                     <ul class="list">
                        <li class="item">tokenisation of the texts to be compared into textual sub-units such as characters
                           
                           words or sentences</li>
                        <li class="item">normalisation of the tokens to ensure that “equivalent” tokens will align correctly 
                           (though see [<a class="ref" href="#birnbaum2020">Birnbaum and Spadini 2020</a>] on normalisation as a process that occurs at 
                           every stage of collation, including transcription of witnesses)</li>
                        <li class="item">alignment of tokens between texts to see where they match and differ</li>
                        <li class="item">analysis of the computed alignment to interpret and correct it</li>
                        <li class="item">output/visualisation of the collation results</li>
                     </ul>
                     Much emphasis is put on the human aspect of this process, both in the analysis of
                     results 
                     and in decisions on the appropriate level of tokenisation. The inherent ambiguity
                     of the collation 
                     process is also highlighted, particularly in relation to transposed text: “In 
                     some cases, even human interpretation may of course not determine decisively whether
                     an actual 
                     transposition took place. We may have to conclude that some cases of potential transposition
                     
                     cannot be determined with absolute certainty.” This reciprocal and iterative relationship 
                     between digital methods and scholarly interpretation, including establishing the point
                     at which 
                     the methods fail to produce conclusive results, was central to our work.

                     a prominent 
                     role in the project, these are combined with editorial procedures that emphasise the
                     human, 
                     interpretative aspects of textual scholarship. Automated outputs are rigorously checked

                     relation

                     These were

                     For each report, metadata is recorded on the newspaper (or other outlet) where it
                     was published,

                     in particular the close relationship between detailed metadata and transcription.
                     TEI also provides 
                     the kind of general standardisation which could allow for comparative approaches with

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">A key problem in the development of our methodology was finding texts with sufficient
                     levels of 
                     similarity for the collation process to be effective. Reports for the same speech
                     sometimes 
                     differed to the point where any kind of automated textual comparison became impossible,
                     
                     especially in the comparison of full transcriptions of speeches with summaries of
                     their content. 
                     To address this problem, an additional step was introduced before the collation process
                     to 
                     identify which texts would collate effectively. This initial stage produced interesting
                     results 
                     on the general level of similarity between accounts of speeches, pointing to patterns
                     of 
                     copying and adaptation in the writing of reports, and also absence of reporting or
                     partial 
                     coverage by some newspapers. This process of calculating source similarity, which
                     was first 
                     seen as a purely pragmatic activity to assemble reports which were suitable for collation,
                     
                     instead opened up interesting new pathways for research on journalistic practice around
                     
                     reporting on Parnell.

                     the workflow was in providing us with useful insights not only into what Parnell did
                     or 
                     did not say, but also on the way in which newspapers and other outlets reported on
                     his speeches.

                     was 
                     biased and sometimes tendentious, reflecting the wish of editors and reporters to
                     please their 
                     readers or represent Parnell in a way that would be either favourable or hostile to
                     a certain 
                     interpretation of his words (e.g. that he was more or less constitutional or revolutionary
                     in 
                     the way he wished to proceed with the implementation of the nationalist programme).

                     to provide 
                     full accounts of his speeches tended to agree with one another about what he had actually
                     said, 
                     and sometimes relied on the same source (suggesting that different newspapers employed
                     a limited 
                     number of reporters specialising on Parnell). There were discrepancies, but they generally
                     
                     reflected editorial decisions in cases where certain phrases were omitted or contracted
                     for the 
                     sake of space, or where a reporter had misheard a specific word resulting in equally
                     plausible 
                     variants, such as when <cite class="title italic">The Times</cite> reported Parnell as saying the 
                     Conservative Party was ‘most remarkable for its wisdom’, even though all other outlets
                     reported 
                     it as ‘most remarkable for its discipline’. Moreover, and not surprisingly, for the
                     speeches that 
                     Parnell delivered when campaigning in the United States, American newspapers often
                     provided a 
                     fuller record than their British and Irish counterparts.

                     relied

                     the

                     significant 
                     or revealing. Therefore, police records implicitly and indirectly confirmed that the
                     newspaper 
                     press was substantially accurate and reliable in its coverage of Parnell’s speeches.

                     In the results from the initial similarity analysis, it is clear that some newspapers
                     refused to 
                     report in detail what Parnell said, providing instead short summaries. This was typically
                     the case 
                     with Ulster Unionist newspapers. For example, <cite class="title italic">The Northern Whig</cite>, a 
                     Belfast-based Liberal unionist publication, only published brief descriptive reports
                     of even 
                     Parnell’s most significant orations. In the five speeches in the corpus that <cite class="title italic">The 
                        Northern Whig</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Hansard</cite> both reported, the similarity rating given 
                     to them was zero, meaning there was no similarity between their reports. Likewise,
                     <cite class="title italic">The 
                        Northern Whig</cite> and the nationalist weekly, <cite class="title italic">The Irishman</cite>, also received 
                     a score of zero over eight reports. In the reports it had in common with the nationalist
                     
                     daily <cite class="title italic">The Freeman’s Journal </cite>and the <cite class="title italic">Times </cite>of London, 
                     which aspired to be perceived as the ultimate record, <cite class="title italic">The Northern Whig</cite> had a 
                     similarity rating of 0.61 and 0.87 respectively.

                     press responded 
                     to Parnell, two considerations stand out: on the one hand, the nineteenth-century
                     positivist 
                     emphasis on ‘factual’ accounts [<a class="ref" href="#matthew1987">Matthew 1987</a>] remained pervasive even when the speaker was as 
                     ambiguous and divisive as Parnell, with editors generally relegating the expression
                     of opinion to 
                     leading articles. On the other hand, it also showed that readers relying only on regional
                     newspapers 
                     in strongly anti-Parnell areas would not have had access to what the nationalist leader
                     actually said, 
                     and may have tended to form their views through strongly opinionated editorials.

                     motivated 
                     editorial interventions, the sheer number of textual discrepancies it highlighted
                     should persuade

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">For instance, in January 1880, during his tour of North America, the House of Representatives
                     
                     invited Parnell to address a House session and on the evening of 2 February a speech
                     was given 
                     from the Speaker’s rostrum. While many media outlets covered the event, only three
                     sources purported 
                     to give a full transcript of the speech, namely the <cite class="title italic">Congressional Record</cite>, 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Washington Post</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">The Irish World </cite>.
                     <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e1152">[1]</a> However, CollateX revealed major differences between the three 
                     sources in length, wording, punctuation, and the recording of audience reactions.
                     In terms of length, 
                     the <cite class="title italic">Congressional Record</cite>’s report was over ten percent longer than that of 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Washington Post</cite> and 25 percent longer than <cite class="title italic">The Irish World</cite>.
                     The report printed in <cite class="title italic">The Post</cite> did not record Parnell’s formal opening in 
                     which he marked out the ‘Speaker and gentlemen of the House of Representatives’ as
                     the ‘ratified audience’ 
                     for his remarks, and it omitted a further bulky passage where Parnell outlined the

                     context of his speech. <cite class="title italic">The Irish World </cite>was also silent on these opening 
                     remarks, which were rhetorically significant as they contained the speech’s emotional
                     ballast or 
                     <cite class="title italic">pathos</cite>. Nonetheless, before we decided that the <cite class="title italic">Congressional 
                        Record</cite> account should be given precedence, we found problems that would probably have gone
                     
                     unnoticed were it not for the CollateX outputs.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">In the weeks preceding Parnell’s speech to Congress, the English historian J.A. Froude
                     published a 
                     series of articles about Irish history and politics in <cite class="title italic">The North American 
                        Review</cite>. Parnell quoted an extract from one of these articles in which Froude described the
                     
                     land system as the worst of the ‘fatal gifts’ England had bestowed upon Ireland. In
                     the 
                     <cite class="title italic">Congressional Record</cite> the first sentence of the quotation was recorded as 
                     ‘But – of all the <span class="hi italic">feudal</span> gifts which we bestowed upon our unhappy possession 
                     was the English system of owning lands.’ By contrast, <cite class="title italic">The Washington Post</cite> 
                     reported it as ‘But, of all the fatal gifts which we bestowed upon our unhappy possession
                     was the 
                     English system of owning land.’ <cite class="title italic">The Irish World </cite>likewise printed the term 
                     ‘fatal gifts’. Leaving aside the differences in punctuation and the plural versus
                     singular of land 
                     versus lands, the reports disagree on whether Parnell said ‘fatal gifts’ or ‘feudal
                     gifts’.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">The inconsistency is not significant in its own right, as the disagreement most likely
                     comes from 
                     a congressional stenographer mishearing the speaker or from a slip of the tongue on
                     Parnell’s part. 
                     It is certainly possible that Parnell misspoke and <cite class="title italic">The Washington Post </cite>and 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Irish World</cite> corrected his mistake while the <cite class="title italic">Record</cite> 
                     did not. Yet, given the prestige and authority of the <cite class="title italic">Congressional Record</cite> 
                     as the record of the United States Congress, such mistakes have a legacy in the garbled
                     
                     transmission of Parnell’s speech. For example, a volume published in approximately
                     1904 
                     entitled <cite class="title italic">Irish Literature</cite> printed an edited version of the 
                     <cite class="title italic">Congressional Record</cite>’s account of Parnell’s speech and the volume’s 
                     editor, the writer and politician Justin McCarthy, failed to correct the error. Additionally,
                     
                     in a 1986 debate regarding the recently signed Anglo-Irish Agreement and the responsibility
                     of 
                     the United States for helping to secure peace in Northern Ireland, Senator D.P. Moynihan
                     commended 
                     Parnell’s speech to the Senate, leading to its republication in the record of that
                     body, replete 
                     with the misquotation of Froude.

                     <cite class="title italic">The Irish World</cite>’s report deserves its own discussion, as it bucked the 
                     trend by demonstrating significant editorial intervention in its reporting of the
                     address to the 
                     House. Unlike the myriad other variations in the dataset, the divergences in the 
                     <cite class="title italic">World</cite>’s report display signs that they were ideologically motivated. 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Irish World</cite>, edited by Patrick Ford, was widely read on both sides of 
                     the Atlantic, circulating over 60,000 copies in the United States with a further 20,000
                     copies 
                     circulating in Ireland and Great Britain [<a class="ref" href="#dungan2014">Dungan 2014</a>]. As none of the major Irish newspapers 
                     printed a full report, Ford’s newspaper was the context in which most Irish readers
                     would have 
                     encountered Parnell’s address. Furthermore, during the 1888-89 special commission
                     into Parnellism 
                     and crime, one of Parnell’s counsels, H.H. Asquith, read <cite class="title italic">The Irish World</cite>’s 
                     report into the record as an authoritative account of Parnell’s speech (<cite class="title italic">Special 
                        Commission Act, 1888</cite>). Its role in the afterlife and reformulation of the speech grants 
                     it a status that outweighs its unreliability as evidence for what Parnell actually
                     said before 
                     the House.

                     use of land reform in Prussia as a model for reform in Ireland. In an open letter
                     to Parnell, 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Irish World</cite> urged him not to make comparisons with European land systems 
                     but, as Paul Bew phrased it, Parnell ‘pointedly’ flouted this recommendation [<a class="ref" href="#bew1979">Bew 1979</a>]. In the 
                     open letter, the <cite class="title italic">World</cite> declared that people who use examples from the 
                     European continent to argue for changes to land tenure in Ireland were ‘half-way men’.
                     Parnell’s 
                     use of the Prussian example placed him out of ideological alignment with the <cite class="title italic">World</cite>. 
                     In return, the <cite class="title italic">World</cite> excised most of his discussion of land reform in Prussia.

                     establishing

                     process, 
                     and in elucidating general patterns in the reporting of Parnell’s speeches. Experimenting
                     with the 
                     distance threshold to find an appropriate level of similarity was an essential part
                     of this process.

                     level of 
                     general similarity. With texts with low levels of similarity the software collated
                     on false 
                     positives generated by commonly used words or punctuation. For a corpus containing
                     texts with 
                     very variable levels of similarity, a preprocessing stage to establish which groups
                     of texts are 
                     suitable for collation becomes essential. As pointed out by the developers of the

                     Collatex (as with all collation software) sometimes struggles with transposed text.
                     This is a 
                     known problem which the developers are working on. The outputs produced by the software

                     challenges. 
                     Whilst we had some success in building a workflow for collation, this necessarily
                     involved a 
                     sub-process of finding sources that were similar enough for the automated tools to
                     pick out 
                     similarities and differences in a coherent manner. When speech reports, or parts of
                     reports, 
                     were too dissimilar, the collation outputs devolved into picking out false positives,
                     such as 
                     isolated instances of punctuation. The SBERT library was extremely useful in enabling
                     us to find 
                     clusters of reports around speeches that were similar enough to be collated. This
                     process also 
                     highlighted significant variations in journalistic practice, such as the fact that
                     Ulster Unionist 
                     newspapers tended only to report what Parnell said in summary.

                     more 
                     easily, drawing attention to additions and omissions as they occurred. This allowed
                     for notable 
                     insights, making us aware of errors in respected sources such as the <cite class="title italic">Congressional

                     <cite class="title italic">The Irish World</cite>, we were unable to see the influence of ideological bias 
                     in the ways different sources reported the speeches, but this is an insight in itself,
                     perhaps 
                     revealing a general editorial trend towards objectivity in relation to speech reports
                     or the 
                     reliance of many publications on a single eyewitness account. Ideological bias seemed
                     to be mainly 
                     expressed through other journalistic practices, such as only providing short summaries
                     of speeches, 
                     or omitting to report on them altogether.

                     failed to report) 
                     on them. This concentration on the factors which went into the creation of reports

                     the TEI dataset which forms the basis of the edition (both as data and through a simple
