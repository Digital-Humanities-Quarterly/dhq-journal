                  <p>Is hierarchical XML apt for the encoding of complex manuscript materials? Some
                     scholars have argued that texts are non-hierarchical entities and that XML
                     therefore is inadequate. This paper argues that the nature of text is such that
                     it supports both hierarchical and non-hierarchical representations. The paper
                     distinguishes (1) texts from documents and document carriers, (2) writing from
                     "texting", (3) actions that can be performed by one agent only from actions that
                     require at least two agents to come about (“shared actions”), (4) finite actions
                     from potentially infinitely ongoing actions. Texts are described as potentially
                     infinitely ongoing actions which are co-produced by author and reader agents.
                     This makes texts into entities that are more akin to events than to objects or
                     properties, and shows, moreover, that texts are dependent on human understanding
                     and thus mind-dependent entities. One consequence from this is that text
                     encoding needs to be recognized as an act participating in texting which in turn
                     makes hierarchical XML as apt a markup for “text representation”, or rather: for
                     texting, as non-hierarchical markup. The encoding practices of the Bergen
                     Wittgenstein Archives (WAB) serve as the main touchstone for my discussion.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Amongst the many theoretical questions about text, there is a philosophical, or
                     more specifically, an ontological question. The most general form of this
                     question is perhaps ‘What <em class="emph">is</em> text?’. In Digital
                     Humanities, the issue has partly been focused around the question whether texts
                     are hierarchical or rather non-hierarchical structures. Examples of this
                     discussion include the statement that “text is best
                     represented as an ordered hierarchy of content object (OHCO), because
                     that is what text really is”  [<a class="ref" href="#deroseetal1990">DeRose et al. 1990</a>, 3], or, in opposition to it, the
                     statement that “humanists are trying to represent what
                     they all agree are non-hierarchical structures”  [<a class="ref" href="#schmidt2010">Schmidt 2010</a>, 344]. Conflicting lessons
                     for text encoding have been drawn from these two opposed approaches to the
                     question. Some have concluded that the hierarchical markup grammar XML can be
                     regarded as adequate for text encoding, because that is in their view what texts
                     basically are, viz., hierarchical entities. Others reject XML and embedded
                     markup more generally as inadequate, precisely on the basis of the view that
                     texts have, or at least can have, non-hierarchical structures. In this paper, I
                     want to argue that both conclusions have been drawn prematurely due to an
                     erroneous approach to the ontological question about text.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">I shall start with presenting a brief example of philosophical authorship from
                     the last century. A reflection on the editorial history of this example and
                     other writings from the same authorship will lead us to a view into editorial
                     philology and, in particular, <em class="emph">digital</em> editorial
                     philology. It is in this digital context that the question about the ontological
                     nature of text and its consequences for text encoding have most forcefully been
                     asked. I shall attempt to demonstrate that a philosophical reflection on the
                     hermeneutical nature of our text practices not only helps to understand better
                     the question about the ontology of texts, but also to dispel the idea that the
                     nature of text would as such, i.e. as independent from our text practices,
                     dictate either hierarchical or non-hierarchical markup.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">In July 1931, a philosopher in Cambridge reads Augustine’s <cite class="title italic">Confessiones</cite>. Augustine’s account of how he learned to speak as a
                     child makes a strong impression on him. Our philosopher reads the account at a
                     time when he is struggling with theoretical questions about language and
                     meaning. He therefore is very sensitive to anything that even remotely deals
                     with these things. Augustine’s description seems generally fair and
                     representative of how we think language acquisition works. But our philosopher
                     gets puzzled about a few sentences. Perhaps he draws a line in the margin of the
                     book, to highlight the passages that he finds perplexing. Later, then, he notes
                     down his thoughts in a notebook, recording what he believes was right and what
                     he believes was wrong with the account. Later still he returns to these notes,
                     and develops his ideas into a longer discussion. He develops an entire argument
                     around Augustine’s account. He regards his discussion of Augustine as a way of
                     becoming clearer about his own thought concerning linguistic meaning, and about
                     the role that <em class="emph">humans</em> play in establishing the relation
                     between words and objects. The exact intentions behind Augustine’s original
                     account are of less importance to him now.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">He has the discussion of Augustine, together with many other notes and remarks,
                     typed. The resulting typescript he then cuts into paper slips. The slips are of
                     varying sizes: some contain one remark or even only part of a remark, others
                     contain series of remarks or also an entire page. He collects the slips together
                     with cuttings from other typescripts. Next, he reorganizes the contents of his
                     collection. He inserts additional sheets, with handwritten titles for chapters
                     and subchapters. Soon he has this new arrangement of his remarks typed again,
                     hereby producing a large <em class="emph">new</em> typescript. It contains more
                     than 4,000 remarks — he calls them “Bemerkungen”. The <em class="term">Bemerkungen</em> are typically separated from each other by one or more
                     blank lines. The typescript looks much like an advanced book manuscript. But
                     soon our philosopher starts to make changes, namely adding, deleting,
                     rearranging and revising remarks and sentences in it. In many places, he adds
                     alternative phrasings. Some parts of the typescript he goes through more than
                     once, making changes in pencil, black ink and red ink. The amount of changes and
                     revisions grows larger and larger. The changes now begin to also extend into
                     parallel notebooks and other writing books. Entire new sections are added, some
                     in the margins of the typed pages, others on the typescript’s verso pages, and
                     yet others in separate notebooks.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">About a year later he begins considering the idea of making his discussion of
                     Augustine the beginning of a new book in philosophy, to appear in a parallel
                     German-English edition. About fifteen years earlier he had published the <cite class="title italic">Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung</cite>; this book had given
                     him some status. He now produces a concise summary of his argument about
                     Augustine, making it the beginning of a discussion about small and well-defined
                     samples of language use. These he calls “language games” (<em class="term">Sprachspiele</em>), and he intends to make the idea of language games the
                     backbone of his entire new book project.

                     deleting, he has yet another typescript produced that looks ready for the press.
                     The typescript even includes a title (<cite class="title italic">Philosophische
                        Untersuchungen</cite>), a motto and a preface. However, in the remaining five
                     years of his life, our philosopher can never bring himself to finish the work
                     for publication. Two years after his death, in 1953, his friends finally edit
                     and publish it with a parallel translation in English.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e240">[1]</a></div>

                     from the twentieth century. Note that I did not use the word “text” even once. I
                     could have used the word, but I need not have used it. In some places, I could
                     have said “text” instead of “remark” or, in others, instead of “discussion” or
                     “argument” or “book” or “work”. But in all these cases it would have been
                     replaceable. Our author<em class="emph">may</em> sometimes have asked himself:
                     Which text should I choose here? Will I ever finish my text? Is my text good
                     enough? Etc. However, again, the occurrences of the expression “text” in such
                     questions are replaceable with words such as “manuscript”, “book”, “phrasing”,
                     “sequence” or “version”. Regarding the notion of text, our real case example did
                     not seem to pose any special theoretical difficulties. Most importantly, the <em class="emph">ontological</em> question of what text <em class="emph">is</em>, clearly need not have bothered our <em class="emph">author</em>.
                     For the author the notion of text need not be problematic at all. An author may
                     just write, delete, rearrange, rewrite, compose, and so on. Neither did <em class="emph">I</em>have to be bothered by the notion when telling the
                     story of the example. So, if there is a specific philosophical, ontological
                     issue about text, where does it come in?

                     the answer to our question. Let us first try to locate, with the help of our
                     narrative, the points at which text can become a theoretical issue of <em class="emph">any</em> sort. As this particular tale goes, before he dies,
                     our philosopher appoints three friends who are to manage the publication of his
                     writings. The three find themselves confronted with a huge mass of pages (which
                     they first have to collect from different places), some handwritten, some typed,
                     some bound in notebooks, some on loose sheets, some in orderly dossiers. This is
                     now standardly referred to as our philosopher’s “Nachlass”. For some of the
                     books and pieces that they decide to edit from this <cite class="title italic">Nachlass</cite>, they are able to use neat enough typescripts — for most of the
                     publications, however, they have to make selections and combinations on both
                     large and small scales, and need to do some substantial editing. They have to
                     decide what to choose for publication; which version to use; how to arrange it;
                     how many and which of our author’s variant phrasings to include; whether to use
                     also variants added in other manuscripts; whether to obey all his instructions
                     or only those that they find conducive; whether always to omit what our
                     philosopher himself had deleted; whether to stick to at least some of his
                     idiosyncratic style and punctuation; whether, and how much, to expand on his
                     elliptic references to either his own ideas or also the ideas and works of
                     others; how much to bother the reader with information about the character of

                     Wittgenstein’s. In the processes of editorial decision-making, such editors will
                     often refer to precisely this thing, the text, and find themselves confronted
                     with issues of so-called “<em class="emph">textual</em> criticism”. We can
                     imagine them discussing and debating these issues both amongst themselves and
                     with the users of their editions. Both the editors and their critics will argue
                     for their respective positions by reference to what they call “the text”; and
                     this invocation of the text, while the word itself often seems to refer to
                     different things for the different sides, always seems to lend their respective
                     standpoints and arguments strength and significance. Surely, for many of the
                     arising disputes, the expression “text” will again be replaceable by some other
                     words, e.g. “source”. In several cases, however, the expression clearly carries
                     something which is not contained in those other expressions, something like the
                     marker of a norm or standard, or of the right interpretation, and “the text” is
                     precisely the expression to be used.

                     side. The Wittgenstein readers asked: Have we received all the text, or are
                     parts missing? Is the text displayed in the correct sequence? Does it contain
                     transcription errors? Does the edition maybe mislead me to adopt a wrong
                     interpretation? Have I been given the right text? Have I been given the text as
                     it was intended by the author? To what extent is the text authorized by its
                     author Ludwig Wittgenstein? Does the edited text correspond to the original? The
                     “textual” situation in the Wittgenstein <cite class="title italic">Nachlass</cite> itself
                     is often far from clear. The edited text could be something that physically
                     never existed before, or no longer existed — thus, was something that had to be
                     (re)constructed. Or, the editors came at different times to different
                     conclusions about what “the text” was referring to, and for a few items
                     different editions, as also different translations, were produced. Readers would
                     again ask: Which is the text / translation I should use for my
                     interpretation?

                     discourse about text. But none of them necessarily brings us to the <em class="emph">ontological</em> question about <em class="emph">what text
                        is</em>. Moreover, there are disciplines that not only treat these questions

                     stress that digital editorial philology provides solutions to the

                     the very same disciplines that provide the solutions, also in fact seem to give

                     finding solutions to exactly the kind of issues and questions brought up in the
                     previous section. Twentieth-century textual criticism has improved these methods
                     further through the application of digital techniques. For instance, while the
                     practice of producing editions comprising both facsimiles and transcriptions,
                     ranging from ultra-diplomatic to so-called “students” versions, has already
                     existed in the pre-digital age, the introduction of digital techniques has made
                     producing such editions easier, cheaper and more efficient. But the digital
                     medium has not only provided improved ways of implementing solutions that had
                     already existed before — it has furthermore brought <em class="emph">new</em>
                     solutions and possibilities. XML-based user-steered or “interactive dynamic presentation” (Pichler and Bruvik

                     achievement of digital editorial philology, and it offers something that had not
                     been possible before.

                     deal with editorial challenges such as the issues from the previous section by,
                     first, separating representation or transcription matters from presentation
                     matters, and, second, by serving the different interests we might have in
                     editing a source, by explicitly addressing them through different groups of
                     codes ([<a class="ref" href="#huitfeldt1994">Huitfeldt 1994</a>];
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pichler1995">Pichler 1995</a>]). For example,
                     while one group of codes may record a manuscript’s chronological sequence,
                     another one can take care of the physical sequence, and a third one of a
                     specific sequence in content. Subsequently, the three encodings can be invoked
                     independently of each other, or also in various combinations, just as required
                     by individual users’ research needs. While pre-digital book editing, if it had
                     not been for certain material restrictions, could have delivered some of the
                     same possibilities, it could never have delivered the same degree of <em class="term">interaction</em> and <em class="term">transparency</em> which
                     characterizes digital editorial philology that is based on text encoding. In
                     traditional editing, the editor and publisher decide how the source is
                     presented, while the user mostly tends to remain in a purely passive role. The
                     typical user of traditional editions merely receives what experts have prepared
                     for her and is rarely in a position to adequately verify the edition received.
                     In contrast to this, with digital editing and publishing driven by text
                     encoding, users are no longer dependent, so-to-say purely on the basis of good
                     faith, on the decisions made by editors. Instead they are now able to check
                     editorial decisions and, moreover, with interactive dynamic presentation tools
                     to also complement the experts’ editing by producing alternative filterings and
                     presentations of the source materials. Editorial philology today can
                     satisfactorily address most of the issues about text brought up in the previous
                     section. We can now make available all versions of a work, all variants of
                     alternative phrasings, all editorial interpretations of a passage — in principle
                     all options between which editors before had to choose due to material
                     restrictions. The user of the editions will still have questions: “Which of the
                     many versions made available to me is the one I shall use?” But this was a
                     question also for our Cambridge author <em class="emph">himself</em>.

                        at its heart which has motivated the emerging, or at least the notable
                        reinforcement, of what I have called the ontological question about text. It
                        is particularly the question whether hierarchical text encoding grammars
                        such as XML are adequate for the transcription of manuscript source
                        materials that has caused considerable controversy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e489">[3]</a>
                        Opponents of the view often justify their position by invoking a
                        non-hierarchical conception of the nature of text: it is the belief that
                        texts are non-hierarchical which leads them to conclude that hierarchical
                        encoding or markup cannot be the correct method. Paradigmatic cases they
                        appeal to include complex manuscript materials which, so their view, are
                        fundamentally characterized by non-hierarchy or at least multiple structures
                        which overlap with each other. Our philosopher’s <cite class="title italic">Nachlass</cite> could be regarded as such a case in question. Against
                        this kind of argument, in turn, proponents of hierarchical markup
                        grammars — though they grant that overlap and multiple hierarchies exist — have
                        argued in favour of adopting the precisely opposite conception of the nature
                        of text, namely a chiefly hierarchical one. Thus, the fundamental issue is
                        no longer one about “Which is the right text?”, but concerns the ontological
                        nature of text.

                        to it, the view that it is a non-hierarchical object [<a class="ref" href="#schmidt2010">Schmidt 2010</a>, ], justified? And if either of
                        the two is justified, does this lend argumentative support to a hierarchical
                        or a non-hierarchical approach in text encoding? In answering this question
                        more fully I would have to address at least the following two sets of
                        questions. First, can the general assumption according to which texts are
                        either hierarchical or non-hierarchical, put any demands on the structure of
                        any particular markup system? Does the fact that a particular object of
                        encoding is hierarchical, entail the demand that the encoding itself be
                        hierarchical or, if it is non-hierarchical, that the encoding be
                        non-hierarchical? Against the view that it does, one could argue that we
                        ordinarily accept that three-dimensional entities are represented in
                        two-dimensional structures. Similarly, we make use of hierarchical
                        taxonomies for domains that in fact can be regarded as non-hierarchical;
                        and, whilst being fully aware of the general vagueness, context-sensitivity,
                        ambiguity etc. of ordinary language, we nevertheless take advantage of exact
                        grammars, logics, strictly organized thesauri or computational ontologies
                        for their analysis and processing. What, then, is it that makes it
                        unacceptable to use hierarchical markup-languages for non-hierarchical
                        sources, or non-hierarchical markup-languages for hierarchical sources?
                        Secondly, are the assumptions that texts are either hierarchical or
                        non-hierarchical objects themselves justified? On what grounds, and in what
                        sense, can it be said that the nature of text is either of a hierarchical or
                        a non-hierarchical structure?

                        to answer the question whether texts are hierarchical entities, we should
                        first try to find out what sort of entities texts could be on a <em class="emph">general</em> level. This is after all also what Renear and
                        others wanted: To answer the question what text (really) <em class="emph">

                        seems a safe thing to say that writing is an action, and as such it should
                        be possible to describe it in terms of action theory. This implies the
                        application of concepts such as “agent”, “basic action”, “action result”,
                        and others. I would like to suggest the following characteristics of

                        difference is that producing texts is producing documents with meaning, as

                        be performed by machines. Reading as such can equally be performed by
                        machines (namely “reading machines”), but not reading <em class="emph">with understanding</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e584">[4]</a>
                        I would now like to introduce for the rest of this paper the technical term
                        “texting” for the action of producing texts. Let us look at some more
                        differences between writing and texting in terms of action theory:
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="ptext">
                        <ul class="list">
                           <li class="item">First, texting is not a basic action but is co-caused by two other
                              actions, writing and reading. (Or: If you look at the matter as one of
                              spoken communication, the two actions that co-cause texting are speaking
                              and hearing.) 
                           </li>
                           <li class="item">Secondly (and consequently), while the action of writing can be
                              performed by only <em class="emph">one</em> agent, it seems then clear
                              that texting <em class="emph">is</em> performed by more than one agent.
                              One agent is the author, another is the understanding reader (naturally,
                              the author and the reader can coincide in one and the same person).
                              Consequently, texting is, unlike writing can be, not under the sole
                              control of the author alone. Rather, texting evolves through actions
                              that are shared among a multitude of agents. Therefore, when attempting
                              to adequately describe texting, it is vital to include not only the
                              author agent, but also the reader agent.
                           </li>
                           <li class="item">Third, while writing produces a finite and rather stable result
                              (namely documents), texting does not; rather it produces an instable and
                              potentially continuously ongoing, endless and open-ended result. Writing
                              has a clearly determinable beginning and end in time. Texting can have a
                              clearly determinable beginning in time, coinciding with the beginning of
                              the action of writing, but it does not have a clearly determinable end.
                              Now, ontologically speaking: What sort of entities exactly are then the
                              results of texting, namely <em class="emph">texts</em>?
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p19">If we start from a widely accepted tripartite division of what exists into
                        objects, properties and events, it seems to make perfect sense to think of
                        written documents, the products from writing, as <em class="emph">objects</em>. Equally it seems to make perfect sense to conceive of the
                        carriers of written documents — paper, trees, stone, pergament etc. — as
                        objects. More specifically, documents and document carriers are <em class="emph">concrete, material</em> objects. But does the same hold
                        true of texts? Very often the expression “text” is used to mean the same as
                        “document”. However, it is important to note that “text” often also denotes
                        something very different from a document, and that the conditions of
                        identity in the case of text in this sense are not the same as the
                        conditions of identity for documents. This applies for example when we say
                        “The work exists in many drafts and different versions” (one text, many
                        documents), or to any ambiguous sentence, e.g. “John went to the bank,” as well as cases of homonymy and polysemy
                        (one document, many texts). Texts in this sense clearly cannot be
                        concrete objects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e639">[5]</a> Some have suggested
                        that texts are abstract objects (e.g. Renear in [<a class="ref" href="#hockeyetal1999">Hockey et al. 1999</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#huitfeldtetal2012">Huitfeldt et al. 2012</a>]). But there are
                        also some factors which speak against this view, be text now conceived as an
                        abstract object in the sense of a <em class="term">type</em> or as an
                        abstract object in the sense of being an <em class="term">immaterial</em>
                        object.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e673">[6]</a> Consequently, though both “document” and
                        “text” are nouns, and many nouns denote objects, it may be that “text” does
                        not denote an object — or that, to speak with Wittgenstein, the “surface
                        grammar” of “text” misleads us into believing that it denotes an object
                        [<a class="ref" href="#wittgenstein2009">Wittgenstein 2009</a>, §664]). 
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div>
                     <div class="ptext" id="p20">Some of the arguments which speak against the view that texts are some kind
                        of abstract object, are the same arguments which actually support the view
                        that texts may be <em class="term">events</em>. To classify texts as events
                        rather than as abstract objects or a property will at first seem a strange
                        thing to say, but it is merely so because we are used to think of texts in
                        analogy to documents, or even document <em class="term">carriers</em>:
                        manuscripts, books, sheets of paper, computer screens etc. which all belong
                        to the domain of <em class="term">objects</em> rather than events. One of
                        the aspects which speak in favour of the event view is that a text at no
                        single (non-durative) point in time seems to be present in its <em class="emph">entirety</em>–which is a characteristic of events
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kanzian2015">Kanzian 2015</a>, 897]. A
                        consequence from the event view of text is that the locus of a text is
                        temporally and spatially distributed: As any event’s locus is the locus of
                        its <em class="term">bearers</em>, so must then also a text’s locus be the
                        locus of its bearers. The text bearers cannot however only be books or
                        computer screens; these, considered by themselves, are document rather than
                        text bearers. If the event view of text is
                        correct, then not only the document itself must be regarded a text bearer, but also
                        the
                        author and the understanding reader. Thus, the <em class="term">text
                           event</em> will need to be seen as taking place exactly in the
                        geographically and chronologically dispersed interplay between authors,
                        documents and readers. This fits very well with our observation above,
                        namely that texts are shared among and coproduced by authors and readers.
                        One advantage from the event view of texts seems to be that it does,
                        ontologically speaking, not demand more than the following ontologically
                        rather uncontroversial entities: as bearers of the event the concrete object
                        document, the concrete object author, and the concrete object reader, and as
                        event proper the action of (understanding) reading.

                        be actions. Within the group of actions, texts can then further be
                        characterized by being actions which are co-produced by authors and readers,
                        thus <em class="emph">shared</em> actions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e744">[7]</a></div>

                     <div class="ptext" id="p22">In the last couple of paragraphs I have proposed a way of looking at the
                        ontological nature of text which recognizes text as event rather than
                        object, and within the category of event as action, and within the category
                        of action, as shared action. But independent of whether the reader wants to
                        follow me in my proposal to conceive of texts as actions that are
                        co-produced by authors and readers, or rather wants to perceive of texts as
                        abstract objects, or as properties of some kind — the reader will still be
                        able to go along with me in the view that text is something which cannot
                        exist without being sustained by an act of reading with understanding. A
                        text that loses the understanding reader will fall back on pure document
                        level and cease to exist <em class="emph">as a text</em>. This aspect of
                        the relation between document and text can be compared to the relation
                        between music score and music: There is no music unless the music score is
                        played (played at least in one’s mind). Naturally, the document can continue
                        to exist even when the text ceases or pauses its existence. But the <em class="emph">text</em> is for its existence mind-dependent on the
                        reader agent. A “paused” text can resume its existence as soon as the
                        document is processed again in its significatory potential — in short: read
                        with understanding by a reader.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e758">[8]</a> This
                        position at least, I hope, should not be controversial, at least if one
                        agrees with the principle that signs have meaning because they are furnished
                        with meaning by humans, and that reading with understanding is thus meaning
                        and structure <em class="emph">constituting</em> rather than merely meaning
                        and structure depicting — a principle that is treasured by hermeneutics

                        view that reading a document with understanding is constitutive for the
                        meaning of this document, has then also consequences for our conception of
                        what is going on in text encoding.

                        that it is written in ink or pencil, pertains to the first; recording which
                        words it contains or which letters are deleted and which are added, pertains
                        to the second; talking about the document’s meaning and stating that there
                        are implicit references and allusions to a work by another author in the

                        it aims at recording the <em class="emph">text</em> and thus moves on the
                        third level. However, already on the level of recording data about the
                        document carrier, the encoding attributes structure to the source rather
                        than simply depicting a pre-existing structure (D.R. Raymond in [<a class="ref" href="#biggsandhuitfeldt1997">Biggs and Huitfeldt 1997</a>, 358]). In the language of the above suggested event conception of
                        text one could say that the encoder becomes herself inevitably one of the

                     <div class="ptext" id="p24">What are then the implications of our philosophical investigation for our
                        question whether hierarchical or rather <em class="emph">non</em>-hierarchical markup is appropriate for the encoding of texts? I
                        think the main implication is, to make a long story short, that both are
                        equally appropriate. For, following the present argument, what we encode are
                        as much our own signifying text actions as the source (the source “as such”,
                        as one is tempted to say). Transcription is, with Sahle’s words, “a protocol
                        of perception, mapping and interpretation” [<a class="ref" href="#sahle2015">Sahle 2015</a>]. Whether the text itself will be
                        hierarchical or non-hierarchical will therefore depend on <em class="emph">us</em> as encoders. Therefore, both the position holding that markup
                        is to be hierarchical because text itself is hierarchical and the opposed
                        view, can be seen to be in one sense correct, but wrong in another. Both
                        seem to draw their consequences for text encoding on an — at least
                        ontologically — unfounded basis. They are making it sound as though the
                        question would be essentially a matter of finding out which is the right
                        representation of a pre-given structure of text. But “hierarchical” or
                        “non-hierarchical” describe aspects of our active engagement with the source
                        and therefore concern the nature of our own <em class="emph">actions</em>
                        rather than the nature of independent entities. “‘An ‘OHCO structure’ is’, as Dino Buzzetti says, ‘not a model of
                        the text, but a possible model of its expression’”  [<a class="ref" href="#buzzetti2002">Buzzetti 2002</a>, 71]. The OHCO view of
                        text could thus be rephrased to: “Text is a hierarchical <em class="emph">ordering</em> of content objects”. According to Desmond Schmidt,
                        complex manuscript variant structures pose overwhelming challenges for
                        hierarchical markup, and consequently form a primary case for the <em class="emph">non-</em>hierarchical approach (as also for non-embedded
                        markup). However, text variants are, on the background of the argument
                        proposed here, not independent entities that put insurmountable constraints
                        on our mapping acts either. What makes up a text variant is namely already
                        co-constituted by our reading and mapping of the source. With Wittgenstein
                        we could thus say that <em class="emph">both</em> sides of the debate mix
                        sign talk and symbol talk, and that the primary field of text-encoding
                        belongs to the realm of symbols rather than that of signs. A symbol is the
                        sign <em class="emph">with meaning</em>: the sign as <em class="emph">symbolized</em> [<a class="ref" href="#wittgenstein1963">Wittgenstein 1963</a>, 3.32]. Whether to encode a
                        source in hierarchical or non-hierarchical ways is a question of how to
                        map — symbolize — the signs of the source.

                        around? In the end, it can only be our scholarly interests and needs. If we
                        are interested in encoding <em class="emph">document structures</em>, then
                        it may be important to record what we regard as overlapping structures, e.g.
                        overlapping structures at the cross points between sentence or paragraph
                        units on the one hand and page units on the other, through non-hierarchical
                        encoding, or even standoff markup. If we are interested in encoding the

                        points where these writing acts’ manifestations cross, equally may be the
                        thing to choose. But even in these cases, practicing one of the TEI’s
                        recommendations for handling overlap through hierarchical XML may be equally
                        in place.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e901">[11]</a> In any way, it seems problematic to hold that it is
                        the text’s nature, as something independent of us, which requires overlap
                        markup. It is rather the nature of our <em class="emph">representation</em>
                        of the source which requires hierarchical or non-hierarchical markup, thus
                        something which is under our, not the source’s control.

                        adequately transcribe complex primary sources in hierarchical XML, it would
                        be quite mysterious why so many projects manage to encode and edit intricate
                        and multifaceted, so-called overlapping and non-hierarchical handwritten
                        materials with hierarchical XML. They do so in an effective manner, living
                        up to the (still evolving) standards expected for digital scholarly
                        editions. One example is editorial work on the Wittgenstein <cite class="title italic">Nachlass</cite> by the Wittgenstein Archives at the
                        University of Bergen (WAB). It is the ambition of WAB’s XML transcriptions
                        to contain an accurate graphemic record of each single letter that
                        Wittgenstein wrote in the <cite class="title italic">Nachlass</cite>, and of the
                        writing acts it was produced by, or subjected to. This information is
                        converted to “diplomatic” version outputs in HTML which, in short, represent
                        the source on the level of its letters and the author’s writing acts. At the
                        same time, our XML transcriptions also permit to produce “linearized” and
                        “normalized” versions, and make yet other, strongly user-steered outputs
                        produced via “interactive dynamic

                        this. However, at least in my view there is nothing in the <em class="emph">source</em> which requires us to choose the hierarchical XML over a
                        non-hierarchical approach for achieving all this, or a non-hierarchical

                     <blockquote>
                        <p>In this picture of
                           language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a
                           meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for
                           which the word stands. (Wittgenstein 2009: §1) [<a class="ref" href="#wittgenstein2009">Wittgenstein 2009</a>, 1]
                        </p>
                     </blockquote> An analogous observation can
                     be made about the debate on hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical markup. The way in
                     which this debate is largely conducted suggests that the central issue concerns
                     the accurate representation of some mind- and action-independent reality. It is
                     assumed that, if texts are hierarchical, the correct depiction must be
                     hierarchical; if they are non-hierarchical, the correct depiction must be
                     non-hierarchical. According to this picture, text encoding is an act of
                     correlating codes with objects and structures <em class="emph">in and of
                        themselves</em>. But any text action including text
                     encoding is a creative symbolizing action and, thus, already in the realm of
                     symbols. This is nothing out of the ordinary; it is simply what meaningfully
                     engaging with the world looks like on an everyday basis; it is what each of us
                     does all the time, without running into any theoretical difficulties. Moreover,
                     though one sometimes can hear that escaping relativism, and producing encodings
                     and editions that will benefit others (including future generations), requires
                     strict avoidance of interpretation in the domain of encoding, it needs being
                     said that the way of looking at things proposed here does not entail any support
                     to relativism. Rather than worrying about relativism, we simply have to
                     ensure — and all the time work to ensure! — that there is sufficient agreement in
                     our interpretations. Successful communication is not dependent on there being
                     non-interpreted facts, but on there being shared interpretations (or rather,
                     more generally, shared understandings). The TEI substantially helps with
                     that.

                     be regarded as pre-given. Rather, as much as they concern the sources to be
                     edited, studied, translated etc., they equally concern ourselves: as authors,
                     editors, readers and scholars, with our preferences, intentions, and the
                     purposes of our actions. A simple question such as “Should the edition follow
                     the physical, chronological or content order of the written?” is as much about
                     what <em class="emph">we</em> want to do with the source as about the source
                     “as such”. Questions of this kind ask for an engaged <em class="emph">
                        action</em>. Through websites such as WAB’s “Interactive Dynamic
                     Presentation” platform this aspect is put to the fore, and the fact that actions
                     are required, is, at least exemplarily, made explicit. Users of the WAB site can
                     utilize XML transcriptions and XSLT tools as basis for producing text following
                     their own editorial choices. The resulting texts will be shared actions,
                     co-produced by at least the following agents: Ludwig Wittgenstein, WAB’s
                     transcribers and editors, the software authors, the interacting users. The ways
                     in which we talk and argue about text manifests that texts originate in and are
                     carried by understanding and acting human subjects. Texts are mappings of signs
                     onto symbols. Thus, when discussing which of the texts emerging from a rich and
                     complex <cite class="title italic">Nachlass</cite> to choose, or what to identify as a
                     “work” in it, etc., we are discussing, first, how to best map this <cite class="title italic">Nachlass’</cite> significatory potential onto symbols and,
                     secondly, which of the symbolizations to give preference to. If it is true that
                     texts are actions, then it therefore lies in the nature of text-talk that it can
                     be evaluative and normative. For it lies in the nature of talk about actions
                     that it can be evaluative and normative. With the later Wittgenstein, we might
                     say that scholarly talk about “text” typically exhibits a normative <em class="term">grammar</em>. This explains why the editorial issues described
                     in Section 3 indeed are <em class="emph">issues</em>.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">In this paper, I have tried to show that the debate about hierarchical vs.
                     non-hierarchical markup can be resolved by a reflection on the “depth grammar”  [<a class="ref" href="#wittgenstein2009">Wittgenstein 2009</a>, 664] or “logical grammar”  [<a class="ref" href="#wittgenstein1963">Wittgenstein 1963</a>, 3.325] of “text”. This grammar
                     is, due to texts’ specific ontological nature, categorially different from the
                     grammar of “document”. Texts in the sense in which they are different from
                     documents are ontologically difficult entities and may, as I tried to argue for
                     here, not be objects. Writing alone does not produce texts, but documents. It
                     seems however a fact that texts are in their existence dependent on human
                     understanding, and that it is the meaning and structure constituting aspects of
                     document understanding which at the same time make texts something under 
                     <em class="emph">our</em> command and responsibility. Therefore, text encoding
                     is no passive depiction but co-constitutes its subject: It never records the
                     mind-independent state of the source alone; rather, it always also records its
                     own actions of recording, its specific representation of the source. Naturally,
                     this goes also for WAB’s own XML transcriptions of the Wittgenstein <cite class="title italic">Nachlass</cite>: They are no understanding-free depictions of
                     the source, but already the results from precisely acts of understanding. The
                     point that texts, and also transcriptions, result from acts of understanding,
                     does however, as I have tried to explain, not need to involve any sort of
                     unwanted relativism. The fact that it is us as understanding subjects that
                     decide on the structure of texts explains in turn why XML can be such a
                     successful markup system also for the encoding of complex manuscript materials
                     as indeed it is — which it should not be if it were an independent hierarchical or
                     non-hierarchical structure of the source that decides on the success or failure
                     of our encoding. It is only when these central points are neglected that the
                     debate about hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical markup can arise in the first

                     to that conception have to do with the fact that texts have a beginning
                     in time and also change with time and place, while abstract objects in a

                     poststructuralism, phenomenology, hermeneutics, reader-response
                     criticism, linguistic pragmatics and speech act theory as well as
                     semiotics to see an intimate connection between text and event / action,
                     or even to view texts as some kind of event or action. However, one has
                     to pay attention to the fact that each of these schools come with their
                     own specific terminologies and conceptualizations which may not agree
                     with each other, or with the approach taken here. Here, the view that
                     texts are (shared) actions is, undertaken from the perspective of
                     analytic philosophy, more specifically analytic ontology and action theory,
                     although discussing these views in great detail is beyond the scope
                     and space of the current paper.</span></div>

                     with a particular focus on works of art. My view that texts do not exist
                     if they are not produced and maintained as such through <em class="emph">understanding reading</em>, has stronger implications
                     for their mind-dependency than Kanzian’s position. Kanzian holds that
                     artefacts are for their subsistence mind-dependent only in the sense
                     that they need a mind that <em class="emph">can</em>, but does not

                     Wittgenstein’s entire mature philosophy: Nothing is a sign unless it is

                     addresses the level of the document itself; and semantic technologies

                     In this passage, Wittgenstein
                     did <em class="emph">not</em> actually write out the two variants
                     “Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung” and “Allgemeinheit”, as he did with the
                     two variants “brauchen” and “verwenden”. He wrote only
                     “Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung” and subsequently deleted part of it,
