                <p>Is hierarchical XML apt for the encoding of complex manuscript materials? Some
                    scholars have argued that texts are non-hierarchical entities and that XML
                    therefore is inadequate. This paper argues that the nature of text is such that
                    it supports both hierarchical and non-hierarchical representations. The paper
                    distinguishes (1) texts from documents and document carriers, (2) writing from
                    "texting", (3) actions that can be performed by one agent only from actions that
                    require at least two agents to come about (“shared actions”), (4) finite actions
                    from potentially infinitely ongoing actions. Texts are described as potentially
                    infinitely ongoing actions which are co-produced by author and reader agents.
                    This makes texts into entities that are more akin to events than to objects or
                    properties, and shows, moreover, that texts are dependent on human understanding
                    and thus mind-dependent entities. One consequence from this is that text
                    encoding needs to be recognized as an act participating in texting which in turn
                    makes hierarchical XML as apt a markup for “text representation”, or rather: for
                    texting, as non-hierarchical markup. The encoding practices of the Bergen
                    Wittgenstein Archives (WAB) serve as the main touchstone for my discussion.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction</head>

                <p>Amongst the many theoretical questions about text, there is a philosophical, or
                    more specifically, an ontological question. The most general form of this
                    question is perhaps ‘What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> text?’. In Digital
                    Humanities, the issue has partly been focused around the question whether texts
                    are hierarchical or rather non-hierarchical structures. Examples of this
                    discussion include the statement that <cit><quote rend="inline">“text is best
                            represented as an ordered hierarchy of content object (OHCO), because
                            that is what text really is”</quote> (DeRose et al. 1990, 3)<ptr
                            target="#deroseetal1990" loc="3"/></cit>, or, in opposition to it, the
                    statement that <cit><quote rend="inline">“humanists are trying to represent what
                            they all agree are non-hierarchical structures”</quote> (Schmidt 2010,
                            344)<ptr target="#schmidt2010" loc="344"/></cit>. Conflicting lessons
                    for text encoding have been drawn from these two opposed approaches to the
                    question. Some have concluded that the hierarchical markup grammar XML can be
                    regarded as adequate for text encoding, because that is in their view what texts
                    basically are, viz., hierarchical entities. Others reject XML and embedded
                    markup more generally as inadequate, precisely on the basis of the view that
                    texts have, or at least can have, non-hierarchical structures. In this paper, I
                    want to argue that both conclusions have been drawn prematurely due to an
                    erroneous approach to the ontological question about text.</p>
                <p>I shall start with presenting a brief example of philosophical authorship from
                    the last century. A reflection on the editorial history of this example and
                    other writings from the same authorship will lead us to a view into editorial
                    philology and, in particular, <hi rend="italic">digital</hi> editorial
                    philology. It is in this digital context that the question about the ontological
                    nature of text and its consequences for text encoding have most forcefully been
                    asked. I shall attempt to demonstrate that a philosophical reflection on the
                    hermeneutical nature of our text practices not only helps to understand better
                    the question about the ontology of texts, but also to dispel the idea that the
                    nature of text would as such, i.e. as independent from our text practices,
                    dictate either hierarchical or non-hierarchical markup.</p>

                <head>2. Writing</head>


                <p>In July 1931, a philosopher in Cambridge reads Augustine’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Confessiones</hi>. Augustine’s account of how he learned to speak as a
                    child makes a strong impression on him. Our philosopher reads the account at a
                    time when he is struggling with theoretical questions about language and
                    meaning. He therefore is very sensitive to anything that even remotely deals
                    with these things. Augustine’s description seems generally fair and
                    representative of how we think language acquisition works. But our philosopher
                    gets puzzled about a few sentences. Perhaps he draws a line in the margin of the
                    book, to highlight the passages that he finds perplexing. Later, then, he notes
                    down his thoughts in a notebook, recording what he believes was right and what
                    he believes was wrong with the account. Later still he returns to these notes,
                    and develops his ideas into a longer discussion. He develops an entire argument
                    around Augustine’s account. He regards his discussion of Augustine as a way of
                    becoming clearer about his own thought concerning linguistic meaning, and about
                    the role that <hi rend="italic">humans</hi> play in establishing the relation
                    between words and objects. The exact intentions behind Augustine’s original
                    account are of less importance to him now. </p>
                <p>He has the discussion of Augustine, together with many other notes and remarks,
                    typed. The resulting typescript he then cuts into paper slips. The slips are of
                    varying sizes: some contain one remark or even only part of a remark, others
                    contain series of remarks or also an entire page. He collects the slips together
                    with cuttings from other typescripts. Next, he reorganizes the contents of his
                    collection. He inserts additional sheets, with handwritten titles for chapters
                    and subchapters. Soon he has this new arrangement of his remarks typed again,
                    hereby producing a large <hi rend="italic">new</hi> typescript. It contains more
                    than 4,000 remarks—he calls them “Bemerkungen”. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bemerkungen</hi> are typically separated from each other by one or more
                    blank lines. The typescript looks much like an advanced book manuscript. But
                    soon our philosopher starts to make changes, namely adding, deleting,
                    rearranging and revising remarks and sentences in it. In many places, he adds
                    alternative phrasings. Some parts of the typescript he goes through more than
                    once, making changes in pencil, black ink and red ink. The amount of changes and
                    revisions grows larger and larger. The changes now begin to also extend into
                    parallel notebooks and other writing books. Entire new sections are added, some
                    in the margins of the typed pages, others on the typescript’s verso pages, and
                    yet others in separate notebooks. </p>
                <p>About a year later he begins considering the idea of making his discussion of
                    Augustine the beginning of a new book in philosophy, to appear in a parallel
                    German-English edition. About fifteen years earlier he had published the <hi
                        rend="italic">Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung</hi>; this book had given
                    him some status. He now produces a concise summary of his argument about
                    Augustine, making it the beginning of a discussion about small and well-defined
                    samples of language use. These he calls “language games” (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Sprachspiele</hi>), and he intends to make the idea of language games the
                    backbone of his entire new book project.</p>
                <p>Eventually, after ten more years’ hard work of producing many new <hi
                        rend="italic">Bemerkungen</hi> and revising, rearranging, adding and
                    deleting, he has yet another typescript produced that looks ready for the press.
                    The typescript even includes a title (<hi rend="italic">Philosophische
                        Untersuchungen</hi>), a motto and a preface. However, in the remaining five
                    years of his life, our philosopher can never bring himself to finish the work
                    for publication. Two years after his death, in 1953, his friends finally edit
                    and publish it with a parallel translation in English.<note xml:id="ftn1"

                <head>3. Scholarship</head>

                <p>So far I have done nothing but portray a real example of philosophical authorship
                    from the twentieth century. Note that I did not use the word “text” even once. I
                    could have used the word, but I need not have used it. In some places, I could
                    have said “text” instead of “remark” or, in others, instead of “discussion” or
                    “argument” or “book” or “work”. But in all these cases it would have been
                    replaceable. Our author<hi rend="italic">may</hi> sometimes have asked himself:
                    Which text should I choose here? Will I ever finish my text? Is my text good
                    enough? Etc. However, again, the occurrences of the expression “text” in such
                    questions are replaceable with words such as “manuscript”, “book”, “phrasing”,
                    “sequence” or “version”. Regarding the notion of text, our real case example did
                    not seem to pose any special theoretical difficulties. Most importantly, the <hi
                        rend="italic">ontological</hi> question of what text <hi rend="italic"
                        >is</hi>, clearly need not have bothered our <hi rend="italic">author</hi>.
                    For the author the notion of text need not be problematic at all. An author may
                    just write, delete, rearrange, rewrite, compose, and so on. Neither did <hi
                        rend="italic">I </hi>have to be bothered by the notion when telling the
                    story of the example. So, if there is a specific philosophical, ontological
                    issue about text, where does it come in?</p>
                <p>Considering the further development of our philosopher’s story may help to find
                    the answer to our question. Let us first try to locate, with the help of our
                    narrative, the points at which text can become a theoretical issue of <hi
                        rend="italic">any</hi> sort. As this particular tale goes, before he dies,
                    our philosopher appoints three friends who are to manage the publication of his
                    writings. The three find themselves confronted with a huge mass of pages (which
                    they first have to collect from different places), some handwritten, some typed,
                    some bound in notebooks, some on loose sheets, some in orderly dossiers. This is
                    now standardly referred to as our philosopher’s “Nachlass”. For some of the
                    books and pieces that they decide to edit from this <hi rend="italic"

                    publications, however, they have to make selections and combinations on both
                    large and small scales, and need to do some substantial editing. They have to
                    decide what to choose for publication; which version to use; how to arrange it;
                    how many and which of our author’s variant phrasings to include; whether to use
                    also variants added in other manuscripts; whether to obey all his instructions
                    or only those that they find conducive; whether always to omit what our
                    philosopher himself had deleted; whether to stick to at least some of his
                    idiosyncratic style and punctuation; whether, and how much, to expand on his
                    elliptic references to either his own ideas or also the ideas and works of
                    others; how much to bother the reader with information about the character of
                    the original <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> source; etc. etc. </p>
                <p>If not for our author, text now seems to have become an issue at least for his
                    editors, or for any editors of a <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> such as
                    Wittgenstein’s. In the processes of editorial decision-making, such editors will
                    often refer to precisely this thing, the text, and find themselves confronted
                    with issues of so-called “<hi rend="italic">textual</hi> criticism”. We can
                    imagine them discussing and debating these issues both amongst themselves and
                    with the users of their editions. Both the editors and their critics will argue
                    for their respective positions by reference to what they call “the text”; and
                    this invocation of the text, while the word itself often seems to refer to
                    different things for the different sides, always seems to lend their respective
                    standpoints and arguments strength and significance. Surely, for many of the
                    arising disputes, the expression “text” will again be replaceable by some other
                    words, e.g. “source”. In several cases, however, the expression clearly carries
                    something which is not contained in those other expressions, something like the
                    marker of a norm or standard, or of the right interpretation, and “the text” is
                    precisely the expression to be used.</p>
                <p>Let us complete the story with some perceptions and questions from the readers’
                    side. The Wittgenstein readers asked: Have we received all the text, or are
                    parts missing? Is the text displayed in the correct sequence? Does it contain
                    transcription errors? Does the edition maybe mislead me to adopt a wrong
                    interpretation? Have I been given the right text? Have I been given the text as
                    it was intended by the author? To what extent is the text authorized by its
                    author Ludwig Wittgenstein? Does the edited text correspond to the original? The
                    “textual” situation in the Wittgenstein <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> itself
                    is often far from clear. The edited text could be something that physically
                    never existed before, or no longer existed—thus, was something that had to be
                    (re)constructed. Or, the editors came at different times to different
                    conclusions about what “the text” was referring to, and for a few items
                    different editions, as also different translations, were produced. Readers would
                    again ask: Which is the text / translation I should use for my
                    interpretation?</p>
                <p>Now, it is true that these questions and issues bring us closer to theoretical
                    discourse about text. But none of them necessarily brings us to the <hi
                        rend="italic">ontological</hi> question about <hi rend="italic">what text
                        is</hi>. Moreover, there are disciplines that not only treat these questions
                    and issues, but also provide answers and solutions to them. I think here in
                    particular of editorial philology, and, of course, especially digital<hi
                        rend="italic"> </hi>editorial philology. In the following, I will first
                    stress that digital editorial philology provides solutions to the
                    above-mentioned issues and questions. But in this context we will notice that
                    the very same disciplines that provide the solutions, also in fact seem to give
                    rise to our ontological question about text.<note xml:id="ftn2" place="end"

                <p>Methods of textual criticism have been developed for many purposes, including for
                    finding solutions to exactly the kind of issues and questions brought up in the
                    previous section. Twentieth-century textual criticism has improved these methods
                    further through the application of digital techniques. For instance, while the
                    practice of producing editions comprising both facsimiles and transcriptions,
                    ranging from ultra-diplomatic to so-called “students” versions, has already
                    existed in the pre-digital age, the introduction of digital techniques has made
                    producing such editions easier, cheaper and more efficient. But the digital
                    medium has not only provided improved ways of implementing solutions that had
                    already existed before—it has furthermore brought <hi rend="italic">new</hi>
                    solutions and possibilities. XML-based user-steered or <cit><quote rend="inline"

                    text archives is <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> new, that is, a genuine
                    achievement of digital editorial philology, and it offers something that had not
                    been possible before.</p>
                <p>Many of the innovations are due to the discipline of text encoding (<cit>TEI
                            2007<ptr target="#tei2007" loc=""/></cit>; <cit>Hockey 2000: ch.3<ptr
                            target="#hockey2000" loc="ch.3"/></cit>). Text encoding enables us to
                    deal with editorial challenges such as the issues from the previous section by,
                    first, separating representation or transcription matters from presentation
                    matters, and, second, by serving the different interests we might have in
                    editing a source, by explicitly addressing them through different groups of
                    codes (<cit>Huitfeldt 1994<ptr target="#huitfeldt1994" loc=""/></cit>;
                        <cit>Pichler 1995<ptr target="#pichler1995" loc=""/></cit>). For example,
                    while one group of codes may record a manuscript’s chronological sequence,
                    another one can take care of the physical sequence, and a third one of a
                    specific sequence in content. Subsequently, the three encodings can be invoked
                    independently of each other, or also in various combinations, just as required
                    by individual users’ research needs. While pre-digital book editing, if it had
                    not been for certain material restrictions, could have delivered some of the
                    same possibilities, it could never have delivered the same degree of <hi
                        rend="italic">interaction</hi> and <hi rend="italic">transparency</hi> which
                    characterizes digital editorial philology that is based on text encoding. In
                    traditional editing, the editor and publisher decide how the source is
                    presented, while the user mostly tends to remain in a purely passive role. The
                    typical user of traditional editions merely receives what experts have prepared
                    for her and is rarely in a position to adequately verify the edition received.
                    In contrast to this, with digital editing and publishing driven by text
                    encoding, users are no longer dependent, so-to-say purely on the basis of good
                    faith, on the decisions made by editors. Instead they are now able to check
                    editorial decisions and, moreover, with interactive dynamic presentation tools
                    to also complement the experts’ editing by producing alternative filterings and
                    presentations of the source materials. Editorial philology today can
                    satisfactorily address most of the issues about text brought up in the previous
                    section. We can now make available all versions of a work, all variants of
                    alternative phrasings, all editorial interpretations of a passage—in principle
                    all options between which editors before had to choose due to material
                    restrictions. The user of the editions will still have questions: “Which of the
                    many versions made available to me is the one I shall use?” But this was a
                    question also for our Cambridge author <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>.</p>
                <p>These achievements of digital editorial philology have become possible through
                        <hi rend="italic">text encoding</hi>. At the same time, it is also <hi
                        rend="italic">precisely</hi> scholars of text encoding who have forcefully
                    embarked on the <hi rend="italic">ontological</hi> question “What is text?”.

                        at its heart which has motivated the emerging, or at least the notable

                        is particularly the question whether hierarchical text encoding grammars
                        such as XML are adequate for the transcription of manuscript source
                        materials that has caused considerable controversy.<note xml:id="ftn3"

                        Opponents of the view often justify their position by invoking a
                        non-hierarchical conception of the nature of text: it is the belief that
                        texts are non-hierarchical which leads them to conclude that hierarchical
                        encoding or markup cannot be the correct method. Paradigmatic cases they
                        appeal to include complex manuscript materials which, so their view, are
                        fundamentally characterized by non-hierarchy or at least multiple structures
                        which overlap with each other. Our philosopher’s <hi rend="italic"
                            >Nachlass</hi> could be regarded as such a case in question. Against
                        this kind of argument, in turn, proponents of hierarchical markup
                        grammars—though they grant that overlap and multiple hierarchies exist—have
                        argued in favour of adopting the precisely opposite conception of the nature
                        of text, namely a chiefly hierarchical one. Thus, the fundamental issue is
                        no longer one about “Which is the right text?”, but concerns the ontological
                        nature of text. </p>
                    <p>But is the view that text is a hierarchical object (<cit>DeRose et al.
                                1990<ptr target="#deroseetal1990" loc=""/></cit>) or, in opposition
                        to it, the view that it is a non-hierarchical object (<cit>Schmidt 2010<ptr
                                target="#schmidt2010" loc=""/></cit>), justified? And if either of
                        the two is justified, does this lend argumentative support to a hierarchical
                        or a non-hierarchical approach in text encoding? In answering this question
                        more fully I would have to address at least the following two sets of
                        questions. First, can the general assumption according to which texts are
                        either hierarchical or non-hierarchical, put any demands on the structure of
                        any particular markup system? Does the fact that a particular object of
                        encoding is hierarchical, entail the demand that the encoding itself be
                        hierarchical or, if it is non-hierarchical, that the encoding be
                        non-hierarchical? Against the view that it does, one could argue that we
                        ordinarily accept that three-dimensional entities are represented in
                        two-dimensional structures. Similarly, we make use of hierarchical
                        taxonomies for domains that in fact can be regarded as non-hierarchical;
                        and, whilst being fully aware of the general vagueness, context-sensitivity,
                        ambiguity etc. of ordinary language, we nevertheless take advantage of exact
                        grammars, logics, strictly organized thesauri or computational ontologies
                        for their analysis and processing. What, then, is it that makes it
                        unacceptable to use hierarchical markup-languages for non-hierarchical
                        sources, or non-hierarchical markup-languages for hierarchical sources?
                        Secondly, are the assumptions that texts are either hierarchical or
                        non-hierarchical objects themselves justified? On what grounds, and in what
                        sense, can it be said that the nature of text is either of a hierarchical or
                        a non-hierarchical structure?</p>

                    <p>In this paper, I have a direct focus on thesecond set of questions, but will
                        provide at least a partial answer also to the first set of questions. Now,
                        to answer the question whether texts are hierarchical entities, we should
                        first try to find out what sort of entities texts could be on a <hi
                            rend="italic">general</hi> level. This is after all also what Renear and
                        others wanted: To answer the question what text (really)<hi rend="italic">
                            is</hi>. But this ontological question, in turn, should first bring us
                        back to the issue of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>. What is writing? It
                        seems a safe thing to say that writing is an action, and as such it should
                        be possible to describe it in terms of action theory. This implies the
                        application of concepts such as “agent”, “basic action”, “action result”,
                        and others. I would like to suggest the following characteristics of
                        writing:</p>
                    
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>First: Writing is, at least in terms of its physical movements, a
                            basic action (<cit>Danto 1963, 435f<ptr target="#danto1963" loc="435f"
                                /></cit>) and thus not caused by other actions.</item>
                        <item>Second: Writing produces a finite action result, the written. The
                            written is writing’s intended result; we call it <hi rend="italic"
                                >document</hi>. </item>
                        <item>Third: Writing does not need more than <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                            agent.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It seems important to appreciate the fact that producing documents, writing,
                        is not the same as producing texts, and thus, to distinguish the action of
                        producing documents from the action of producing texts. One important
                        difference is that producing texts is producing documents with meaning, as
                        we normally do when we write, or also furnishing documents with meaning, as
                        we do when we read with understanding. Writing on the other hand does not
                            <hi rend="italic">need</hi> to produce meaningful documents and can also
                        be performed by machines. Reading as such can equally be performed by
                        machines (namely “reading machines”), but not reading <hi rend="italic"

                        I would now like to introduce for the rest of this paper the technical term
                        “texting” for the action of producing texts. Let us look at some more
                        differences between writing and texting in terms of action theory:</p>
                    <list type="unordered">
                        <item>First, texting is not a basic action but is co-caused by two other
                            actions, writing and reading. (Or: If you look at the matter as one of
                            spoken communication, the two actions that co-cause texting are speaking
                            and hearing.) </item>
                        <item>Secondly (and consequently), while the action of writing can be
                            performed by only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> agent, it seems then clear
                            that texting <hi rend="italic">is</hi> performed by more than one agent.
                            One agent is the author, another is the understanding reader (naturally,
                            the author and the reader can coincide in one and the same person).
                            Consequently, texting is, unlike writing can be, not under the sole
                            control of the author alone. Rather, texting evolves through actions
                            that are shared among a multitude of agents. Therefore, when attempting
                            to adequately describe texting, it is vital to include not only the
                            author agent, but also the reader agent.</item>
                        <item>Third, while writing produces a finite and rather stable result
                            (namely documents), texting does not; rather it produces an instable and
                            potentially continuously ongoing, endless and open-ended result. Writing
                            has a clearly determinable beginning and end in time. Texting can have a
                            clearly determinable beginning in time, coinciding with the beginning of
                            the action of writing, but it does not have a clearly determinable end.
                            Now, ontologically speaking: What sort of entities exactly are then the
                            results of texting, namely <hi rend="italic">texts</hi>?</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>If we start from a widely accepted tripartite division of what exists into
                        objects, properties and events, it seems to make perfect sense to think of
                        written documents, the products from writing, as <hi rend="italic"
                            >objects</hi>. Equally it seems to make perfect sense to conceive of the
                        carriers of written documents—paper, trees, stone, pergament etc.—as
                        objects. More specifically, documents and document carriers are <hi
                            rend="italic">concrete, material</hi> objects. But does the same hold
                        true of texts? Very often the expression “text” is used to mean the same as
                        “document”. However, it is important to note that “text” often also denotes
                        something very different from a document, and that the conditions of
                        identity in the case of text in this sense are not the same as the
                        conditions of identity for documents. This applies for example when we say
                        “The work exists in many drafts and different versions” (one text, many
                        documents), or to any ambiguous sentence, e.g. “<hi
                            rend="background-color(#ffffff)">John went to the bank”, as </hi><hi
                            rend="background-color(#ffffff)">well as cases of homonymy and polysemy
                            (one document, many texts).</hi> Texts in this sense clearly cannot be
                        concrete objects.<note xml:id="ftn5" place="end" n="5"> Some may object that
                            we frequently use “text” and “document” interchangeably and that the
                            distinction between “text” in the sense of document and “text” in a
                            sense in which it is very different from documents and document
                            carriers, is counterintuitive and goes against standard usage of the
                            expression. However, not only is it generally accepted that words can
                            have a variety of different uses, and from a philosophical perspective
                            defendable that one distinguishes between the surface and the depth
                            grammar of our concepts and expressions, but also that there is a <hi
                                rend="italic">categorial</hi> distinction between document and text
                            is moreover a view held by many digital humanists and scholars of
                            textual criticism (see for example Renear in <cit>Hockey et al. 1999<ptr
                                    target="#hockeyetal1999" loc=""/></cit> and <cit>Gabler 2012<ptr
                                    target="#gabler2012" loc=""/></cit>).</note> Some have suggested
                        that texts are abstract objects (e.g. Renear in <cit>Hockey et al. 1999<ptr
                                target="#hockeyetal1999" loc=""/></cit>; <cit>Huitfeldt et al.
                                2012<ptr target="#huitfeldtetal2012" loc=""/></cit>). But there are
                        also some factors which speak against this view, be text now conceived as an
                        abstract object in the sense of a <hi rend="italic">type</hi> or as an
                        abstract object in the sense of being an <hi rend="italic">immaterial</hi>
                            object.<note xml:id="ftn6" place="end" n="6"> Some of the challenges
                            that conceptions of text as abstract object have to face have been
                            addressed by philosophical critiques of the FRBR (Functional
                            Requirements for Bibliographic Records, <cit>IFLA 1998<ptr
                                    target="#ifla1998" loc=""/></cit>) ontology which conceives text
                            “works”, “expressions” and “manifestations” as<hi rend="italic"
                                >types</hi> (see e.g. <cit>Renear and Dubin 2007<ptr
                                    target="#renearanddubin2007" loc=""/></cit>). Other challenges
                            to that conception have to do with the fact that texts have a beginning
                            in time and also change with time and place, while abstract objects in a
                            standard sense do not.</note> Consequently, though both “document” and
                        “text” are nouns, and many nouns denote objects, it may be that “text” does
                        not denote an object—or that, to speak with Wittgenstein, the “surface
                        grammar” of “text” misleads us into believing that it denotes an object
                            (<cit>Wittgenstein 2009: §664<ptr target="#wittgenstein2009" loc="664"
                            /></cit>). </p>
                    <p>Some of the arguments which speak against the view that texts are some kind
                        of abstract object, are the same arguments which actually support the view
                        that texts may be <hi rend="italic">events</hi>. To classify texts as events
                        rather than as abstract objects or a property will at first seem a strange
                        thing to say, but it is merely so because we are used to think of texts in
                        analogy to documents, or even document <hi rend="italic">carriers</hi>:
                        manuscripts, books, sheets of paper, computer screens etc. which all belong
                        to the domain of <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> rather than events. One of
                        the aspects which speak in favour of the event view is that a text at no
                        single (non-durative) point in time seems to be present in its <hi
                            rend="italic">entirety</hi>–which is a characteristic of events
                            (<cit>Kanzian 2015, 897<ptr target="#kanzian2015" loc="897"/></cit>). A
                        consequence from the event view of text is that the locus of a text is
                        temporally and spatially distributed: As any event’s locus is the locus of
                        its <hi rend="italic">bearers</hi>, so must then also a text’s locus be the
                        locus of its bearers. The text bearers cannot however only be books or
                        computer screens; these, considered by themselves, are document rather than
                            text<hi rend="italic"> </hi>bearers. If the event view of text is
                        correct, then not only the document itself must be regarded a<hi
                            rend="italic"> </hi>text<hi rend="italic"> </hi>bearer, but also the
                        author and the understanding reader. Thus, the <hi rend="italic">text
                            event</hi> will need to be seen as taking place exactly in the
                        geographically and chronologically dispersed interplay between authors,
                        documents and readers. This fits very well with our observation above,
                        namely that texts are shared among and coproduced by authors and readers.
                        One advantage from the event view of texts seems to be that it does,
                        ontologically speaking, not demand more than the following ontologically
                        rather uncontroversial entities: as bearers of the event the concrete object
                        document, the concrete object author, and the concrete object reader, and as
                        event proper the action of (understanding) reading.</p>
                    <p>This implies that it not only makes sense to conceive of texts as events, but
                        indeed events of a special kind, namely <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>.
                        Thus, texts not only seem to be produced by actions—they seem themselves to
                        be actions. Within the group of actions, texts can then further be
                        characterized by being actions which are co-produced by authors and readers,
                        thus <hi rend="italic">shared</hi> actions.<note xml:id="ftn7" place="end"
                            n="7"> There is a long tradition in twentieth century literary theory,
                            poststructuralism, phenomenology, hermeneutics, reader-response
                            criticism, linguistic pragmatics and speech act theory as well as
                            semiotics to see an intimate connection between text and event / action,
                            or even to view texts as some kind of event or action. However, one has
                            to pay attention to the fact that each of these schools come with their
                            own specific terminologies and conceptualizations which may not agree
                            with each other, or with the approach taken here. Here, the view that
                            texts are (shared) actions is, undertaken from the perspective of
                            analytic philosophy, more specifically analytic ontology and action<hi

                    <p>In the last couple of paragraphs I have proposed a way of looking at the
                        ontological nature of text which recognizes text as event rather than
                        object, and within the category of event as action, and within the category
                        of action, as shared action. But independent of whether the reader wants to
                        follow me in my proposal to conceive of texts as actions that are
                        co-produced by authors and readers, or rather wants to perceive of texts as
                        abstract objects, or as properties of some kind—the reader will still be
                        able to go along with me in the view that text is something which cannot
                        exist without being sustained by an act of reading with understanding. A
                        text that loses the understanding reader will fall back on pure document
                        level and cease to exist <hi rend="italic">as a text</hi>. This aspect of
                        the relation between document and text can be compared to the relation
                        between music score and music: There is no music unless the music score is
                        played (played at least in one’s mind). Naturally, the document can continue
                        to exist even when the text ceases or pauses its existence. But the <hi
                            rend="italic">text</hi> is for its existence mind-dependent on the
                        reader agent. A “paused” text can resume its existence as soon as the
                        document is processed again in its significatory potential—in short: read
                        with understanding by a reader.<note xml:id="ftn8" place="end" n="8"> The

                            for their mind-dependency than Kanzian’s position. Kanzian holds that

                            Wittgenstein’s entire mature philosophy: Nothing is a sign unless it is
                            understood (and practiced) as a sign by a human.</note> However, the
                        view that reading a document with understanding is constitutive for the
                        meaning of this document, has then also consequences for our conception of
                        what is going on in text encoding.</p>

                    <p>Text encoding can record data about the document carrier, the document as
                        well as the text. Saying that the source is a notebook or a typescript or
                        that it is written in ink or pencil, pertains to the first; recording which
                        words it contains or which letters are deleted and which are added, pertains
                        to the second; talking about the document’s meaning and stating that there
                        are implicit references and allusions to a work by another author in the
                        document, pertains to the third.<note xml:id="ftn10" place="end" n="10">
                            Also the term “text technology” (cf. “TEXT Technology: the journal of
                            computer text processing”<ptr
                                target="https://texttechnology.humanities.mcmaster.ca/home.html"/>)
                            can be applied on all three levels, thus using “text” in a wide sense.
                            Preservation methods, for example, deal with the document carrier; OCR
                            addresses the level of the document itself; and semantic technologies
                            again refer to the level of text in the narrow sense.</note> On whatever
                        level text encoding moves, it will always also record data about the
                        encoder’s engagement with the source. This becomes particularly clear where
                        it aims at recording the <hi rend="italic">text</hi> and thus moves on the
                        third level. However, already on the level of recording data about the
                        document carrier, the encoding attributes structure to the source rather
                        than simply depicting a pre-existing structure (D.R. Raymond in <cit>Biggs
                            and Huitfeldt 1997, 358<ptr target="#biggsandhuitfeldt1997" loc="358"
                            /></cit>). In the language of the above suggested event conception of
                        text one could say that the encoder becomes herself inevitably one of the
                            <hi rend="italic">bearers</hi> of the text.</p>
                    <p>What are then the implications of our philosophical investigation for our
                        question whether hierarchical or rather <hi rend="italic"
                        >non</hi>-hierarchical markup is appropriate for the encoding of texts? I
                        think the main implication is, to make a long story short, that both are
                        equally appropriate. For, following the present argument, what we encode are
                        as much our own signifying text actions as the source (the source “as such”,
                        as one is tempted to say). Transcription is, with Sahle’s words, “a protocol
                        of perception, mapping and interpretation” (<cit>Sahle 2015<ptr
                                target="#sahle2015" loc=""/></cit>). Whether the text itself will be
                        hierarchical or non-hierarchical will therefore depend on <hi rend="italic"
                            >us</hi> as encoders. Therefore, both the position holding that markup
                        is to be hierarchical because text itself is hierarchical and the opposed
                        view, can be seen to be in one sense correct, but wrong in another. Both
                        seem to draw their consequences for text encoding on an—at least
                        ontologically—unfounded basis. They are making it sound as though the
                        question would be essentially a matter of finding out which is the right
                        representation of a pre-given structure of text. But “hierarchical” or
                        “non-hierarchical” describe aspects of our active engagement with the source
                        and therefore concern the nature of our own <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>
                        rather than the nature of independent entities. <cit><quote rend="inline"
                                >“An ‘OHCO structure’ is”, as Dino Buzzetti says, “not a model of
                                the text, but a possible model of its expression.”</quote> (Buzzetti
                            2002, 71)<ptr target="#buzzetti2002" loc="71"/></cit> The OHCO view of
                        text could thus be rephrased to: “Text is a hierarchical <hi rend="italic"
                            >ordering</hi> of content objects”. According to Desmond Schmidt,
                        complex manuscript variant structures pose overwhelming challenges for
                        hierarchical markup, and consequently form a primary case for the <hi
                            rend="italic">non-</hi>hierarchical approach (as also for non-embedded
                        markup). However, text variants are, on the background of the argument
                        proposed here, not independent entities that put insurmountable constraints
                        on our mapping acts either. What makes up a text variant is namely already
                        co-constituted by our reading and mapping of the source. With Wittgenstein
                        we could thus say that <hi rend="italic">both</hi> sides of the debate mix
                        sign talk and symbol talk, and that the primary field of text-encoding
                        belongs to the realm of symbols rather than that of signs. A symbol is the
                        sign <hi rend="italic">with meaning</hi>: the sign as <hi rend="italic"
                            >symbolized</hi> (<cit>Wittgenstein 1963, 3.32<ptr
                                target="#wittgenstein1963" loc="3.32"/></cit>). Whether to encode a
                        source in hierarchical or non-hierarchical ways is a question of how to
                        map—symbolize—the signs of the source. </p>
                    <p>What could, or rather: what <hi rend="italic">should</hi> then bring us to
                        encode hierarchically rather than non-hierarchically, or the other way
                        around? In the end, it can only be our scholarly interests and needs. If we
                        are interested in encoding <hi rend="italic">document structures</hi>, then
                        it may be important to record what we regard as overlapping structures, e.g.
                        overlapping structures at the cross points between sentence or paragraph
                        units on the one hand and page units on the other, through non-hierarchical
                        encoding, or even standoff markup. If we are interested in encoding the
                        sequence of (as such: genetically linear) <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">acts</hi>, a markup system permitting for recording the
                        points where these writing acts’ manifestations cross, equally may be the
                        thing to choose. But even in these cases, practicing one of the TEI’s
                        recommendations for handling overlap through hierarchical XML may be equally
                        in place.<note xml:id="ftn11" place="end" n="11"><p> The string “The <hi

                        the text’s nature, as something independent of us, which requires overlap
                        markup. It is rather the nature of our <hi rend="italic">representation</hi>
                        of the source which requires hierarchical or non-hierarchical markup, thus
                        something which is under our, not the source’s control.</p>
                    <p>If this wasn’t true, and consequently: if it wasn’t true that we can
                        adequately transcribe complex primary sources in hierarchical XML, it would
                        be quite mysterious why so many projects manage to encode and edit intricate
                        and multifaceted, so-called overlapping and non-hierarchical handwritten
                        materials with hierarchical XML. They do so in an effective manner, living
                        up to the (still evolving) standards expected for digital scholarly
                        editions. One example is editorial work on the Wittgenstein <hi
                            rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> by the Wittgenstein Archives at the
                        University of Bergen (WAB). It is the ambition of WAB’s XML transcriptions
                        to contain an accurate graphemic record of each single letter that
                        Wittgenstein wrote in the <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi>, and of the
                        writing acts it was produced by, or subjected to. This information is
                        converted to “diplomatic” version outputs in HTML which, in short, represent
                        the source on the level of its letters and the author’s writing acts. At the
                        same time, our XML transcriptions also permit to produce “linearized” and
                        “normalized” versions, and make yet other, strongly user-steered outputs
                        produced via <cit><quote rend="inline">“interactive dynamic

                            <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> is the abundance of, partly rather
                        complicated, text variance. Each of the around 65,000 occurrences is at WAB

                        other formats possible. It is <hi rend="italic">XML</hi> that permits all
                        this. However, at least in my view there is nothing in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >source</hi> which requires us to choose the hierarchical XML over a
                        non-hierarchical approach for achieving all this, or a non-hierarchical

                <head>6. Conclusion</head>

                <p>The version of the comment on Augustine’s account of language acquisition that
                    our Cambridge philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, eventually ended up with,
                    includes the following passage: <cit><quote rend="block">In this picture of
                            language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a
                            meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for
                            which the word stands.</quote> (Wittgenstein 2009: §1)<ptr
                            target="#wittgenstein2009" loc="1"/></cit> An analogous observation can
                    be made about the debate on hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical markup. The way in
                    which this debate is largely conducted suggests that the central issue concerns
                    the accurate representation of some mind- and action-independent reality. It is
                    assumed that, if texts are hierarchical, the correct depiction must be
                    hierarchical; if they are non-hierarchical, the correct depiction must be
                    non-hierarchical. According to this picture, text encoding is an act of
                    correlating codes with objects and structures <hi rend="italic">in and of
                        themselves</hi>. But any<hi rend="italic"> </hi>text action including text
                    encoding is a creative symbolizing action and, thus, already in the realm of
                    symbols. This is nothing out of the ordinary; it is simply what meaningfully
                    engaging with the world looks like on an everyday basis; it is what each of us
                    does all the time, without running into any theoretical difficulties. Moreover,
                    though one sometimes can hear that escaping relativism, and producing encodings
                    and editions that will benefit others (including future generations), requires
                    strict avoidance of interpretation in the domain of encoding, it needs being
                    said that the way of looking at things proposed here does not entail any support
                    to relativism. Rather than worrying about relativism, we simply have to
                    ensure—and all the time work to ensure!—that there is sufficient agreement in
                    our interpretations. Successful communication is not dependent on there being
                    non-interpreted facts, but on there being shared interpretations (or rather,
                    more generally, shared understandings). The TEI substantially helps with
                    that.</p>
                <p>The issues from Section 3, as we are now in a position to appreciate, are not to
                    be regarded as pre-given. Rather, as much as they concern the sources to be
                    edited, studied, translated etc., they equally concern ourselves: as authors,
                    editors, readers and scholars, with our preferences, intentions, and the
                    purposes of our actions. A simple question such as “Should the edition follow
                    the physical, chronological or content order of the written?” is as much about
                    what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> want to do with the source as about the source
                    “as such”. Questions of this kind ask for an engaged <hi rend="italic"
                        >action</hi>. Through websites such as WAB’s “Interactive Dynamic
                    Presentation” platform this aspect is put to the fore, and the fact that actions
                    are required, is, at least exemplarily, made explicit. Users of the WAB site can
                    utilize XML transcriptions and XSLT tools as basis for producing text following
                    their own editorial choices. The resulting texts will be shared actions,
                    co-produced by at least the following agents: Ludwig Wittgenstein, WAB’s
                    transcribers and editors, the software authors, the interacting users. The ways
                    in which we talk and argue about text manifests that texts originate in and are
                    carried by understanding and acting human subjects. Texts are mappings of signs
                    onto symbols. Thus, when discussing which of the texts emerging from a rich and
                    complex <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> to choose, or what to identify as a
                    “work” in it, etc., we are discussing, first, how to best map this <hi
                        rend="italic">Nachlass</hi>’ significatory potential onto symbols and,
                    secondly, which of the symbolizations to give preference to. If it is true that
                    texts are actions, then it therefore lies in the nature of text-talk that it can
                    be evaluative and normative. For it lies in the nature of talk about actions
                    that it can be evaluative and normative. With the later Wittgenstein, we might
                    say that scholarly talk about “text” typically exhibits a normative <hi
                        rend="italic">grammar</hi>. This explains why the editorial issues described
                    in Section 3 indeed are <hi rend="italic">issues</hi>.</p>
                <p>In this paper, I have tried to show that the debate about hierarchical vs.
                    non-hierarchical markup can be resolved by a reflection on the <cit><quote
                            rend="inline">“depth grammar”</quote> (Wittgenstein 2009: §664)<ptr
                            target="#wittgenstein2009" loc="664"/></cit> or <cit><quote

                            target="#wittgenstein1963" loc="3.325"/></cit> of “text”. This grammar
                    is, due to texts’ specific ontological nature, categorially different from the
                    grammar of “document”. Texts in the sense in which they are different from
                    documents are ontologically difficult entities and may, as I tried to argue for
                    here, not be objects. Writing alone does not produce texts, but documents. It
                    seems however a fact that texts are in their existence dependent on human
                    understanding, and that it is the meaning and structure constituting aspects of
                    document understanding which at the same time make texts something under <hi
                        rend="italic">our</hi> command and responsibility. Therefore, text encoding
                    is no passive depiction but co-constitutes its subject: It never records the
                    mind-independent state of the source alone; rather, it always also records its
                    own actions of recording, its specific representation of the source. Naturally,
                    this goes also for WAB’s own XML transcriptions of the Wittgenstein <hi
                        rend="italic">Nachlass</hi>: They are no understanding-free depictions of
                    the source, but already the results from precisely acts of understanding. The
                    point that texts, and also transcriptions, result from acts of understanding,
                    does however, as I have tried to explain, not need to involve any sort of
                    unwanted relativism. The fact that it is us as understanding subjects that
                    decide on the structure of texts explains in turn why XML can be such a
                    successful markup system also for the encoding of complex manuscript materials
                    as indeed it is—which it should not be if it were an independent hierarchical or
                    non-hierarchical structure of the source that decides on the success or failure
                    of our encoding. It is only when these central points are neglected that the
                    debate about hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical markup can arise in the first
                        place.<note xml:id="ftn13" place="end" n="13"><p> I am indebted to many
