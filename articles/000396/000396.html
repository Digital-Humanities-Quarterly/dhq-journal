                  <div class="ptext" id="p1"> Digital technology is transforming the assemblage and dissemination of
                     historical information. Museums, libraries, archives, and universities
                     increasingly modify their digital research infrastructures in order to make data
                     open and available (see [<a class="ref" href="#crane2009">Crane, Seales, and Terras 2009</a>]; <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#smithies2013">#smithies2013</a></span>; [<a class="ref" href="#terras2013">Terras, Nyhan, and Vanhoutte 2013</a>]; cf [<a class="ref" href="#foka2017">Foka et al. 2017</a>]). The imminent
                     assessment and representation of historical data has admittedly challenged the
                     boundaries of historical knowledge and generated new research questions [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#foka2016">Foka and Arvidsson 2016</a>]. The process of reconstructing, visualizing and
                     rendering historical data has equally developed together with technology <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#westin2018">#westin2018</a></span>. This is the case in both academic and heritage
                     contexts and in less immediatedly obvious popular uses, such as the increasingly
                     significant presence and use of history within videogames [<a class="ref" href="#chapman2016">Chapman 2016</a>]. Regardless of specific context, as this collection
                     of articles shows, the process of digitally capturing and representing
                     historical data is often analogous to and determined by the digital platform
                     used.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> Scientific visualisation emerged in the fifteenth century as an important method
                     through which to record, to transport findings by turning them into inscriptions
                     that could be then shared and analysed [<a class="ref" href="#latour1990">Latour 1990</a>, 6].
                     Digitally reconstructing is the active part of what has been termed as a
                     “knowledge representation”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#favro2006">Favro 2006</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#dunn2012">Dunn et al. 2012</a>]. This is in effect “a visual manifestation of the physical and digital
                     archive documentation, and a process of knowledge acquisition and
                     evaluation”, with visualizations and reconstructions composing a
                     research method and a series of questions - a process of extracting information
                     while simultaneously developing a model [<a class="ref" href="#westin2017">Westin and Claesson 2017</a>, 116–129]. Reconstructions are occasionally “frowned upon as inherently
                     inauthentic imitations of real monuments, i.e those that have survived
                     the test of time”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#silberman2015">Silberman 2015</a>, 2] (cf [<a class="ref" href="#westin2017">Westin and Claesson 2017</a>, 116–129]). While the ocularcentric
                     tradition of visual cues is dominant within humanities research [<a class="ref" href="#howes2005">Howes 2005</a>, 14]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#classen1997">Classen 1997</a>, 401–12] more immersive platforms open up new
                     sensory possibilities. It is commonly believed that intangible artefacts, such
                     as dancing or soundscapes for example, leave no traces or evidence, meaning they
                     cannot be reproduced in their entirety (see [<a class="ref" href="#foka2016">Foka and Arvidsson 2016</a>]). However,
                     this special issue argues that the lack of evidence is in fact present in any
                     historical research, sensory or not, as western intellectual tradition has shown
                     a marked preference for vision as the figure of knowledge (see [<a class="ref" href="#evens2005">Evens 2005</a>, ix]).

                        the Past / Diversify the Future</cite><a class="noteRef" href="#d4e291">[1]</a>, individual contributions examine both the opportunities and challenges
                     that digital technology poses in the study and dissemination of the past. Five
                     articles focus on the processes that lead to visualizing/rendering intangible
                     historical data within the disciplines of classical studies, environmental
                     archaeology and historical science more generally. “Intangible” is often
                     defined by large initiatives (UNESCO) as the term that replaced “folklore”
                     as referring to aspects of cultural heritage that are non-physical, estimated,
                     incorporeal, unembodied, and disembodied. In this special issue, in using the
                     term <em class="emph">intangible</em>, unless otherwise stated, we mean the historically
                     invisible or complicated to render by digital means, the incomplete and the
                     intangible in cultural or environmental, social or ecological terms.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> Beyond reconstructions, and because of innovative digital tools,
                     visualizations/renderings for historical disciplines can, more generally, vary
                     from simple graphs to word clouds and geospatial, time-interactive maps. Early
                     digital visualisations have accordingly provided insight into aspects of urban
                     development and have facilitated critical discussions of the application of
                     digital tools within the context of museology, conservation, urban planning, or
                     the narratives of digital heritage [<a class="ref" href="#vitale2016">Vitale 2016</a>]. Early digital
                     visualizations also made evident how existing digital tools and related models
                     carry assumptions of knowledge as primarily visual, thus neglecting
                     interactivity with the user/observer or, for example, sensory data. As it
                     emerges from this special issue, current technological developments, such as
                     augmented, mixed, or even virtual reality, can inspire new modes of
                     representation that call for new scientific questions and methods/solutions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> Joshua L. Mann’s paper, <cite class="title italic">How Technology Means: Texts,
                        History, and Their Associated Technologies,</cite> begins from the premise
                     that technologies used to study and represent the past are not hermeneutically
                     neutral: the main question that the author aims to explain relates to the ways
                     in which associated technologies convey meaning. Mann examines textual history,
                     using biblical texts as a case study. The thrust of this study is that older,
                     future and contemporary textual technologies may capture or obscure material
                     history. The author examines and compares the non-digital book and its familiar
                     digital counterparts. Further, the article considers ways in which augmented
                     reality and virtual reality have already been used and might be used in future
                     to render historical texts. New technologies then appear to trespass the
                     boundaries of previous book technologies in capturing a text’s history. In
                     conclusion, the author makes practical suggestions in relation to reading,
                     studying, or producing digital textual objects.

                        reception</cite>, similarly tackles the question of digital reconstructions
                     of classical antiquity as the “sensory turn” in historical
                     scholarship moves beyond vision. The article concentrates on kinaesthesia, or
                     the sense of self-movement in Roman Pantomime. The article concludes that
                     kinaesthetic engagement can also contribute to formulating conceptions of the
                     ancient past, and that virtual reality is “an ideal tool for fashioning this analogical
                     relationship”. The objective is recreating Roman Pantomime to examine
                     how the dancers’ kinaesthetic translation of ancient data pertaining to <span class="foreign i">orchēsis</span> would be affected by the additional factor
                     of digital interaction. Motion Capture and the creation of 3D avatars of the
                     dancers is discussed thoroughly, while resulting videos enable each dance piece
                     to be analysed from any angle in the context of a virtual ancient theatre
                     environment. The authors conclude that this experiment inspired both questions
                     of a humanistic and of a technological nature.

                        experiential learning in a traditional classroom</cite> discusses how a
                     scholar and a student are to perceive Classical Drama, the theatrical place, the
                     distances between the actors, the chorus, and the audience, the logistics of the
                     performance, and the cultural aspects at play. Bozia advocates the use of mixed
                     reality as a way to promote experiential learning. Mixed reality promotes
                     traditional edification methods, virtually recreating a stage, with the Magic
                     Mirror Theater, a web application designed to help students understand Classical
                     Drama. The author first makes an account of all the attempts at reviving the
                     circumstances of performance in the actual physical place; then it discusses a
                     mixed-reality environment as an ideal solution for the study of ancient drama,
                     allowing the user to “be” in the theatrical space, and

                     interaction is embedded in stone. Sciuto discusses how the intangible life story
                     of an artefact is partially registered in its primary material properties and
                     its physical alteration from contact with other bodies. The article concentrates
                     on two methods: chemical imaging and portable spectroscopy; these quick and
                     non-destructive remote sensing techniques can be used to collect empirical data
                     and track production and use of stone artefacts over time. With the Mobima
                     project carried out by an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists and chemists
                     at University of Umeå, Sweden as a case-study, the author first reviews Near
                     Infrared Spectroscopy as a method for geochemical characterization of stone
                     artefacts and as a tool for provenance studies. The author concludes by making
                     an account of archaeometry as a new method with multiple purposes, from rock
                     paintings to medieval stone walls to soil composition and pedagogical training.
                     The digital tools have been adapted to the specific purpose of each study,
                     offering reliable support for understanding geologic materials and their
                     context.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Finally Philip I. Buckland, Nicolò Dell'Unto and Gísli Pálsson’s contribution,
                     <cite class="title italic">“To tree, or not to tree”?: On the Empirical Basis
                        for Having Past Landscapes to Experience</cite>, provides an overview of
                     some of the complex issues involved in reconstructing and visualizing past
                     landscapes. Empirical data, as the authors argue, creates the need for
                     humanistic terminology that is borrowed by the natural sciences. The authors
                     analyse this from the perspectives of environmental archaeology, archaeological
                     theory and heritage management as well as relating this, briefly, to the broader
                     context of archaeological theory, practice and research data infrastructure. The
                     article provides a point of reference for those examining past landscapes,
                     understanding their relevance in archaeological visualisation.

                     indeed, ought to be documented, explicit and transparent in order to be
                     scholarly validated <a class="noteRef" href="#d4e356">[2]</a>, all contributions describe
                     and analyse the thought processes and further activities around conceptual
                     rendering methods they have used within research projects. Contributions here
                     discuss the complexities of landscape studies (see Buckland et al. in this
                     issue); how provenance tracked and visualized may reveal past conditions and
                     uses of stone artefacts (see Sciuto in this issue); how the sensory may be
                     re-experienced and reflected upon within a virtual reality Roman pantomime
                     performance (see Slaney et al. in this issue); how conceptual 3D renderings may
                     be further implemented as an experiential learning tool in the classroom (see
                     Bozia; Slaney et al. in this issue); and the possibilities that new technologies
                     may open for the study of old texts (see Mann on biblical texts). Individual
                     contributions here focus precisely on interactive and embodied renderings of the
                     past, including attempts to experience the past rather than just gaze upon it
                     (see Slaney et al; Bozia in this issue). New forms of digital ekphrasis (see
                     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#lindh%C3%A92013">#lindhé2013</a></span>) are shaped with technology, making technology
                     “good to think with”, to paraphrase Levi Strauss. Visualizations appear
                     affected by our interpretative choices concerning the (often incomplete) data at
                     hand and digital technologies with limiting rendering capacities.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Contributors and editors agree that regular and canonised assessment of the
                     processes of visualization/rendering the past is deemed pivotal for any
                     scholarly activity [<a class="ref" href="#vitale2016">Vitale 2016</a>]. Visualizations evidently can
                     lead to novel epistemological questions through the process of making, the
                     real-life applications for pedagogical and public dissemination purposes, and
                     the feedback on what technology can and cannot do at this moment. This
                     collection of articles then, rather than concentrating on the properties of
                     digital representations as such, encourages historians to think in terms of
                     transduction, the conversion of energy from one form to another. Ultimately, new
                     possibilities can be found for creative research and expressions which integrate
                     affective history with more traditional modes of understanding [<a class="ref" href="#turkel2011">Turkel 2011</a>]. To grasp the importance of how technology may
                     interrupt the flow of information, the following articles target visualizations
                     in order to discuss technology as fragmented in its mediation of an already
                     fragmented past. In this light, the ultimate aim of this collection is to
                     reflect upon the validity of technology as a digital research infrastructure for
                     the humanities where ideas may be <em class="emph">realized</em>, communicating the past
                     to a large and diverse audience and inspiring new questions in the process of
                     making. With this issue we aim at foregrounding the role of digital, historical
                     visualizations. This research strand takes as its starting point the digital as
                     a resource to formulate a critique of our understanding of the past.
