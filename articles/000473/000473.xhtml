                  <p>How can practitioners outside of R-1s afford to build a DH lab? How to connect a
                     lab’s output to the communities it serves? This essay is a case study of Ooligan
                     Press, a student-run trade press housed within a R-2, teaching-intensive university.
                     Two elements make Ooligan Press distinctive as a DH lab. First, Ooligan is a
                     not-for-profit business folded into a Master’s program in Book Publishing. Profits
                     from sale of Ooligan Press books sustain the lab, which would collapse if its books
                     were steadily unprofitable. Second, the essay uses the DH feminism “M.E.A.L.S.” framework to explain how Ooligan's horizontal
                     management structure and student ownership of the press manifest in an ethic of care.
                     Unlike most R-1 DH labs, where priorities are set by senior scholars and directors,
                     graduate students decide which projects the lab will develop, and which skills they
                     want to master in exchange for their labor. Because Ooligan is self-sustaining, it
                     can also be self-directing.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Ooligan Press is a full-scale, student-run publishing house that launches four trade
                  books annually, the signature piece of a two-year master’s degree in book publishing
                  at
                  Portland State University. In addition to a final researched paper, an oral defense,
                  and
                  a digital portfolio, the degree requires 48 credits of coursework; eight of these
                  are
                  fulfilled working at Ooligan Press, though many students elect to invest much more
                  time
                  than that.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e217">[1]</a> At a cultural moment when some R-1 digital humanities and book history programs
                  are exploring the materiality of moveable type letterpresses, such as the Book Lab
                  at
                  University of Maryland, Huskiana Press at Northeastern University, and the Rutgers
                  Initiative for the Book,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e226">[2]</a>
                  book materiality at Portland State, a Carnegie-classified R-2, is commercially oriented
                  because the press needs proceeds from book sales in order to survive.

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">Ooligan Press sells the books it makes because sales sustain the student experience
                  of
                  learning how to make books from start-to-finish: from title acquisition through
                  developmental and copyediting, book cover design and interior design, marketing, ebook
                  conversion, social media and events-based launch, and backlist management. Book sales
                  are also a test of how accurately the student teams have gauged the market for the
                  manuscript they acquired and made into a book. From 2015 to 2019, Ooligan Press was
                  27%
                  profitable. That number encompasses the most recent seventeen titles published over
                  five
                  years, generating $124,993 in gross revenue and netting $33,206 in profit. Profits
                  are
                  reinvested back into the material costs of the press. As of 2015 to 2019, six of the
                  seventeen titles are currently unprofitable; all of these were published prior to
                  2018,
                  a 65% by-title profitability. “The press is getting better at
                  predicting success, but it takes a long time to see that in actual development
                  because of the long timelines of publishing,” notes former Ooligan Publisher
                  and article co-author Abbey Gaterud. “If Ooligan had a sequence of
                  bad books (or rising expenses) we'd be in trouble. There's no safety net.”

               <div class="ptext" id="p3">“There’s no safety net” might be the motto of Ooligan Press. It dovetails with the
                  scarce resources and the accessibility mission of Portland State as an R-2, which
                  is
                  charged to “Let Knowledge Serve the City”: a core value so foundational to PSU that
                  it’s inscribed in gold letters across a bridge spanning a main thoroughfare of our
                  urban
                  campus. Ooligan’s role in Portland’s thriving independent publishing scene is led
                  by its
                  ethical commitment to stewardship and community outreach. Initiatives such as <cite class="title italic">Rethinking Paper and Ink</cite>, a sustainability guide to critically
                  examine the book publishing industry; “Writers of Color Spring Showcase”, an annual
                  event where local authors meet agents and publishers; “Write to Publish”, a one-day
                  conference that demystifies publishing for aspiring authors; and “Transmit
                  Culture”, a free and open-to-the-public quarterly lecture series about book
                  publishing, all do the work of delivering accessible publishing information to broader,
                  local publics.

                  rarely
                  talk about in the context of labs: how can practitioners outside of R-1s afford to
                  build
                  a lab? How to connect the lab’s output holistically to the communities it serves?
                  What’s
                  the role of a lab in helping students achieve learning outcomes they seek when they
                  enroll in a degree program? These questions, centered on students and community impact,
                  are often not within the ambit of R-1 labs. And yet they are a vital component of
                  postgraduate DH training that merit attention and support.

               <div class="ptext" id="p5">DH at an R-2 is expressly tied to teaching and learning. At Ooligan, feminist pedagogy
                  manifests itself in horizontal structures of power and built-in managerial overlaps
                  in
                  student responsibilities. We foster an ethic of care and mutual dependence. This ethic
                  of care might be why Ooligan persisted despite funding calamities a decade ago, when
                  it
                  was on the verge of collapse. Today, the press’s acquisitions editors do extensive
                  forecasting, including profit-and-loss projections based on sales data available for
                  “comp” (comparable or comparator) titles. This forecasting allows Ooligan to
                  guess more accurately which people, and how many, will buy its books, sales necessary
                  to
                  recoup the significant investment in printing. Printing costs are not a budget line
                  item
                  funded by Portland State University. Being self-sustaining shields Ooligan from the
                  boom-bust cycles that can beset DH centers and labs, where there’s top-down money
                  for
                  startup but rarely for maintenance [<a class="ref" href="#sample2010">Sample 2010</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#posner2016">Posner 2016</a>]. As Ooligan Press has become more successful at making books
                  people want to buy, the lab has expanded its capacity, adding ebooks (in 2012) and
                  audiobooks (in 2018) to the slate of digital objects that book publishing master’s
                  students can learn how to make.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">In this R-2 DH lab, students decide which projects to develop, and which skills they
                  want to learn and master as a byproduct of their labor. More traditional labs orient
                  graduate students to objects of study or critical making that have been decided by
                  faculty and/or lab directors. Ooligan Press vests even freshly-admitted newcomers
                  with
                  the same authority to speak in meetings and direct the goals of the press as more
                  experienced students and faculty. This feminist principle is aligned with similar
                  organizational efforts documented in panels like “Feminist
                  Infrastructures” at the Allied Digital Humanities Organization’s 2016
                  conference in Kraków, and the “Feminist Infrastructures and
                  Technocultures” assembly at the University of California San Diego in 2013. It
                  aligns historically with second-wave feminist social organizational practices, where
                  women formed collectives and made books like <cite class="title italic">Our Bodies,
                     Ourselves</cite>, originally published in 1970 by the Boston Women’s Health
                  Collective. It is a feminist principle that context and participants’ lived experience
                  should factor into calibrations of value.

                  [<a class="ref" href="#gold2019">Gold and Klein 2019</a>, xiii], we articulate Ooligan Press specifically as a
                  digital humanities lab. The implied prestige of digital humanities has little impact
                  on
                  perceptions of Ooligan Press. Ooligan gains nothing particular from being recognized
                  as
                  “DH.” But DH has something to gain from locating a lab like Ooligan Press within
                  its domain because as the field now includes R-2s, SLACs, small private universities,
                  and community colleges, the field will benefit from developing nomenclature to describe
                  how DH is practiced without the budgets, resources, and priorities of R-1s. A dearth
                  of
                  scholarly information about non-R-1 DH can be attributed to the lack of time and
                  research money teaching faculty typically have to support writing and conferencing.

                  students at a chronically underfunded regional comprehensive university — students
                  who
                  are the most likely to have experienced the alienating effects of poverty, racism,
                  sexism, ageism and homo- and transphobia? How to reveal the assumptions and ideologies

                  “frictionless” software products made by Adobe, Google, Microsoft and Apple — not

                  by studying them using DH methods and tools? Our solution in the book publishing
                  graduate program has been to integrate a technically intensive business as part of
                  the
                  curriculum and to give students actual power to perform work at every point in the

                  DH
                  lab because its output is commercial print product, not a boutique tool or dataset.
                  Such
                  a position is understandable, but unwarranted. Technical engagement with Silicon Valley
                  products does not stop or disincentivize students from performing critique of those
                  tools and technical systems. Required coursework in the book publishing program
                  introduces students to creative coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript; text analysis;
                  media
                  theory; media archeology; and cultural studies in those contexts. This, coupled with
                  required coursework in research methods, broadens the range of questions students
                  ask
                  about book publishing and equips them with scholarly training to answer them. In this
                  essay we trace how Ooligan Press is intersectional in the lab’s human processes and
                  in
                  its nonhuman technical and commercial systems. In doing so, we are mindful of work
                  by
                  Tara McPherson, Miriam Posner and Julia Flanders, which framed for us, as Flanders
                  puts
                  it, “the difficulty . . . in creating a single coherent account of
                  the operations of diversity in theories about how ‘building’ operates in digital
                  humanities.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e349">[3]</a> Ooligan Press stands apart from the prestige economy stoked by “colonial and masculinist lineages” of “inherited lab models” that “can have direct influence not

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Book publishing master’s programs are positioned within various departments. The
                     location of PSU’s book publishing program within the English department on the one
                     hand seems like a natural extension of the study of literature, but on the other like
                     a strange marriage of humanities and social sciences. Indeed, scholars who research
                     within the academic discipline of book publishing often draw from concepts and
                     methodologies that are associated with sociology (such as <a href="#bourdieu1993">Bourdieu 1993</a>, <a href="#thompson2012">Thompson 2012</a>). It’s
                     possible that one factor in the prevalence of sociological methods in book publishing
                     is due to an effort to distinguish book publishing from literary analysis of the text
                     itself. However, book publishing is very much a <em class="emph">humanist</em> endeavor
                     because while both humanities and social sciences have human subjects, relationships,
                     and interactions as crucial to the research and fields, the primary difference
                     between humanities and social sciences is method — qualitative vs quantitative,
                     philosophical vs scientific. For this reason, book publishing might be called
                     <em class="term">applied humanities</em>, which demonstrates the pairing of conceptual and
                     theoretical knowledge with practical application that typifies book publishing degree
                     programs. Book publishing has a vocational tie in the same way that business schools,
                     engineering departments, and other social and natural science fields prepare their
                     students for work in the world. However, much like these other fields, book
                     publishing is not <em class="emph">only</em> vocational.

                     initiatives, without the infrastructure, institutional history, and integration that
                     are central to Ooligan Press. Bowen Street Press is part of the publishing master’s
                     program at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia (established in
                     1988), which houses the oldest publishing program in Australia [<a class="ref" href="#weber2017">Weber and Mannion 2017</a>]. Bowen Street Press is student-run, founded in 2016, and
                     publishes primarily anthologies, zines, and magazines. Lamplight Press is the only
                     student-run press as part of a publishing program in the UK, at Loughborough
                     University, but Lamplight Press is for undergraduate students, not graduate students.
                     Lamplight previously published 4 books a year, was self-distributed, and was founded
                     in 2013, but it hasn’t been since 2015 that anything has been published at the press,
                     presumably in part because the faculty member who founded and championed the press
                     moved to a position at another university. The third example of book publishing
                     teaching presses is New Rivers Press, based at Minnesota State University Moorhead.
                     This press is not integrated with a book publishing program; however, it is a
                     student-run publishing company, with distribution through Small Press Distribution,
                     a
                     trade book distributor that does not have the national reach that large distributors
                     like Ingram do. The fourth example is Lookout Books, launched in 2011, a literary
                     book publishing press located within the Department of Creative Writing at University
                     of North Carolina Wilmington; students work in the press as part of coursework for
                     a
                     BFA certificate in Publishing. Lookout Books is distributed by Consortium (owned by
                     Ingram). Of these four teaching presses, Lookout Books and Bowen Street Press are
                     the
                     ones that come closest to the kind of teaching press experience and output that
                     Ooligan Press provides, but even that is a far cry from the national distribution,
                     varied output, integrated systems, and longevity that characterize Ooligan.

                     student taking a book through the various stages of the publication process (editing,
                     marketing, design) and finally culminating in a printed and bound (or digital)
                     product. This corresponds generally with a publishing program guiding and instructing
                     students through the various aspects, agents, and processes within the book
                     publishing workflow, value chain, or communications circuit [<a href="#darnton2007">Darnton 2007</a>, <a href="#squires2013">Squires and

                     include Drexel University, Emerson College, New York University, University of
                     Stirling, University of Sydney, University of Central Lancashire, and Kingston
                     University. Other programs utilize the publication of a student-run journal as the
                     collaborative book project that culminates or at least contributes to the book
                     publishing master’s degree experience. Examples of such programs include National

                     backdoor founding by a non-tenure track English department faculty member; little
                     funding; grandfathered-in national distribution; and lab integration into the
                     curriculum only because there developed a one-credit gap between graduate class
                     credit hours (two classes = 8 credits) and the nine-credit minimum to qualify for
                     loans and financial aid. These contingencies made Ooligan Press possible to exist,
                     and shape its present-day characteristics. Such serendipity makes the press difficult
                     to replicate in a top-down DH lab model. A bottom-up approach rife with contingencies

                     in
                     publishing program at Portland State University, Ooligan Press is staffed by one
                     full-time non-tenure-track professor (the Publisher) and a rotating cohort of
                     approximately sixty students. The two other faculty in the program, Berens and
                     Noorda, advise the press.

                     same retail outlets and opportunities as major publishers like Taunton Press, Indiana
                     University Press, and Granta Books. Without this access, Ooligan would be unable to
                     sell the books it produces beyond what personal outreach to retail outlets could net,
                     and would make its operations unsustainable. Through a connection with a community
                     advisor, who was also the publisher of a local company called Graphic Arts Books,
                     Ooligan found a new distributor through Graphic Arts. About a year after solidifying
                     this relationship, Graphic Arts was partially sold to Ingram Publisher Services and
                     Ooligan found itself lucky enough to be brought in under Graphic Arts’ wing.

                     them, the books produced after this partnership quickly became more successful than
                     any of Ooligan’s previous titles. Without a personal connection between two
                     publishers, Ooligan would have struggled to convince such a large, nationally known
                     entity to take it on as a client. Producing only three or four titles a year,
                     Ooligan’s output would not be large enough to entice a major distributor. But
                     Ooligan’s placement with Graphic Arts, combined with its singularity in publishing
                     education, allows the relationship to be successful.

                     daily basis to improve communication, keep records, produce books, and maintain
                     history. Adoption of these tools has been, like most things at Ooligan, organic.
                     Early in the press’s history, Apple iMacs were procured and local licenses for Adobe
                     Creative Suite products like InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat were
                     installed to assist with print book production. These tools were purchased with
                     one-time infusions of tech money from either the Dean’s office or the University’s
                     Office of Information Technology. As ebook production entered the press’s operational
                     scope, these tools, combined with other free programs like Sigil, BbEdit, Wordpress,
                     and Kindle Previewer, were repurposed to make digital books.

                     quickly integrated the full function of Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets. Prior to this
                     adoption, most production scheduling was handled by Microsoft Excel files shared on
                     a
                     PSU server space, leading to versioning problems and clunky access points. The Google
                     Suite erased those issues, but brought new challenges of document ownership transfer,
                     overwhelming numbers of documents, and difficulties in shared organization of files.
                     To combat these problems, digital content managers in 2012 proposed adoption of
                     Trello, a cloud-based and free project management software. Rolled out over the
                     summer of 2013, the smooth operation of the press quickly became reliant on Trello’s
                     kanban-board structure. Based on a standardized template board, project managers and
                     Publisher construct a new board for each project after its author contract is signed,

                     contract signing to post-publication publicity, department managers — another group
                     of second-year graduate students — are responsible for the quality of work in the
                     more traditional division of labor. These managers work with project managers and
                     team members on specific parts of the book’s life cycle, ensuring professional-level
                     quality in the books. These redundant layers of management serve as a backstop
                     against shoddy work and also against the problem of relying too heavily on one person
                     to carry the burden of an entire project. Managers are often taking the four-credit
                     Publishing Studio course, therefore ensuring more time in their course schedule to
                     devote to Ooligan work; but they are also taking other courses, and often working
                     off-campus jobs, raising families, doing internships, and simply living messy human
                     lives. Ooligan’s structure allows students the space to be developing humans,
                     sometimes needing a day or two off, while also ensuring that the work can continue.
                     If a student does need to take time off from school for any reason, the book and
                     author do not suffer in the long run.

                     theoretical and cultural frameworks for understanding their situatedness in

                     make to Pacific Northwest culture. Ooligan’s mission recognizes “the importance of comprehensive representation and diversity, particularly within
                     the publishing industry, and [is] committed to building a literary community that
                     includes traditionally underserved voices.” Ooligan encourages submission
                     of “works originating from, or focusing on, the experiences that
                     come from these people and communities within the Pacific Northwest.”

                     published at Ooligan and also allows for two years of technical and problem-solving
                     skills development. Students report that this long-term, in-depth involvement with
                     book projects is one of the biggest benefits of PSU’s program: they iterate skills
                     and build mastery that could not be developed over the course of one term in a more
                     traditional classroom-project setting.

                     it has developed its current structure organically to deal with the unique challenges
                     of running a business within a classroom. For example, the first Ooligan cohort had
                     eight students; all students worked collaboratively on all aspects of the book
                     production process, mostly in dedicated classroom face-to-face settings. Over time
                     as
                     the number of involved students increased, the organizational structure evolved to
                     one that emulates that of the wider publishing industry, with departments structured
                     around the main divisions of labor: editorial, design, marketing and sales.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">As Ooligan grew in number of students and number of titles published, this structure
                     evolved, with a switch to a project-based approach rolled out in 2011. The reasons
                     for this shift were two-fold. One, students were given a broader understanding of
                     the
                     full process that a book goes through inside a publishing house, which came from
                     curricular needs. The publishing program aims to give students a broad understanding
                     of all aspects of the publishing process, and faculty found that students tended to
                     silo their work and their exposure to areas where they felt most comfortable. To
                     increase exposure to new and emerging fields in publishing — like digital content
                     production and marketing — required students to work with an entire book rather than
                     a department. Gradually their work would encompass all aspects of book production,
                     thereby making their understanding of the process deeper and broader.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">The second reason for a shift to project-based teams was as an effort to overcome
                     the
                     biggest hurdle at Ooligan: institutional memory. As one cohort of managers graduates
                     from the program, the next one steps in over the summer term and takes full control
                     of their project or department. The Publisher trains new managers to:

                     schedules, weekly assignments, and departmental progress. Then for hour two, each

                     consequences are also felt at a deeper level. A project manager in 2017, after
                     discovering a major omission in an already printed book, reacted with tears — and
                     then a plan to address the omission — in a private meeting with then-Publisher
                     Gaterud, and then a tearful confession to the press at the weekly meeting. A student

                     informally pitched at a writer’s conference, told Gaterud that she’d never been
                     prouder of herself in an educational setting. The stakes are real and the reactions
                     are as well, something prospective students understand as much as graduates. Fifty

                     running and managing a business in an industry that runs on relationships and sells
                     objects that are very expensive to fix if something goes wrong. Printed books cannot
                     be easily changed, adapted, or modified once they have been solidified into a print
                     object. A second edition might come out once the print run has been exhausted (this
                     has happened only once in Ooligan’s nineteen-year history); otherwise, the print
                     object is a fixed thing. Print’s fixity adds pressure and risk to the process. If
                     the
                     design of the cover is off by half an inch, then the entire print run includes covers
                     that don’t line up with the spine. If there is a major editorial oversight in a
                     chapter, that oversight appears in every copy of the print run. It’s a real-world
                     scenario in which the stakes are high in economic, social, and symbolic terms. This
                     fixed, one-shot opportunity to get the final product right affectively influences
                     all
                     those involved in the press in a way that would be difficult to replicate without
                     Ooligan’s real-world uncertainties, and the pressure of knowing that Ooligan must
                     remain budget-neutral in order to survive.

                     trust, understanding, and mutual dependence prompts the students to tattoo their
                     bodies with the Ooligan Press logo, start new presses and freelance agencies
                     together, engage in a myriad of personal and extracurricular activities together,
                     and
                     put in extra time and effort (particularly for press managers) to develop a sense
                     of
                     community and deep relationships. 98% of our graduates stay connected to the book
                     publishing program via our mailing list and through our Facebook group (a private
                     group is not limited exclusively to alumni). In an alumni survey, 70% of respondents
                     said they felt connected to the graduate program in book publishing, in contrast to
                     only 12% who felt connected to the English department in which book publishing is
                     housed and 30% who felt connected to PSU as a whole. This sense of community,
                     facilitated largely by Ooligan Press, contributes to why 91% of book publishing
                     alumni feel that the graduate degree was a good investment of their time and money

                     experience that trains them ethically, technically and emotionally in time-pressured
                     and constrained real-world settings. Publishing books that the public buys is an
                     extra-academic context in which to measure technical skills and rising confidence.
                     Steven Lubar, the public humanist at Brown University asks: “How
                     do the humanities change when we take engaged public scholarship
                     seriously?” Rather than a plea for the more conservative, less socially
                     engaged work Erwin Steinberg called for in his 1974 article “Applied Humanities”, we think “applied humanities” is a term that
                     modifies “digital humanities” in a useful way, by suggesting that humanities
                     work is always situated in particular communities who are served–or not–by that work.

                     sustains experiential learning and extends digital humanities pedagogical approaches
                     beyond R-1s. The second is feminism, and an ethic of care that makes space for
                     student autonomy and press ownership.
