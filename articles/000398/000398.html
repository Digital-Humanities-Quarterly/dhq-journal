                  <p>Technologies used to study and represent the past are not hermeneutically
                     neutral. Since technologies have illocutionary force, we should ask of any
                     representation of history, <span class="hi italic">In what ways are the associated
                        technologies conveying meaning?</span> In this article, the question will be
                     asked of a particular kind of history, textual history, taking biblical texts as
                     an illustrative example. The goal is to better understand how textual
                     technologies of yesterday, today, or tomorrow capture or obscure the material
                     history of their texts. The article proceeds in two main parts. First, two kinds
                     of technologies commonly used are examined and compared: the non-digital book
                     and its familiar digital counterparts. Second, we will consider ways in which
                     augmented reality and virtual reality have been used and might be used to
                     represent texts. It will be suggested that these new technologies may overcome
                     some of the limitation of previous book technologies in capturing a text’s
                     history. In conclusion, practical suggestions will be made for those who read,
                     study, or produce digital textual objects.

                     past are not hermeneutically neutral. To state this positively: the technologies
                     themselves <em class="emph">mean</em> something; they have illocutionary force. In
                     considering technologies through which the past might be apprehended, it is
                     important to remember that the past is only ever <em class="emph">approximately</em>
                     apprehended: one cannot simply “go back,” but must rely on
                     constructed memories, artifacts, written accounts, recordings, etc. Further, as
                     these examples indicate, most of our means of apprehending the past rely on
                     technology, broadly defined. Consider Ferré’s broad understanding of technology: “...technology involves (i)
                     implements used as (ii) means to practical ends that are somehow (iii)
                     manifested in the material world as (iv) expressions of

                     textual history, taking biblical texts as an illustrative example. The goal is
                     to better understand how textual technologies of yesterday, today, or tomorrow
                     capture or obscure the material history of their texts. Biblical texts are
                     particularly useful since they feature prominently during major media shifts in
                     the past two millennia (from scroll to codex, script to print, print to
                     digital). First, two technologies widely used are considered and compared: the
                     (non-digital) book and its digital counterparts. This analysis will suggest ways
                     in which the associated paratexts affect the reader’s understanding of the
                     text’s past. Second, technologies increasingly available but less commonly used
                     for texts, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), will be considered
                     along the same lines. These technologies are particularly interesting because,
                     although they are digital, they represent 3D physical space quite realistically.
                     It will be seen that each technology examined conveys certain elements of
                     textual history while obscuring others. These observations will lead to more
                     general considerations for those creating, using, and studying texts.

                     technology, we necessarily describe features of texts that are normally taken

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Roughly, paratexts are to texts what a frame is to a picture. Gérard Genette, who
                     has coined the literary use of the term, explains: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           A literary work consists, entirely
                           or essentially, of a text, defined (very minimally) as a more or less
                           long sequence of verbal statements that are more or less endowed with
                           significance. But this text is rarely presented in an unadorned state,
                           unreinforced and unaccompanied by a certain number of verbal or other
                           productions, such as an author’s name, a title, a preface,
                           illustrations. And although we do not always know whether these
                           productions are to be regarded as belonging to the text, in any case
                           they surround it and extend it, precisely in order to
                           <em class="emph">present</em> it, in the usual sense of this verb but also in
                           the strongest sense: to <em class="emph">make present</em>, to ensure the text’s
                           presence in the world, its “reception” and
                           consumption in the form (nowadays, at least) of a book. These
                           accompanying productions, which vary in extent and appearance,
                           constitute what I have called elsewhere the work’s
                           <em class="emph">paratext</em>....

                        </p>
                     </blockquote> The key is that paratexts themselves have meaning; they are
                     hermeneutically significant: “Far from being an issue that
                     preoccupies only the theoretically minded, the matter of the paratext is
                     always — albeit often imperceptibly — already at work in the hermeneutic
                     process”

                     two respects: (1) It matters very little in the following analysis whether or
                     not the “author” legitimates (or accepts responsibility) for
                     a paratext;<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e301">[2]</a> and (2) the <em class="emph">para</em> of
                     <em class="emph">paratexts</em> receives the emphasis, not the <em class="emph">texts</em>. In
                     other words, paratexts are framing features of the text but not necessarily
                     texts themselves.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e319">[3]</a> For the purposes of this article, then,
                     paratexts are the productions that accompany, present, or contain the text,
                     including productions that facilitate the engagement of a reader.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e324">[4]</a> Paratexts may be produced by an author, publisher, software
                     developers, editors, and the like, and also include visual features associated
                     with typography, page layout, book design or, in software, the interface. These
                     paratexts affect readerly expectations of encountering a text and, indeed, the
                     encounter itself. In the following section, we begin to explore how paratexts
                     affect the reader’s sense of a text’s history.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The purpose here is to sufficiently explore the subtle
                     “messages” various book technologies send a reader of
                     biblical texts; that is, to consider the illocutionary force of the various
                     paratexts. For heuristic purposes, let us begin by considering the form of
                     biblical texts that most people encounter today: The printed Bible in
                     translation. Such a book is generally a collection of 66 or more ancient
                     documents bound together in a single volume (<a href="#figure01">Figure
                        1</a>)<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e350">[5]</a>. 
                     <div id="figure01" class="figure">

                        </div>
                     </div> Right away we should note that the binding itself is significant. The
                     binding is a paratext that conveys a message: these documents
                     <em class="emph">belong</em> together. But in terms of the text’s history, the
                     binding paratext of a codex potentially obscures the fact that the documents
                     within were completed at various times over the course of 1,500 or more years by
                     authors who almost certainly did not envision that their work would be read
                     alongside of these other works. Indeed, the texts of these documents were
                     transmitted by copying and came to be collected together and assorted in various
                     ways over the centuries by diverse groups, many of whom did not agree about the
                     documents’ relation to one another.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e368">[6]</a> Even where an introduction or
                     marginal note gives an account of the composition of a particular document, the
                     paratextual message of <em class="emph">belonging</em> remains.
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Early in the textual history of many of the biblical texts, however, especially
                     those of the Hebrew Bible, the scroll, not the codex, was the book technology of
                     choice.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e381">[7]</a> We might therefore ask: Does a
                     scroll have a similar binding or boundary paratext as a codex? Of course, each
                     end of the scroll serves as a boundary, and if multiple texts are contained in a
                     single scroll, these texts are related to one another by virtue of the boundary
                     paratext analogous to the binding of a codex. Perhaps a closer equivalent to the
                     binding paratext of the codex would be the receptacle of a group of scrolls,
                     perhaps a shelf, a chest, or a jar.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e390">[8]</a> For example, the <cite class="title italic">Torah
                        Ark</cite>, a special receptacle for Torah  scrolls
                     used in some synagogues, represents a similar kind of canonical paratext as the
                     binding of the Bible earlier described. But note that a collection of scrolls is
                     far less fixed than a collection of texts bound in a codex, and the paratextual
                     message of belonging is less overt. Thus a canonical collection of scrolls
                     captures the distinctiveness of individual documents, obscuring to a lesser
                     extent the collection’s textual history.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">What, then, is the binding or boundary paratext of a <em class="emph">digital</em>
                     biblical text? Technically, a computer file containing the text exists, usually
                     marked (or tagged) at document boundaries. Since a reader is generally unaware
                     of this technical boundary, its hermeneutical significance is more difficult to
                     discern.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e406">[9]</a> In terms of the electronic display of
                     a biblical text, boundaries might include title pages and chapter or page
                     numbers that indicate a beginning or a scroll bar that indicates the user’s
                     relative location within the document.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e412">[10]</a> It is instructive to compare the boundary paratexts
                     illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 below. In Accordance Bible Software, if a user
                     navigates to the beginning of the Gospel of Luke — a distinct ancient document —
                     scrolling up will display the ending of the Gospel of Mark — another distinct
                     document, usually bound just before Luke in a print Bible — with little
                     indication of a boundary between them (<a href="#figure02">Figure
                        2</a>).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e424">[11]</a> But in YouVersion’s popular Bible app, navigating to
                     the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, the user is presented with the first
                     chapter of that document, unable to scroll up to any previous text (<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e431">[12]</a> To
                     advance within the text of chapter one, the user must scroll down. To advance to
                     chapter two, the user must tap the right arrow button. However, pressing the
                     left arrow button <em class="emph">will</em> take the user to the last chapter of the
                     Gospel of Mark (similar to the scrolling navigation in Accordance). Thus in both
                     examples, the user can navigate back one chapter <em class="emph">in canonical
                        sequence</em>, from Luke 1 to Mark 16, not unlike most printed Bibles.
                     YouVersion’s app presents more of a boundary between the two documents, the
                     Gospels of Mark and Luke, by virtue of its chapter boundaries. But in both
                     cases, the canonical sequence is fixed and the boundaries between documents are
                     not overt.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Consider also the uniformity of modern printed books in terms of typography, page
                     layout, and other elements of book design — paratextual properties according to
                     my definition — reinforcing the message that the documents are related and
                     belong together since each document (or “book” within) looks
                     and feels exactly the same.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e465">[13]</a> Similarly, printed Bibles typically have consecutive page
                     numbering <em class="emph">across</em> the bound collection, another paratextual message
                     suggesting the unity and progression of its contents.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e490">[14]</a> An
                     additional numbering system is commonly used for referencing larger units of
                     each document (consecutively numbered “chapters”) under which
                     are smaller units (consecutively numbered “verses”, per
                     chapter).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e500">[15]</a> The consistency of this reference system across biblical
                     texts, including various editions, versions, and translations of modern Bibles,
                     and even anachronistically used in online editions of digitized manuscripts,
                     subtly suggests readerly, possibly even authorial, agreement about the unit -
                     delineation, and therefore the argument, of the texts. These numbering systems
                     are intentionally absent in some printed Bibles, often called Reader’s Bibles,
                     in order to present the reader a text formatted like familiar modern books. Some
                     Bible applications likewise allow the user to “hide” verse
                     and chapter numbers (and manipulate certain other visual paratextual features).
                     Even so, print and digital versions alike present an extremely uniform text
                     which subtly obscures its textual history.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">The physical binding of a Bible also fixes the sequence (or canonical order) of
                     the documents. Imagine the hermeneutical difference, for example with a
                     Protestant Bible, if a reader had a series of 66 unnumbered volumes on a shelf,
                     each corresponding to one ancient document (e.g., Genesis, Exodus, etc.), rather
                     than a one-volume bound collection. At a glance, it would become immediately
                     clear that the documents vary greatly in size, which reduces the sense of
                     uniformity, even if slightly. The reader could also then order the collection in
                     a multitude of ways: by putative date of composition, by genre, by size, and so
                     on.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e510">[16]</a> While digital biblical
                     texts often utilize hyperlinking in such a way that navigation is not linear,
                     they nevertheless retain traditional canonical sequencing through the prominent
                     navigational features (e.g., scrolling, contents menu, etc.).

                     paratextual message that suggests a pure, original text. This
                     “finality” enabled by the printing press was celebrated
                     by science and religion alike from an early period. In 1702, Bishop Thomas Sprat
                     could say: “[Both the Royal Society and the
                     Church]...have taken a like cours[e] to bring this about; each of them
                     passing by the corrupt Copies, and referring themselves to the perfect
                     Originals for their instruction; the one to Scripture, the other to the
                     large Volume of the Creatures”

                     acute in Bible software.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e553">[18]</a>
                     Accordance Bible Software, for example, periodically alerts the user to
                     available updates, listing specific modules that might include a biblical text —
                     a text that is updated, changed with the click of a button!

                     perpetual. One is, as it were, standing in it. As David Parker, a New Testament
                     textual critic, once observed after creating an electronic transcription of
                     Codex Sinaiticus: “...textual critics, under the
                     guise of reconstructing original texts, are really creating new
                     ones”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#parker2003">Parker 2003</a>, 401].<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e582">[19]</a> Parker
                     suggests that as technologies give more ability to the user to manipulate a
                     scholarly edition of a text (like the New Testament), “The result will be a weakening of
                     the status of standard editions, and with that a change in the way in
                     which users of texts perceive their tasks”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#parker2003">Parker 2003</a>, 404]. Note, however, that even in Parker’s advanced software, Collate, there
                     is a smoothing over of textual materiality for the sake of the machine. This
                     “smoothing over” is the effect of any attempt to produce
                     a critical edition, creating the tension, described by Alan Galey, “...between the surface orderliness
                     of scholarly resources and the stubborn irregularity of textual
                     materials”

                     Images have for a long time been an important means of capturing the materiality
                     of manuscripts. Given the scope of this article, we limit ourselves to
                     considering <em class="emph">digital</em> images. For a manuscript of more than a few
                     pages, most digitized versions present a series of images, one per page (of a
                     codex) or per section (of a scroll). For example, the Center for the Study of
                     New Testament Manuscripts provides a web interface that simply presents
                     thumbnail images of the pages of a manuscript.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e618">[20]</a> Clicking
                     on a thumbnail will open a larger version of the same image in a viewer in which
                     the user can zoom to view even greater detail. Other interfaces juxtapose
                     manuscript images, transcriptions, and translations. One Bible software program,
                     BibleWorks, links manuscript sigla, transcriptions, and images of select
                     manuscripts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e624">[21]</a> In an
                     example of one of the more sophisticated web interfaces, the Codex Sinaiticus
                     Project displays a zoomable manuscript image (per codex page), a transcription
                     formatted in columns corresponding to the manuscript, and a translation in one
                     of a few languages — each linked to the other word by word.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e630">[22]</a>
                     Navigation  is possible either by book/chapter/verse (like a
                     modern printed Bible) or quire/folio/verso-recto. The latter method is a good
                     example of a navigational paratext that captures the materiality of the
                     manuscript. In spite of the sophistication, however, the user’s relative
                     location within the document is not obvious. Contrast this limitation with a
                     series of digitized scrolls in The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls project by The
                     Israel Museum, Jerusalem.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e642">[23]</a> The Isaiah Scroll, for
                     example, can be read by moving a slider at the bottom of the window — a scroll
                     bar that is itself an image of the scroll, rolled out, and numbered, column by
                     column (<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). The greater part of the window

                     unrolled or rolled up, depending on the direction of navigation. Hovering over a
                     line of the original text causes a shaded box to appear which, upon clicking,
                     displays a pop up English translation of the highlighted text. This interface,
                     more than any other I have encountered online, captures the original paratexts

                     in print, obscure the textual history of the Bible by inviting assumptions about
                     the unity and cohesion of the various documents contained therein. Most digital
                     counterparts to the book similarly smooth over the variegated history of the
                     texts. Critical editions suffer from this tendency, even as they explicitly
                     represent the details of the text’s history. Digitized manuscripts, however, are
                     increasingly produced in a way that preserves their original paratextual
                     properties and material features, and may help overcome the tendency of printed
                     texts to obscure textual history. This leads us to consider the potential of two
                     image-based technologies, AR and VR.

                     roughly this same period, the proliferation of mobile devices with

                     may be represented and experienced. The exhibit is visual, multi-sensory, and
                     may tap into something of the <em class="emph">emotion</em> of the biblical scene,
                     perhaps in a way not unlike the illuminations of ancient or medieval

                     virtually presented: The binding, the thickness of the book, the presence of
                     other pages, etc. One can further imagine that in a VR environment, the relative
                     size of the object could be more realistically rendered by the added depth

                     holographic computer.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e886">[37]</a> With the
                     HoloLens, a user looks through a lens, seeing the real world, while the computer
                     projects images upon the lens in 3D, creating a holographic effect. In Smith’s
                     example, a physical desk upon which sits an open Bible is overlaid with
                     holographic digital texts and tools that a user can manipulate (<a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>). It is not difficult to also imagine a
                     holographic display of a scroll, a codex, or even the site of a manuscript’s
                     discovery.

                     of the biblical text that have been digitized — a kind of virtual critical
                     edition. The user, seated at a desk, can “open” and read any
                     of the objects, perhaps using a printed Bible in translation as the
                     point-of-entry. When selected, Codex Sinaiticus appears on the desk, rendered in
                     3D and in true-to-life relative size to the Bible, the desk, and, say, a measure
                     on the desk. If a particular manuscript is, in reality, distributed in various
                     parts across different libraries, then in the virtual world, a user could either
                     view each part separately or view a virtual reconstruction of the whole. A fully

                     apprehension of the text’s past. Thus, when creating any representation of a
                     text or manuscript (a digital representation, a critical edition, etc.), care
                     should be taken in preserving the original paratexts, and consideration should
                     be given to the new paratexts created in the production of the digital
                     representation. For digitized manuscripts especially, representations should
                     attempt to imitate the original paratexts as closely as possible (an excellent
                     example is the Isaiah Scroll in <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a> above).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">Second, those undertaking digitization projects should consider cutting edge
                     technologies and their future trajectories and, accordingly, capture as much
                     information as possible in their digitization work. Along these lines, David
                     Parker says: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           In transcribing Codex Sinaiticus, I
                           found myself seeking new ways of indicating just what I found. ...Should
                           I indicate which letters were written smaller at the end of a line? How
                           should I indicate punctuation, paragraphing, the Eusebian apparatus, and
                           the running titles? ...At the end of this process it was clear that the
                           activity on which I was engaged was quite different in character from
                           collating. I was trying to decide what features in the manuscript I
                           could and should represent in my transcription, and then finding ways of
                           doing so. And I was thinking not only about the possibilities
                           immediately available to me, but also about possibilities that might be
                           available to scholars at a future date, if only I had the forethought to
                           set out my material in such a way that they could capture it for their
                           own ends.
                            [<a class="ref" href="#parker2003">Parker 2003</a>, 398]

                     </blockquote> In view of AR, VR, and other 3D applications, this means that digital
                     photos of manuscripts and books should include the outside of the book at
                     multiple angles. Related to this, efforts to establish digital standards that
                     directly or indirectly affect texts (e.g., protocols, file types, markup
                     languages, etc.) would likewise benefit from such future-looking considerations.

                     and VR for the analysis of textual objects. VR and holographic AR especially
                     have the potential to represent manuscripts in a compelling real-to-life and
                     true-to-size manner. Fourth, we have seen that many AR applications are used in
                     educational contexts. Educators will thus want to think critically about how AR
                     and VR may enhance and restrict the learning experiences they wish to create,
                     and for texts, the ways in which the technology captures or obscures textual
                     history.

                     digital texts. As Alan Galey rightly says: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           If textual scholars tend to position
                           themselves at the threshold between the surfaces of texts and their
                           mysterious depths...then digital materials may lead them to new kinds of
                           thresholds. As in bibliography, questions about preserving and reading
                           digital artefacts lead inevitably to the topic of their design. Reading
                           the human presence in a digital artefact requires knowledge of markup,
                           encoding, and even programming, raising the problem of negotiating
                           multiple fields: on the one hand, textual scholarship (which some take
                           to include book history, or at least to overlap substantially with it);
                           and on the other, <em class="emph">interface design</em> as a catch-all term for
                           a practice that brings together human-computer interaction, information
                           design, usability studies, and programming. Textual scholarship’s close
                           ties with book history significantly complicate its relationship with
                           design — though such complexity can be productive.

                     “text” inherited from the printing press, especially
                     an assumed stability of the text [<a class="ref" href="#clivaz2015">Clivaz 2015</a>].</span></div>

                     of these texts may be more obviously useful for scholars than, say, the
                     popular readership of the YouVersion Bible app. However, the point here is
                     to simply show that the paratexts themselves indicate (or obscure) much
                     about the text’s history, impacting upon our apprehension of the
