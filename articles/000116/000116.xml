                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>This article describes the authors’ experience teaching college students how to
                    use Google Earth to create atlases of historical Silk Road journeys. It argues
                    that a digital humanities classroom, with clearly defined assignments and
                    extensive evaluation, is an exemplary setting for establishing and verifying
                    genre conventions and review standards. Approaches that are developed for the
                    classroom can be modified for professional settings. The authors introduce
                    criteria for evaluating digital historical atlases as works of humanistic
                    scholarship, and suggest that digital humanists do the same for other
                    disciplines and genres as well.</p>

            <div>
                <head>I. Introduction</head>
                <p>This article is inspired by Ruth Mostern’s experience teaching an undergraduate
                    history course about the Silk Road using spatial history principles and methods.
                    Half of the classroom time in this Spring 2010 course at the University of
                    California, Merced was a conventional history seminar. During the remainder of
                    the class meetings, Mostern, along with graduate research assistant Elana
                    Gainor, taught digital map design and development using Google’s popular virtual
                    globe application, Google Earth. Integrating these two practices, students
                    produced gazetteers, descriptions of historical places, interactive maps, and
                    term papers about historical Silk Road travel itineraries. </p>
                <p>This article offers advice and lessons to others who wish to attempt such a
                    course. However, it is also an article about reviewing and evaluating digital
                    scholarship beyond the classroom. Mostern and Gainor sptook advantage of the
                    structure and highly specified assignments of an undergraduate classroom to
                    design and implement clear and actionable standards for digital historical
                    atlases. The standards shaped student work and allowed a reviewer – in this case
                    a professor with grading authority – to evaluate the results of their efforts
                    and to distinguish in a fair and systematic way between more and less effective
                    digital atlases. Classroom work and professional scholarship are not identical,
                    but many of the same review principles apply to both. Since scholarly review of
                    digital scholarship is still at an early stage of development, classrooms are a
                    valuable and accessible venue for testing and evaluating review standards. We
                    used our expertise in spatial history methods, theories and exemplars to
                    introduce the digital atlas genre, set standards for student work, and grade
                    student accomplishments. Based on our experience, we propose that our classroom
                    standards can be modified and utilized by digital atlas developers and reviewers
                    in the profession. </p>
                <p>The first two sections of the article offer suggestions about spatial history as
                    a research and teaching practice, based on the proposition that spatial history
                    is not simply a set of techniques, but an informed approach to understanding
                    past geography. The next two sections of the article are about the Silk Road
                    class content and its implications for the digital humanities. The article
                    concludes with one section that introduces recent writing about scholarly review
                    of digital work, and another proposing guidelines for digital historical atlas
                    review informed by classroom experience and professional good practice. </p>

                <head>II. Interpretation and Analysis in the Spatial Humanities </head>
                <p>Instructors who grade student work, as well as editors who review authors’
                    submissions, are explicitly conducting evaluation. At the same time, scholars
                    who assess how a given work contributes to their field are also engaging in
                    assessment. That is particularly true in the digital humanities, since peer
                    review and third-party publication are still rare. Putting aside technical
                    review, evaluating digital scholarship is no different than assessing any other
                    work. Those who do it recognize a work in its genre context, compare it to
                    analogous works, and determine what it adds to its field. The task implies an
                    intellectual agenda, but this has not yet been well articulated in the field of
                    digital spatial history. In the following section, we survey the intellectual
                    state of the spatial history field and propose a way forward.</p>
                <p>We use the term <emph>digital atlas</emph> to refer to the typical genre of
                    spatial history work. The term is shorthand for a multimedia project based upon
                    a mapping platform, integrating spatially referenced features with non-spatial
                    resources such as embedded or hyperlinked text, images, or video, organizing
                    spatial information into layers by category, and filtering visible display by
                    means of a time-slider for temporal scale and pan-and-zoom controls for spatial
                    scale. Digital atlas users can turn layers on and off, control visibility, and
                    explore hyperlinked data associated with georeferenced locations. Each atlas
                    depicts a topic or theme; it has a coherent spatial and temporal premise like
                    that presented on a single page in a paper atlas or a single map in a textbook.
                    However, the advantage of a digital atlas is that it is backed by a database
                    holding all the geographical information, map layers, and other resources from
                    many atlases, and the same content can be reused for multiple thematic
                        maps.<note> The term digital atlas is inspired by the work of the Electronic
                        Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI), which is the best known research program
                        to use the atlas metaphor to refer to interactive digital maps of historical
                        and cultural phenomena. ECAI, now largely dormant, was influential between
                        about 1999 and 2005. See <ref target="http://ecai.org"
                        >http://ecai.org</ref>.</note>
                </p>
                <p> Humanities scholars using methods from cultural geography and geographic
                    information science have styled their practices as <q>geohumanities</q> and
                        <q>spatial humanities,</q> two names for a field that has emerged in the
                    last decade.<note>
                        <title rend="italic">GeoHumanities</title> is the title of a book edited by
                        geographer Michael Dear and several colleagues, and <title rend="italic"
                            >Spatial Humanities</title> is the title of a book edited by historian
                        David Bodenhamer and two colleagues. The spatial humanities book focuses
                        particularly on the use of GIS, while the geohumanities book, a conference
                        volume, covers a wide range of other topics as well, including speculative
                        mapping, and literary criticism informed by cultural geography. The term
                        spatial history dates to Paul Carter’s influential <title rend="italic">The
                            Road to Botany Bay: An Exploration of Landscape and History</title>,
                        published in 1988. In contrast to the term historical GIS, it refers to a
                        methodological stance more than an engagement with particular technologies.
                        Judging by conference attendance and book and journal publishing profiles,
                        there is remarkably little overlap between the digital humanities community
                        and the spatial history community.</note> The field involves a range of more
                    and less computational approaches. Among them we are most interested in those
                    that involve producing digital maps of historical phenomena and using them for
                    analysis and communication. Barriers to entry for geographic information systems
                    (GIS) software and methods have declined, and historians, archaeologists, and
                    literary critics have, often in collaboration with colleagues in other fields,
                    developed exemplary projects. There are a number of books and articles about
                    methods and results; and conferences, workshops and opportunities for funding
                    have all proliferated. Stanley Fish, humanities blogger at the <title
                        rend="italic">New York Times</title>, devoted a column to the field in
                    summer 2011 <ptr target="#fish2011"/>.</p>
                <p>The quantity of activity in this area is impressive. However, in lieu of careful
                    development of theory, a critical apparatus, and standards of rigor and
                    excellence, advocates of the field too often rejoice in its mere existence and
                    engage in evangelism for it. The editors of the <title rend="italic"
                        >GeoHumanities</title> volume, for instance, celebrate the fact that <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#richardson2011">a kaleidoscope of intellectual and
                        artistic outputs</quote> is leading to <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#richardson2011">excitement breaking out across the intellectual
                        landscape</quote>
                    <ptr target="#richardson2011" loc="3"/>. Thus, although numerous methods for
                    spatial analysis and spatial representation in the humanities have been
                    proposed, implemented, and reported, there has been only limited critical and
                    comparative evaluation of what approaches are most appropriate for accomplishing
                    particular ends. The authors assembled in the <title rend="italic"
                        >GeoHumanities</title> volume, for example, include proponents of animation
                    (Ayers), gaming and immersive visualization (Harris et al.), <q>quantitative techniques combined
                        with hermeneutics</q> (von Lünen and Moschek), integrating disparate
                    sources (Schwartz et al.) or analyzing one difficult source (Hillier) using GIS,
                    and gazetteer development (Bol).<note> All of these authors are from the final
                        section of the volume, which is about history. Other sections of the book,
                        concerned with art, representation, and literature, are less involved with
                        spatial analysis and visualization technology, and are less pertinent for
                        this discussion. <title rend="italic">The Spatial Humanities</title>
                        features articles by many of the same authors and reflects a similar range
                        of approaches.</note> All of the authors make excellent cases for their
                    approaches, and all of them describe successful applications of the methods in
                    question to their own projects. None of them, however, assesses which research
                    and/or visualization problems other than their own are most suitable for the
                    method in question, or whether their method is the most appropriate among a
                    range of possibilities. Finally, none of them suggest criteria by which
                    reviewers or readers should judge the quality of work produced according to the
                    method in question, or, in most cases, the suitability of the particular method
                    in question. This omission explains why we advocate reviewing and critiquing
                    spatial humanities works, a practice for identifying how they help to frame and
                    address questions in the humanities and for permitting developers to select a
                    suitable method for a given purpose.</p>
                <p>The current state of affairs is understandable for an emerging and rapidly
                    evolving field. Nevertheless, scholars have a hard time engaging critically with
                    one another’s work because they lack generally accepted shared language and
                    shared standards of evaluation and comparison. Moreover, without community
                    standards there is no foundation for the peer review or assessment of spatial
                    humanities applications. For these reasons, developing theory and common
                    methodology for the spatial humanities is not simply an intellectual exercise;
                    rather it is essential for the maturation of the field. The remainder of this
                    section proposes criteria for such standards. </p>
                <p>Mostern has already written an article that reflects earlier stages of her
                    thinking about this matter. Her 2010 article <title rend="quotes">Putting the
                        World in World History</title> was an initial effort to articulate a
                    theoretical grounding for the spatial humanities, specifically with reference to
                    her field of world history, and particularly in the context of pedagogy.<note>
                        <ptr target="#mostern2010"/>. That article was preceded by a related work
                        that had less of a pedagogy focus but was also an effort to engage digital
                        practices in history and geography. That article <ptr target="#mostern2008"
                        /> argued for the utility of including information about events in spatial
                        humanities databases in order to engage more effectively with contingency
                        and change, the core points of analysis in the discipline of history.</note>
                    That article was inspired by the work of geographer Doreen Massey. While Massey
                    is not a historian, the question with which she opens her book <title
                        rend="italic">For Space</title> is fundamental to the field: <quote
                        rend="inline" source="#massey2005">What might it mean… to question [the]
                        habit of thinking of space as a surface? If, instead, we conceive of a
                        meeting up of histories, what happens to our implicit imagination of time
                        and space?</quote>
                    <ptr target="#massey2005" loc="4"/>. Using Massey’s work to insist that the
                    relationship between history and geography is more than the sum of <q>time</q>
                    plus <q>space,</q> Mostern argued that practicing critical and temporally minded
                    geography means describing, mapping, and analyzing the spatial intersection of
                    multiple narratives rather than simply producing singular histories of change
                    over time; in particular by investigating the ways in which such intersecting
                    historical events and processes create space and place. Mostern’s article
                    concludes that studying the geography of connections among peoples – whether
                    structurally á la world-systems theory, or empirically á la world history –
                    offers a way for historians to develop a more theoretically informed and
                    analytically agile spatial humanities practice. </p>
                <p>The current article is still not intended to articulate a complete theoretical
                    foundation for spatial history, but it proposes four propositions that can
                    support digital spatial visualization and analysis, permit the framing and
                    resolution of interesting and unique historical questions, justify the adoption
                    of particular methods, and assist in review and comparison. This is an
                    intellectual basis for critiquing and evaluating spatial history work. </p>

                    works of GIS implementation. In the concluding section of the article, we will
                    suggest review standards for spatial history works that are consistent with this

                <p> Since we intend this article to inform peer review and critique, it may seem
                    counterintuitive that the next two sections of it concern pedagogy. However,
                    given the nascent state of scholarly review for spatial history, at present
                    there are effectively no professional platforms for reviewing digital atlases.
                    By contrast, any instructor with training in the field and the opportunity to
                    design an appropriate course can assign students to create such works and
                    complete them in the course of an academic term. Moreover, good teaching and
                    fair grading compels instructors to precisely dictate the components of the
                    atlas and the standards for its successful accomplishment. For these reasons,
                    the classroom is an ideal location for learning to specify genre characteristics
                    and review criteria. It is true that scholarly critique is a different task from
                    grading and that analogous scholarly works differ from one another more than
                    student projects do. We will discuss these matters in the last section of the
                    paper. Nevertheless, we contend that it is precisely the controlled atmosphere
                    of a classroom that makes it a good place to begin the neglected practice of
                    describing digital atlases as a genre, determining whether individual exemplars
                    are consistent with the aims of spatial history, and comparing them to one
                    another. </p>
                <p>Following from our emphasis on improved intellectual grounding for spatial
                    history, our first proposal is that a historian teaching spatial approaches to
                    the past should teach history, albeit with an understanding of disciplinary
                    geography and interdisciplinary approaches to spatial theory adequate for
                    introducing relevant concepts and methods. There has recently been extensive
                    advocacy for the notion of cross-disciplinary <q>spatial literacy</q> or
                        <q>spatial thinking</q> as a goal in its own right. However, spatial
                    reasoning in support of spatial history is only a specialized portion of the
                    domain of spatial reasoning. Indeed, in its focus on historical processes and
                    human agency in landscape formation and transformation, spatial history is at
                    the margins of the spatial literacy field as it has been articulated to
                    date.</p>
                <p>The notion of spatial literacy embraces some modes of thought and practice that
                    are not at all relevant to the issues raised in the first section of this paper.
                    According to an influential 2006 National Research Council report entitled
                        <title rend="italic">Learning to Think Spatially: GIS as a Support System in
                        the K-12 Curriculum</title>, spatial thinking can be equally applied to
                    spaces both abstract and concrete: life spaces, physical spaces, and
                    intellectual spaces. Its disciplinary heritage emerges from math as much as
                    geography. It includes thinking <emph>in</emph> space, or proxemics, which
                    measures the kind of reasoning that allows people to efficiently load a truck,
                    find their way, or park a car. These skills are not relevant to the spatial
                    humanities, though they may be the kinds of competencies that the authors allude
                    to in terms the relevance of spatial thinking to cognition and life skills.
                    However, spatial thinking also involves thinking <emph>about</emph> space, which
                    is the primary objective of the spatial humanities as well as many other
                    academic domains, and thinking <emph>with</emph> space, or working with maps and
                    spatial data.<note> University of Saskatchewan geographer Scott Bell helpfully
                        introduced these distinctions at a Learning Spatially (LENS) Mapping People
                        workshop at the University of Redlands that Mostern attended in June
                        2010.</note> Initially, one goal of the Silk Road class was to improve
                    spatial literacy among history students, following the National Research Council
                    recommendation that spatial literacy does not belong under the ownership of
                    geography departments, but should be instructed throughout the curriculum <ptr
                        target="#council2006"/>. It is reasonable to believe that, similar to such
                    established interdisciplinary fields of instruction as writing, critical
                    thinking, or quantitative reasoning, spatial literacy is mastered through
                    courses both within and beyond a discipline. Nevertheless, students most
                    effectively and meaningfully filter these kinds of learning experiences through
                    the conventions of a given discipline, as noted by a longitudinal study of
                    undergraduate learning at the University of Washington <ptr target="#beyer2007"
                    />. The lead author of this study, Catharine Beyer, suggests that instructors
                    need to think about improving student attainment of broad, interdisciplinary
                    learning outcomes in the context of majors and disciplines. By analogy with
                    professional spatial history practice, historians who design atlases should be
                    articulating how they are relevant to their fields. </p>

                <p>However, the National Research Council report also notes that it is still not
                    clear how to incorporate spatial thinking into existing curricula or how to
                    measure student proficiency in spatial reasoning outside of disciplinary
                    settings. Indeed, most spatial literacy and spatial thinking websites do not
                    promote curricula, learning outcomes, or assessment criteria. One representative
                    initiative, Spatial@UCSB, has developed a website that includes a page of
                    Learning Resources, prominently featuring a list of <q>spatial concepts as the driving force for spatial
                        thinking.</q>

                        likewise presents a variety of learning resources without defining the
                        domain or including tools for assessing competency in it <ref

                        appears to be taking on a mandate of developing practical classroom tools,
                        but it also falls short.</note> However, it does not detail any objectives
                    that would represent the attainment of spatial literacy, or suggest any
                    instruments that would indicate whether students are becoming spatially literate
                    or not.<note> See also Nora Newcombe, <title rend="quotes">A Plea for Spatial
                            Literacy,</title> linked from the Carlton website.</note> This critique
                    reinforces the need for teaching spatial thinking in disciplinary context and
                    for designing criteria targeted to given disciplines. Outside the classroom it
                    points toward our proposal to define an intellectual agenda for spatial history
                    and to evaluate the technical accomplishments of its works in its context.</p>
                <p>In the end, because of the conceptual breadth of the field, the difficulty of
                    gauging student success in it, and the marginality of historical analysis to the
                    geography mainstream, we came to criticize teaching or evaluating spatial
                    reasoning <foreign>per se</foreign> as a spatial history objective.
                    Nevertheless, there are specific concepts associated with spatial literacy,
                    primarily drawn from disciplinary geography, that can help undergird spatial
                    history practice. The Learning Spatially (LENS) initiative at University of
                    Redlands defines spatial thinking as <q>the
                        ability to visualize and interpret location, distance, direction,
                        relationships, movement and change through space.</q> This competence
                    overlaps with the theoretical propositions that we introduced in the first
                    section of this paper, though it does not embrace the notions of landscape
                    creation, transformation and occupation that we consider fundamental to spatial
                        history.<note> Various other spatial thinking and spatial literacy
                        initiatives are underway as well as those we have noted here. They include
                        the teachspatial.org site at UC Santa Barbara and the Spatial Intelligence
                        and Learning Center (SILC) at Temple. No participants in the field have
                        developed curriculum or learning outcomes for spatial literacy yet, though
                        discussions on the topic are underway. A book entitled Ontologies for
                        Spatial Thinking is under development based on a 2011 workshop at UC Santa

                <p>All of these have some relevance to theory and practice in the spatial history
                    profession and classroom and to a research agenda for spatial history.
                    Nevertheless, this list does not conform to the spatial history conceptual
                    agenda, since it does not focus upon social processes and changing phenomena
                    over time, but rather emphasizes spatial geometry. For these reasons, we only
                    implicitly instructed the Silk Road students about spatial thinking. Since
                    competence in spatial reasoning for history is not the same thing as spatial
                    literacy considered as an autonomous field, it was not feasible or desirable to
                    design assignments and assessments for evaluating history students’ proficiency
                    in these areas. Likewise, the quality of spatial thinking in spatial history
                    scholarship should be reviewed according to its contribution to history.</p>

                <head>IV. Traveling the Silk Road on a Virtual Globe</head>
                <p>In Spring 2010, as a professor of history and an expert in spatial history,
                    Mostern taught a class on the history of the Silk Road using digital history
                    methods. By the end of the semester, students were expected to be able to
                    describe how Silk Road travelers represented routes and places according to
                    particular historical and cultural circumstances; to communicate about
                    historical phenomena using integrated images, digital maps, digital timelines,
                    text, and hyperlinks, and to explain how long-distance Eurasian movements of
                    microbes, people, ideas, goods, and population shaped world history. By
                    producing atlases using Google Earth, they practiced many of the spatial
                    concepts included on the Spatial@UCSB list reproduced in the last section of
                    this article. However, they did so in the service of learning about the history
                    of the Silk Road and the experiences of its travelers.</p>
                <p> The Silk Road can refer to the steppe lands that stretch across Eurasia from
                    Hungary to the Pacific; or to the land and sea routes by which traders moved
                    goods and ideas between Africa, Asia, and Europe; or even to the broader notion
                    of cross-cultural exchange in the Old World. The content covered in this class
                    about the history of travel, exchange, and politics across Eurasia incorporated
                    tens of thousands of miles of territory, many of the world’s religions, dozens
                    of languages, and the entirety of human history from hominid migrations to
                    contemporary conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan.<note> A website about the
                        course, including the complete syllabus, is online at <ref

                </p>
                <p>The vast scope of a Silk Road class lends itself particularly well to a spatial
                    history approach focusing on the production and reproduction of landscape, the
                    geo-semantics of travel, and the notion of scale. Owing to constraints of
                    climate and topography, the travel routes that constituted the Silk Road were
                    limited and discrete, and amenable to reasonably accurate mapping. On land, Silk
                    Road travelers traversed some of the world’s most arid and high-altitude
                    terrain. On sea, they were at the mercy of particular ocean currents, wind
                    patterns, and safe harbors. Therefore, although routes changed over time, Silk
                    Road geography is organized around particular mountain passes, desert oases,
                    entrepôt cities, and ocean ports. Silk Road travelers exchanged goods — from
                    pepper to porcelain to lapis lazuli — that were mined, harvested, or
                    manufactured in distinct locales. Many travelers — Marco Polo is the best known
                    — wrote narratives about their journeys or became the subjects of biographies.
                    It is possible to reconstruct and trace the routes of Greek generals, Tibetan
                    foot soldiers, Khotanese dancers, Chinese monks, and Persian sailors, and to
                    study their experiences. </p>
                <p>Once a week throughout the semester, the Silk Road course was a conventional
                    history seminar, and once a week there was a lab session. There were no special
                    prerequisites for the 18 upper division history students enrolled in this
                    course. Students learned to use spreadsheet applications to organize
                    georeferenced information about Silk Road history, to write enough HTML code to
                    format attractive pop-up boxes that included images, captions, and text with
                    multiple colors and fonts, and to use Google Earth to create maps that depicted
                    historical narratives, including the modification of KML code to support
                    time-stamping. They used the History Engine episode format to describe events in
                    spatial history.<note> See <ref target="http://historyengine.richmond.edu"
                            >http://historyengine.richmond.edu</ref>.</note> At the end of the
                    semester, each student completed a digital atlas depicting the journey of one
                    Silk Road traveler.<note>For a good introduction about issues to consider

                        journey, and link to pop-up boxes that describe the episodes that occurred

                <p>As the basis for their research and atlas development, the students each selected
                    a Silk Road travel narrative to study during the semester.<note> UC Merced was
                        founded only in 2005, and the library has limited print holdings. Students
                        selected the travelers they wished to study by consulting Silk Road websites
                        and then ordered print copies of the narratives and appropriate secondary
                        works using interlibrary loan, which provides UC Merced students easy access
                        to the entire ten-campus University of California collection.</note> They
                    wrote ten-page research papers about their chosen narratives, and in addition,
                    they mined them for spatial information. They researched the contemporary
                    equivalents of historical names in order to create gazetteers of the places the
                    travelers visited, determined the travelers’ routes from place to place, and
                    wrote short descriptions of the travelers’ experiences at particularly
                    significant places. They created interactive maps that integrated all of this
                    material, including even thumb-tacking their term papers, which focused on the
                    geographic aspects of their travelers’ narratives, to their maps. At the end of
                    the semester, with the permission of the students and the assistance of the UC
                    Merced library, Mostern created a video showcasing their accomplishments and
                    depicting the features of the maps they created. It played on screens in the
                    library throughout the Fall 2010 semester, and is available on YouTube and on a
                    public website about the class.<note> The YouTube video is available on the

                <p>In addition to the sources that we have mentioned thus far, Edward Ayers’ use of
                    the History Engine collaborative database authoring tool at the University of
                    Richmond was another inspiration for the class. Ayers’ students use the History
                    Engine to integrate primary source interpretation and historical research to
                    create temporally and spatially referenced content. Like the digital atlas
                    assignment, teaching with History Engine is grounded in theory as well as
                    embodied practice. As he explains: <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#bodenhamer2010">The episodes in the History Engine embody the
                        principles of practice theory. …The History Engine shows that, at base,
                        history is where singular events and larger patterns intersect…The History
                        Engine shows how pattern, structure, event, and change are embodied at the
                        local and personal level, in a collage of moments</quote>
                    <ptr target="#bodenhamer2010" loc="8–9"/></cit>. Just as we did in the Silk Road
                    class, Ayers used digital tools because they helped him teach historical
                    principles, not because he wished impart technical mastery for its own sake.</p>
                <p>Support from the UC Merced Center for Research on Teaching Excellence (CRTE)’s
                        <title rend="quotes">Educating Future Faculty to Engage with a New
                        Demographic</title> grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Post
                    Secondary Education (FIPSE) allowed Elana Gainor to work as a graduate research
                    assistant embedded in the class to evaluate teaching materials, assess student
                    learning, and identify relevant literature about active learning and evaluation
                    in a spatial history classroom. During the semester, with assistance from CRTE
                    staff, Gainor designed and conducted two focus group interviews, one online
                    survey, and one written survey of the students enrolled in the class. The
                    surveys included open ended as well as scaled questions. The scaled questions
                    offered quantifiable data, and the open-ended questions provided insight
                    pertaining directly to the students’ thoughts and ideas. Gainor administered one
                    survey halfway through the course and one at the end. The first survey focused
                    upon students’ understanding of the learning outcomes of the class and their
                    general response to Google Earth. The second survey asked them to reflect on the
                    original survey questions once they had completed their projects. The
                    discussions in the focus groups were based upon the survey responses, but they
                    also gave students the opportunity to speak directly with Gainor and allowed her
                    to assess student progress. </p>
                <p>We used the survey and focus group results during the semester to make
                    adjustments to the class, especially when they indicated the need for further
                    instruction. That data is also the basis for the claims regarding the success of
                    the class that we will make in the next section of this paper. There were 18
                    students in the class: too small a sample to establish statistical significance.
                    Nevertheless, the survey data establishes a baseline to use as a benchmark for
                    future comparison, and it is qualitatively meaningful. Moreover, the act of
                    creating the survey allowed us to consider what information would best reveal
                    student learning and accomplishment. For that reason, the surveys were essential
                    for determining and testing review criteria.</p>
                <p>Support from CRTE was critical to the success of the course in another respect as
                    well. At present, humanities instructors are inhibited from designing
                    assignments that utilize new technologies. One significant factor is that, as is
                    equally true in the profession at large, standards and rubrics for evaluating
                    student work in digital media have not kept pace with changes in technology.
                    Instructors cannot design digital assignments if they cannot determine how to
                    grade them, just as peer reviewers cannot assess their colleagues’ work. In
                    addition we worried about grading students on the basis of work submitted in a
                    medium that they had never used before. Since this was a history class, we did
                    not want to unduly penalize them for lack of aptitude with the tool if their
                    conceptual grasp of spatial history and Silk Road history were good. Few of them
                    had ever been graded on any history assignment other than papers and exams.
                    Moreover, even outside the classroom, although interactive digital maps are
                    widespread, no standards or guidelines have been developed for them, either for
                    students or for professionals. We knew that it would be particularly important
                    to design and communicate clear standards and expectations. In order to
                    accomplish that, we employed three approaches. </p>
                <p>First, we created short assignments, due throughout the semester, that led up to
                    the final digital map submission. The digital atlas project constituted 65% of
                    the semester’s grade, but it was assembled additively from multiple assignments,
                    none of which was individually worth more than 30% of the grade. In addition, we
                    developed and circulated very detailed lab slides and held extended office
                    hours, particularly before the final due date. Finally, and of most significance
                    for this article focused on review and assessment standards, we developed a
                    detailed rubric that listed the components of a digital map project, explained
                    our expectations about each component, and provided advice. Appendix 1 is the
                    rubric that we developed. Our objective in designing the rubric was to clearly
                    and comprehensively list the components that the atlases should contain and the
                    standards by which we would evaluate each component. Our intent was twofold.
                    First, that students should understand what they were being asked to accomplish:
                    what we meant by a digital atlas, and how we were measuring success. Second,
                    that each atlas should have a very similar structure so that in spite of the
                    complexity and novelty of the atlas format we would be able to compare students’
                    accomplishments in a fair and reasonably objective way. </p>
                <p>We opted against using a standard grid-based rubric. The atlases required an
                    unusual and paradoxical degree of both creativity and standardized structure. We
                    developed the rubric according to Bob Broad's guiding concept from <title

                    <ptr target="#broad2003" loc="3"/></cit>. We wanted to ensure that the rubric
                    constrained the atlas structure without inhibiting creative accomplishment.
                    Thus, we structured the rubric as an outline that detailed the elements each
                    atlas had to include, set standards for each element, and explained how each
                    element would be evaluated. The rubric was like a journal’s style guide, in that
                    it allowed authors creativity and flexibility in content while imposing a
                    standardized format. In keeping with Broad’s concept of <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#broad2003">dynamic criteria mapping</quote>
                    <ptr target="#broad2003" loc="41"/></cit>, we described exemplary accomplishment for
                    each element, but we did not develop a formula to match descending grades with
                    particular deficiencies.</p>
                <p>The rubric had three categories that reflected the range of historical analysis,
                    spatial thinking, and technical accomplishment required to create a successful
                    digital atlas. As we will discuss in the final section of this paper, these
                    categories collectively represent the mission of a digital atlas in the
                    profession as well as the classroom. Digital atlases, like the pages of print
                    historical atlases, include significant written elements, which usually include
                    an overview as well as commentary about particular map elements. Print atlases
                    also rely on cartography to illuminate the theme of each atlas page. Finally,
                    the graphic and written elements of an atlas reinforce one another.<note>
                        <ptr target="#grossner2010"/> includes an excellent review of the
                        characteristics of print atlases.</note>Reflecting that analogy, the
                    categories of the rubric were Writing, Spatial Reasoning and Visualization, and
                    Storytelling and Integration. Each of those areas had subcategories, and each
                    subcategory detailed specific benchmarks. For instance, because place and
                    itinerary are so important in spatial history, the rubric explained that every
                    atlas was intended to include a gazetteer with at least 15 georeferenced
                    locations and descriptions of them, with locations connected by routes depicted
                    as lines. The cartography for every atlas needed to demonstrate a communicative
                    visual style (which we defined as clear and consistent iconography, objects
                    distinguished from one another by category, and a title and legend), incorporate
                    contextual information (such as the boundaries and extent of regimes, important
                    cities or ports near the traveler’s route, and overlaid maps), zoom and tilt
                    settings that controlled visibility in an appropriate way, and an animated tour
                    or flythrough. The rubric explicitly enumerated all of those facets. We
                    circulated a draft of the rubric to the students, then scheduled a lab session
                    to walk through the draft point by point, and we encouraged students to ask
                    questions for clarification and to offer feedback, which we incorporated into a
                    revised version. The process granted the students some ownership over the format
                    of the work they would submit. As the students embarked upon their atlas
                    designs, our vision and grading standards were clear to them – and to us as
                    well. </p>
                <p>All of the atlases were intended to illustrate a clear historical argument about
                    a single personage based upon one primary text, and to this end, the students
                    were required to finish a draft of their term papers prior to embarking on their
                    atlas designs. This helped to ensure that students were good historians first,
                    and that they were using spatial reasoning and digital tools in support of their
                    work as historians. The atlases themselves reflected core humanistic practices
                    of research and communication. The rubric and course goals could have been more
                    explicitly spatial, but they were not, because we were not teaching spatial
                    literacy as such. Rather we introduced spatial reasoning in the context of
                    spatial history. We advocate the same approach to evaluating the technical
                    aspect and the intellectual content of digital atlases in a professional
                    context.</p>

                <p>Both the quality of the work the students submitted and the experiences that they
                    shared through surveys and course evaluations reveal that they learned a great
                    deal about spatial history reasoning, Silk Road history, and digital atlas
                    development. Their growing competence in each of these areas reinforced their
                    capacities in the others, and their performance and satisfaction exceeded that
                    of students in other classes. However, as we will discuss in more detail below
                    and as other recent research on the topic affirms, they were not the <q>digital
                        natives</q> we had presumed before the semester began.<note> A November 2011
                        special report from the <title rend="italic">Chronicle of Higher Education
                        </title>concludes that although today’s college students use digital
                        technology for many purposes, they are not necessarily <q>digital
                            learners</q> who know how to work with their technology, and they do not
                        necessarily prefer to learn with technology or in online environments. As we
                        learned in the Silk Road course, the <title rend="italic">Chronicle of
                            Higher Education </title>advocates much more study about what technology
                        in the classroom works, and what does not. <title rend="quotes">Online

                    routine editing tasks, but the time students devoted to those tasks paid off in

                        atlases are direct evidence of their ability to reason about historical
                        geography and use multimedia spatial visualization to communicate about it.
                        When we circulated the rubric to the students, we guaranteed them that any
                        atlas that met all the benchmarks it enumerated would receive at least a B
                        range grade. The grade breakdown was as follows:</p>

                    <p>Sixteen out of 18 students in this course met or exceeded the standards we
                        set for a complex multimedia project that involved short and long form
                        writing, visual storytelling, map design, georeferencing, and even simple
                        coding. Half of the students exceeded our minimum standards for success and
                        earned A range grades. None received grades below C. By comparison, the
                        grade breakdown for the students’ research papers about the travel
                        narratives they selected is a more typical range of grades for students
                        enrolled in one of Mostern’s upper division courses. Fewer than a third of
                        the students earned A range grades, and almost a quarter earned grades in
                        the C range or below. Half of the students in the class clustered in the B
                        range. Counterintuitively, students less successfully demonstrated
                        proficiency at writing research papers, a core competency of the history
                        major, than at developing atlases, which involved multiple novel skill sets. </p>
                    <p>The surveys that Gainor conducted with CRTE support also offer evidence of
                        their accomplishments, and they help to explain the seemingly incongruous
                        results presented above. The surveys reveal that almost 80% of the students
                        felt that they learned more about history in this course than in a standard
                        history course, though half of their class time was occupied by computer
                        labs. This is a noteworthy finding, since the class involved less assigned
                        reading and less time for discussion than a more orthodox class. A large
                        percentage of them also felt that they worked no harder than they would in
                        another history class, although we assigned more work, requiring more
                        disparate skills, than in most of Mostern’s other courses. Students doubted
                        their capacity to work with the technology at first, but took pride in their
                        proficiency by the end of the semester. Appendix 2 is a series of charts and

                    <p>We did not develop instruments for measuring spatial literacy <foreign>per
                            se</foreign>. Moreover, students could not consistently articulate their
                        spatial thinking in language familiar to geographers, and they were not
                        adept with a wide range of tools for spatial analysis and visualization.
                        Nevertheless, by the end of the semester, they had completed sophisticated
                        spatial history projects that exceeded our expectations. Spatial reasoning
                        need not be framed as a new kind of literacy. Rather, it may best be
                        characterized as an approach that engages with capacities that many students
                        already possess. They can learn skills and procedures that allow them to
                        articulate what they know and incorporate it into other kinds of academic
                        reasoning. More advanced techniques and precise concepts would best be
                        instructed in a different class, most likely in geography rather than
                        history.</p>

                    <p>This was a rewarding and enjoyable course to teach, but it was time
                        consuming. We had not used any advanced Google Earth functions before the
                        semester began, but as people with backgrounds in spatial history and a high
                        comfort level with digital tools in general, we found the application
                        intuitive. The tutorials on the Google Earth website were particularly
                        helpful. However, the students did not all share our facility with the
                        software. In general, they did not demonstrate a <q>digital native</q>
                        advantage. Certain skills that we considered to be matters of basic user
                        technique were new to many of them: right-clicking to see properties (for PC
                        users); copying, cutting, pasting, and dragging objects efficiently, and
                        understanding file structures and file suffixes. They were most challenged
                        by interacting with code, which most of them had never done before, and some
                        of them found intimidating. They had to write simple HTML in order to format
                        Google Earth popup boxes, and they had to write simple KML to time-stamp
                        objects in Google Earth. It was difficult for some of them to understand
                        which editing platform and which commands governed which behavior in the
                        application. Some students were extraordinarily adept at some of these
                        tasks, and one was a former computer professional. However, the baseline of
                        computer knowledge and comfort for the class was low overall. </p>
                    <p>In order to teach Google Earth labs that were targeted to their level, to the
                        discipline of history, and to the Silk Road in particular, Mostern spent
                        many hours developing slides that used Silk Road geography examples to
                        demonstrate step-by-step techniques for completing each of the tasks for
                        which we would later hold them responsible. She also scheduled extended
                        office hours near the atlas due date to tutor any student who needed
                        assistance, to troubleshoot their atlases, and to check for compatibility
                        problems as she downloaded the atlases onto her computer. Preparation and
                        grading took more time and more creative effort than a conventional course
                        would have, and this approach is best suited to a small, upper-division
                        course. </p>
                    <p>There were also challenges inherent in the decision to use Google Earth, a
                        free but commercial tool that was not developed specifically for classroom
                        use, historical content, or publishing authored works. The choice between
                        community-built and commercial tools in humanities computing is a common
                        trade-off, and Google Earth – accessible, intuitive, feature-rich,
                        well-documented, and integrated with the whole Google ecosystem – had plenty
                        of advantages over any other viable option. Still, it was not ideal. The
                        template for exporting georeferenced content from a Google Docs spreadsheet
                        into Google Earth was difficult to use; and this made it hard to work with
                        gazetteers, which are an essential part of digital atlas infrastructure.
                        Moreover, Google Earth lacks a time-stamping interface, which is why
                        students needed to write a few lines of KML code in a text editor in order
                        to time-enable their data; and it lacks a GUI editor for pop-up boxes, which
                        is why they had to write HTML to create appealing placemark pop-ups that
                        included images and formatted text. It also lacks a publication layout mode,
                        so students had to handcraft legends and titles for their atlases outside of
                        Google Earth using image editing software, and import them as overlays.
                        While these procedures were not difficult, some students found them daunting
                        or confusing, and even for the most adept students, it was not ideal to be
                        required to manage and use so many tools. Finally, because Google Earth
                        Community, Google Earth’s public data repository, does not have a provision
                        for creating closed groups, there was no way for the students to share
                        content with one another short of making it public to the world. That would
                        have been an unreasonable and unethical requirement, so we asked students to
                        submit their digital map files using UC Merced’s course management system.
                        Although that was feasible, it meant that we were not able to fulfill one of
                        our original goals. We had hoped to permit students to compare their maps to
                        one another and to reason about their differences. For instance, if they had
                        been able to evaluate how different atlases located the <q>same</q> place at
                        somewhat different points on the map, it would have been a powerful lesson
                        in the spatial ambiguity of historical maps.</p>
                    <p>The Silk Road class included instruction in multiple software tools and
                        applications, spatial thinking and visualization, computer wrangling, and a
                        relatively abstruse historical topic. It demanded that students complete a
                        research project that demonstrated their proficiency in all of those
                        domains, in spite of the fact that none of them had with experience with
                        more than a few of these areas at the beginning of the semester. Many
                        factors contributed to the success of the course. Among them, we
                        particularly credit our insistence upon clear standards for the digital
                        atlas. This permitted students to focus on communicating about spatial
                        history without having to invent unique digital formats. We are convinced
                        that the development of structures and criteria for digital atlases in the
                        profession would have a similar benefit for authors and developers in the
                        profession. For that reason, we turn next to review criteria in the digital
                        humanities.</p>

                <head>VII: Evaluation and Review in the Digital Humanities</head>
                <p>As we have argued, pedagogy is a useful point of entry for contemplating issues
                    of authorship and assessment that are significant throughout the digital
                    humanities and spatial history in particular. We taught the Silk Road course in
                    part to determine whether a digital atlas could be reviewed effectively as a
                    work of history. Student work may be simpler and more standardized then
                    professional work, but it need not differ categorically. A history student’s
                    research paper adheres to the same format as a journal article, and the student
                    author aspires to excellence according to the same criteria as the professional.
                    We believe that the same is true of digital atlases, and therefore that it is
                    reasonable to develop digital atlas style guides and evaluation criteria to
                    guide developers and peer reviewers. </p>
                <p>A recent special issue of <title rend="italic">MLA Profession</title> devoted to
                    digital literary and media scholarly evaluation is germane to these issues. An

                        <title rend="italic">Profession </title>issue notes that although humanities
                    disciplines have acknowledged <q>to
                        the point of redundancy</q> the need for a system of reviewing digital
                    scholarship for publication and evaluating its practitioners for tenure and
                    promotion, <q>practical change has

                        it also remains impenetrable to most of their colleagues.</q> Although
                    digital humanists have largely persuaded colleagues and professional
                    organizations that digital scholarship needs to be taken seriously, the field
                    has not yet provided direction about how to evaluate it. As Geoffrey Rockwell
                    explains to <title rend="italic">Inside Higher Education</title>, digital
                    humanities scholarly review is neglected <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#rockwell2011">not for lack of will, but of methodology.</quote>

                    </note> In <title rend="italic">Profession</title>, Rockwell distinguishes
                    between digital research, which is an activity, and digital scholarship, which
                    is an outcome that can be shared <ptr target="#rockwell2011" loc="152"/>. When
                    we asked the Silk Road students to produce term papers prior to embarking upon
                    atlases and then graded the atlases for their capacity to enrich the papers, it
                    was because we were teaching them to produce scholarship. That is also why we
                    designed learning outcomes that were specific to history rather than basing them
                    upon spatial literacy criteria.</p>
                <p>We developed the rubric for the Silk Road student atlases with the conviction
                    that the digital atlas was a coherent genre that reflected spatial history
                    theory as well as digital technique. Likewise, several <title rend="italic"
                        >Profession </title>authors explore the attributes and taxonomies of digital
                    works, recognizing that determining a set of features for authors to master and
                    for reviewers to evaluate is essential for review. For instance, Steve Anderson
                    and Tara McPherson specify the elements of multimedia scholarship: multiple
                    media, user interactivity, a networked or database structure, nonlinear
                    components, and <quote rend="inline" source="#anderson2011">a heightened
                        attention to aspects of design, aesthetics, or form,</quote> along with
                    infrastructure or systems development when works require new capacity in those
                    areas <ptr target="#anderson2011" loc="137"/>. Rockwell proposes a typology of
                    digital scholarly works. Some of them, like online journal articles, can be
                    reviewed using established procedures, while others, like blogs, may not be
                    amenable to review at all. Some contributions, including tools and software,
                    scholarly editions, and multimedia works, are creative works that require new
                    methods for appraising scholarly significance <ptr target="#rockwell2011"/>.
                    Jerome McGann contends that <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#mcgann2011">It’s
                        important to remember that information technology has not altered the
                        fundamental mission of the humanities: to preserve, investigate, and rethink
                        our cultural inheritance</quote><ptr target="#mcgann2011" loc="184"/></cit>. The
                    task of evaluation is to identify how creative works in particular digital
                    genres accomplish that goal. </p>
                <p>We concur with Anderson and McPherson and with Rockwell that multimedia works
                    have genres and identifiable conventions. A digital atlas has little in common
                    with a network visualization or a portal into a document collection – no more so
                    than a critical essay has in common with a short story or a library catalogue in
                    the print domain, for instance – except that all of the former were created
                    and/or disseminated using computer assisted methods. The review standards for
                    various types of work will differ considerably. So, as we did with the atlas, we
                    advocate that digital humanists identify genres within their own domain
                    expertise, distinguish them from one another, determine the suitability of
                    particular techniques for achieving specific scholarly goals, enumerate the
                    elements of successful accomplishment, and define standards that can be used to
                    evaluate each element. That is the work that the rubric performed in the Silk
                    Road classroom. </p>
                <p>We celebrate scholarly and creative work that crosses boundaries, undergoes
                    continuous modification, and requires collaboration – in text, visual culture,
                    and performance as well as digital modes. However, it cannot be reviewed
                    effectively, at least not until after we learn more about how to assess less
                    experimental accomplishments.<note> As Jerome McGann points out, collaborative
                        and socially authored works are difficult to review, and the ones most
                        familiar to the humanities academy are <cit><quote rend="inline"
                            source="#mcgann2011">fundamentally stand-alone operations</quote>
                        <ptr target="#mcgann2011" loc="192"/></cit>.</note> In the meantime, many digital
                    humanities practitioners are completing works that meet existing criteria for
                    humanistic scholarship. They can be evaluated based on whether their content
                    contributes to humanistic colloquy. </p>
                <p>The introduction to the <title rend="italic">Profession</title> forum on digital
                    humanities evaluation notes that not all work in the digital humanities adheres
                    to established academic modes such as criticism and analysis. Thus some authors
                    advocate that we <cit><quote rend="inline" source="#anderson2011">shift our notions
                        of humanities scholarship away from a fixation on product and even
                        publication</quote>
                    <ptr target="#anderson2011" loc="141"/></cit>, that we abandon <quote rend="inline"
                        source="#nowviskie2011">an outmoded and sometimes patently incorrect
                        vision of solitary scholarship</quote> in favor of implicit and ongoing peer
                    review via collaboration itself <ptr target="#nowviskie2011" loc="170"/> and
                    that we conduct review by assessing the community’s engagement with a work
                    through comments and hyperlinks rather than via anonymous evaluation by subject
                    experts <ptr target="#fitzpatrick2011"/>. These recommendations for new
                    practices in the humanities are ingenious and bracing, and they may represent a
                    possible future. At the same time, as McGann says, <cit><quote rend="inline"
                        source="#mcgann2011">while digital technology is introducing new critical
                        methods and procedures, it does not fundamentally alter the sociologies of
                        scholarship and education or their institutional mechanisms</quote>
                    <ptr target="#mcgann2011" loc="192"/></cit>. Taking an experimental and open-ended
                    approach to digital humanities scholarship and review ensures that it cannot be
                    effectively ingested into actually existing academic institutions. As a
                    practical matter, that will keep digital work isolated, if not marginal. It is
                    problematic from an intellectual point of view as well. As long as we treat
                    digital works as if they are all idiosyncratic and incommensurable, we cannot
                    improve our practices, we cannot put our accomplishments in conversation with
                    one another, and we cannot use them to expand and enrich our understanding of
                    the world. In the end, we contend that while form is important to the digital
                    humanities, it should be assessed based upon its appropriateness to the content
                    and argument in a given field, and not simply its elegance or novelty. We
                    advocate assessing and critiquing digital works with respect to their
                    effectiveness for scholarly communication.</p>

                <head>VIII: From the Classroom to the Profession</head>
                <p>At the beginning of this article, we proposed four propositions for enriching
                    spatial history. First, landscapes are constructed by human action. Second,
                    itineraries create spatial relationships. Third, both processes and events
                    transform landscapes. And fourth, spatial and temporal scale determines whether
                    a landscape and its changes are visible to occupants and/or scholars. A
                    successful digital atlas is a scholarly work that illuminates one or more of
                    these concepts using methods appropriate to its topic and purpose. The Silk Road
                    student atlases, for instance, were cartographic narratives of long-distance
                    journeys based on works of travel writing. </p>
                <p>The criteria we developed for the student atlases apply to atlas developers and
                    reviewers in the profession as well. A digital atlas, an integrated multimedia
                    work of scholarship with a map interface, should include:</p>
                <list type="ordered">
                    <item>Long form writing that makes a spatial history argument.</item>
                    <item>Short form writing and illustrations that explain the significance of
                        specific locations and geo-located events to the overall work. </item>
                    <item>A map interface that includes the places, routes, fields and other spatial
                        objects that comprise the landscape in question. </item>
                    <item>User control of spatial and temporal visibility and scale.</item>
                    <item>A clear, attractive, coherent and intuitive user experience.</item>
                    <item> Effectively integrated written and cartographic components.</item>
                </list>
                <p>For authors and developers, these guidelines support both consistency and
                    creativity, while readers and reviewers can use them to judge and compare a wide
                    range of works and assess their contributions to the spatial history field. The
                    profession is a less constrained environment than the classroom. Nevertheless,
                    an academic field like spatial history is still a distinct milieu, and the
                    conventions that guide peer review are always quite specific. The review
                    standards we are proposing here are intended to be suitable for spatial history,
                    and not to all work in the digital humanities. The classroom experience is
                    relevant to evaluation criteria in the profession. This article explains how we
                    defined the intellectual terrain of a digital humanities field, created student
                    assignments specific to it, and used that experience to propose standards for
                    professional developers and reviewers. We urge specialists in other digital
                    humanities fields to do the same. </p>
                <p>In <title rend="italic">Online Humanities Scholarship: The Shape of Things to

                    review of a digital atlas: <title rend="italic">The Grub Street Project</title>,
                    a depiction of the publishing world in eighteenth century London. Darnton
                    praises the project for its maps, its visuality, and its efforts to approach an
                    ideal of <foreign>histoire totale</foreign> through a spatial interface,
                    extensive context, and hyperlinked text. In its form, it is consistent with the
                    criteria we introduced above. However, he additionally interrogates its
                    contribution to history. In his view, the atlas comes up short by that standard,
                    for conceptually it does not go beyond a 1972 print article on the same topic
                        <ptr target="#darnton2010"/>. Our point here is not to stake a claim about
                    the atlas in question, which concerns a topic about which we have no expertise.
                    It is rather to applaud Darnton’s insistence on asking humanistic questions
                    about it and not only praising its rich detail and technological accomplishment;
                    and to commend the editors of the volume in which the review was published for
                    soliciting a response to the digital atlas from a leading cultural historian who
                    is not a digital humanities practitioner. We reiterate, and we concur with
                    Darnton, that a digital atlas needs to be critiqued for its contribution to the
                    field of spatial history, and not only as a formal accomplishment.</p>
                <p>In the end, we propose to hold digital atlases to existing standards for
                    humanistic scholarship and to emerging genre conventions. The classroom, an
                    ideal site for sustained, fair and actionable evaluation, can also serve as a
                    laboratory for the development of digital humanities standards. Although the
                    Silk Road atlases that the students produced are yeoman work, they exemplify a
                    space in the digital humanities for projects which are creative but
                    self-contained, and which use standard and tested technology. The <title
                        rend="italic">Profession</title> contributors insist that digital humanists
                    need to educate outsiders to the field about our practices. We contend that we
                    have work to do internally that is even more important: to value – and to
                    evaluate – finished work that contributes to the disciplines.</p>

                    piece. The UC Merced Center for Research on Teaching Excellence was an
                    invaluable source of funding and advice, particularly CRTE staff members Anne

                    draft and offered helpful comments. Archaeologist Kathleen Hull and graduate
                    students Christine Clarkson and Michael Eissinger joined Ruth Mostern in a
                        <title rend="quotes">Time, Space and Process</title> graduate seminar where
                    she articulated many of the ideas in the first section of this article. </p>

                <figure>
                    <head> The digital and spatial focus of the Silk Road class influenced students’
                        perception about how much they learned. While there is no actual way to
                        measure learning by way of quantity, the responses to this question accord
                        with Bob Broad’s notion of learning via self-authorship, fostering agency
                        and independent thinking. <ptr target="#broad2003"/>
                    </head>
                    <graphic url="./resources/images/figure02.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <head> Students learned to reason spatially about historical phenomena by
                        learning to use Google Earth and other tools. These results show that
                        students felt that the use of Google Earth assisted them in learning about
                        history. In addition to their overall sense of satisfaction and high level
                        of learning in the course, over 75% of survey respondents were happy with
                        the appearance and functionality of their Google Earth project and 80% of
                        students said that they enjoyed working with Google Earth. </head>
                    <graphic url="./resources/images/figure03.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <figure>
                    <head>Students found the rubric useful. Students were involved with the creation
                        and implementation of the rubric, and they attributed their success in part
                        to the rubric. We infer that the rubric helped them to understand the
                        project and to recognize what was required for a successful final project.
                        The success of the rubric helps to explain the high final project grades for
                        the course.</head>
