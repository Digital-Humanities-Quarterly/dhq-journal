                  <p>The Hellespont project (DAI, Tufts University) aims to structure the text of a
                     passage from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides (1.89-118), in order to
                     highlight events, persons and peoples that populate the world of the author and
                     connect the different digital sources available for their study. Event
                     annotation in the text in particular requires an in-depth linguistic analysis of
                     morphology, syntax and semantics. However, the available resources for Ancient
                     Greek do not provide adequate standards to support the encoding of semantic and
                     pragmatic phenomena in Ancient Greek texts. In this paper, we discuss the
                     motivation of the project and how we adapted the so called
                     <em class="term">tectogrammatical annotation</em> of the Prague Dependency Treebank
                     to identify the events and describe their structure. The linguistic notion of
                     <em class="term">valency</em>, which is central to tectogrammatical sentence
                     representation, proves very useful for this analysis of Ancient Greek.

                     "Words, Space, Time" and collected in this volume
                     attest, digital resources for the study of the Greek and Roman civilizations are
                     rapidly growing in quantity and quality. In many fields of Classical Studies
                     (such as digital archaeology or epigraphy), progress has been spectacular. In
                     other areas, however, the gap between the resources that can be applied for
                     studying the ancient world and the state-of-the-art technologies for processing
                     and exploring data is still considerable. In terms of Natural Language
                     Processing (NLP), for instance, the resources for classical languages are still
                     far less numerous and sophisticated than those available for modern languages
                     such as English.

                     would enable readers to get a better understanding of the historical events that
                     are narrated in the text. On the other hand, we intended to lay the foundations
                     for a complex linguistic description of Ancient Greek that could also take
                     semantic and pragmatic phenomena into account, along with syntax and

                        dedicated to the war between the two superpowers of its times should mostly
                        contain narrations of events and that consequently it should not be
                        difficult to recognize and identify them in the flow of the text. The
                        reference model that <cite class="title">Arachne</cite> is currently adopting to link

                        that the common involvement in the same historical "event" or activity
                        is a point of contact between monuments, objects, actors, and places [<a class="ref" href="#doerr2003">Doerr 2003</a>].

                        and one actor (e.g. Themistocles) are involved in the same event (the
                        Athenians, following Themistocles' advice, rebuilt the city fortifications

                        that makes reference to that episode, the annotation would provide an
                        effective link between the archaeological traces of a given monument and the
                        text excerpt. Then, by setting up a chronology of the annotated events
                        (either absolute or relative), it becomes possible to create a timeline that
                        allows readers to access the related sources in the collection.

                        Yet the main problem with this approach is often one of granularity. In some
                        sections of the text, especially in the second half after chapter 98, the
                        style of the narration becomes quick and rather unadorned [<a class="ref" href="#hornblower1991">Hornblower 1991</a>, 149]: many facts appear to be piled up one after
                        the other. In such cases, readers are forced to summarize chapters and
                        paragraphs using general labels, while the stages and the articulation of
                        the facts remain difficult to capture. Thus, for example chapter 1.105 and
                        1.106 are summarized by <span class="error"><a href="#Hornblower1991">Hornblower (1991,

                        each sentence. Consequently, instead of taking textual units like chapters
                        or paragraphs as a basis for the annotation, we were forced to consider the

                        would have taken) should lead us to identify a core set of the narrated
                        events. Yet it is immediately clear that the last one of them does not
                        belong to the domain of history, but the verb mood characterizes the event
                        as the unrealistic outcome of a counterfactual hypothesis, both in Greek and
                        in the English translation. On the other hand, even the first verb, which
                        may seem to those familiar with Greek history to point to the main fact that
                        is referred to here (the Athenians are summoned to the siege of Ithome), is
                        not unproblematic. If we consider the sentence that precedes, which is
                        reported in brackets at the beginning of the translation, we see that
                        Thucydides is not reporting a new event, he's instead alluding for the
                        second time to the same episode he narrated in the previous sentence; the
                        main focus of the first quoted sentence is the cause that brought about the
                        Athenian intervention, while the fact that they were called in is simply
                        repeated from the preceding statement. This distinction, which may seem
                        trivial to the human reader and is most likely performed unconsciously by
                        them, requires a subltler linguistic distinction between given and new
                        information.

                        of the translation are entirely omitted in the Greek original, as it is
                        often the case with verb and noun arguments (and syntactic subjects in

                        Syntactic analysis, however, is not sufficient: subjects of active verbs and
                        agents of passive verbs are obviously distinguished in syntax, and yet these
                        arguments play the same role in the performance of an action, as in the two

                        375,000 annotated words, including the complete text of the Homeric poems,
                        the extant opera of Hesiod and Aeschylus, as well as five tragedies of
                        Sophocles and the <cite class="title italic">Euthyphro</cite> of Plato. All the
                        texts are chunked into sentences and a complete morphological analysis
                        (including lemmatization) of each word is provided [<a class="ref" href="#bamman2009">Bamman et al. 2009</a>]. The syntactic function of the words in a sentence is described according
                        to a formalism inspired by dependency grammar [<a class="ref" href="#tesniere1959">Tesnière 1959</a>];
                        in this representation (which may be contrasted with a constituency-based
                        formalism, where words are grouped into phrases), the words are put directly
                        in relation with each other; thus, a subject is made to depend directly on
                        its governing verb, articles and attributes on the nouns they are referred
                        to, and so on. The set of relations between heads and dependents can thus be
                        visualized as a dependency tree, with acyclic, directed edges connecting the
                        words (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a> below). The annotation of
                        morphology and syntax is provided for every word in each text, including for
                        example particles and conjunctions, as well as for punctuation marks<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e579">[7]</a>. The morphological annotation and
                        the type of dependency grammar adopted by Perseus are modeled on two layers
                        (the morphological and the so-called <em class="term">analytical layer</em>) of the

                        tectogrammatical tree still represents the structure of a sentence as a
                        dependency tree, which is not different from what happens with the standard
                        syntactic annotation of the AGDT (compare the two trees of <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). In the prototypical cases, the main
                        verb dominates all the other words, both in analytic and tectogrammatical
                        trees. The nodes of a tectogrammatical tree, however, do not represent all
                        the words that are attested in the text, but only those which carry an
                        independent lexical meaning. Functional words, like prepositions and
                        conjunctions, or those words that introduce special nuances of meaning, like
                        modal verbs, auxiliaries, or articles, are not reproduced as nodes, but

                        <em class="term">valency</em> does indeed play a crucial role. The valency of a
                        word may be described as the list of the obligatory arguments that are
                        required in order to fill each of the particular meanings of a given word;
                        <a href="#tesniere1959">Tesnière (1959: 102)</a> speaks of the
                        valency arguments as the actors that play a part in the "drama" evoked by a word, and distinguish them from the
                        <em class="term">circumstantials</em> that are used to set the temporal, spatial
                        or discursive frame of an event. Valency arguments can be omitted whenever
                        they can be easily implied, but are semantically always required; they are
                        therefore always integrated in the tectogrammatical trees. To come back to
                        the example from Thucydides quoted above (1.102.2, see <a href="#event-view">Section 1.2</a>), all the "they" and
                        "them" within brackets in the English translation would correspond
                        to newly inserted nodes in the tectogrammatical representation of the Greek
                        original, for both subjects and (direct) objects belong to the valency of
                        the Greek verbs used in the sentences.

                        tectogrammatical annotation enables us to link not only the pronouns that
                        are explicitly used in the Greek original with either the Spartans or the
                        Athenians, but also the implied subjects of the verbs. Much more than a
                        modern translation, therefore, tectogrammatical sentence representation can
                        serve to disambiguate the interpretation of this passage.

                     arguments. Moreover, by using the definitions of the <span class="error"><a href="#LSJ1940">LSJ</a></span> lexicon that is linked with the valency frame in our dictionary,
                     we can choose to present the results of our investigations in English
                     translation, even if the data relate to the content of the original Greek text.
                     A visualization of the results for such a query, i.e. the English translations
                     of all the verbs that have the Athenians or a co-referenced node as the semantic
                     agent in the <cite class="title italic">Pentecontaetia</cite>, is given in the

                  this case not even the context is sufficient. This passage is
                  notoriously ambiguous and may support two different interpretations. In
                  the one adopted, Thucydides comments about the Spartans’ deficiency in
                  siege warfare (this is the interpretation reflected by the English
                  translations of <a href="#jowett1881">Jowett 1881</a> and <a href="#crawley1910">Crawley 1910</a>). But the Greek text
                  supports also a different reading, based on what we know of the sequel:
                  while the operations dragged on, the Athenians could not bring any
                  decisive aid to the siege and were therefore dismissed; probably, the
                  lack of progresses in the campaign was used as a pretext to hide the
                  political suspicions that the Spartans began to have on their former
                  allies, as Thucydides himself states (see 1.102.3-4). This passage can
                  then be translated accordingly, with the Athenians as the referent of
                  the pronoun <span class="foreign i">τοῖς</span> ("the Athenians' deficiency in siege-warfare became evident")
                  and (implied) subjects of <span class="foreign i">εἷλον</span> (not
                  even the Athenians could storm the fortress); this interpretation is
                  adopted by <a href="#classen1919">Classen (1919)</a>, <a href="#maddalena1952">Maddalena (1952)</a> and <a href="#deromilly1958">De Romilly (1958)</a>.

                  <em class="term">token</em>; in most cases, a treebank token corresponds
                  either to a word or  to a punctuation mark, but there are notable
                  exceptions. A frequent case of mismatch is represented by coordinating
                  conjunctions: the Greek equivalent of the English "neither", for
                  example, is analyzed in the treebank as two distinct tokens, one for the
                  negative particle, one for the coordinating conjunction. Sentence
                  tokenization is based on the punctuation of the edition of <a href="#jones1942">Jones and Powell (1942)</a>, as digitized in

                  action", and in that case it only requires an <em class="term">actor</em>
                  as argument; or it can be used with the meaning "to play a role",
                  like in the sentence "the Bank will act as a
                  trustee"; this second frame will include an

                  adjectives can of course have valency too. Their argument structures
                  (with ellipsis and co-reference resolution) have been annotated in the
                  text, but the entries for nouns and adjectives in the valency lexicon
