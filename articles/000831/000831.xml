                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>Accurate dating of historical texts is essential for understanding cultural and
                    historical narratives. However, traditional methods, such as paleographic and
                    physical examination, can be subjective, costly, and potentially damaging to
                    manuscripts. This paper introduces a machine learning approach to predicting the
                    authorship dates of historical texts by using named entities — specifically,
                    person and place names — as temporal markers. Using a dataset from Trismegistos,
                    which includes metadata on the earliest and latest possible writing dates, we
                    apply regression models to estimate text origins. While linear models like Lasso
                    and Ridge Regression showed limited success, nonlinear models, including Random
                    Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, performed significantly better, with
                    ensemble methods delivering the best results. The top-performing ensemble model
                    achieved a mean absolute error of 45.7 years, surpassing traditional techniques.
                    This study demonstrates the potential of named entities as temporal indicators
                    and the effectiveness of ensemble learning in capturing complex historical
                    patterns. Offering a scalable, non-destructive alternative to traditional
                    methods.</p>
