                  <p>This paper presents methodology and findings from a multi-case study exploring the
                     use of
                     					preservation and sustainability measures to increase access to digital humanities
                     (DH)
                     					content. Specifically, we seek to develop a workflow to both prepare DH content
                     for
                     					preservation while enhancing the accessibility of the project. This work is based
                     on the
                     					idea of treating DH as traditional data by applying data curation and digital
                     preservation
                     					methods to DH content. Our outcomes are an evaluation of the process and output
                     using
                     					qualitative methods, publicly accessible and described project components on
                     two Virginia
                     					Tech projects, and a potential workflow that can be applied to future work. By
                     breaking
                     					down individual projects into their respective components of content, code, metadata,
                     and
                     					documentation and examining each component individually for access and preservation,
                     we
                     					can begin migrating our digital scholarship to a sustainable, portable, and accessible
                     					existence.</p>

                     					without standards for access and preservation. However, various standards and
                     best

                     					of this paper is to explore the concept of DH as data and the application of
                     data curation
                     					methods to two DH projects at Virginia Tech (VT) in order to enhance access and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">At Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) there are currently eighteen DH projects
                     that
                     					we currently maintain on a technical level, may potentially maintain, or plan
                     to provide
                     					preservation services for project content. These projects are currently hosted
                     on local
                     					library servers, private servers we do not have access to, different departmental
                     servers,
                     					and two projects that are currently hosted outside of the university. Seven of
                     the
                     					projects are built on Omeka, four on Wordpress, and many were built using HTML
                     or other
                     					homegrown tools. These projects were created over a period of time ranging from
                     1996 to
                     					2021 with some having been static and unmaintained since the mid-2000’s. A survey
                     of these
                     					projects revealed that seven had some supplementary content (such as news articles,
                     					corresponding publications, presentations, and images) in our institutional repository
                     					VTechWorks, but only one of the projects had deposited raw data or content into
                     that
                     					repository. Further, only four projects mention or document details regarding
                     preservation
                     					and sustainability efforts for ongoing access. These projects are fragile with
                     an average
                     					lifespan of two to five years without human intervention, and as the University
                     					Library we are responsible for the maintenance of the open source resources created
                     by our
                     					VT community. In a larger effort to support these projects and other future digital
                     work,
                     					we chose to explore methods to preserve DH projects with a strategy that could
                     be
                     					reasonably implemented on a larger scale. This strategy is based on preserving
                     components
                     					of the DH project for reconstruction of the content in the future and documenting
                     methods
                     					to educate our digital scholars to create and modify their projects with preservation
                     in
                     					mind.</div>

                     					but can be summed up into a single concept. DH is uniquely located in the overlap
                     between
                     					the humanities, archives, and information technology, but unless a resource is
                     labeled
                     					DH-related, it may be overlooked. There are best practices, and general technical
                     					maintenance that are applied in several other fields, but may not cross into
                     DH education
                     					and infrastructure [<a class="ref" href="#barats_etal2020">Barats, Schafer, and Fickers 2020</a>]. By identifying these practices and
                     					testing their application specifically to DH without compromising the culture
                     and purpose,
                     					we can avoid reinventing new ways to curate digital content.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">For the purposes of this paper, we refer to the Digital Preservation Coalition definition
                     					of digital preservation as “the series of managed activities
                     					necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as
                     					necessary” [<a class="ref" href="#dpc">Digital Preservation Coalition</a>]. This is a widely adopted definition utilized
                     					by libraries and archives as it allows for varied approaches to preservation
                     based on
                     					needs. Although this paper is written in the context of an academic library,
                     it is also a
                     					resource for those creating DH projects and sustaining and preserving the digital
                     					components of their work. Further, we define a sustainable project as one that
                     can be
                     					supported financially, including the resources for storage, ongoing maintenance
                     and
                     					monitoring, unique technology needs, and time and effort from personnel. Finally,
                     					infrastructure refers to the technical scaffolding and organized governance necessary
                     to
                     					host, maintain, and preserve digital projects.</div>

                     of DH are

                     to
                     					generate, manipulate, and render information. Where DH lacks a community-supported

                        James

                        						collaboration with over a million dollars in funding, noting “the focus was on building the tool with the most features and not something that
                        						actually could be sustained or even worked” (<a href="#kirby2019">2019</a>). Even a 2013 JISC study surveyed DH Center Directors regarding

                        						this request by experimenting with the concept of DH as data with comprehensive
                        						exports of project content, the creation of necessary metadata, and the creation

                     <div class="ptext" id="p41">Within the DH field it is often necessary to learn at least one or multiple
                        						technologies from digitization, processing and quality control, metadata, website
                        						development, text mining, and so on to create successful digital scholarship.
                        With our
                        						two case studies, as well as many other projects at Virginia Tech, researchers
                        are
                        						largely self-taught and use popular platforms like Omeka to execute their work.
                        						Sometimes these projects are completed without direction or collaboration with
                        the
                        						library and are later brought to VTUL for maintenance and preservation. In the
                        case of
                        						older projects, many of these were built before VTUL had developed a preservation
                        						program, meaning that even those with the best intentions may have received
                        little
                        						direction in the area of preservation. Humanists are not trained in information
                        						technology, digitization standards, metadata standards, content management systems,
                        						storage management, and digital preservation, because that is not generally
                        required
                        						in the field. There is a balance between what technology is community-supported,
                        what
                        						is simple to adopt, and what is sustainable. What are considered foundational
                        DH
                        						skills may not incorporate IT best practices, digitization guidelines, or project
                        						management. The problem is paradoxical - what services can a library provide
                        to its
                        						faculty and students when there are no defined best practices to teach? The

                        						what makes DH so dynamic, but also causes formalization to be even more difficult

                     researchers
                     					to backtrack in order to adopt a different strategy or undergo deduplication.
                     Since there
                     					are few well-established standards specifically for DH as a field that have also
                     been
                     					adopted by the community, choosing best practices that support individual project
                     					components can aid in developing an entire infrastructure of components that
                     are
                     					supported, sustainable, and documented. As an example, in our case study with
                     the
                     					Redlining Virginia preservation package, we needed to identify a metadata standard

                     create a
                     					brand new metadata schema. While creators should be documenting as they develop,
                     this is
                     					not a usual experience and the effort may fall largely to the curator for technical

                     an
                     					institutional repository or an appropriate public repository and ensuring the
                     data fits
                     					the standard for that repository early on ensures a form of access and direct

                     					preservation copies and activities without the previously mentioned challenge
                     of revising
                     					content or metadata after development to conform to a repository. Preservation

                     Digital

                     over
                     					time and can be migrated or updated more smoothly. Reaching out to a university

                     					comparable institutional body to see what options are available for hosting and

                     task of
                     					managing dozens of projects with the same methodology is not a sustainable process
                     for two
                     					people to manage. Successful DH programs require dedicated and intentional infrastructure

                     be
                     					transparent about what tools are supported and for researchers to choose a tool

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">This paper explored the case studies performed on two Virginia Tech DH projects at
                     varying
                     					stages of complexity and age for the purposes of access and preservation. These
                     case
                     					studies aimed to compile project components, develop additional description and
                     					documentation, and prepare content for long-term access. The findings shaped
                     specific
                     					interventions utilized by VTUL and will be applied to additional DH projecfts.
                     The result
                     					was the appraisal of two DH projects for preservation and access needs and the
                     compilation
                     					of preservation-prepared datasets and corresponding documentation stored and
                     accessible
                     					through the Virginia Tech Data Repository. The other significant result was the
                     improved
                     					advocacy and support for our current and legacy DH projects as we work to maintain
                     and
                     					enhance VT digital scholarship through a newly established Library committee.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p53">Our current goal is to ensure that our DH projects at VTUL can be reconstructed or
                     					recreated in the event that access to the original format is lost. In the preservation
                     					field, emulation is the optimal form of preservation for access. As organizations
                     like SPN
                     					are already investigating the preservation and future accessibility of software
                     and as we
                     					are currently employing web archiving through Archive-It, our ideal goal would
                     be to
                     					ensure the usability of sites that cannot be migrated without losing integrity
                     can be
                     					emulated and reused. Web archiving can preserve the look and feel of the project
                     but may
                     					not be able to handle complex data manipulation software in a way that is meaningful
                     to a
                     					user, thus the need to think of the components of DH projects and what we can
                     do to
                     					preserve those as well as the look and feel.</div>
