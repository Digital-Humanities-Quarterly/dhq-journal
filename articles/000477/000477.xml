            <!--Include a brief abstract of the article-->
            <p>This paper presents a multicase study protocol for meta-research in Digital
               Humanities, prepared by Digital Methods and Practices Observatory (DiMPO) Working
               Group of the Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH).
               The protocol is intended to help researchers in conducting meta-research and adopting
               this methodology for different purposes, disciplines and approaches. As many of the
               issues raised here are already covered in manuals for social research, our focus is
               the specificity of meta-research in the DH environment. The specificity of DH in this
               respect relies on an intrinsic challenge of bringing together generally
               undertheorised approaches of the humanities with very formal and process-driven ICT
               approaches. </p>
            <p>The main assumption behind this research is that a meaningful change in scholarly
               practices is taking place and is worth investigating. Moreover, a full assessment of
               this transformation should not focus exclusively on pioneering research, but rather
               on the selective uptake of digital practices and methods by researchers in the
               humanities: those who do not necessarily affiliate themselves with DH but simply use
               digital tools to explore particular problems. Hence, this paper should be of interest
               not only to researchers willing to conduct meta analysis, but to all DH practitioners
               willing to gain critical perspective on their work, as well as for those working on
               funding, evaluation and research policy.</p>
            <p>Three pilot studies are discussed in this paper, as they served as a basis for the
               protocol. They focused on different <q>units of inquiry</q> (individual researchers,
               projects, research communities) and varied in methodological directions: (a)
               individual interviews with Polish DH researchers; (b) mixed-methods analysis of
               digital practice in E-CURATORS, a multicase SSHRC Insight project focusing on
               archaeological research sites or projects, integrating individual interviews,
               document analysis and naturalistic observation; and, (c) group interviews with
               historians and literary scholars conducted within the framework of NEP4DISSENT COST
               Action. The resulting protocol is discussed in detail and some directions for further
               research are suggested.</p>

         <p>These examples, selected out of many stemming from our meta-research into digital
            practices in the humanities (i.e. the study of research carried out with the help of
            digital technologies), illustrate how technology is penetrating unevenly into different
            stages of the research process: the discovery phase (<hi rend="italic">search &amp;
               access to research data</hi>); gathering activities (<hi rend="italic">data
               collection</hi>); conceptual work and organization of one’s research assets (<hi
               rend="italic">data curation</hi>), and computer-assisted analysis of the research
            assets (<hi rend="italic">data analysis</hi>). Invariably, these examples also
            problematise the institutional, custodial, and disciplinary nature of humanities
            research conducted within the confines of the physical archive, the geographically
            bounded community of scholars, and the materially constrained toolset of a single
            discipline. If scholarly research often now appears to transcend locality and place,
            methodological approaches to studying how scholars work should also adapt
            accordingly.</p>
         <p>As we come to reflect on how humanities research is shaped today by the physical and
            material factors that condition the work of researchers, as well as the new capabilities
            that the digital ecosystem affords, we see that there are micro-practices — visible in
            those examples described above — that fall outside both the traditional humanistic
            methods and what is usually considered Digital Humanities (DH). We understand DH in the
            broadest possible sense, as the <quote rend="inline">big tent</quote>
            <ptr target="#svensson2012"/> of digital practices, methods, tools and resources which
            inform various disciplines in the humanities. Moreover, we do not limit its scope to the
            core DH community of researchers advancing cutting-edge methodologies, but also look at
            scholars who would never call themselves digital humanists yet do take advantage of the
            digital to answer their non-digital research questions. <q>Big tent</q> DH recognizes
            that the importance of the digital is not limited to the use of computational,
            algorithmic methods for research, but has to do with the broader shift of the whole
            paradigm of humanities proper: the centrality of digital resources and access to them
            for all kinds of humanities work; changes in scholarly communication, peer review and
            publication where digital and online systems are central, inter- and
            cross-disciplinarity; as well as working with open content and open data, both digitised
            and born digital. </p>
         <p>In this way, we can see how research practices are fundamentally unpredictable: they do
            not fall under the umbrella of a single custodial environment but are rather assembled
            as a local response to a single project’s needs. To assemble them involves repeated acts
            of bricolage, tinkering with moving parts that were not designed to work together.
            Nowhere is the impact of this status more present than in the situatedness of humanities
            research, that is in the (self-) management of its physical, virtual and mental spaces.
            SPARKLE (Scholarly Primitives And Renewed Knowledge-Led Exchanges), one of the studies
            we reference below, showed in particular the degree to which location and spatial
            configuration were felt by the researchers interviewed to be integral to the
            productivity of the humanistic scholar <ptr target="#edmond2016"/>. We are perhaps used
            to this aspect of, for example, archive-based work, due to the external constraints of
            opening hours, reading rooms, and all the rest of what Arlette Farge refers to as their
               <quote rend="inline">absurd rules of operation</quote>
            <ptr target="#farge2013" loc="52"/>. But what perhaps has its roots in a time-management
            challenge progresses into what manifests as a highly individualised and expertly tuned
            set of spatial strategies. Even in the relatively small SPARKLE sample, there was
            essentially no agreement, of where the ‘best place’ to work might be. In part this was a
            reflection of adaptation to different life circumstances: senior academics with teaching
            and administrative responsibilities seemed generally to find their offices more rife
            with distraction than their home spaces, for example. It also sometimes indicated a
            separation, or multiple separations, between administrative work, personal life and
            research work. But even these general rules had exceptions, where the desire for
            work-life balance created yet further variation (libraries or coffee shops, for example,
            or working in the office but out of business hours, on weekends or in the evening). </p>
         <p>The nature of humanities research as being physically unbounded, or perhaps, more
            precisely, loosely and alternatingly bound to multiple places (the office, the archive,
            the classroom, indeed even the virtual environment or page of writing etc.) places it in
            stark contrast to laboratory science, in which the nature of the work space is very
            specific and determined, forming (at its most extreme extension) a guarantor of
            scientific credibility, that is a <q>clean</q> or <q>controlled</q> environment. The
            contrast between the closed physical space of the laboratory and nomadic nature of the
            humanistic knowledge-creation process, with its constant refreshing of sources,
            backdrops and inspirations, is reminiscent of the contrast between farmed agriculture
            and the hunter gatherer, with the pre-agrarian mode of subsistence being perhaps more
            dependent on shifting availability of resources in a wider space, but benefitting
            instead from a more multisensory, kinetic and synthetic mode of cultivation. </p>
         <p>The idea that objects should be organised in physical and mental space also
            interconnects with another theme that appeared across our study, which is that knowledge
            creation is an embodied process, encompassing far more than just the brain and its
            focussed sense of sight as an organ for processing source inputs. This is no less true
            in virtual than in physical spaces. Separation (of tasks, of ideas) and integration (of
            source material, with a community) are constantly in balance in the epistemic process,
            to the extent that one interviewee stressed the importance of technology for him in
            making it possible to access his entire personal source library from his computer at all
            times. These mental and physical environments, as well as the broader sensory world, of
            those engaged in historical humanistic research leads to an enduring dominance of
            multimodal personal research environments. In spite of the rise of digital humanities
            (which some, but not all, of the interviewees had embraced), historians still prefer to
            have notes, notebooks, pencils, post-its, books, printouts, and all manner of stimuli
            around them, in addition to their laptops and digital tools. This set of hybrid
            practices, spaces and tools are therefore customised to the questions and the knowledge
            base of the researcher(s) using them, and yet must also be flexible enough to
            accommodate research teams that evolve over time, software that is continually
            versioning up, and workflows that must be reinvented with every new experiment, even as
            they expand to incorporate new technological affordances. How can we study this kind of
            subtle and evolving phenomenon?</p>
         <p>This paper proposes an approach to qualitative meta-research into contemporary
            scholarship which enables us to track and understand novel research practices and assess
            their impact on scholarly activity as a whole. Our approach is based on several pilot
            studies, and our goal has been to use these studies as “ground truth” to support a
            theoretically-informed, highly original methodological framework for qualitative
            research on DH practice: a self-reflexive approach to DH practice which is often
            overlooked in existing empirical studies. The primary audience of this paper, given its
            methodological scope, are DH researchers willing to either conduct meta-research, or to
            critically evaluate their own work. We believe that this kind of research should be of
            interest to researchers willing to understand their own method and be empowered to be
            critical about their work (in particular people embarking on large-scale collaborative
            projects). Additionally, anyone interested in interdisciplinarity should find much to
            think about here as well. Beyond the academic, anyone looking to fund, evaluate, promote
            or integrate DH (whether as a Dean or funder or research manager or policy maker) could
            make use of this perspective.</p>
         <p>The rationale for meta-research in DH, viewed as an integrative framework, could be
            explained in four dimensions: ontology (how do we conceptualize the domain of research),
            epistemology (what is the knowledge we are seeking to produce), axiology (what values
            shape the object and process of our research, i.e., the infamous <q>so what</q>
            question), and methodology (research design and method selection to address these
            issues).</p>
         <p>At the ontological level we conceive of DH research as a practice based on symbolic
            interactions involving purposeful action by researchers. Hence DH is treated not merely
            as empirical reality (accessible only through empirical study) but also as consisting of
            such elements as motivations and norms of researchers, or goals and objectives served by
            their research choices, or the criteria, often implicit, of what constitutes <q>good
               research.</q> These ontological commitments bring our work close to the model of
            purposeful human activity established by cultural-historical activity theory <ptr
               target="#leontev1978"/>
            <ptr target="#engestrom2000"/>. Figure 1 offers an informal model representing this
            ontological view.</p>
         <p>As for epistemology, our approach relies on access to diverse evidence drawn from
            interviews with actors, but also from examination of documents, records and other
            traces. At the same time, building from the ontological assumptions, our protocol does
            focus on understanding what motivates and what shapes DH researchers' work, i.e. it
            seeks to prioritize objects of our study from the viewpoint of research
            participants.</p>
         <p>As for the axiological level, we advocate for DH researchers (not just meta-researchers)
            to engage in what Pierre Bourdieu calls <quote rend="inline">epistemic
               reflexivity</quote>
            <ptr target="#bourdieu1992"/>. Central to Bourdieu's idea is the notion of <q>two steps
               back</q> in research: the first step back is to look at the research field itself. In
            other words, we <q>zoom out,</q> to use <ref target="#nicolini2010">Nicolini's
               (2010)</ref> different formulation, to view more clearly the main entities and
            processes-relations in the field of study. The second step back is to look from the
            outside at the approach, methods, and instruments of research (i.e., for a DH
            researcher, to consider the <q>epistemic framework</q> or commitments of their own
            research, or the research of others DHers). This kind of <q>double objectification</q>
            is what we suggest through our call for meta-research. </p>
         <p>Finally, our methodological plane coheres with the commitments of the study detailed
            above. We employ our multi-case studies meta-method within a critical realist grounded
            theory, i.e. we neither adopt the notion that we start tabula rasa seeking to "hear" the
            data speak to us, nor do we believe that it is enough to just start with hunches and
               <q>sensitizing concepts</q> and take it from there. </p>
         <p>In some ways our meta-research on DH can be equated to the kind of methodological work
            that goes on in any community of practice (bioinformatics, for example), or indeed is
            akin to the work of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the Sociology of Scientific
            Knowledge (SSK), but there are a few key differences. Primary among them would be the
            gap in epistemic vocabulary and different levels of methodological coherence between the
            diverse fields we examine. Unlike the relative coherence of work within specific
            sciences that was noted in STS/SSK studies, e.g. the existence of coherent epistemic
            cultures in molecular biology and in high energy physics identified by <ref
               target="#knorrcetina1999">Knorr-Cetina (1999)</ref>, humanities disciplines tend to
            be less coherent methodologically, especially when contrasted with information and
            computer sciences. In other words, humanities are generally undertheorised in terms of
            their methods and epistemic strategies, while software development seems at times
            perhaps overly process-driven in this respect. There is a distinct challenge in bringing
            these approaches together. In addition, the starting point for this work has not been
            entirely disinterested: this is an investigation of DH, but also performed — to some
            extent — by those trained primarily as (digital) humanists, not as social scientists.
            Because of this, even when we use social science tools and instruments, we may use them
            differently, drawing on the strengths of what we were taught to do (read texts, looks
            for patterns, use a peripheral view, be sensitive to subtle, trace indicators of bias or
            habitus, be unwilling to accept that language use is neutral, focus on cultural norms,
            values etc). The resulting positioning of our approach to understanding how DH research
            works, brings certain restrictions on its scalability or universality. While it would be
            possible for observers of other inter-disciplines and methodological communities to take
            inspiration from the manner in which we have leveraged our perspective on the work of
            those in our immediate environment, the specificities of how that would optimally be
            deployed could be quite different and lie beyond the scope of this paper. That said, our
            approach would be quite extensible to most DH research and researchers seeking a
            framework from which to observe their fields.</p>
         <p>In what follows, we present a review of previous studies on digital practices in the
            humanities, before moving on to discuss the steps taken by the Digital Methods and
            Practices Observatory (DiMPO) Working Group of the Digital Infrastructure for the Arts
            and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH) to develop a protocol for DH meta-research. Included
            in that section is a critical overview of the notion of meta-research, as it applies to
            the DH field, and an account of earlier DiMPO work conducted with a meta-research
            orientation. The pilot studies that follow point to promising directions in the area of
            DH meta-research and lay the groundwork for the development of our protocol which is
            presented in the penultimate section of the article. The DiMPO research protocol for DH
            meta-research consists of a set of specific methodological guidelines for researchers
            wishing to study research practices in the humanities. It includes: (a) the proposed
            research workflow (summarized in Figure 3); (b) a conceptual model accounting for both
            external and internal dimensions of DH activity; (c) a core code system (taxonomy of
            descriptors) amenable to the qualitative data analysis (QDA), which could be expressed
            in XML as a SKOS structure if necessary; (d) a qualitative interviewing and document
            analysis codebook identifying themes for eliciting evidence in situ (elaborated in Table
            1); (e) an exemplary case study structure to shape analysis and writing-up. The final
            section sets forth the next steps for the protocol and the DiMPO working group.</p>
         <p>We believe that broader adoption of this protocol by the research community could form
            the basis for the improved exchange of qualitative research results in this area, and a
            better understanding of DH and its penetration beyond the scope of those already
            committed to these methods. In establishing the protocol we hope to illustrate diversity
            and contextual dependency across different disciplines, schools of thought, typologies
            of research project and team, and individual practices. Taken together, the article and
            protocol map out an approach to meta-research of digital practices in the humanities
            which goes much further than the state of the art, in that it asks us to consider why
            and how we can comprehensively chart the impact of the digital on our knowledge
            production practice. </p>

         <div>
            <head>Earlier Studies on Digital Practices in the Humanities</head>
            <p>Considerable international research has been conducted on digital scholarship,
               digital research infrastructures, the organizational and disciplinary structures
               enabling digital work in the field of humanities research, and the information
               seeking and use patterns of researchers in the human sciences (for an overview, see
                  <ref target="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</ref>, <ref target="#case2016"
                  loc="287–96">Case and Given 2016, 287–96</ref>, <ref target="#schreibman2016"
                  >Schreibman et al., 2016</ref>). Within information science, researchers in the
               subfield of information behaviour have been trying to understand research practice as
               far back as the 1950s. While this work was initially limited to information seeking –
               how scholars sought information relevant to their research – it gradually expanded to
               encompass processes of information management, curation, collaboration and
               communication <ptr target="#julien2000"/>. Information behaviour studies addressed
               questions of computer use, comparison between the humanities and other disciplines,
               resource discovery, primary and secondary sources, and finding aids and archival
               services used by humanities researchers <ptr target="#dalton2004"/>
               <ptr target="#delgadillo1999"/>
               <ptr target="#duff2002"/>
               <ptr target="#stone1982"/>.</p>
            <p>One strand of earlier information behaviour research in particular remains relevant
               today: the abstraction of processes of scholarly information work, such as chaining,
               browsing and extracting, as described by Ellis in his comparative study across the
               sciences, social sciences, and the humanities (1993). This comparative approach was
               enriched with further processes <ptr target="#meho2003"/>, and later converged with
               the notion of scholarly primitives introduced by <ref target="#unsworth2000">John
                  Unsworth (2000)</ref>. Carole Palmer and her colleagues further developed the
               notion of scholarly primitives into a fully-fledged classification of twenty
               granular, standardised and recombinant scholarly activities, within broader processes
               of searching, collecting, reading, writing, and collaborating <ptr
                  target="#palmer2009"/>. On a parallel trajectory, the work of the Arts and
               Humanities Data Service (AHDS) in the 2000s took the abstraction of the research
               process further by establishing the complementary notion of computational methods.
               This led to the development of an extensive taxonomy of methods for the arts and
               humanities, documenting the context, needs and scenarios of use of each method in
               particular disciplines – from history, performing arts and archaeology to theatre and
               linguistics – across complementary contexts of digital data creation, processing and
               use <ptr target="#hughes2008"/>
               <ptr target="#reimer2009"/>. The AHDS methods taxonomy has been used to structure the
               ICT Guides database of digital arts and humanities projects in the UK <ptr
                  target="#grindley2007a"/>
               <ptr target="#grindley2007b"/> (cf. <ref target="#grindley2006a">2006a</ref>, <ref
                  target="#grindley2006b">2006b</ref>), and governed the information architecture of
               the arts-humanities.net portal, hosted for several years by the Centre for e-Research
               (CeRch, King's College London). Both the repository and the taxonomy were furthered
               by the DH@Oxford initiative in the UK, and the Database of Research and Projects in
               Ireland (DRAPIer, Digital Humanities Observatory). </p>
            <p>The Digital Research Tools (DiRT) directory originally appeared under the auspices of
               the Bamboo project <ptr target="#loesch2013"/>, and created a different
               classification of digital tools for humanities research which, implicitly, reflected
               an underlying categorization of scholarly research activities. An initiative within
               DARIAH-DE (the German tier of the DARIAH infrastructure) drew from such earlier work
               in the pragmatic context of building a tagging scheme for a Zotero bibliography on

               to develop an updated Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities
               (TaDiRAH) in collaboration with the DiRT directory <ptr target="#borek2016"/>
               <ptr target="#perkins2014"/>. Echoing Ellis and Unsworth, DH researchers involved in
               the development of methods taxonomies turned to modular, standardized procedures
               underlying humanities research enabled by ICT, and usable in hugely diverse contexts.
               One driving idea was to advocate for the development of <quote rend="inline">a system
                  that would span disciplines and facilitate knowledge transfer around digital
                  methods, could help prevent the re-inventing of the wheel, encourage re-use of
                  resources and contribute to a greater awareness of the importance of digital
                  research</quote>
               <ptr target="#reimer2009"/>. </p>
            <p>In spite of all of this work, however, our knowledge of the information behaviour of
               humanities researchers in the digital environment remains incomplete, largely due to
               the fact that this remains a diverse field and has been a moving target, especially
               as the tools of scholarship have changed radically with the advent of ICT. The
               complexity and fluidity of the research environment calls for flexible methodologies,
               capable of capturing the nuances and accounting for the variety of research
               practices. Hence, the emergence of qualitative inquiry approaches towards DH, which
               tend to investigate digital practices in a broader epistemic and organizational
               context, very much in-line with the methodologies presented in the following sections
               (e.g., <ref target="#antonijevic2015">Antonijević 2015</ref>).</p>
            <p>There are a number of recent studies which either directly or indirectly address
               digital research practices in the humanities. An important subset of this research
               has been conducted in the context of defining user requirements for digital research
               infrastructures and services for the arts and humanities. Questionnaire survey and
               qualitative interviewing research in the context of the Preparing DARIAH and European
               Holocaust Research Infrastructure project <ptr target="#benardou2010"/> highlighted,
               among other findings: the persistent use of traditional, non-digital formats to
               access textual archival resources and books; the high importance attributed to
               collecting and managing references, as well as to storing both digital and paper
               copies of both published and unpublished materials; the perceived value of
               highlighting relevant text passages and storing notes with them; and the importance
               of named entities for content-based retrieval of primary and secondary sources.
               Further analysis of interviews under the same project formally corroborated a number
               of important intuitions, such as a widespread tendency of researchers to use primary
               data and secondary sources at the same time, or to forge links between objects on the
               basis of their conceptual content <ptr target="#benardou2013"/>. The Scholarly
               Research Activity Model, resulting from this work, drew from mixed methods research
               on the scholarly practices of researchers in the DARIAH and EHRI communities and was
               used to model, represent and analyse the findings of such analysis <ptr
                  target="#benardou2010"/>. Some recent work within the DARIAH Community Engagement
               Working Group (CE-DARIAH) continues to analyse the work practices of humanities
               researchers and how these researchers might be encouraged to better engage with
               Research Infrastructures (RIs) such as DARIAH <ptr target="#garnett2019"/>. </p>
            <p>Likewise, numerous projects have tackled research on DH from different perspectives.
               The CENDARI Project (2012-2016) was funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework
               Programme to pilot the implementation of a virtual research infrastructure for
               scholars of medieval and modern history. A part of the project dedicated to the
               Domain Use Cases aimed to capture the different research practices in transnational
               history, challenges posed by the fragmentation of archival sources, and how a virtual
               research infrastructure can help address these challenges (CENDARI WP4 team, 2013).
               The DESIR project (INFRADEV-03-2016-2017; 2017-2019), created a very informative
               series of video interviews with DH researchers, focusing in part on their own career
                  paths.<note>These video interviews can be viewed here: <ref

                     >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSbLhKeZXZP8Jvl2D7OxSVA</ref></note> The
               KPLEX project (2017-2018), funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020
               research programme, conducted surveys and interviews on how big data research might
               be better informed by humanities research practices. The most relevant pieces of work
               for DH meta-research are the interviews of WP2, which looked at computer scientists’
               attitudes toward the definitions of certain key terms in their work (especially
                  <q>data</q>), provenance and data cleaning as productive or destructive processes,
               and the role of uncertainty in humanities research datasets. The protocol used,
               background information and analysis of the interviews were published as a
                     report.<note><ref
                     target="https://kplexproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/d2-1-redefining-what-data-is-and-the-terms-we-use-to-speak-of-it.pdf"

               The PROVIDEDH Project (CHIST-ERA, 2017-2020) prepared User Stories and Scenarios
               which present eight cases of how uncertainty arises and is managed in early modern
               historical research, drawn from interviews with four expert researchers in the field.
               Finally, The Scholarly Primitives and Renewed Knowledge-Led Exchanges Project <ptr
                  target="#edmond2016"/> was inspired by ethnographic methods, in looking at the
               practices of knowledge creation in the humanities. Nine interviews were carried out
               with the aim of pinpointing the key moments and milestones of this process <ptr
                  target="#edmond2018"/>. What we can extract from this distillation of almost three
               decades of research in digitally-enabled humanities scholarship is that any broad
               framework for study has to be expansive and customizable for a field-specific study.
               It needs to account for the specificity of the sources, the research team and funding
               structure, versioning software — in short, the radical instability of the rapidly
               changing research environment as well as knowledge production itself. Even a cursory
               examination of how researchers work with digital technology reveals that the
               application of specific research methods is dependent on the researcher’s ability to
               use particular digital tools and services (as well as on the stage in research
               lifecycle, the disciplinary context, etc.). Those studies form the background for the
               investigation on the scholarly practices, digital needs and attitudes of European
               researchers in the human sciences which is the focus of the present discussion, and
               of the meta-research approach that has been developed within DARIAH DiMPO Working
               Group.</p>

            <head>Towards a Protocol for DH Meta-Research</head>
            <p>The number of studies presented in the previous section brings to the fore how
               complexity is inherent not only in the human cultural record that is the object of
               humanistic inquiry but also in the very practices that constitute scholarly work. In
               the last five years, the work of DiMPO has aimed at studying the purposeful activity
               of humanities researchers as they engage with everyday processes of scholarly work
               and to document and account for the role of the digital in their workflows. Its first
               research endeavour was the European survey on scholarly practices and digital needs
               in the arts and humanities, disseminated in ten languages during winter 2014/2015,
               which attracted 2,177 respondents from sixteen European countries. The survey aimed
               at providing <quote rend="inline">an evidence-based outlook of scholarly practices,
                  needs and attitudes of European humanities researchers towards digital resources,
                  methods and tools across space and time</quote>
               <ptr target="#dallas2017"/>.</p>
            <p>The DiMPO survey results depicted a landscape in flux, with rapid change in some
               places and contexts, and surprising stagnation in others. To capture this changing
               landscape, the survey was designed as a longitudinal research project, to be repeated
               every few years. However, while a survey is a good instrument in identifying “what”
               questions through quantitative summaries and statistical associations between
               different variables, it provides little context to help elucidate holistically the
                  <q>how</q> and <q>why</q> of DH research. For this reason, DiMPO agreed that a
               process of qualitative research is also necessary to allow a fuller understanding of
               how humanities researchers work while engaging increasingly with digital resources,
               tools and methods. Such a qualitative approach would complement the quantitative
               while allowing for the interpretations to the multiple intentionalities, disciplinary
               affiliations and contextual dependencies of particular developments in the field. </p>
            <p>Before the next iteration of the survey, DiMPO initially adopted a case-study
               approach, inspired by a multicase study model <ptr target="#stake2013"/>, for the
               following reasons: </p>
            <list type="ordered">
               <item>it would provide an insight into researcher’s motivations and their reasons for
                  choosing (or refusing) certain digital methods while providing a perspective on

               <item>it accounts for the holistic, contextual and situational dimensions of human
                  culture</item>
            </list>
            <p>Discussions of the rationale and priorities that should govern research on DH
               research practice led DiMPO to consider a broader epistemic framework for its
               activities, based on the notion of meta-research. Stemming from concerns on
               reproducibility and waste in the biomedical field, meta-research emerged recently as
               an important orientation to the study of research practice. While the term was
               originally used as a mere synonym to meta-analysis, i.e. the consolidation of
               aggregated findings of published studies such as different clinical trials on the
               same research hypothesis, the emerging new field of meta-research now seeks to find
               evidence-based improvements to scientific work through <quote rend="inline">research
                  on research</quote>
               <ptr target="#wikipedia2018"/> by looking more broadly at <quote rend="inline"
                  >thematic areas of methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and
                  incentives,</quote> combining theoretical and empirical investigation, and
               extending beyond retrospective studies to planned, prospective inquiry on scientific
               practice <ptr target="#enserink2018"/>
               <ptr target="#ioannidis2015"/>. DiMPO shares the pragmatic goal of meta-research, as
               it has been adopted in the natural and hard sciences, to make a positive difference
               in the way researchers work. This commitment underlies the mixed methods research it
               adopted, consisting of a combination of longitudinal questionnaire survey, literature
               review, and qualitative multicase study investigations. The scope of DiMPO work,
               driving the construction of the DiMPO protocol for case study meta-research, is
               therefore adjusted to studying DH scholarly work by zooming in to a granular study of
               particular research activities and operations and zooming out to considering broader
               socio-technical and cultural factors. Beside contribution to knowledge, an important
               objective of DH meta-research is to assess and help overcome challenges currently
               faced by humanities researchers in creating, curating and using digital resources,
               taking up and building useful digital tools and services, and developing and adopting
               appropriate digital research methods in practice. </p>
            <p>During a series of working group meetings in 2017-18, DiMPO planned for harmonization
               between three pilot studies conducted by different group members and discussed their
               outcomes, paving the way for the preparation of the final version of the DiMPO
               protocol. These pilot studies were not designed for the purpose of this meta-research
               endeavour: they rather represent active, actual research on DH scholarly practices
               and knowledge work conducted by different co-authors of this study. These span
               different disciplines and fields within the <q>big tent</q> of DH, from literary
               studies to history and archaeology, different units for inquiry from individual
               researchers to research projects and whole fields, and diverse kinds of research
               questions from digital literacy to the effect of digital tools on research activity
               to the formation of research communities. Collectively, and through their
               complementarity and diversity, these pilot studies were selected to satisfy, through
               the principle of saturation typical of qualitative research, a criterion of
               generality for our proposed methodology. </p>
            <p>Based on input from these pilot studies, a preliminary case study structure was
               produced, including a common template for outcomes and reporting, instructions on
               construction of each case study dossier and how it should be situated in the context
               of multiple case studies. This framework was elaborated according to the particular
               research needs of the pilot studies. Three studies, presented in brief in the next
               section, account for three complementary research perspectives adopted by DiMPO,
               focusing on a different level of <q>unit of inquiry</q> and adopting methodological
               directions from this orientation: (a) <hi rend="italic">individual interviews</hi>
               with Polish DH researchers; (b) <hi rend="italic">mixed-methods analysis</hi> of
               digital practice in archaeological research sites or projects, integrating individual
               interviews, document analysis and naturalistic observation, and, (c) <hi
                  rend="italic">group interviews</hi> with historians and literary scholars
               conducted within the framework of NEP4DISSENT COST Action. A secondary dimension, on
               which the pilots contribute differently, was to balance between a <q>grounded
                  theory,</q> inductive approach based on open coding, and a theory-laden,
               conceptual model based approach based on practice studies, activity theory etc.
               Finally, the choice of case-studies was motivated by the need to gather input on
               digital practices in multiple disciplines (literary studies, history, archaeology),
               reflecting our broad understanding of the humanities and the <q>big-tent</q>
               characteristics of DH. In all, a total of twenty-seven researchers were included as
               study subjects in these pilot studies. The following section briefly contextualises
               the presentation of the protocol that follows and its main purpose is to give the
               overview of research questions, methods and possible outputs that can stem out of
               meta-research.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Pilot Study 1: Individual Researchers</head>
            <p>This pilot study involved Polish humanities scholars and aimed to gain a better
               understanding of the DiMPO survey results with regard to how digital practices change
               the work of researchers in various fields, and how these researchers define and
               understand digital practices in the context of their needs. It was assumed that a
               series of interviews would provide better information on the values ​​assigned to
               digital technologies in the context of their use in research, to identify
               particularly useful existing and missing digital tools, as well as potential
               obstacles. Other research questions included the influence of digital tools on
               communication between researchers and disciplines, dissemination of results, the
               perception of what constitutes research data, and researchers’ assessments of the
               level of digital competence among their peers.</p>
            <p>The pilot study employed a relational approach to digital literacy, which defines the
               competent use of the digital in terms of a contribution to one’s life quality and
               performance <ptr target="#filiciak2013"/>. This relative perspective allows us to
               view digital competence in relation to other spheres of activity, allowing a
               subjective assessment of respondents’ competences with regard to their actual needs.
               In order to fruitfully explore the subject in the relational approach, the research
               team employed the technique of episodic interviews <ptr target="#flick1997"/>, as it
               encourages the exploration of both semantic and episodic dimensions knowledge. The
               former entails internalised social knowledge, whereas the latter expresses its
               particular expressions based on specific actions. The method provided insights not
               only into interviewees’ assumptions on digital research technologies and values
               ascribed to them, but also into particular manifestations of these assumptions and
               values in research.</p>
            <p>The interview questionnaire consisted of three key sections, each containing up to 9
               questions. Section one, aimed at eliciting <term>semantic knowledge</term>, included
               general questions about the usefulness of digital technologies in research, along
               with introductory questions identifying the interviewee’s main research interests,
               career focus and current work situation. Section two concentrated on the
                  <term>episodic knowledge</term>, which regards to the following dimensions:
               communication within the scientific community, disseminating research results, doing
               research, academic teaching. The interviewees were very willing to share their
               experiences with particular devices and software with regard to those dimensions.
               Section three was dedicated to consolidating and juxtaposing both dimensions of
               knowledge. The questions focused on the interviewees assessment of their individual
               digital skills as well as the skills of their scholarly community. This section also
               assessed the perceived effectiveness of using digital technologies in research in the
               context of the non-digital practices.</p>
            <p>There were five interviewees in total. The subject group consisted of one female and
               four male researchers, representing different career stages (three professors and two
               PhDs) and disciplines (two historians and three literary scholars). Two interviewees
               were leading grant projects at the time of the interview. Three interviews were
               conducted face-to-face in Warsaw, and two remotely via Skype. Each interview lasted
               between 45 and 65 minutes. The interviews were recorded, live transcribed and coded
                  <hi rend="italic">in vivo</hi> by the team members, i.e. new codes were generated
               inductively from interviewees’ statements by two researchers separately listening to
               the recordings and taking notes. To decrease the bias, the material was
               cross-analysed by two researchers. Although this was manageable in the pilot study
               due to the volume of material (five recordings, 60 minutes each on average), for a
               full-fledged study full transcription and qualitative coding would be advised.</p>
            <p>The study enabled investigators to answer the majority of research questions, and
               proved effective in eliciting both the general attitudes and experiences concerning
               the use of digital technology in research, and the experiences and assumptions
               connected to particular instances of using such technologies on the various stages of
               the research process. This short discussion of the study outcomes is by no means
               comprehensive. Two key conclusions from this research were that digital practices
               enable, facilitate, and in some cases demand the emergence of networks of cooperation
               within the academia (i.e. researchers from various fields), as well as between
               academia and other groups (amateur science enthusiasts for instance). Furthermore,
               digital technologies and practices can help bridge the gap between academic centres
               and peripheries (although limited access to digital technologies may have a negative
               impact on this process), as it facilitates cooperation between units, opens access to
               various resources, and offers state-of-the-art solutions to methodological or
               theoretical issues. </p>
            <p>As for more detailed conclusions, interviewees reported a major qualitative and
               quantitative change with regard to possible research avenues, quoting perspectives
               enabled by big data to conduct large-scale comparative studies. Digital research is
               perceived as more cost- and time-efficient, facilitating the coordination of various
               elements of the research process. However, the interviewees highlighted the need for
               the conscious use of the new tools, which may give great opportunities but should
               always serve as a means for answering the research question, so that the mere use of
               tools on new material does not become a goal in itself. The writing was reported
               least affected by digital technologies, as standard, widely available word processors
               were not replaced in the studied sample by new tools. Interestingly, what was further
               confirmed in the community research described below, researchers incorporate into
               their work the non-scientific resources as, for instance, data provided by amateur
               genealogists or individual enthusiasts. As for the physical working space,
               interviewees tend to work remotely in different settings (home, university, library),
               using mostly their own equipment.</p>
            <p>In sum, this pilot study informed our thinking about the DiMPO protocol in terms of
               introducing the methodological orientation of the episodic interview approach, and of
               defining the research questions and questionnaire construction, and the workflow for
               the individual interviews. </p>

            <head>Pilot Study 2: Research Projects and Sites as Activity Systems</head>
            <p>The second pilot study was conducted as part of E-CURATORS, a research project funded
               by an Insight grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of
               Canada, seeking to advance scholarly knowledge on the growing complexity and
               diversity of digital research practices in archaeology in the context of increasingly
               mainstreamed, pervasive, and invisible digital infrastructures. The study looks at
               practices such as: adoption of mobile devices to capture and document excavation and
               survey data; use of off-the-shelf mobile apps to construct three-dimensional models
               of archaeological artefacts, or to geo-locate archaeological information resources;
               instant online aggregation of captured data and resources in research archives,
               databases and repositories at the time of capture; use of synchronous and
               asynchronous communication technologies to connect researchers with data and enable
               interpretation <quote rend="inline">at the trowel’s edge</quote>
               <ptr target="#hodder1997"/>; collaborative annotation, enrichment and interpretation
               of archaeological data using Web 2.0 technologies, crowdsourcing and social tagging;
               adoption of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) visualization methods and
               equipment imported from fields such as the media and gaming industries for the
               generation and assessment of archaeological knowledge; use of blogs, wikis and social
               media networks to co-create and co-curate archaeological information objects; open
               access provision of data outside established archaeological data infrastructures;
               and, the use of gamification, storytelling and social media networks for public
               communication, learning and mediation.</p>

                  target="#dallas2007"/>
               <ptr target="#kaptelinin2006"/>, E-CURATORS focuses on studying archaeological
               research in the situated framework of bounded research processes considered as
                  <term>activity systems</term>, which involve a group of individuals purposefully
               engaging in specific, hierarchically organized, activities prompted by multiple
               motivations, pointing to specific goals, and made possible through the affordances of
               a diversity of norms, established procedures, methods, competencies, as well as
               digital and conceptual mediating tools. E-CURATORS is thus construed as a multicase
               study on archaeological projects, organisational units performing situated
               archaeological work, or sites of archaeological activity. Following a mixed methods
               approach, for each case study, the project collects a combination of three kinds of
               research data: (a) audio or video recorded testimonies and stories, acquired through
               a combination of life history and semi-open episodic interviews, and covering
               historical (factual), attitudinal and normative dimensions of archaeological
               activity; (b) documentary evidence, including captured field data, digital photos,
               models, notes, recordings, logs, database entries, maps, cataloguing texts, reports,
               web content and publications, and (c), optionally, naturalistic observation of study
               subjects. While the focus is on the overall activity system constituted by
               interacting actors, objects and mediating tools, E-CURATORS aims to examine different
               levels of granularity of scholarly activity through a process of
                  <term>zooming-in</term> to the specifics of digitally-mediated actions and
               operations, and <term>zooming-out</term> to the contextual factors of sociotechnical
               infrastructures and epistemic culture <ptr target="#nicolini2013"/>.</p>
            <p>E-CURATORS adopted a multi-step research activity design, based on connecting three
               interrelated processes: conceptual modeling of digital archaeological practice, data
               constitution, and analysis and theory building (these were integrated into the DiMPO
               protocol, which is presented in more detail in Figure 2).</p>
            <p>Work in the E-CURATORS project involves frequent iterations between activities, as
               well as interaction between activities executed in tandem across processes. So far,
               the E-CURATORS team developed a preliminary, extensible model and <q>code system</q>
               for QDA, drawing from an earlier model on archaeological digital curation <ptr
                  target="#dallas2015"/>, and based on integration between relevant parts of the
               NeDiMAH Methods Ontology <ptr target="#hughes2016"/>
               <ptr target="#pertsas2017"/>, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model <ptr
                  target="#leboeuf2015"/>, and the gIBIS practical argumentation and design
               rationale schema <ptr target="#conklin1987"/>
               <ptr target="#shum2006"/>. The model aims to represent evidence not only on (a)
               activities, actors, their goals and motives, archaeological entities, information
               resources, methods, procedures, digital devices, tools and services, but also on (b)
               issues (problems, questions), positions (solutions, ideas), and arguments (criteria,
               pros and cons) elicited from study subjects on their archaeological practice. A
               preliminary schematic representation (Figure 1) identifies the functional structure
               of digital archaeological practice through three overlapping facets, or views: (a)
               intentionality, relating activities with research actors, beliefs they hold,
               collectivities they belong to and shared drivers such as motives, goals and norms;
               (b) process, relating activities with procedures guided by drivers, tools
               implementing them, and information objects involved in them; and, (c) knowledge work,
               relating activities with archaeological entities, information objects, and beliefs
               they support or challenge (Figure 1). The code system consists of extensible code
               stub hierarchies for all entities in the model, and the relationships between
               them.</p>

                  (positions, arguments) on archaeological questions through knowledge interaction
                  with archaeological entities (artefacts, ecofacts, sites, ancient people, events,
                  cultural meanings etc.) as data and information resources accessed by means of
                  diverse (physical, digital, conceptual) mediating tools (methods, procedures,
                  workflows, recording devices, and analytical software).</head>

            <p>Fieldwork on the first case study, the Archaeology Data Service (University of York,
               UK) and its <title rend="italic">Internet Archaeology</title> journal, was completed
               in December 2018. Interviews conducted with seven key members of the ADS team are
               currently being transcribed, coded and annotated using the MAXQDA computer-assisted
               qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) <ptr target="#woolf2017"/>. In tandem, a
               Neo4J property graph database <ptr target="#vukotic2015"/> is being developed to host
               representations of research data (coded transcripts of interviews, annotated and
               categorised documentary data), so that they can be visualised and further analyzed
               through graph browsing, filtering, query, summarization and synthetic views of main
               activities and ideas expressed by study participants, and related motives, goals,
               norms and competencies, as well as digital infrastructures and tools, and
               archaeological entities related to research practices.</p>
            <p>An initial evaluation of results from this single-sited case study demonstrates
               themes and underlying factors, such as shared norms and metaphors about digital
               preservation work, the nature of the archaeological record, the role of digital
               repositories such as ADS, and the value of specific knowledges and capabilities,
               across study participants. Positional roles and relationships between researchers,
               trans- and interdisciplinary interactions and <q>translations</q>, emerged from
               interviews with different team members and documentary evidence they pointed us to,
               and helps build an account of digitally-enabled archaeological activity at ADS that
               would be impossible without attention to the collective work of study participants
               within multi-year projects, and to the set of arrangements, presuppositions, methods
               and norms shared by the ADS team. Individual competencies and orientations play
               nevertheless as important a role as the broader context of <q>client</q>
               organisations and people in British archaeology, peer organisations and networks
               active in archaeological data archiving in the European or global context, and, last
               but not least, a transdisciplinary ecosystem of diverse platforms, research
               organisations in computer science and informatics, policy makers and funders whose
               activities affect, directly or indirectly, the work of the organisation. Sensitizing
               concepts such as objectual practice <ptr target="#knorrcetina2001"/>, thought
               collective <ptr target="#fleck1979"/>, and semiosphere <ptr target="#lotman2005"/>
               seem to be promising in providing fruitful theoretical insights on this study.</p>
            <p>The ADS case study raises particular questions regarding the locatedness of
               archaeological curation practice. ADS activity is predicated upon localised primary
               archaeological fieldwork, but, by virtue of how communications between archivists and
                  <q>client</q> archaeologists unfold, and how information objects (such as
               datasets, and archaeological reports) are produced and curated, the ADS work itself
               detached from the location where it takes place: ADS staff work mostly in front of
               computer screens, using information systems and services accessible via digital
               networks, and interact with stakeholders over the phone, email and other
               digitally-enabled means of communication. Viewed as an archaeological semiosphere
                  <ptr target="#lauzikas2018"/>, the field where ADS research, curation and data
               management work is enacted may be conceived as a (conceptual) landscape punctuated by
               diverse disciplinary traditions, data management methods and rules-of-thumb, norms of
               best practice and acceptance criteria, competencies and skills, systems and services,
               and data standards, among other things. While place is not one of the entities
               represented explicitly in the E-CURATORS schematic model (fig. 1), a topological
               structure is implicit in its overarching conceptual organisation. Besides, the Neo4J
               graph database was selected to represent E-CURATORS data exactly because of is
               ability to allow visualisation, navigation and traversal of topological structures
               representing curation practices such as found at ADS. Aspects relevant to the ADS
               case include the emergence of practices of <term>creolisation</term> and
                  <term>translation</term> emerging at the <term>boundary</term> between
               semiospheres of scholarly archaeology and data management. Other cases of
               archaeological practice investigated by E-CURATORS, related to digitally-enabled
               archaeological excavation and survey, may call attention to the boundary between
               material-tangible and digital-intangible archaeological work, and the processes of
               creolisation and translation between competing norms, methods and regimes of value
               among these two semiospheres. </p>
            <p>The E-CURATORS pilot is special in being part of a funded project, with an
               international team of senior collaborators and a dedicated team of paid research
               assistants, hence some of its characteristics are not transferable to the mostly
               unfunded, in-kind contribution model under which DiMPO operates. From E-CURATORS, our
               DiMPO protocol inherits the appreciation of, firstly, the methodological value of
                  <term>zooming-in/zooming-out</term> between different levels of DH research
               activity, of attention to interactions between different actors in the context of a
               situated research process - which may be identified as a research site, an
               organisational unit, or a project - and between research actors and digital
               resources, tools and methods. Secondly, of attention to the issues, positions and
               arguments digital humanists identify as they consider challenges and opportunities,
               and obstacles and drivers to purposeful DH research activity, as well as the
               importance of norms, motivations and shared orientations within different kinds of
                  <quote rend="inline">thought collectives,</quote> especially as DH changes through
               interdisciplinarity and osmosis with pervasive digital infrastructures, diverse
               stakeholders, and bottom-up practices <quote rend="inline">in the wild</quote>
               <ptr target="#dallas2016"/>. And, thirdly, of the shifts introduced by digital tools,
               services and infrastructures to the spatial enframing of scholarly work, when
               activities, methods, thought collectives, norms and other elements of scholarly
               practice collectively form a conceptual rather than physical landscape, a topological
               structure amenable to traversal and navigation as researchers cross disciplinary and
               methodological boundaries.</p>

               including historians and art historians, anthropologists and scholars of media
               studies, librarians/archivists and curators, information technologists and digital
                  humanists.<note>For a further breakdown, see <ref

                     >http://nep4dissent.eu/working-groups/</ref></note> One of the main goals of
               NEP4DISSENT is to introduce DH methods to scholars who are already immersed in
               digital materials and tools but not yet self-consciously carrying out DH projects.
               Interviewees were selected who seemed <q>DH-curious</q> and were open to learning new
               methodologies, but for the most part not yet fluent in DH terminology and major
               approaches. Therefore, the group interviews conducted at this early stage in the
               project (March 2018) served several purposes at once: (a) to measure the degree of
               familiarity with DH tools within the research group, as well as probing attitudes and
               beliefs about digital tools for research; (b) to provide a snapshot of scholars’
               current practices and methods for collecting and curating their data (in some cases
               born-digital but in most cases analogue); and, (c) to identify the key needs of this
               group, in terms of areas for possible DH collaboration and training in DH methods
               within the framework of the Action.</p>
            <p>The interview protocol was developed by DiMPO members who are also taking part in
               NEP4DISSENT under Working Group 5 (<title rend="quotes">Mediating Research Through
                  Technology</title>), and based on the paradigm developed earlier for the SPARKLE
               project (discussed in section two above). The eleven selected interviewees, seven
               male and four female, represented five disciplines: history (6), art history (2),
               media studies (1), sociology (1), and tourism studies (1). They were interviewed in
               groups of two to four, over videoconference, with at least two interviewers taking
               part in each session. At times the subjects interacted with each other during the
               interviews, but for the most part, the dialogue was one-to-one between interviewer
               and interviewee. The interviews were coded in vivo by the interviewers and later
               distilled into a table reflecting key aspects of the study: sources, methods, tools,
               privacy, publication, barriers, and examples. </p>
            <p>The question of barriers to digital research revolved largely around issues of access
               (digitization priorities of national archives and libraries) and funding, with one
               respondent pointing to a cultural issue in the region which scholars are sometimes
               averse to: open-access. Another issue that came up repeatedly was the difficulty of
               creating datasets that could be easily integrated with those maintained by other
               scholars – sometimes because of an investment in a single platform from which it is
               not easy to extract data (or at least not obvious to the researchers using it how to
               do so). This does not necessarily point to any inherent problem with the platform, as
               much as to the researcher’s ability to leverage its use and value. <quote
                  rend="inline">Working with quantitative data is very time-consuming,</quote> a
               historian commented, <quote rend="inline">even though there are a lot of tools out of
                  there, but the risk is big because you need to build up your entire data set to
                  accommodate to one tool, and then you realize it’s not the tool you needed (after
                  you cut and pasted for days)</quote> (Group Interview 3, 2018). These group
               interviews also revealed a promising line of engagement for NEP4DISSENT to introduce
               more advanced text analytical methods to those already working with quantitative
               analysis of written materials, but unsure of how to engage with semantic-level
               analysis. The main reasons scholars gave for using analogue over digital methods were
               that: (a) their sources were too mixed, (b) that they lacked faith in digital tools,
               and, (c) the scale of material collected was so small that they didn’t feel they need
               for the specific tools discussed or mentioned by colleagues.</p>
            <p>A more systematic analysis was performed by applying full qualitative data coding of
               one of the group interviews. In the context of QDA, coding is defined as a systematic
               classification process that helps identify themes or patterns, thus forming a basis
               for the subjective interpretation of a document’s content <ptr target="#hsieh2005"/>.
               There are different software options that enable computer-supported content analysis
               and coding, including MaxQDA, NVivo, Dedoose, and ATLAS.ti. These tools allow
               investigators to import various kinds of documents, usually in .txt .rtf .doc/x .pdf
               formats, and to perform different actions that help the content analysis process. </p>
            <p>For this in-depth qualitative analysis, data was gathered from the group interview
               with two researchers working in the area of memory studies, both members of the
               NEP4Dissent Working Group 4 on <q>Cultural memory of dissent</q> (Group Interview 4).
               A full transcription of the interview was prepared and QDA was applied to the
               transcribed text by using the MAXQDA software. The creation of a code system followed
               an inductive (data-driven) approach by reading and summarizing raw data. The
               inductive approach uses open coding, where specific codes are derived from data and
               are subsequently classified in order to create the code system, usually by
               categorisation aiming to reduce the number of codes by grouping them. An advantage of
               the inductive approach is that it does not impose any preconceived categories or
               theoretical perspectives to the ongoing research and allows to gather direct
               information from study participants, which is grounded in the actual data <ptr
                  target="#hsieh2005"/>. No in vivo coding was applied during the QDA, meaning that
               the process of assigning a code mainly involved paraphrasing and generalization of
               selected text segments rather than verbatim codes. The inductive approach provided
               useful insights into an analysis based on raw data and helped to identify potential
               areas of concern expressed by researchers during the interview. Open coding resulted
               in the emergence of a code system which consisted of six broader definitions (codes)
               and their subcodes thus presenting the main findings of the interview (see Figure 2). </p>

                  inductive codes indicate five main categories related to digital research as
                  mentioned by the researchers in the interview, while subcodes indicate specific
                  details drawn from the discussion. </head>

            <p>The findings of the case study showed that the evaluation of one’s familiarity with
               digital research or the role of the digital was mainly shaped by scholars’ attitudes
               and beliefs, as well as by personal experience working with digital resources and
               digital tools: <quote rend="inline">(...) in my case there is a disconnection extent
                  to which I work with digital sources and huge amount of ignorance that I possess
                  about them. So I don’t have proper tools and knowledge on how to work with them.
                  As a cultur[al] historian I see a big need to work with digital sources</quote>
               (Group interview 4, 2018). </p>
            <p>Questions about digital resources revealed that it’s not only digital publications
               that are important for research, but even more so online research data, with
               different websites and social media platforms playing a key role. The Danish
               researcher admits that social media is a huge incentive for her in finding new ways
               of studying memory: <quote rend="inline">I also haven’t studied the memory of dissent
                  as such, but I was looking into dissenting memories and what you can do with
                  digital sources and social networks, mainly Facebook, and also Youtube. They are
                  places where anyone can contribute and it’s a massive resource for the study of
                  memory</quote> (Group interview 4, 2018). Meanwhile, the Bulgarian scholar points
               to the importance of thematic portals for her research, e. g. <quote rend="inline"
                  >(...) websites for sharing memories of socialism (...) is another source which is
                  born-digital, because people go there and they write their comments and memories,
                  but sometimes they upload photos of objects from that period (...)</quote> (Group
               interview 4, 2018). </p>
            <p>With regard to questions of digital research methods, scholarly research processes
               were the most extensively discussed by both scholars, and particular codes were
               assigned to identify specific activities being mentioned, e. g. seeking of
               information, acquiring and organizing research data, publishing research results,
               collaborating with other scholars, and preserving data. In some cases, it’s
               fascinating to acknowledge how the research process might be ordinary and
               unformalized: <quote rend="inline">(..) we are very honest web users as most other
                  people, the way we engage with net is unprofessional acting like ordinary people
                  with tools that are easy available</quote> (Group interview 4, 2018). Actually,
               the simplicity of research activities was observed in every step of research, where
               research data is usually acquired by copying, pasting or by printscreens and
               organised by using USB stick, folder system, Powerpoint or Word document: <quote
                  rend="inline">(...) I have a Word file where I copy-paste links that I feel I want
                  to go back [to]. It’s like [a] bibliography, but it’s a linkography - list of
                  links</quote> (Group interview 4, 2018). </p>
            <p>Finally, the key issues identified in the analysis of the group interview were
               related to open access, lack of digital methods literacy and the complexity of online
               data. And while the first two perhaps are easy to anticipate, the third issue points
               to an increasing need to use online data in/for research, as well as methods and
               tools that could deal with it. As noticed by one of the researchers in the group
               interview, <quote rend="inline">(...) working with social networks is incredibly
                  tempting and definitely dangerous, because it’s so easy and the feeling is
                  quantifiable (you can count number of likes, comments). What I saw as a challenge
                  in this connection is a super-fluidiness of so much of it, it’s so unstable, so
                  easy, inexpensive, so you don’t know much what is going on</quote> (Group
               interview 4, 2018). </p>
            <p>This method was also tested in an environment of scholars with a fairly long record
               in DH, who identified with that field, through an interview conducted with four
               members of the Stanford Literary Lab,<note><ref target="https://litlab.stanford.edu/"
                     >https://litlab.stanford.edu/</ref></note> a group representing the field of
               literary studies, and consisting of scholars on different stages of their careers,
               with a long history of collaboration. Hence, the interview collected individual
               responses but also became a platform for negotiating a collective approach towards
               methods, tools and research strategies adopted by the group. The NEP4DISSENT Group
               Interview Protocol was slightly modified in this study, allowing for questions
               inspired by the narrative component of the episodic interviews, discussed in the
               first pilot study, namely about how the researchers were introduced to digital
               methods, and how they see the field in the time-perspective (five years ago and five
               years from now). It should be noted that, as in the case of previous interviews, it
               was clear for interviewees that the application of digital tools and methods should
               be always driven by the humanities’ research questions, not the other way around.
               Moreover, the group tend to seek novel research problems to develop new tools, rather
               than to use the ones they have already developed on other material. This high
               methodological awareness also translated into the interviewees’ self-perception as DH
               scholars. Actually, in their words, being a DH scholar means having <q>two jobs,</q>
               or writing <q>one and a half dissertation(s),</q> as they need to master two fields:
               literary studies and computational analysis. They also pointed out to the
               collaboration model of DH inquiry, which differed largely from individualistic
               approaches of literary studies. They were also aware of some methodological criticism
               of DH methods, which they dubbed ‘the rolling backlash’, but claimed it was very
               productive for their work as it pushed them to rethink certain aspects of their
               mode.</p>
            <p>The working space is an important factor for the project workflow. Although the Lab
               members often live in different cities and communicate with each other via electronic
               channels, the actual meeting space remains crucial for debating the current status of
               the project and exchanging the ideas that may emerge in the <q>first phase</q>
               dedicated to individual work. The big table in the lab, around which the team gathers
               for the project meeting, is, in the words of the founding director of the Lab, <quote
                  rend="inline">as essential a tool as the really expensive ones ... All researchers
                  bring to this phase their interests, and even fixations. At times, there is a lot
                  of noise. But in a few magic moments, the group becomes truly more than the sum of
                  its parts; it <q>sees</q> things that no single pair of eyes could have</quote>
               <ptr target="#moretti2016" loc="2–3"/>. Hence, the physical space becomes a platform
               for the integration of the individual perspectives and generation of genuinely
               collective outputs.</p>
            <p>To sum up, this short overview of findings, interviewing DH communities may provide
               more knowledge about the DH field as such, as well as about overcoming methodological
               obstacles through collaboration with peers and negotiating DH status in the
               humanities departments.</p>
            <p>Pilot studies on research community profiles contributed to the protocol with regard
               to establishing the research framework, desk research on actors, conducting group
               interviews with researchers, as well as transcribing them, coding and analysing.The
               resulting interpretations will not be designed for DH research as a whole, or even
               digital history, but rather customized to fit the needs, skills, research
               environment, and general methodological approaches of our project participants.</p>

            <head>The DiMPO Case-Study Protocol</head>
            <p>The outcome of the pilot studies is the DiMPO Case-Study Protocol for Meta-Research
               in Digital Humanities (Figure 2) and accompanying guidebook (under preparation).
               These materials are intended to help researchers in conducting meta-research and
               adopting these guidelines for different purposes, disciplines and approaches. As many
               of the issues raised here are already covered in manuals for social research, our
               focus is the specificity of meta-research in the DH environment. This section
               discusses only the main assumption of the protocol. For a more detailed overview
               consult the guidebook (under preparation; see Next steps).</p>

               <head>Background</head>
               <p>The protocol should serve to bridge knowledge gaps about questions or issues that
                  are relevant, consequential and potentially impactful. The very first step is to
                  define the main area of the case study. As digital humanities tends to be
                  conceived as a <quote rend="inline">big tent</quote> for a plethora of approaches
                  and disciplines (cf. <ref target="#svensson2012">Svensson 2012</ref>), there are
                  many potential areas for a meaningful work into contemporary research practices,
                  be it the uptake of digital encoding by scholarly editors in literary studies,
                  cultural analytics for art history, or databases in religious studies. The main
                  assumption behind scholarly practices meta-research is that a meaningful change in
                  scholarly practices takes place and is worth investigating. Moreover, as we argued
                  in the introduction, the full assessment of this change should involve not only
                  pioneering computational research, but rather the broader uptake of the digital
                  practices and methods by researchers in the humanities, even if they do not
                  self-identify as digital humanists, as long as they use digital resources, tools
                  and methods in order to explore particular problems. Hence, the investigator
                  should choose the most promising aspect of the field, basing on her own expertise
                  and knowledge.</p>
               <p>That leads us to the identification of appropriate research questions. Sometimes,
                  research questions may take the form of well-defined hypotheses, to be confirmed
                  or refuted by operationalizing them as relationships among properties of the data
                  collected in the study (deduction). Alternatively, they may merely consist in
                  identifying relevant aspects of phenomena manifested in the data, which will be
                  later elucidated through <q>inference to the best explanation</q> among
                  alternatives (abduction). Finally, there are cases where the research questions
                  are little more than informal ideas and <q>sensitizing concepts</q> on potential
                  topics of interest, in the expectation that new knowledge will arise from the
                  grounded, bottom-up examination of the data (induction). DH meta-research
                  questions are diverse: for example, they may be how digital resources and tools
                  change the way research questions are formulated and scholarly investigations are
                  conducted, what is the status digital sources in humanities research, or what are
                  the effects of digital collaboration practices and dissemination of knowledge. </p>
               <p> On the basis of prior literature and pilot studies, DiMPO identified a number of
                  research questions relevant for DH meta-research, categorized within the following
                  facets: Research Activity, Resource Assets, Tools, Researchers, Place and Time.
                  Facets and research questions are summarised in Table 1. </p>

               <p>Another integral part of this early, conceptual stage is the choice of the unit of
                  inquiry. DiMPO protocol distinguishes between three kinds of units, depending on
                  the types of research questions: research community, research project, individual
                  researchers. The focus on <hi rend="italic">Research Community</hi> enables a view
                  on a particular field, discipline or community of practice, and an assessment of
                  the role the digital in this field. It could also assess the popularity of certain
                  tools and approaches in the community as well as its value judgments concerning
                  the evaluation of the digital work, i.e. what is considered a good practice in the
                  field. The <hi rend="italic">Research Project/Site</hi> approach allows for a
                  comprehensive and formal description of a particular project, research site, or
                  bounded activity of an organizational unit in its entirety, in order to provide a
                  situated picture and understanding of a particular research endeavour, and the
                  interaction between people, technology and its outputs. The analysis of <hi
                     rend="italic">Individual Researchers</hi> supplements these approaches with the
                  biographical perspective on a researcher, her individual motivations and goals,
                  particular methods, beliefs held about the digital, and career trajectory. The
                  pilot studies presented earlier are good examples of types of differences in
                  results between particular approaches.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Project framework establishment</head>
               <p>The second step is to establish the framework of the project, i.e. translate
                  research questions into a concrete study workflow. The questions which emerged in
                  the previous step will be now operationalised and particular methods and
                  techniques should be chosen. In the pilots we focused on personal interviews,
                  group interviews and observations, described in more detail in the fieldwork
                  section below. Once the choice is made, a researcher needs to generate the study
                  form, i.e. questionnaires, or observation protocols, relevant to research
                  questions. Additionally an ethics review should be performed and suitable policies
                  applied, especially in cases where there is risk and potential for harm
                  (professional, reputational, etc.) for study participants or investigators. Some
                  funding agencies may require rigorous ethics review, yet, for most of the cases,
                  it involves considering such aspects in clear terms as regards risks, conflicts of
                  interest, preservation of anonymity of study participants, right for withdrawal,
                  obligations for data retention, conditions of access to research data, and
                  consultation with study participants before publication. For instance, one should
                  know beforehand how raw data will be stored, or if it is going to be published in
                  any form. All such cases will be outlined in a consent form prepared for the
                  study, which should be signed by subjects prior to the interview.</p>
               <p>Depending on the particular unit of analysis chosen for the study, investigators
                  will need to establish criteria for selection of cases, i.e. which particular
                  individuals, research projects or communities will be approached in this study.
                  They should consider carefully what kind of sampling technique will be relevant to
                  gather heterogeneous material and different approaches.</p>
               <p>Finally, the internal work environment should be organised, which entails a
                  selection of tools for data collection, storage and processing, that includes
                  means of recording, transcribing and annotating the communication with the actors,
                  as well as a clear data management plan. The entire framework should be put into a
                  single case-study manual, which can serve as a point of reference throughout the
                  study for the principal investigator and the research team.</p>
               <p>Once all of the above items are in place, a short pilot study should be conducted
                  to assess the research design and materials gathered in the case-study manual.
                  Relevant amendments should be made to the manual. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Desk research on the units of inquiry</head>
               <p>The first phase of the actual research consists of gathering data about the unit
                  of inquiry (individual, project, community), which will inform the interaction
                  with actors and allow for the better understanding of their work. Desk research
                  should include a basic case overview, like research scope (what is the field),
                  objectives (what are the aims of research) and contribution (what are the
                  achievements). This includes gathering relevant materials, such as publications,
                  project descriptions, earlier interviews, developed software, etc. The outcome
                  should be presented in a form of short bios of the actors, including descriptions
                  of their projects and contributions, together with a bibliography of publication.
                  Such a resource could be later used by other team members. Materials created in
                  this stage could be later reused in the final report.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Fieldwork</head>
               <p>The next stage consists of the actual fieldwork. Its scope depends on the types of
                  methods chosen and the size of the team conducting the study. One of the easiest
                  ways of acquiring material, often used in our pilot studies, is an interview by
                  videoconference, which is an easy and inexpensive way to reach out to a wider,
                  international base of subjects. But fieldwork may also include participant
                  observation of particular research activities, which could entail attending
                  project meetings and presentations, testing tools developed by actors or observing
                  them at work. This also can entail collection of documentary evidence, such as
                  photos of resources and workplaces, as well as gathering outputs of DH research
                  activity. Such an approach allows for gathering knowledge about the processes
                  which could not be noticed by subjects and not reported in interviews.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Data preparation and transcription</head>
               <p>Fieldwork produces a diversity of raw data, which needs to be put in shape in
                  preparation for analysis. Field notes need to be organized and annotated with the
                  time and place where they were taken; recordings, photos and videos need to be
                  inventoried and may also need to be processed before transcription. Given the
                  scope of DiMPO research, audio (and optionally video) recordings should be
                  transcribed, so as to capture fully and faithfully the verbal content of
                  participant speech, but also salient paralinguistic aspects of speech, as well as
                  relevant non-verbal actions and events. Finally, it includes conventions for
                  describing gestures, pointing at objects and screen events, as these can be
                  important features of observed scholarly practice. CAQDAS packages include useful
                  transcription functions as a matter of course, allowing for slower playback and
                  rewind, pausing, and insertion of timestamps. Transcribers should allow for 6-7
                  hours of transcription time for each hour of audio recording, or roughly ten
                  person days to transcribe a typical set of audio recordings for each case study.
                  Given the multiple parameters and dimensions of DH research practices to be
                  investigated, the DiMPO protocol stipulates full transcription of audio
                  recordings, rather than open (live) transcription of only the segments that
                  investigators find of interest at first hand.</p>
               <p>If anonymization has been decided on as part of the ethics review, visual material
                  may have to be redacted, and names of individuals in text documents and
                  transcripts replaced either with participant codes or, preferably, with pseudonyms
                  (nicknames). But, on the whole, the DiMPO protocol recommends retaining
                  participant identity as an important part not just of ensuring interpretability of
                  results, but also as an ethical commitment to giving due credit to individuals,
                  organizations and projects participating in the study for their frequently
                  innovative practices, methods and ideas.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>Analysis and interpretation </head>
               <p>The DiMPO protocol recommends that all data collected through fieldwork, as well
                  as in earlier bibliographic and desk research, are imported for analysis into a
                  CAQDAS package such as MAXQDA, Atlas Ti, nVivo or Dedoose, or a free alternative.
                  Segments of transcripts, documents and publications, as well as of visual records
                  collected for the study, can be then annotated systematically and consistently by
                  the use of short jottings and longer analytic memos, i.e., free text annotations
                  capturing the insights, questions and ideas of investigators, and codes. In the
                  context of QDA, a code is defined as <quote rend="inline">a word or short phrase
                     that symbolically assigns a summative, salient, essence capturing, and/or
                     evocative attribute for a portion of language-based or visual data</quote>
                  <ptr target="#saldana2013" loc="3"/>. As soon as research data from preliminary
                  research and fieldwork are ready for analysis, the protocol recommends that
                  investigators immerse themselves in the data, and produce memos which capture
                  initial questions, ideas and insights, as well as associations with sensitizing
                  concepts from the scholarly literature they consider relevant. </p>
               <p>During the first cycle of analysis, the DiMPO protocol advocates a combination of
                  deductive (provisional) and inductive (open) coding. A hierarchically-organised
                  provisional code scheme, including ca. 50 initial codes representing the
                  conceptual structure of scholarly practice, will be used to encode transcript and
                  other data segments referring to the compositional structure of DH research
                  activities, their input and output, the roles and involvement of researchers and
                  other stakeholders, the epistemic context of their action, their motives and
                  goals, as well as the digital methods, procedures and tools involved in each
                  activity. In tandem, an inductive coding approach, based on open coding of
                  relevant segments of the qualitative data, can be applied to capture unforeseen
                  aspects of DH work, as well as issues, ideas and arguments introduced by study
                  participants <ptr target="#miles2014"/>
                  <ptr target="#saldana2013"/>.</p>
               <p>The second cycle of analysis is based on theoretical coding, and is performed
                  simultaneously with sorting, filtering, summarization and visualization of data
                  coded according to the inductive/deductive approach described in the previous
                  paragraph. Theoretical codes, i.e., codes that may represent possible explanatory
                  and causal mechanisms, underlying factors and characterizations underlying DH
                  scholarly practice, will be defined through identifying associations,
                  relationships, axial differentiations or shared categorizations of provisional and
                  open codes developed so far, and of the aspects of evidence represented by data
                  segments they are connected with. Intra-case study theoretical coding will be used
                  firstly to make sense of individual cases. This will be followed by theoretical
                  coding across cases, aimed to capture diversity and complementarity between the
                  practices of different DH sites or projects, rather than to achieve confirmation
                  through repetition. Additional fieldwork, e.g., in the form of follow-up
                  interviews to clarify or enrich understanding about some phenomenon that became
                  visible at the stage of theory building, may be planned at this point for the
                  purpose of saturation.</p>

            <div>
               <head>Outputs</head>
               <p>There are three main outputs of the study: report, data, and additional
                  publications. The genre of a report gives more space for the inclusion of larger
                  chunks of evidence (esp. quotes from interviews) but should also be supplemented
                  by a bibliography of the publications (prepared through desk research) and a
                  glossary of key project concepts, i.e. its theoretical, methodological and
                  technological terms. Ideally, the report should contain the research protocol and
                  codebook, material created through desk research, discussion of the data collected
                  and the interpretation. A report in the field of meta-research should tackle the
                  questions of the role of digital resources, methods, tools, as well as services
                  and infrastructures in the analysed case. Reports could be stored in the DiMPO
                  Community on Zenodo,<note><ref target="https://zenodo.org/communities/dimpo/"
                        >https://zenodo.org/communities/dimpo/</ref></note> or, if applicable, in

                        >https://hal.inria.fr/DARIAH</ref></note> for better visibility.
                  Additionally, data from the project (esp. annotated transcripts) should be made
                  public whenever it is possible, as it could enable comparative perspectives or
                  reexamination of the material by other investigators (Directory of Open Access

               <head>Evaluation of the research protocol </head>
               <p>The last step of the study is the evaluation of the research protocol, i.e.
                  assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen research framework
                  and methodological choices. This knowledge is extremely important, as it informs
                  further studies in the field, and — as such — should be shared in the report.</p>

         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Next Steps</head>
            <p>The main goal of this work is to enable comparable meta-research on digital
               humanities, covering various disciplines. Such a body of knowledge would help in
               developing a self conscious — if not self critical — approach to the research
               conducted in the field. Moreover, it could serve as a methodological guideline for
               non-DH researchers willing to adopt certain methods in their disciplinary work.</p>
            <p>The DiMPO team is now elaborating a detailed online handbook to accompany the
                  protocol.<note>An early draft is already available here: <ref
                     target="http://entopia.org/meta-research/doku.php"
                     >http://entopia.org/meta-research/doku.php</ref>.</note> Future plans include a
               series of workshops, presentations and tutorials for scholars wishing to conduct such
               research. Furthermore, DiMPO will be conducting a series of case-studies deploying
               this protocol. The authors are also considering whether to open the protocol to other
               topics and uses within the DH community, including such specific fields as scholarly
               writing practices in DH, or quality assessment. Another avenue for development would
               be to adapt parts of the protocol for evaluating DH projects and generating detailed
               reports about their activities, and/or for sharpening the specification of DH
               development projects.</p>
            <p>While local conditions are always the most relevant, scholarly practice increasingly
               includes conceptual, rather than physical, connectivity because of norms and
               competencies that are shared across geographic and disciplinary boundaries. These
               collaborative practices are further enabled by online, mainstreamed and broadly
               available pervasive digital infrastructures and tools (cf. <ref target="#dallas2016"
                  >Dallas 2016</ref>), which in turn produce new regimes for inter- and
               cross-disciplinary scholarly work. The only approach that could conceivably handle
               this variability must take into account research norms, environments (both physical
               and digital), tools, social formations, and technological limitations which set the
               parameters — and shape the container — in which each instance of digital research
               finally takes place. Therefore, we see this paper as a step towards establishing a
               systematic reflection on the dynamic field of digital humanities, a set of practices
               which is more often <q>defined</q> and <q>debated</q> than studied, and which always
               flows to fit the shape of the container in which it is placed.</p>
