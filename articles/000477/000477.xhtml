                  <p>This paper presents a multicase study protocol for meta-research in Digital
                     Humanities, prepared by Digital Methods and Practices Observatory (DiMPO) Working
                     Group of the Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH).
                     The protocol is intended to help researchers in conducting meta-research and adopting
                     this methodology for different purposes, disciplines and approaches. As many of the
                     issues raised here are already covered in manuals for social research, our focus is
                     the specificity of meta-research in the DH environment. The specificity of DH in this
                     respect relies on an intrinsic challenge of bringing together generally
                     undertheorised approaches of the humanities with very formal and process-driven ICT
                     approaches. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The main assumption behind this research is that a meaningful change in scholarly
                     practices is taking place and is worth investigating. Moreover, a full assessment
                     of
                     this transformation should not focus exclusively on pioneering research, but rather
                     on the selective uptake of digital practices and methods by researchers in the
                     humanities: those who do not necessarily affiliate themselves with DH but simply use
                     digital tools to explore particular problems. Hence, this paper should be of interest
                     not only to researchers willing to conduct meta analysis, but to all DH practitioners
                     willing to gain critical perspective on their work, as well as for those working on
                     funding, evaluation and research policy.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Three pilot studies are discussed in this paper, as they served as a basis for the
                     protocol. They focused on different “units of inquiry” (individual researchers,
                     projects, research communities) and varied in methodological directions: (a)
                     individual interviews with Polish DH researchers; (b) mixed-methods analysis of
                     digital practice in E-CURATORS, a multicase SSHRC Insight project focusing on
                     archaeological research sites or projects, integrating individual interviews,
                     document analysis and naturalistic observation; and, (c) group interviews with
                     historians and literary scholars conducted within the framework of NEP4DISSENT COST
                     Action. The resulting protocol is discussed in detail and some directions for further
                     research are suggested.

                  bounded community of scholars, and the materially constrained toolset of a single
                  discipline. If scholarly research often now appears to transcend locality and place,
                  methodological approaches to studying how scholars work should also adapt
                  accordingly.

               <div class="ptext" id="p8">As we come to reflect on how humanities research is shaped today by the physical and
                  material factors that condition the work of researchers, as well as the new capabilities
                  that the digital ecosystem affords, we see that there are micro-practices — visible
                  in
                  those examples described above — that fall outside both the traditional humanistic
                  methods and what is usually considered Digital Humanities (DH). We understand DH in
                  the
                  broadest possible sense, as the “big tent”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2012">Svensson 2012</a>] of digital practices, methods, tools and resources which
                  inform various disciplines in the humanities. Moreover, we do not limit its scope
                  to the
                  core DH community of researchers advancing cutting-edge methodologies, but also look
                  at
                  scholars who would never call themselves digital humanists yet do take advantage of
                  the
                  digital to answer their non-digital research questions. “Big tent” DH recognizes
                  that the importance of the digital is not limited to the use of computational,
                  algorithmic methods for research, but has to do with the broader shift of the whole
                  paradigm of humanities proper: the centrality of digital resources and access to them
                  for all kinds of humanities work; changes in scholarly communication, peer review
                  and
                  publication where digital and online systems are central, inter- and
                  cross-disciplinarity; as well as working with open content and open data, both digitised
                  and born digital.

                  not fall under the umbrella of a single custodial environment but are rather assembled
                  as a local response to a single project’s needs. To assemble them involves repeated

                  of bricolage, tinkering with moving parts that were not designed to work together.
                  Nowhere is the impact of this status more present than in the situatedness of humanities
                  research, that is in the (self-) management of its physical, virtual and mental spaces.
                  SPARKLE (Scholarly Primitives And Renewed Knowledge-Led Exchanges), one of the studies
                  we reference below, showed in particular the degree to which location and spatial
                  configuration were felt by the researchers interviewed to be integral to the
                  productivity of the humanistic scholar [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2016">Edmond et al. 2016</a>]. We are perhaps used
                  to this aspect of, for example, archive-based work, due to the external constraints
                  of
                  opening hours, reading rooms, and all the rest of what Arlette Farge refers to as
                  their
                  “absurd rules of operation”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#farge2013">Farge 2013</a>, 52]. But what perhaps has its roots in a time-management
                  challenge progresses into what manifests as a highly individualised and expertly tuned
                  set of spatial strategies. Even in the relatively small SPARKLE sample, there was
                  essentially no agreement, of where the ‘best place’ to work might be. In part this
                  was a
                  reflection of adaptation to different life circumstances: senior academics with teaching
                  and administrative responsibilities seemed generally to find their offices more rife
                  with distraction than their home spaces, for example. It also sometimes indicated
                  a
                  separation, or multiple separations, between administrative work, personal life and
                  research work. But even these general rules had exceptions, where the desire for
                  work-life balance created yet further variation (libraries or coffee shops, for example,
                  or working in the office but out of business hours, on weekends or in the evening).

               <div class="ptext" id="p10">The nature of humanities research as being physically unbounded, or perhaps, more
                  precisely, loosely and alternatingly bound to multiple places (the office, the archive,
                  the classroom, indeed even the virtual environment or page of writing etc.) places
                  it in
                  stark contrast to laboratory science, in which the nature of the work space is very
                  specific and determined, forming (at its most extreme extension) a guarantor of
                  scientific credibility, that is a “clean” or “controlled” environment. The
                  contrast between the closed physical space of the laboratory and nomadic nature of
                  the
                  humanistic knowledge-creation process, with its constant refreshing of sources,
                  backdrops and inspirations, is reminiscent of the contrast between farmed agriculture
                  and the hunter gatherer, with the pre-agrarian mode of subsistence being perhaps more
                  dependent on shifting availability of resources in a wider space, but benefitting
                  instead from a more multisensory, kinetic and synthetic mode of cultivation.

               <div class="ptext" id="p11">The idea that objects should be organised in physical and mental space also
                  interconnects with another theme that appeared across our study, which is that knowledge
                  creation is an embodied process, encompassing far more than just the brain and its
                  focussed sense of sight as an organ for processing source inputs. This is no less
                  true
                  in virtual than in physical spaces. Separation (of tasks, of ideas) and integration
                  (of
                  source material, with a community) are constantly in balance in the epistemic process,
                  to the extent that one interviewee stressed the importance of technology for him in
                  making it possible to access his entire personal source library from his computer
                  at all
                  times. These mental and physical environments, as well as the broader sensory world,
                  of
                  those engaged in historical humanistic research leads to an enduring dominance of
                  multimodal personal research environments. In spite of the rise of digital humanities
                  (which some, but not all, of the interviewees had embraced), historians still prefer
                  to
                  have notes, notebooks, pencils, post-its, books, printouts, and all manner of stimuli
                  around them, in addition to their laptops and digital tools. This set of hybrid
                  practices, spaces and tools are therefore customised to the questions and the knowledge
                  base of the researcher(s) using them, and yet must also be flexible enough to
                  accommodate research teams that evolve over time, software that is continually
                  versioning up, and workflows that must be reinvented with every new experiment, even
                  as
                  they expand to incorporate new technological affordances. How can we study this kind
                  of
                  subtle and evolving phenomenon?

               <div class="ptext" id="p12">This paper proposes an approach to qualitative meta-research into contemporary
                  scholarship which enables us to track and understand novel research practices and
                  assess
                  their impact on scholarly activity as a whole. Our approach is based on several pilot
                  studies, and our goal has been to use these studies as “ground truth” to support a
                  theoretically-informed, highly original methodological framework for qualitative
                  research on DH practice: a self-reflexive approach to DH practice which is often
                  overlooked in existing empirical studies. The primary audience of this paper, given
                  its
                  methodological scope, are DH researchers willing to either conduct meta-research,
                  or to
                  critically evaluate their own work. We believe that this kind of research should be
                  of
                  interest to researchers willing to understand their own method and be empowered to
                  be
                  critical about their work (in particular people embarking on large-scale collaborative
                  projects). Additionally, anyone interested in interdisciplinarity should find much
                  to
                  think about here as well. Beyond the academic, anyone looking to fund, evaluate, promote
                  or integrate DH (whether as a Dean or funder or research manager or policy maker)
                  could
                  make use of this perspective.

               <div class="ptext" id="p13">The rationale for meta-research in DH, viewed as an integrative framework, could be
                  explained in four dimensions: ontology (how do we conceptualize the domain of research),
                  epistemology (what is the knowledge we are seeking to produce), axiology (what values
                  shape the object and process of our research, i.e., the infamous “so what”
                  question), and methodology (research design and method selection to address these

                  interactions involving purposeful action by researchers. Hence DH is treated not merely
                  as empirical reality (accessible only through empirical study) but also as consisting
                  of
                  such elements as motivations and norms of researchers, or goals and objectives served
                  by
                  their research choices, or the criteria, often implicit, of what constitutes “good
                  research.” These ontological commitments bring our work close to the model of
                  purposeful human activity established by cultural-historical activity theory [<a class="ref" href="#leontev1978">Leont’ev 1978</a>]
                  [<a class="ref" href="#engestrom2000">Engeström 2000</a>]. Figure 1 offers an informal model representing this

                  interviews with actors, but also from examination of documents, records and other
                  traces. At the same time, building from the ontological assumptions, our protocol
                  does
                  focus on understanding what motivates and what shapes DH researchers' work, i.e. it
                  seeks to prioritize objects of our study from the viewpoint of research
                  participants.

               <div class="ptext" id="p16">As for the axiological level, we advocate for DH researchers (not just meta-researchers)
                  to engage in what Pierre Bourdieu calls “epistemic
                  reflexivity”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#bourdieu1992">Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992</a>]. Central to Bourdieu's idea is the notion of “two steps
                  back” in research: the first step back is to look at the research field itself. In
                  other words, we “zoom out,” to use <a href="#nicolini2010">Nicolini's
                     (2010)</a> different formulation, to view more clearly the main entities and
                  processes-relations in the field of study. The second step back is to look from the
                  outside at the approach, methods, and instruments of research (i.e., for a DH
                  researcher, to consider the “epistemic framework” or commitments of their own
                  research, or the research of others DHers). This kind of “double objectification”
                  is what we suggest through our call for meta-research.

                  the
                  data speak to us, nor do we believe that it is enough to just start with hunches and

               <div class="ptext" id="p18">In some ways our meta-research on DH can be equated to the kind of methodological
                  work
                  that goes on in any community of practice (bioinformatics, for example), or indeed
                  is
                  akin to the work of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the Sociology of Scientific
                  Knowledge (SSK), but there are a few key differences. Primary among them would be
                  the
                  gap in epistemic vocabulary and different levels of methodological coherence between
                  the
                  diverse fields we examine. Unlike the relative coherence of work within specific
                  sciences that was noted in STS/SSK studies, e.g. the existence of coherent epistemic
                  cultures in molecular biology and in high energy physics identified by <a href="#knorrcetina1999">Knorr-Cetina (1999)</a>, humanities disciplines tend to
                  be less coherent methodologically, especially when contrasted with information and
                  computer sciences. In other words, humanities are generally undertheorised in terms
                  of
                  their methods and epistemic strategies, while software development seems at times
                  perhaps overly process-driven in this respect. There is a distinct challenge in bringing
                  these approaches together. In addition, the starting point for this work has not been
                  entirely disinterested: this is an investigation of DH, but also performed — to some
                  extent — by those trained primarily as (digital) humanists, not as social scientists.
                  Because of this, even when we use social science tools and instruments, we may use
                  them
                  differently, drawing on the strengths of what we were taught to do (read texts, looks
                  for patterns, use a peripheral view, be sensitive to subtle, trace indicators of bias
                  or
                  habitus, be unwilling to accept that language use is neutral, focus on cultural norms,
                  values etc). The resulting positioning of our approach to understanding how DH research
                  works, brings certain restrictions on its scalability or universality. While it would
                  be
                  possible for observers of other inter-disciplines and methodological communities to
                  take
                  inspiration from the manner in which we have leveraged our perspective on the work
                  of
                  those in our immediate environment, the specificities of how that would optimally
                  be
                  deployed could be quite different and lie beyond the scope of this paper. That said,
                  our
                  approach would be quite extensible to most DH research and researchers seeking a
                  framework from which to observe their fields.

                  and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH) to develop a protocol for DH meta-research. Included

                  to
                  the DH field, and an account of earlier DiMPO work conducted with a meta-research

                  of
                  DH meta-research and lay the groundwork for the development of our protocol which
                  is
                  presented in the penultimate section of the article. The DiMPO research protocol for
                  DH
                  meta-research consists of a set of specific methodological guidelines for researchers
                  wishing to study research practices in the humanities. It includes: (a) the proposed
                  research workflow (summarized in Figure 3); (b) a conceptual model accounting for
                  both
                  external and internal dimensions of DH activity; (c) a core code system (taxonomy
                  of
                  descriptors) amenable to the qualitative data analysis (QDA), which could be expressed
                  in XML as a SKOS structure if necessary; (d) a qualitative interviewing and document
                  analysis codebook identifying themes for eliciting evidence in situ (elaborated in
                  Table
                  1); (e) an exemplary case study structure to shape analysis and writing-up. The final
                  section sets forth the next steps for the protocol and the DiMPO working group.

                     The CENDARI Project (2012-2016) was funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework
                     Programme to pilot the implementation of a virtual research infrastructure for
                     scholars of medieval and modern history. A part of the project dedicated to the
                     Domain Use Cases aimed to capture the different research practices in transnational
                     history, challenges posed by the fragmentation of archival sources, and how a virtual
                     research infrastructure can help address these challenges (CENDARI WP4 team, 2013).
                     The DESIR project (INFRADEV-03-2016-2017; 2017-2019), created a very informative
                     series of video interviews with DH researchers, focusing in part on their own career
                     paths.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e623">[2]</a> The
                     KPLEX project (2017-2018), funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020
                     research programme, conducted surveys and interviews on how big data research might
                     be better informed by humanities research practices. The most relevant pieces of work
                     for DH meta-research are the interviews of WP2, which looked at computer scientists’
                     attitudes toward the definitions of certain key terms in their work (especially
                     “data”), provenance and data cleaning as productive or destructive processes,
                     and the role of uncertainty in humanities research datasets. The protocol used,
                     background information and analysis of the interviews were published as a
                     report.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e631">[3]</a>
                     The PROVIDEDH Project (CHIST-ERA, 2017-2020) prepared User Stories and Scenarios
                     which present eight cases of how uncertainty arises and is managed in early modern
                     historical research, drawn from interviews with four expert researchers in the field.
                     Finally, The Scholarly Primitives and Renewed Knowledge-Led Exchanges Project [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2016">Edmond et al. 2016</a>] was inspired by ethnographic methods, in looking at the
                     practices of knowledge creation in the humanities. Nine interviews were carried out
                     with the aim of pinpointing the key moments and milestones of this process [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2018">Edmond 2018</a>]. What we can extract from this distillation of almost three
                     decades of research in digitally-enabled humanities scholarship is that any broad
                     framework for study has to be expansive and customizable for a field-specific study.
                     It needs to account for the specificity of the sources, the research team and funding
                     structure, versioning software — in short, the radical instability of the rapidly
                     changing research environment as well as knowledge production itself. Even a cursory
                     examination of how researchers work with digital technology reveals that the
                     application of specific research methods is dependent on the researcher’s ability
                     to
                     use particular digital tools and services (as well as on the stage in research
                     lifecycle, the disciplinary context, etc.). Those studies form the background for
                     the
                     investigation on the scholarly practices, digital needs and attitudes of European
                     researchers in the human sciences which is the focus of the present discussion, and

                     questions through quantitative summaries and statistical associations between

                     originally used as a mere synonym to meta-analysis, i.e. the consolidation of
                     aggregated findings of published studies such as different clinical trials on the
                     same research hypothesis, the emerging new field of meta-research now seeks to find
                     evidence-based improvements to scientific work through “research
                     on research”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wikipedia2018">Wikipedia 2018</a>] by looking more broadly at “thematic areas of methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and
                     incentives,” combining theoretical and empirical investigation, and
                     extending beyond retrospective studies to planned, prospective inquiry on scientific

                     [<a class="ref" href="#ioannidis2015">Ioannidis et al. 2015</a>]. DiMPO shares the pragmatic goal of meta-research, as
                     it has been adopted in the natural and hard sciences, to make a positive difference
                     in the way researchers work. This commitment underlies the mixed methods research
                     it
                     adopted, consisting of a combination of longitudinal questionnaire survey, literature
                     review, and qualitative multicase study investigations. The scope of DiMPO work,
                     driving the construction of the DiMPO protocol for case study meta-research, is
                     therefore adjusted to studying DH scholarly work by zooming in to a granular study
                     of
                     particular research activities and operations and zooming out to considering broader
                     socio-technical and cultural factors. Beside contribution to knowledge, an important
                     objective of DH meta-research is to assess and help overcome challenges currently
                     faced by humanities researchers in creating, curating and using digital resources,
                     taking up and building useful digital tools and services, and developing and adopting
                     appropriate digital research methods in practice.

                     between three pilot studies conducted by different group members and discussed their
                     outcomes, paving the way for the preparation of the final version of the DiMPO
                     protocol. These pilot studies were not designed for the purpose of this meta-research
                     endeavour: they rather represent active, actual research on DH scholarly practices
                     and knowledge work conducted by different co-authors of this study. These span
                     different disciplines and fields within the “big tent” of DH, from literary
                     studies to history and archaeology, different units for inquiry from individual

                     complementarity and diversity, these pilot studies were selected to satisfy, through
                     the principle of saturation typical of qualitative research, a criterion of

                     produced, including a common template for outcomes and reporting, instructions on
                     construction of each case study dossier and how it should be situated in the context
                     of multiple case studies. This framework was elaborated according to the particular
                     research needs of the pilot studies. Three studies, presented in brief in the next
                     section, account for three complementary research perspectives adopted by DiMPO,
                     focusing on a different level of “unit of inquiry” and adopting methodological
                     directions from this orientation: (a) <span class="hi italic">individual interviews</span>

                     conducted within the framework of NEP4DISSENT COST Action. A secondary dimension,
                     on
                     which the pilots contribute differently, was to balance between a “grounded
                     theory,” inductive approach based on open coding, and a theory-laden,
                     conceptual model based approach based on practice studies, activity theory etc.
                     Finally, the choice of case-studies was motivated by the need to gather input on
                     digital practices in multiple disciplines (literary studies, history, archaeology),
                     reflecting our broad understanding of the humanities and the “big-tent”
                     characteristics of DH. In all, a total of twenty-seven researchers were included as
                     study subjects in these pilot studies. The following section briefly contextualises
                     the presentation of the protocol that follows and its main purpose is to give the

                     understanding of the DiMPO survey results with regard to how digital practices change

                     understand digital practices in the context of their needs. It was assumed that a
                     series of interviews would provide better information on the values ​​assigned to
                     digital technologies in the context of their use in research, to identify
                     particularly useful existing and missing digital tools, as well as potential
                     obstacles. Other research questions included the influence of digital tools on
                     communication between researchers and disciplines, dissemination of results, the
                     perception of what constitutes research data, and researchers’ assessments of the

                     the
                     competent use of the digital in terms of a contribution to one’s life quality and
                     performance [<a class="ref" href="#filiciak2013">Filiciak et al. 2013</a>]. This relative perspective allows us to
                     view digital competence in relation to other spheres of activity, allowing a
                     subjective assessment of respondents’ competences with regard to their actual needs.
                     In order to fruitfully explore the subject in the relational approach, the research
                     team employed the technique of episodic interviews [<a class="ref" href="#flick1997">Flick 1997</a>], as it
                     encourages the exploration of both semantic and episodic dimensions knowledge. The
                     former entails internalised social knowledge, whereas the latter expresses its
                     particular expressions based on specific actions. The method provided insights not
                     only into interviewees’ assumptions on digital research technologies and values
                     ascribed to them, but also into particular manifestations of these assumptions and

                     9
                     questions. Section one, aimed at eliciting <em class="term">semantic knowledge</em>, included
                     general questions about the usefulness of digital technologies in research, along
                     with introductory questions identifying the interviewee’s main research interests,
                     career focus and current work situation. Section two concentrated on the
                     <em class="term">episodic knowledge</em>, which regards to the following dimensions:
                     communication within the scientific community, disseminating research results, doing
                     research, academic teaching. The interviewees were very willing to share their
                     experiences with particular devices and software with regard to those dimensions.
                     Section three was dedicated to consolidating and juxtaposing both dimensions of
                     knowledge. The questions focused on the interviewees assessment of their individual
                     digital skills as well as the skills of their scholarly community. This section also
                     assessed the perceived effectiveness of using digital technologies in research in

                     enable, facilitate, and in some cases demand the emergence of networks of cooperation
                     within the academia (i.e. researchers from various fields), as well as between
                     academia and other groups (amateur science enthusiasts for instance). Furthermore,
                     digital technologies and practices can help bridge the gap between academic centres
                     and peripheries (although limited access to digital technologies may have a negative
                     impact on this process), as it facilitates cooperation between units, opens access
                     to

                     enabled by big data to conduct large-scale comparative studies. Digital research is
                     perceived as more cost- and time-efficient, facilitating the coordination of various
                     elements of the research process. However, the interviewees highlighted the need for
                     the conscious use of the new tools, which may give great opportunities but should
                     always serve as a means for answering the research question, so that the mere use
                     of
                     tools on new material does not become a goal in itself. The writing was reported

                     were not replaced in the studied sample by new tools. Interestingly, what was further
                     confirmed in the community research described below, researchers incorporate into
                     their work the non-scientific resources as, for instance, data provided by amateur
                     genealogists or individual enthusiasts. As for the physical working space,

                     research data: (a) audio or video recorded testimonies and stories, acquired through
                     a combination of life history and semi-open episodic interviews, and covering
                     historical (factual), attitudinal and normative dimensions of archaeological
                     activity; (b) documentary evidence, including captured field data, digital photos,
                     models, notes, recordings, logs, database entries, maps, cataloguing texts, reports,
                     web content and publications, and (c), optionally, naturalistic observation of study
                     subjects. While the focus is on the overall activity system constituted by
                     interacting actors, objects and mediating tools, E-CURATORS aims to examine different
                     levels of granularity of scholarly activity through a process of
                     <em class="term">zooming-in</em> to the specifics of digitally-mediated actions and

                     pros and cons) elicited from study subjects on their archaeological practice. A
                     preliminary schematic representation (Figure 1) identifies the functional structure
                     of digital archaeological practice through three overlapping facets, or views: (a)
                     intentionality, relating activities with research actors, beliefs they hold,
                     collectivities they belong to and shared drivers such as motives, goals and norms;
                     (b) process, relating activities with procedures guided by drivers, tools
                     implementing them, and information objects involved in them; and, (c) knowledge work,
                     relating activities with archaeological entities, information objects, and beliefs

                     archaeological curation practice. ADS activity is predicated upon localised primary
                     archaeological fieldwork, but, by virtue of how communications between archivists
                     and
                     “client” archaeologists unfold, and how information objects (such as
                     datasets, and archaeological reports) are produced and curated, the ADS work itself
                     detached from the location where it takes place: ADS staff work mostly in front of
                     computer screens, using information systems and services accessible via digital
                     networks, and interact with stakeholders over the phone, email and other
                     digitally-enabled means of communication. Viewed as an archaeological semiosphere
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lauzikas2018">Laužikas et al. 2018</a>], the field where ADS research, curation and data
                     management work is enacted may be conceived as a (conceptual) landscape punctuated
                     by
                     diverse disciplinary traditions, data management methods and rules-of-thumb, norms
                     of
                     best practice and acceptance criteria, competencies and skills, systems and services,
                     and data standards, among other things. While place is not one of the entities
                     represented explicitly in the E-CURATORS schematic model (fig. 1), a topological
                     structure is implicit in its overarching conceptual organisation. Besides, the Neo4J
                     graph database was selected to represent E-CURATORS data exactly because of is
                     ability to allow visualisation, navigation and traversal of topological structures
                     representing curation practices such as found at ADS. Aspects relevant to the ADS
                     case include the emergence of practices of <em class="term">creolisation</em> and
                     <em class="term">translation</em> emerging at the <em class="term">boundary</em> between
                     semiospheres of scholarly archaeology and data management. Other cases of
                     archaeological practice investigated by E-CURATORS, related to digitally-enabled
                     archaeological excavation and survey, may call attention to the boundary between
                     material-tangible and digital-intangible archaeological work, and the processes of
                     creolisation and translation between competing norms, methods and regimes of value
                     among these two semiospheres.

                     familiarity with DH tools within the research group, as well as probing attitudes
                     and

                     born-digital but in most cases analogue); and, (c) to identify the key needs of this

                     creating datasets that could be easily integrated with those maintained by other
                     scholars – sometimes because of an investment in a single platform from which it is

                     historian commented, “even though there are a lot of tools out of
                     there, but the risk is big because you need to build up your entire data set to
                     accommodate to one tool, and then you realize it’s not the tool you needed (after
                     you cut and pasted for days)” (Group Interview 3, 2018). These group
                     interviews also revealed a promising line of engagement for NEP4DISSENT to introduce
                     more advanced text analytical methods to those already working with quantitative
                     analysis of written materials, but unsure of how to engage with semantic-level
                     analysis. The main reasons scholars gave for using analogue over digital methods were
                     that: (a) their sources were too mixed, (b) that they lacked faith in digital tools,
                     and, (c) the scale of material collected was so small that they didn’t feel they need
                     for the specific tools discussed or mentioned by colleagues.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p51">A more systematic analysis was performed by applying full qualitative data coding
                     of
                     one of the group interviews. In the context of QDA, coding is defined as a systematic
                     classification process that helps identify themes or patterns, thus forming a basis
                     for the subjective interpretation of a document’s content [<a class="ref" href="#hsieh2005">Hsieh and Shannon 2005</a>].
                     There are different software options that enable computer-supported content analysis
                     and coding, including MaxQDA, NVivo, Dedoose, and ATLAS.ti. These tools allow
                     investigators to import various kinds of documents, usually in .txt .rtf .doc/x .pdf
                     formats, and to perform different actions that help the content analysis process.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p52">For this in-depth qualitative analysis, data was gathered from the group interview
                     with two researchers working in the area of memory studies, both members of the
                     NEP4Dissent Working Group 4 on “Cultural memory of dissent” (Group Interview 4).
                     A full transcription of the interview was prepared and QDA was applied to the
                     transcribed text by using the MAXQDA software. The creation of a code system followed
                     an inductive (data-driven) approach by reading and summarizing raw data. The
                     inductive approach uses open coding, where specific codes are derived from data and
                     are subsequently classified in order to create the code system, usually by
                     categorisation aiming to reduce the number of codes by grouping them. An advantage
                     of
                     the inductive approach is that it does not impose any preconceived categories or
                     theoretical perspectives to the ongoing research and allows to gather direct
                     information from study participants, which is grounded in the actual data [<a class="ref" href="#hsieh2005">Hsieh and Shannon 2005</a>]. No in vivo coding was applied during the QDA, meaning that
                     the process of assigning a code mainly involved paraphrasing and generalization of
                     selected text segments rather than verbatim codes. The inductive approach provided
                     useful insights into an analysis based on raw data and helped to identify potential
                     areas of concern expressed by researchers during the interview. Open coding resulted
                     in the emergence of a code system which consisted of six broader definitions (codes)
                     and their subcodes thus presenting the main findings of the interview (see Figure
                     2).

                     digital tools: “(...) in my case there is a disconnection extent

                     about them. So I don’t have proper tools and knowledge on how to work with them.
                     As a cultur[al] historian I see a big need to work with digital sources”

                     that are important for research, but even more so online research data, with
                     different websites and social media platforms playing a key role. The Danish
                     researcher admits that social media is a huge incentive for her in finding new ways
                     of studying memory: “I also haven’t studied the memory of dissent
                     as such, but I was looking into dissenting memories and what you can do with
                     digital sources and social networks, mainly Facebook, and also Youtube. They are
                     places where anyone can contribute and it’s a massive resource for the study of
                     memory” (Group interview 4, 2018). Meanwhile, the Bulgarian scholar points
                     to the importance of thematic portals for her research, e. g. “(...) websites for sharing memories of socialism (...) is another source which is
                     born-digital, because people go there and they write their comments and memories,
                     but sometimes they upload photos of objects from that period (...)” (Group
                     interview 4, 2018).

                     were the most extensively discussed by both scholars, and particular codes were
                     assigned to identify specific activities being mentioned, e. g. seeking of
                     information, acquiring and organizing research data, publishing research results,
                     collaborating with other scholars, and preserving data. In some cases, it’s
                     fascinating to acknowledge how the research process might be ordinary and
                     unformalized: “(..) we are very honest web users as most other
                     people, the way we engage with net is unprofessional acting like ordinary people
                     with tools that are easy available” (Group interview 4, 2018). Actually,
                     the simplicity of research activities was observed in every step of research, where
                     research data is usually acquired by copying, pasting or by printscreens and
                     organised by using USB stick, folder system, Powerpoint or Word document: “(...) I have a Word file where I copy-paste links that I feel I want
                     to go back [to]. It’s like [a] bibliography, but it’s a linkography - list of
                     links” (Group interview 4, 2018).

                     related to open access, lack of digital methods literacy and the complexity of online
                     data. And while the first two perhaps are easy to anticipate, the third issue points
                     to an increasing need to use online data in/for research, as well as methods and
                     tools that could deal with it. As noticed by one of the researchers in the group
                     interview, “(...) working with social networks is incredibly
                     tempting and definitely dangerous, because it’s so easy and the feeling is
                     quantifiable (you can count number of likes, comments). What I saw as a challenge
                     in this connection is a super-fluidiness of so much of it, it’s so unstable, so
                     easy, inexpensive, so you don’t know much what is going on” (Group
                     interview 4, 2018).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p57">This method was also tested in an environment of scholars with a fairly long record
                     in DH, who identified with that field, through an interview conducted with four
                     members of the Stanford Literary Lab,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e998">[6]</a> a group representing the field of
                     literary studies, and consisting of scholars on different stages of their careers,
                     with a long history of collaboration. Hence, the interview collected individual
                     responses but also became a platform for negotiating a collective approach towards
                     methods, tools and research strategies adopted by the group. The NEP4DISSENT Group
                     Interview Protocol was slightly modified in this study, allowing for questions
                     inspired by the narrative component of the episodic interviews, discussed in the
                     first pilot study, namely about how the researchers were introduced to digital
                     methods, and how they see the field in the time-perspective (five years ago and five
                     years from now). It should be noted that, as in the case of previous interviews, it
                     was clear for interviewees that the application of digital tools and methods should
                     be always driven by the humanities’ research questions, not the other way around.
                     Moreover, the group tend to seek novel research problems to develop new tools, rather
                     than to use the ones they have already developed on other material. This high
                     methodological awareness also translated into the interviewees’ self-perception as
                     DH
                     scholars. Actually, in their words, being a DH scholar means having “two jobs,”
                     or writing “one and a half dissertation(s),” as they need to master two fields:
                     literary studies and computational analysis. They also pointed out to the
                     collaboration model of DH inquiry, which differed largely from individualistic
                     approaches of literary studies. They were also aware of some methodological criticism
                     of DH methods, which they dubbed ‘the rolling backlash’, but claimed it was very
                     productive for their work as it pushed them to rethink certain aspects of their
                     mode.

                     members often live in different cities and communicate with each other via electronic
                     channels, the actual meeting space remains crucial for debating the current status
                     of
                     the project and exchanging the ideas that may emerge in the “first phase”
                     dedicated to individual work. The big table in the lab, around which the team gathers
                     for the project meeting, is, in the words of the founding director of the Lab, “as essential a tool as the really expensive ones ... All researchers
                     bring to this phase their interests, and even fixations. At times, there is a lot
                     of noise. But in a few magic moments, the group becomes truly more than the sum of
                     its parts; it ‘sees’ things that no single pair of eyes could have”

                     for the integration of the individual perspectives and generation of genuinely

                        are relevant, consequential and potentially impactful. The very first step is to
                        define the main area of the case study. As digital humanities tends to be
                        conceived as a “big tent” for a plethora of approaches
                        and disciplines (cf. <a href="#svensson2012">Svensson 2012</a>), there are
                        many potential areas for a meaningful work into contemporary research practices,
                        be it the uptake of digital encoding by scholarly editors in literary studies,
                        cultural analytics for art history, or databases in religious studies. The main
                        assumption behind scholarly practices meta-research is that a meaningful change in
                        scholarly practices takes place and is worth investigating. Moreover, as we argued
                        in the introduction, the full assessment of this change should involve not only
                        pioneering computational research, but rather the broader uptake of the digital
                        practices and methods by researchers in the humanities, even if they do not
                        self-identify as digital humanists, as long as they use digital resources, tools
                        and methods in order to explore particular problems. Hence, the investigator
                        should choose the most promising aspect of the field, basing on her own expertise

                     <div class="ptext" id="p63">That leads us to the identification of appropriate research questions. Sometimes,
                        research questions may take the form of well-defined hypotheses, to be confirmed
                        or refuted by operationalizing them as relationships among properties of the data
                        collected in the study (deduction). Alternatively, they may merely consist in
                        identifying relevant aspects of phenomena manifested in the data, which will be
                        later elucidated through “inference to the best explanation” among
                        alternatives (abduction). Finally, there are cases where the research questions
                        are little more than informal ideas and “sensitizing concepts” on potential
                        topics of interest, in the expectation that new knowledge will arise from the
                        grounded, bottom-up examination of the data (induction). DH meta-research
                        questions are diverse: for example, they may be how digital resources and tools
                        change the way research questions are formulated and scholarly investigations are
                        conducted, what is the status digital sources in humanities research, or what are
                        the effects of digital collaboration practices and dissemination of knowledge.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p65">Another integral part of this early, conceptual stage is the choice of the unit of
                        inquiry. DiMPO protocol distinguishes between three kinds of units, depending on
                        the types of research questions: research community, research project, individual
                        researchers. The focus on <span class="hi italic">Research Community</span> enables a view
                        on a particular field, discipline or community of practice, and an assessment of
                        the role the digital in this field. It could also assess the popularity of certain
                        tools and approaches in the community as well as its value judgments concerning
                        the evaluation of the digital work, i.e. what is considered a good practice in the
                        field. The <span class="hi italic">Research Project/Site</span> approach allows for a
                        comprehensive and formal description of a particular project, research site, or
                        bounded activity of an organizational unit in its entirety, in order to provide a
                        situated picture and understanding of a particular research endeavour, and the
                        interaction between people, technology and its outputs. The analysis of <span class="hi italic">Individual Researchers</span> supplements these approaches with the
                        biographical perspective on a researcher, her individual motivations and goals,
                        particular methods, beliefs held about the digital, and career trajectory. The
                        pilot studies presented earlier are good examples of types of differences in
                        results between particular approaches.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p66">The second step is to establish the framework of the project, i.e. translate
                        research questions into a concrete study workflow. The questions which emerged in
                        the previous step will be now operationalised and particular methods and
                        techniques should be chosen. In the pilots we focused on personal interviews,
                        group interviews and observations, described in more detail in the fieldwork
                        section below. Once the choice is made, a researcher needs to generate the study
                        form, i.e. questionnaires, or observation protocols, relevant to research
                        questions. Additionally an ethics review should be performed and suitable policies
                        applied, especially in cases where there is risk and potential for harm
                        (professional, reputational, etc.) for study participants or investigators. Some
                        funding agencies may require rigorous ethics review, yet, for most of the cases,
                        it involves considering such aspects in clear terms as regards risks, conflicts of
                        interest, preservation of anonymity of study participants, right for withdrawal,
                        obligations for data retention, conditions of access to research data, and
                        consultation with study participants before publication. For instance, one should
                        know beforehand how raw data will be stored, or if it is going to be published in
                        any form. All such cases will be outlined in a consent form prepared for the
                        study, which should be signed by subjects prior to the interview.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p67">Depending on the particular unit of analysis chosen for the study, investigators
                        will need to establish criteria for selection of cases, i.e. which particular
                        individuals, research projects or communities will be approached in this study.

                        ways of acquiring material, often used in our pilot studies, is an interview by
                        videoconference, which is an easy and inexpensive way to reach out to a wider,
                        international base of subjects. But fieldwork may also include participant
                        observation of particular research activities, which could entail attending
                        project meetings and presentations, testing tools developed by actors or observing
                        them at work. This also can entail collection of documentary evidence, such as
                        photos of resources and workplaces, as well as gathering outputs of DH research
                        activity. Such an approach allows for gathering knowledge about the processes
                        which could not be noticed by subjects and not reported in interviews.

                        preparation for analysis. Field notes need to be organized and annotated with the
                        time and place where they were taken; recordings, photos and videos need to be
                        inventoried and may also need to be processed before transcription. Given the
                        scope of DiMPO research, audio (and optionally video) recordings should be
                        transcribed, so as to capture fully and faithfully the verbal content of
                        participant speech, but also salient paralinguistic aspects of speech, as well as
                        relevant non-verbal actions and events. Finally, it includes conventions for
                        describing gestures, pointing at objects and screen events, as these can be
                        important features of observed scholarly practice. CAQDAS packages include useful
                        transcription functions as a matter of course, allowing for slower playback and
                        rewind, pausing, and insertion of timestamps. Transcribers should allow for 6-7
                        hours of transcription time for each hour of audio recording, or roughly ten
                        person days to transcribe a typical set of audio recordings for each case study.
                        Given the multiple parameters and dimensions of DH research practices to be
                        investigated, the DiMPO protocol stipulates full transcription of audio
                        recordings, rather than open (live) transcription of only the segments that
                        investigators find of interest at first hand.

                     parameters — and shape the container — in which each instance of digital research
                     finally takes place. Therefore, we see this paper as a step towards establishing a
                     systematic reflection on the dynamic field of digital humanities, a set of practices
                     which is more often “defined” and “debated” than studied, and which always
                     flows to fit the shape of the container in which it is placed.
