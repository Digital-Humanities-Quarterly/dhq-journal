                     						Chairs for several conferences between 2014 and 2020. ADHO has long
                     						grappled with the significant issues associated with “representation,
                     						diversity, multilingualism, and labor” (Abstract) associated with the

                     						undertaking. The long ramp-up to each conference,<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e220">[3]</a> over two years, has a time-warp effect as far
                     						as both policy and practices are concerned: there is a significant gap
                     						between the approval of new procedures and their effects. Major
                     						organizational changes and conference policy changes that provide the

                     						learn from them with humility, as well as to learn from other

                        						develop and implement such a policy as soon as possible. We also aim

                        						complex set of rules and processes, and instead think of it as a
                        						revolving cast of “us,” since many individuals have held multiple <a href="https://adho.org/leadership/past-officers" onclick="window.open('https://adho.org/leadership/past-officers'); return false" class="ref">roles in ADHO

                        						There is very little of ADHO that exists as a separate bureaucracy –
                        						rather, ADHO is an attempt to coordinate and collaborate across the
                        						cultural and linguistic gaps that separate COs, which are themselves
                        						made up of regional, linguistic, or structural groups of “us.” ADHO
                        						can and will strive to become a more transparent, inviting, and
                        						rewarding space in which to collaborate with others in shaping the
                        						international DH community, but ultimately it can only do better if
                        						COs engage in making it better. COs can only engage with ADHO if
                        						people in their communities advocate for that involvement, and can
                        						offer the time to make it happen. On one hand, it would be vastly more
                        						straightforward if ADHO were a clear group of “them” that could be

                        						conference, ADHO has grown rapidly in recent years, from 2 to 11

                        						review of our structure and governance, ADHO undertook a complete
                        						organizational restructuring, the final implementation details for
                        						which are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e450">[9]</a> Working through the

                        						concern of those who served on ADHO’s Steering Committee, and many

                        						issues have taken a back seat to the organizational changes. In 2019,
                        						the reorganization created the parallel structures of the
                        						policy-making COB and the EB, which carries out the day-to-day running
                        						of ADHO, a division of responsibilities that makes it easier for the
                        						COB to direct its attention to the big-picture challenges, priorities,
                        						and future directions for ADHO, confident that the EB is handling the

                        						extensive policies governing it. The <a href="https://adho.org/leadership/conference-coordinating-committee-ccc/" onclick="window.open('https://adho.org/leadership/conference-coordinating-committee-ccc/'); return false" class="ref">Conference Coordinating Committee (CCC)</a> maintains these
                        						policies and oversees their implementation in specific instances of
                        						the conference. The Local Organizers are responsible for hosting,
                        						logistical management, and finances, and the Program Committee (PC)
                        						for the academic program. After conference bids have been prepared by
                        						the prospective LOs and then refined in consultation with the CCC, the
                        						COB (formerly the Steering Committee) selects the host institution and
                        						hence the LO committee prior to the formation of the PC. The host CO
                        						is usually<a class="noteRef" href="#d3e468">[10]</a> determined by the geographic location of the
                        						conference rather than assigned, and historically the LOs are
                        						determined through the bidding process, with a separate process for
                        						selecting the Chairs for the PC, which is composed of representatives
                        						from all COs. This practice not only results in “gray areas” of
                        						responsibility, as noted, but also overlaps that indeed make essential
                        						“Cooperation, communication, and goodwill” (§19) and increase the
                        						potential for conflict if the LOs and the PC chairs do not work well
                        						together, as has sometimes been the case. The LO/PC division of

                     							Organisations Board (COB) is composed of one representative from
                     							each of the Constituent Organisations (COs) and a liaison to the
                     							Special Interest Groups (SIGs). Its role is to establish and
                     							develop vision, strategy, and policy for ADHO. The Executive
                     							Board (EB) is appointed by the COB, and its role is to enact the
                     							decisions made by the COB, to administer the day-to-day running
                     							of the organization, and to ensure that ADHO abides by all
                     							applicable laws. The Conference Coordinating Committee is
                     							appointed by the COB and is responsible for developing, improving
                     							and maintaining the ADHO conference protocol and accompanying
                     							guidelines, and coordinating the annual conference. Individuals
                     							in these bodies change from year to year. The names of current
                     							officers can be accessed on the ADHO site at <a href="https://adho.org/leadership/governance-structure/" onclick="window.open('https://adho.org/leadership/governance-structure/'); return false" class="ref">https://adho.org/leadership/governance-structure/</a>.

                     							the ADHO Executive Board, and therefore occupied a dual role
                     							throughout the writing, editing, and early reception of this
                     							article. He notes that he did his best to operate with integrity
                     							and transparency in both roles, but he acknowledges occasional
                     							conflicts of interest, miscommunications, and unwelcome
                     							interventions on his part during the process.</span></div>

                     							size and complexity of the conference, the call for bids and the
                     							selection of conference venues is made years in advance. For
                     							instance, the call for bids for DH2025 from the Conference
                     							Coordinating Committee has to go out by January 2023, and will be
                     							governed by the policy in place at the time the bid is announced,
                     							and any subsequent changes would have to be voluntarily adopted
                     							by the organizers. Financial planning is supposed to begin 30
                     							months prior to the conference. There will thus be at least a
                     							2.5-year lag in manifesting new policy related to the
