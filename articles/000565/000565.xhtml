                  <p>Katherine Bode theorizes a new approach to “data rich”
                     literary history, in which the researcher constructs a “a
                     scholarly edition of a literary system” pairing annotated data with a
                     critical apparatus. Bode challenges the rhetoric around “distant
                     reading,” arguing it recapitulates the historical oversights of
                     new criticism. <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> comprises a book
                     and paired database which apply this framework to the fiction published in
                     nineteenth-century Australian newspapers. Bode's investigation advances new
                     ideas about the gender of Australian fiction authors, the networks of influence
                     among provincial and metropolitan newspapers, and the national character of
                     fiction in the period. <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> is an
                     important intervention in conversations about computational literary-historical
                     analysis, as well as around the construction and use of digitized historical
                     archives.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Scholarship in digital textual studies often vacillates between two poles: the
                     species of computational text analysis, sometimes called “distant
                     reading,” occupy one pole, while text encoding and digital edition
                     building, as might be characterized by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI),
                     occupy the other. For decades there have been calls for research that moves
                     between these poles — for “scalable” or “zoomable
                     reading”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mueller2012">Mueller 2012</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#cordell2013">Cordell 2013</a>] — as well as research that locates itself
                     emphatically in the continuum, such as Alison Booth's
                     “mid-range” reading [<a class="ref" href="#booth2017">Booth 2017</a>]. In a 2013
                     conference dialogue, Julia Flanders and Matthew Jockers dreamed of methods that
                     would “mak[e] it possible to see both scale and detail
                     simultaneously” because “micro and macro
                     approaches are really two faces of the same thing.”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers and Flanders 2013</a>, 14, 18] We might even claim near-consensus
                     among digital literary scholars that our research <em class="emph">should</em> bridge
                     scales, and that the distant reading versus text encoding dichotomy is both
                     intellectually and rhetorically impoverished. Nevertheless, in these repeated
                     calls for a middle way we might also mark a lingering anxiety in the field that,
                     however much we might wish for research that moves easily among analyses at
                     different scales, in practice such movement is rare. Both practical obstacles of
                     time and labor, as well as conceptual obstacles of commensurability, result in
                     most projects unfolding largely at one scale or another.

                        Digital Collections and the Future of Literary History</cite> not only
                     models how scholars might stage meaningful dialogue between scales of textual
                     analysis, but also makes a forceful argument for the necessity of such work. The
                     book ranges over a number of prominent computational methods, from quantitative
                     data analysis to topic modeling to network analysis. Its heart, however, is the
                     construction of “a scholarly edition of a literary
                     system” which pairs a curated and annotated dataset of Australian
                     newspaper fiction with a critical apparatus that “elaborates
                     the complex relationships between the historical context explored, the
                     disciplinary infrastructure employed in investigating that context, the
                     decisions and selections implicated in creating and remediating the
                     collection or collections, and the transformations wrought by the editor's
                     extraction, construction, and analysis of that data”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 53]. In this vein, <cite class="title italic">A World
                        of Fiction</cite> comprises both a monograph exploring her findings about
                     Australian newspaper fiction and an extensive “curated

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Like printed critical editions, Bode argues, a scholarly edition of a literary
                     system “presents an argument about the existence of literary
                     works in the past based on the editor's interpretation of the multiple
                     transactions by which documentary evidence of the past is transmitted to the
                     present”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 53]. Bode's edition, for instance, seeks to
                     capture the shifting elements of fiction as it moved through the Australian
                     press, such as changing titles and varying authorship attributions so that
                     relationships among witnesses are visible and available for analysis [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 41–42]]. In theorizing her computational work in
                     book historical and bibliographic terms, Bode accomplishes something both
                     transformative and refreshingly modest, demonstrating how computational or
                     algorithmic models relate to the hypotheses underlying the work of all edition
                     building, digital or not. The resulting book states its arguments and
                     interventions plainly, while exposing its underlying evidence in an accessible
                     interface, so that other scholars can verify, extend, or challenge Bode's
                     findings. Though <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> declares its
                     ambition “to advance a noncanonical, data-rich, and
                     transnational history of the literary, publishing, and reading cultures of
                     nineteenth-century Australia”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 3] it is modest insofar as it refuses the
                     rhetorical excesses that can attend other data-rich humanities projects,
                     insisting instead on the createdness of its data and the situatedness of its
                     findings.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Bode establishes the urgency of her approach in <cite class="title italic">A World of
                        Fiction</cite>'s first chapter, which critiques the work of previous
                     cornerstone books in computational text analysis: Franco Moretti's <cite class="title italic">Distant Reading</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Graphs, Maps,

                     rejects the idea that the methods labeled “distant reading”
                     or “macroanalysis” should be understood as opposites to close
                     reading. Instead, she argues that both distant and close reading “are united by a common neglect of textual scholarship,”
                     and “cannot benefit from the historical insights presented
                     by editorial and bibliographic productions.” By “conceiving data and computation as providing direct access to the
                     literary-historical record” such scholarship ends up “offer[ing] ahistorical arguments about the existence and
                     interconnections of literary works in the past”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Bode analyzes such oversights in detail, but in brief overview, she critiques the
                     way such studies discuss the composition of their corpora (what they include
                     and, most importantly, what they do not); the ways in which metadata can mislead
                     (a single publication date, for instance, often obscures a more complex
                     production history); or the ways such datasets elide broader publication
                     contexts (the older books still on the market in a given moment, for instance,
                     or parallel periodical publications). Bode takes particular issue with the
                     assumption underlying many distant reading analyses that the date of work's
                     first publication provides the most meaningful datapoint for modeling literary
                     influence “in a chronologically discrete manner, regardless
                     of the actual conduits of literary influence, which require availability to
                     readers who buy, borrow, and sometimes write literary works”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 29]. In arguing that distant and close reading
                     are similarly ahistorical in orientation, Bode begins <cite class="title italic">A
                        World of Fiction</cite> with a striking and important claim. Taking that
                     claim seriously would require practitioners of computational text analysis to
                     pay more than lip service to the work of archive and collection construction,
                     which Bode attempts to model in the following chapters.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">In chapter 3, Bode establishes the centrality of newspapers to the publication
                     and circulation of fiction in nineteenth-century colonial Australia; it was not
                     one medium for fiction, but the predominant medium. Thus <cite class="title italic">A
                        World of Fiction</cite> asserts that its claims about newspaper fiction can
                     be understood as claims about fiction in the region more broadly, more so than
                     would be the case in a discussion of Britain or America in the same period. By
                     relying on newspapers, Bode demonstrates her commitment to grounding <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> not only in the messy historical
                     medium in which readers would have encountered these fictional works, but also
                     in the histories of collection, preservation, and eventually digitization that
                     make that newspaper fiction available for computational analysis, a process she
                     outlines in detail in chapter 3, which details the social and technical
                     structures of the Trove collections from which she draws her newspaper corpus.
                     Importantly, Bode also notes the comprehensiveness of Trove's collections in
                     contrast to similar digital newspaper archives in the US, such as Chronicling
                     America, which lends even more force to the book's claims.

                     laying theoretical groundwork to applying its theories to specific case studies,
                     analyzing what the book's scholarly edition of a literary system indicates about
                     authorship, anonymity, and reception of fiction in nineteenth-century Australian
                     newspapers (chapter 4); what network analysis might show about circulation and
                     the influence of syndication networks (chapter 5); and how topic models might
                     reveal shifting regional and national literary traditions over the study's time
                     period (chapter 6). At this point, I must confess one limitation in my own
                     perspective. While I work extensively with digitized historical newspapers, my
                     focus is on American (and more recently transatlantic) newspaper literature.
                     Thus I feel most qualified to comment on Bode's methodological interventions in
                     <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite>. I am not expert in
                     nineteenth-century Australian literary history, and so must take Bode's claims
                     of intervention in this domain as read, assuming her characterization of the
                     existing scholarship is made in good faith and that her findings challenge them
                     in the ways she outlines. I will refer to these claims primarily as examples of
                     how <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> moves between data and
                     literary history, a move this book makes with particular alacrity. In reading, I
                     learned a good deal about how nineteenth-century Australian newspaper fiction
                     differed from American newspaper fiction, and in fact one additional merit of
                     <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> is that it brings into focus
                     a literary domain that is largely neglected in American literary study.
                     Nevertheless, I must acknowledge that an expert in Australian literature might
                     review some of Bode's claims differently.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">In chapter 4, Bode works with the metadata she has assembled about the authors of
                     Australian newspaper fiction to explore their demographics and reception in
                     metropolitan and provincial newspapers. In some cases, <cite class="title italic">A
                        World of Fiction</cite> confirms previous scholarship, finding for example
                     a trend away from anonymous authorship as the nineteenth-century progressed,
                     though this trend is less definitive than prior narratives have claimed. From
                     here, however, <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> advances a number
                     of novel interpretations of authorship in the period. First, Bode finds that
                     named authorship is far less important than attributed nationality. She writes,
                     “47 percent of titles were inscribed with an authorial
                     gender and 79 percent with a nationality. This relatively low rate of gender
                     inscription…emphasizes the point already made: that the author was not the
                     primary framework through which colonial readers interpreted fiction”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 96]. Digging into gender further, Bode finds
                     that, in contrast to much scholarship on nineteenth-century periodical
                     literature, colonial Australian literature was more often written by men than
                     women, and more likely to be local than is typically understood. Tracing trends
                     across the century, Bode finds that prestige shifts over time: in urban
                     newspapers, at least, local writing is valued more earlier in the century, when
                     it is ascribed mostly to men, and loses prestige later in the century, when more
                     women are contributing fiction to Australian newspapers. These are only a few of
                     the trends Bode traces in this chapter, which demonstrates clearly how the data
                     she collects and annotates can be used to elucidate the complex social and
                     demographic situation of newspaper fiction in the period.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">In <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite>'s next chapter, Bode explores
                     the effects of syndication networks on the distribution and circulation of
                     fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers. She begins, however, with a
                     strong caution of network analysis as it is typically implemented in data-rich
                     literary history. In particular, Bode warns that “The
                     probability measures needed to model systems based on highly incomplete
                     datasets are at odds with the centrality of documentary evidence to
                     historical argumentation.” While I am not entirely convinced by the
                     definitive claim that “Literary historians focus on what
                     occurred and why, not what might have taken place based on assumptions and
                     probabilities”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 130], Bode's overall skepticism about network
                     graphs constructed from mostly incomplete and partial datasets is well taken, as
                     is her critique of analysis focused on network visualizations rather than their
                     underlying metrics. In the ensuing chapter, Bode uses network analysis primarily
                     to explore her data rather than to make quantitative claims about it, and she
                     does not employ network visualizations at all, instead charting the proportions
                     of serialized and reprinted fiction across a number of categories: e.g.
                     Australian vs. British, or metropolitan vs. provincial. Her findings demonstrate
                     the importance of provincial networks to the publication and circulation of
                     Australian fiction in the period, acting as a counterforce to dominant
                     metropolitan syndicates that imported British and American fiction into the
                     colony.

                     uses a combination of topic modeling and decision trees in order to determine
                     “whether, and if so what, characteristics distinguished
                     the American, Australian, and British fiction in colonial
                     newspapers.” As in her exploration of gender in chapter 4, here Bode
                     finds that topics hew more closely to author's national identity than to their
                     gender. The Australian literary voice is characterized most strongly by topics
                     drawn “from prominent descriptions of nonmetropolitan
                     colonial settings, characters, and activities,” but also by more
                     “prominently depicting Aboriginal characters”
                     than previous scholarship has acknowledged [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 159].
                     This latter claim requires exposition, and while Bode finds a much greater
                     presence of Aboriginal characters than expected based on previous theorizations
                     of colonial literature, she outlines how these depictions rely on negative
                     stereotypes, such that the presence of Aboriginal people actually serves to
                     justify the colonial project in most of these works. Bode notes that “In identity politics and literary criticism…oppression and
                     emancipation are equated with nonrepresentation and representation,
                     respectively” while she finds the opposite in the Australian
                     newspaper fiction of the nineteenth century, which “asserted
                     colonial ownership by prominently and consistently depicting [Aboriginal
                     characters], sometimes in highly unsettling ways”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 196]. Throughout this chapter, Bode moves deftly
                     between the statistical relationships between words in her study's topic model,
                     to the probabilities these topics would be associated with particular categories
                     of author, to literary-historical interpretation that sometimes confirms, but
                     often nuances or challenges existing scholarship.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">In her conclusion, Bode overviews the interventions of <cite class="title italic">A
                        World of Fiction</cite> while opening up her discussion in a few pressing
                     directions. First, she turns to the many questions the book did not answer,
                     whether due to time or disciplinary expertise, and invites other scholars to
                     engage with her scholarly edition of a literary system — in other words, with
                     the curated and annotated datasets available as both downloads and in the
                     interface linked to above — to engage those questions or formulate their own.
                     Bode writes that the “scale of fiction encompassed by this
                     scholarly edition and its international breadth make me confident that
                     almost any historian of nineteenth-century literature will find something to
                     extend their knowledge and enrich their research in this representation of a
                     literary system”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bode2018">Bode 2018</a>, 205], a claim which seems sure to bear out as
                     more scholars engage this work. Bode closes the book in a brief but urgent
                     discussion of funding for resources such as Trove that are invaluable to the
                     next generation of literary historical work but are in constant danger of
                     defunding and loss of public support. Here Bode addresses the final but
                     essential node in the literary system, the one which makes these kinds of
                     analyses possible.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">In all, <cite class="title italic">A World of Fiction</cite> is an important work of
                     scholarship that should be read, at the least, by scholars in digital
                     humanities, nineteenth-century studies, book history, periodical studies, and
                     library science. The book should certainly become a standard reference point in
                     courses on humanities data analysis, cultural analytics, distant reading, and
                     related methods. Bode brings the two poles of digital textual studies together
                     compellingly, demonstrating how computational analyses might bring nuance and
                     complexity to our readings of digitized archives of historical texts, and how
                     the contours of those archives — the circumstances of their collection,
                     selection, and digitization practices — might shape the framing of data-rich
                     analyses. Her computational work is founded on and helps build a critical
                     edition; the two activities are mutually imbricated rather than unfolding as
                     distinct projects. Rather than restricting the work, Bode's firm disciplinary
                     perspective ensures that the book's claims will resonate with area scholars:
                     that the interpretive consequences of her computational work are clear. Bode's
                     book productively challenges the dominant paradigms of “distant
                     reading,” offering a more nuanced path forward for practitioners
                     while inviting a much wider range of scholars to the data discussion.
