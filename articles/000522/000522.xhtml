                  <p>Digitization has changed flow music radio. Competition from music streaming services
                     like
                     Spotify and iTunes has to a large extend outperformed traditional playlist radio,
                     and the
                     global dissemination of software generated playlists in public service radio stations
                     in
                     the 1990s has superseded the passionate music radio host. But digitization has also
                     the
                     changed the way we can do research in radio. In Denmark digitization of almost all
                     radio
                     programming back to 1989, have made it possible to actually listen to the archive
                     to
                     investigate how radio content has changed historically. This article investigates
                     the
                     research question: <em class="emph">How has the distribution of music and talk on the Danish
                        Broadcasting Corporation’s radio channel P3 developed 1989-2019</em> by comparing a
                     qualitative case study with a new large-scale study. Methodologically this shift from
                     a
                     close listening to a few programs to large-scale distant listening to more than 65,000
                     hours of radio enables us to discuss and critically compare the methods, results,
                     strengths and shortcomings of the two analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated
                     that
                     Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained for image recognition of spectograms
                     of the
                     audio outperforms alternative approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
                     The
                     large-scale study presented shows that the CNN-based approach generalizes well, even
                     without fine-tuning, to speech and music classification in Danish radio, with an overall
                     accuracy of 98%.

                     financed by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (2013-2018), eleven researchers
                     investigated the present status and the historical development of Danish public music
                     radio. The project demonstrated, among many other things, how digitization has changed
                     the
                     flow of music radio in several ways. Competition from music streaming services like
                     Spotify and iTunes challenges traditional playlist radio, and the dissemination of
                     software-generated playlists in public service radio stations in the 1990s has superseded

                     radio, talk radio is experiencing an increasing popularity in synergy with on-demand
                     podcast formats. And while music radio channels are bleeding listeners, these years
                     national governments and public debates around the world discuss whether music radio
                     should still be viewed as a public service and receive public funding [<a class="ref" href="#michelsen2018b">Michelsen et al. 2018b</a>].

                     has
                     been a development from recorded music being the most important content to an increasing
                     emphasis on spoken words (chattering hosts, news etc.) on Danish public service music
                     radio. This hypothesis was tested, discussed, and to some extent also confirmed, in
                     a
                     qualitative study of five case studies of the most popular Danish morning music show
                     on

                     service music radio channel broadcasted nationwide in Denmark and the equivalent of,
                     for
                     example, the Swedish P3, the Norwegian P3 and the British BBC Radio 1. In this article
                     we
                     investigate this hypothesis from a quantitative perspective, by extending the data
                     from
                     five case studies to 65,000 hours of music radio at P3.

                     of
                     radio research. Radio archives are being digitized all over the world as a part of
                     a
                     preservation policy regarding cultural heritage and some of these archives allow access
                     for researchers. Even if archive politics are becoming more user-friendly, there is
                     still
                     a need for developing tools for engaging with the overwhelming amounts of material
                     in the
                     audio archives [<a class="ref" href="#michelsen2018b">Michelsen et al. 2018b</a>, 9]. Access to digital archives has
                     changed radio studies and media studies in general. First, by making it possible to
                     actually listen deeply to the archive and investigate how radio content and expression
                     have changed historically and thereby also enabling corrections and rewriting of existing
                     radio history [<a class="ref" href="#michelsen2018a">Michelsen et al. 2018a</a>]. Humanities scholars are skilled and have
                     many tools at hand in doing deep hermeneutic and aesthetic content analysis. But the
                     existing digital archives and improvement of metadata also opens open up new possibilities
                     of large-scale analysis and enables us to listen both closely and at distance to the
                     archive.

                     reading [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>]; in this article these terms will refer to two
                     different methodological approaches to audio analysis. By close listening we understand
                     a
                     human sensorial listening, manual registering, and hermeneutic interpretation of audio
                     material. The strength of this method is the possibility to dive deeply and detailed
                     into
                     the data, which require a limited amount of material, which in this context means
                     a few
                     selected radio programs. Distant listening, on the other hand, refer to a methodology
                     where computational models are developed to do the “listening” for you,
                     so to speak, because the amount of data is too big for human sensorial processing.
                     The
                     strength is here the width in listening to a huge amount of radio programs in the
                     archive
                     focusing on simple categories such as music and speech.

                     Charles Bernstein has used the term in relation to poetry analysis (1998). Tanya Clement
                     has introduced the term distant listening, as we use it here, as a methodological
                     term in
                     digital humanities to describe large-scale machine-processing of audio data [<a class="ref" href="#clement2012">Clement 2012</a>]

                     Digital Humanities compared to textual and visual analysis. Most of the existing audio

                     institutional and media systemic analysis [<a class="ref" href="#michelsen2018b">Michelsen et al. 2018b</a>]. Research access
                     to archives and digital tools such as LARM.fm makes it possible to do deeply and broadly
                     contextualized synchronic analysis because it enables us to study what was broadcasted
                     simultaneously, before and after a given event or a specific program. However, archives

                     unique
                     possibilities for coupling qualitative and quantitative methods and analysis. The

                     throughout the time span, but due to few accessible programs from the first years
                     of the

                     because it has technical problems in the studio, which gave rise to the use of some
                     unplanned “rescue music” during the first 15 minutes, and therefore the
                     music takes up more time than expected. However, that was discovered so late in the

                     in general more host speak during the years. The analysis showed that the amount of

                        P3</em> evolved from being a radio program with a strong focus on music or at least
                     with music as the most important content, to a program focusing on light, entertaining
                     news and chatter of the hosts. This changed the status of the program from being a
                     clear
                     music-radio format where the recorded music is clearly significant and essential to
                     being
                     a more blurred soft-news format, where music takes many different roles, not only
                     as
                     musical pieces but also as underscore music and jingles important to the flow of the
                     program. These observations enabled by a close listening to the programs combined
                     with
                     knowledge of Danish media politics and institutional changes in DR are of relevance
                     for
                     the large-scale analyses presented in the following section. Instead of relying on
                     a
                     small, curated and hand-annotated sample, this study utilizes thousands of radio programs
                     to test the qualitative observations on data from LARM.fm. The study represents the
                     first

                     consistent from 2006-2016. However, the comparison also revealed some errors, since
                     there
                     is a discrepancy in 1992 and 1998. So, we went back to LARM.fm to deep-listen to the

                     network (CNN) image-based classification on spectrograms obtain state-of-the-art
                     performance. This model was trained by applying transfer-learning from a CNN trained
                     on
                     subset of the Imagenet [<a class="ref" href="#deng2009">Deng et al. 2009</a>]. In this approach each audio file is
                     broken into overlapping mid-term segments of 2.4 seconds with a step of 1 second.
                     A
                     spectrogram is then derived for each segment after which the CNN trained by Papakostas

                     Giannakopoulos (<a href="#papakostas2018">2018</a>) is used to discriminate between
                     speech and music. Followingly, a median filter was used to smooth the signal. This
                     could
                     e.g. remove 1-second segments of speech in music, which is naturally very
                     unlikely.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e591">[7]</a> During testing, this image classification approach yield accuracy of
                     approximately 93-98% on 11 hours of radio stream [<a class="ref" href="#papakostas2018">Papakostas and Giannakopoulos 2018</a>], while

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">The changes in 2005 might also be explained by a change in file format in the dataset.
                     That year The Danish State Media Collection from procedure changed from digitizing
                     the
                     incoming material from the Danish media providers, to receiving it as born-digital
                     as
                     described above. While this change is positive, it leads to analysis on individual
                     programs rather than the entire morning section. This leads to files which predominantly
                     is music or speech hereby leading to increased uncertainty. To normalize across corpora
                     each file was further split into segments of approximately 1,000 seconds leading less
                     effect of outliers, however a noticeable difference still remains between the corpuses.
                     As
                     seen in <span class="error"><a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a></span> and <a href="#figure09">Figure 9</a>,
                     hardly any sections of music or speech is above 1,000 seconds. But we must still take
                     an
                     increase in uncertainty after 2005 into account.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43">In <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a> we see an increase in the average length of
                     music from 1992 and a decline in music and speech length from 2011, which seems to
                     indicate that there are shorter segment of both speech and music in the early years
                     which
                     might to some extend be explained by the practice of the host overlapping with the
                     music
                     and consequently music and speech are switching more often. The shift in 2011 might
                     be
                     explained by a general use of jingles and segments like quizzes and DR's own commercials.
                     However, that does not correspond with <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a> showing a
                     more stable category of “Other” between 2011 and 2016. The rise
                     in average speech length from 1992 until 1999 can be explained by the fact that DR
                     in
                     relation to the reorganization in 1992 introduced more entertaining and chatty news
                     communication as a part of Go' Morgen P3, which occupy half of the morning programs
                     during
                     the thirty years. In general, P3 after 1992 turned from being a purer music channel
                     towards a more entertaining and communicative channel.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">In <a href="#figure01">Figure 8</a> and <a href="#figure01">Figure 9</a> we
                     pay attention to the first peak of very short segments of 10-20 seconds, which again
                     can
                     be explained by the overlapping host talk in the early years, and the second peak
                     around
                     the 200 seconds — especially significant in relation to music. This observation is
                     interesting because it confirms a standardization in the lengths of musical tracks
                     played
                     in the radio after the restructuring in 1992. It is an example of what Have (<a href="#have2018">2018</a>) calls a <em class="emph">radiotization</em> of music, which means
                     that the logic of radio dictate parts of the creative processes of the musicians.
                     In other
                     words: If you want to be played in the radio, you must compose tracks close to 3 minutes
                     and 20 seconds to fit into the flow of the musical clock structure. The clock format
                     is
                     based on the structure of an hour divided in segments of speech and music (see e.g.
                     [<span class="error"><a href="#hendy2000">Hendy 2000</a></span>, 94ff for an introduction to the so-called clock

                     [<a class="ref" href="#russo2013">Russo 2013</a>]). The structure of well over 3 minutes per segment has proven
                     to be the best to maintain the listeners on the channel — a perfect balance between
                     recognizability and renewal. As the playlists in the case study show, the variation
                     in the
                     music became narrower after the introduction of the playlist tool, and as shown in
                     <a href="#figure09">Figure 9</a> the length of the individual sections of music have
                     become more stable during the years confirming a more controlled and computer-calculated
                     playlist and structure.

                     article also has an interest in the methodological discussions of deep and distant
                     listening. The opportunity to move back and forth between the existing case study
                     and the
                     large-scale study — you might call it a meso scale listening approach — has made the
                     analysis not just more solid in relation to the existing findings but also in relation
                     to
                     filling the gaps of each method. Risks of cherry picking in relation to the qualitative
                     case study have been dismissed, and <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a> added a more
                     nuanced perspective to the case study by showing a quite variable amount of speech
                     during
                     the years. However, with an upward trend from 2016-2019, which is the period not included
                     in the case-study. So, the large-scale study also gave rise to new questions, such
                     as, why
                     do we see an increasing amount of speech from 2016 and onwards? An explanation could
                     be
                     the increasing competitive situation, both from commercial digital music radio stations
                     and digital music streaming services. In this competitive field of musical content
                     DR and
                     P3 turn towards one of their core competences as a public service institution, to
                     offer
                     professional journalistic content presented by well-known young personas in an
                     entertaining way. That strategy turns P3 even more away from being the music channel
                     it
                     once was towards an entertaining and communicative radio channel.

                     not the classifier but the data, which changed format in 2005. This is valuable knowledge
                     not only in this study but in future large-scale studies of the LARM.fm archive. Working

                     development from recorded music being the most important content to an increasing
                     emphasis
                     on spoken words. The close listening approach enabled a study of how the music was
                     presented by the hosts in the program and confirmed the qualitatively change from
                     a host
                     filling out the gaps between the musical tracks by talking about the music in the
                     early
                     1990s to music as something filling out the gaps between a group of hosts, who do
                     not
                     relate to the music at all. However, the large-scale study enabled us to correct or
                     at
                     least nuance the findings further by demonstrating that the general amount of speech
                     has
                     actually not increased but is varying during the 30 years period, as shown in <a href="#figure01">Figure 6</a>. From the large-scale study we learned that the
                     diachronic changes in the share of music and speech are less significant than initially
                     expected. This points to the fact that picking single case studies (even if sampled
                     deliberately) can lead to doubtful conclusion if not reflected on a background of
                     the full
                     radio programming. At this point our study clearly shows strengths and weaknesses
                     of the
                     two approached and why it generates more valid answers to combine them.

                     to a
                     large-scale study of the whole morning programming (6 to 12 a.m) of the music channel
                     P3
                     1989-2019. Both studies are anchored in the data from Danish digital archive and
                     infrastructure LARM.fm, which is offering new paths for radio and media studies by
                     affording deep listening studies as well as large-scale distant listening studies.
                     The
                     study is the first to present a large-scale analysis of the huge amount of data from
                     the
                     Danish radio archive. Inspired by Papakostas and Giannakopoulos we applied a convolutional
                     neural network (CNN) image-based classification on spectrograms, which was obtaining
                     state-of-the-art performance. For a comparison with an audio-based classifier we used
                     the
                     support vector machine (SVM) by Giannakopoulos (<a href="#giannakopoulos2015">2015</a>). As demonstrated in <a href="#table02">Table 2</a> and <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a> the classifier tools developed from Papakostas and
                     Giannakopoulos performed with high accuracy and the performance levels generalized
                     well to
                     Danish. This is useful insight to bring into future studies of automated speech
                     recognition in Digital Humanities: For instance, how the analytical results found
                     in a
                     small amount of data can successfully be generalized to a large amount of data, and
                     how
                     models of speech-music discrimination can successfully be transferred across languages
                     (Danish and English in this case). We also expect that the model developed in this
                     article
                     can be trained in relation to other tasks such as gender detection or regional accent
                     detection.

                     Danish
                     music radio leave their imprint in the content of the programs. For instance, when
                     we
                     register more standardized formats and segments after the restructuring in 1992. But
                     the
                     most eye-catching protrusion of <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a> in 2005 must be
                     explained by a change of format caused by a shift from digitized to born digital files
                     in
                     the archive. Thereby the study also contributes with an example of how it is important
                     to
                     include reflections on the constitution and possible changes in the data when doing

                     music radio programming at P3 from 1989 to 2019. The combination both enables us to
                     give
