                  <p>This article locates how the violent afterlives of slavery and colonialism manifest
                     in internet infrastructure, 
                     specifically focusing on Google's undersea fiber-optic cable named “Equiano”. This naming calls on Olaudah 
                     Equiano, an eighteenth-century Black man who was sold into slavery and later purchased his
                     own freedom. 
                     Equiano eventually advocated for the abolitionist movement and published an autobiographical
                     account called 
                     <cite class="title italic">The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African</cite> 
                     (1789). Reading Google's infrastructural initiative against the grain of Equiano's autobiographical 
                     narrative, I pursue the histories, lived experiences, and affective registers of enslavement,
                     colonialism, and Black 
                     liberation called into being by the invocation of Equiano's name. This article highlights the implications 
                     of undersea cable projects for infrastructural sovereignty when Western and capitalist
                     corporations drive the 
                     development of internet infrastructure in postcolonial nation-states like Nigeria. Furthermore, I forward 
                     Equiano's testimony and his unrestrained desire for freedom as a call to reimagine internet
                     
                     infrastructural politics and data justice. Equiano's autobiography testifies to the capacity of the Black 
                     radical imagination to pursue liberatory pathways that had been declared foreclosed
                     under regimes of racial terror. 
                     Methodologically, I build on extant scholarship in literary criticism on Equiano's narrative as well as 
                     Black and postcolonial digital humanities to illuminate historically situated (infra)structural
                     modalities and the 
                     racial politics undergirding them.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">In June 2019, Google announced a new undersea fiber-optic cable line connecting Portugal and 
                     South Africa. Traveling over ocean beds between continents, undersea fiber optic cables are the
                     material 
                     backbone of the global internet network, responsible for almost all internet connectivity.
                     Google now partially owns 
                     8.5% of the global undersea cable infrastructure, and this new cable project announced
                     by Google will be the third 
                     cable entirely owned and operated by Google [<a class="ref" href="#zimmer2018">Zimmer 2018</a>]. In the map accompanying the Google news 
                     release in June 2019, the cable is marked as a white line stretched across the blue
                     waters of the Atlantic and running 
                     the length of West Africa between Lisbon, Portugal and Cape Town, 
                     South Africa [<a class="ref" href="#francois_etal2019">Francois, Chris, and Stowell 2019</a>]. The cable makes landfall just once in this journey in 
                     Lagos, Nigeria.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e256">[1]</a> Drawing on this 
                     connection to Nigeria, Google named the cable line “Equiano” and enmeshed the Transatlantic 
                     Slave Trade with the undersea fiber optic network of the internet.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">This naming evokes Olaudah Equiano, an African man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery as a young 
                     boy in Nigeria and eventually purchased his freedom from a British slave owner in 1766. 
                     Equiano lived in London for most of his life after manumission, eventually advocating for the 
                     abolitionist movement and publishing an autobiographical account called  <cite class="title italic">The Interesting 
                        Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African</cite> (1789). Google's naming choice 
                     enmeshes a historical legacy with contemporary infrastructure, threaded through by
                     the iterative logic of racial 
                     subjugation. While this naming follows the facile ethos of corporate multiculturalism
                     (purportedly honoring 
                     Equiano's life), I read Google's infrastructure initiative in light of Equiano's narrative 
                     to pursue the histories, lived experiences, and affective registers of enslavement,
                     colonialism, and Black liberation 
                     called into being by the invocation of his name. I locate how the violent afterlives
                     of slavery and colonialism and the 
                     commodification of Black bodies under racial capitalism manifest in internet infrastructure.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">I draw this approach particularly from Jessica Marie Johnson who notes that “embodied 
                     and data-rich histories of slavery [require]…remixing conceptual, discursive, and
                     archival geographies, with deliberate, 
                     pained intimacy, and, likely, some violence” [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>, 71]. Johnson's 
                     reminder that loss and violence are implicit in the datafication of Black life applies
                     two-fold in the context of 
                     Google's project. Olaudah Equiano entered Western modernity as an enslaved subject and commodity under 
                     the terms of racial capitalism. Centuries later, Google's abrogation of his name and
                     the symbolic transmutation of his 
                     personhood into object form (an undersea cable) recreates the troubling dehumanization
                     of Black subjectivity. The 
                     recurring nature of this transmutation points to the colonial and racial ideologies
                     through which Google lays claim 
                     on African markets and seeks to quantify Black bodies as data. By bringing Equiano's narrative to bear 
                     on Google's techno-infrastructure, I trace the “pained intimacy” of slavery which the press 
                     release elicits but ultimately eschews due to its distressing as well as subversive
                     capacity 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">I first point out the complex politics of naming and Black personhood in Equiano's autobiographical 
                     account and Google's press release and then racialize the notion of connectivity by
                     intertwining techno-utopian 
                     narratives of internet connectivity with kinship bonds in Equiano's account. I argue that Google's 
                     project emblematizes how these internet infrastructural projects reroute colonial
                     ambitions, operating in the oceanic 
                     pathways of the slave trade and on the ideologies of racial capitalism now trading
                     in datafied Black bodies. I then 
                     turn to Equiano's narrative to present the subversive potential of Equiano's desire for 
                     freedom as it becomes embedded in this cable project. In the gaps and silences of
                     Google's press release, 
                     Equiano's narrative charts an account of vulnerability and survival and speaks to the struggle
                     for Black 
                     liberation against the dehumanizing systems of white supremacy and racial capitalism.
                     Most crucially, 
                     Equiano's testimony and his unrestrained desire for freedom present a call to reimagine infrastructural
                     
                     and data logics of racial subjugation. As much as Equiano's text speaks to the oceanic currents of trauma 
                     and abjection, this narrative also reconfigures the Atlantic as a site of Black liberation
                     and speculative 
                     (re)imagining of the future.

                     of internet infrastructures on 
                     postcolonial sovereignty located within a genealogy of postcolonial and decolonial

                     drawing on germinal work by [<a class="ref" href="#ricaurte2019">Ricaurte 2019</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#orji2018">Orji 2018</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#ajayi2002">Ajayi 2002</a>]

                     [<a class="ref" href="#duarte2017">Duarte 2017</a>]. Infrastructural assemblages, denoting “technical systems and the 
                     social networks” that form around them [<a class="ref" href="#anand_etal2018">Anand, Gupta, and Appel 2018</a>], encompass material presence, 
                     bureaucratic logics, and ideological orientations that are likewise invested in the
                     production of racial hierarchies 
                     and racialized forms of humanity. I particularly foreground Black subject-formation
                     as inseparable from concerns about 
                     internet infrastructure and sovereignty in Google's latest project. In this regard,
                     I draw on Kim Gallon's 
                     assertion that “Black digital humanities provides a forum for thinking through the ways that black
                     
                     humanity emerges, submerges, and resurfaces in the digital realm” [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>]. It is necessary 
                     to center the (re)mediation of Blackness in the techno-modern landscape to attend
                     to the racial projects imbricated in 
                     and perpetuated by these undersea cable projects in transnational and postcolonial
                     contexts.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">While the internet is often perceived as a deterritorialized space, its infrastructure
                     remains material and embedded 
                     in state and international politics. The material infrastructure of the internet,
                     dependent on the global fiber optic 
                     cable network, has become a matter of state sovereignty, crucial to the economy and
                     security of modern nation-states. 
                     States rely on internet infrastructure to access global financial markets and for
                     all major communications, ranging 
                     from matters of state security to citizens' use of the internet. This article, thus,
                     refocuses contemporary discussions 
                     of data colonialism on the very material infrastructures which undergird algorithmic
                     violence 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#couldry_etal2019">Couldry and Mejias 2019</a>]. Infrastructural modalities should be a critical component in our efforts to 
                     challenge data colonialism and data injustices. My analysis of Equiano's narrative for its subversive 
                     potential is undergirded by Ruha Benjamin's reminder that we can redesign technologies 
                     “to resist coded inequity, to build solidarity, and to engender liberation”, as well as 
                     Shaka McGlotten's writing on the “rogue epistemologies” of Black data that 
                     can be tuned into counter-knowledges and forms of resistance.

                     international cable lines 
                     (“Curie”, between California and Chile, and “Dunant”, between Virginia 
                     and France) that are also privately and solely owned by Google. Most cable lines are built as
                     
                     collaborative projects between multiple partners to offset costs, and sole ownership
                     consolidates management and 
                     operation parameters within one corporation. The June 2019 press release announcing
                     the Equiano cable follows the 
                     company's logic of naming cable lines to honor “historical luminaries” 
                     (Marie Curie, Henry Dunant, and now Olaudah Equiano) but does little to grapple 
                     with the history of slavery in the Atlantic over which the cable project will be laid
                     materially and symbolically. The 
                     barely concealed violence of enslavement is glossed over with technical detail. To

                           Equiano is no different. Named for Olaudah Equiano, a Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist 
                           who was enslaved as a boy, the Equiano cable is state-of-the-art infrastructure based

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The press release not only omits substantive attention to the Transatlantic Slave
                     Trade but also to the Black man 
                     after whom the cable line is named. A single platitude (“historical luminary”) covers for 
                     Equiano's life as an enslaved person, his struggle to purchase his freedom, and his work
                     as an 
                     abolitionist. Omitting Equiano's voice entirely, the press release lacks the emotional charge present in 
                     his written account, as well as his critical examination of slavery. Instead of delving
                     into these details and their 
                     implications, the press memo immediately transitions into technical details. In the
                     long second sentence, 
                     Equiano, a Black abolitionist, is symbolically transmuted into <em class="emph">the</em> Equiano cable. The yawning 
                     chasm between the two sentence phrases, Equiano, the Black man, and Equiano, the cable, is incapable of 
                     being bridged by the one comma, which stitches the sentence fragments together to
                     perform this dehumanizing 
                     transmutation. The press release avoids the “pained intimacy” of Black life under slavery 
                     with an overflow of technical detail [<a class="ref" href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>, 71]. Johnson suggests that an 
                     appropriate approach to the archives of slavery (which are also remediated in digital
                     forms) calls for an attentiveness 
                     to the pain, discomfort, and messiness of data that encodes Black subjectivity piecemeal.
                     Engaging with 
                     Equiano's presence substantively would require Google to center Equiano's voice and seriously 
                     consider the fears, wishes, and hopes that he writes about as a Black man and their
                     contemporaneous implications.

                     the white technocratic 
                     imagination, the memo instead rushes the transition from man to cable so that the
                     project named after a Black man can 
                     become a celebratory feat of progressive multiculturalism and techno-utopianism. While
                     Google's choice of name may have 
                     sought to honor a historical figure's legacy, the naming politics described in Equiano's narrative 
                     complicate this choice. The title of Equiano's narrative, <cite class="title italic">The Interesting Narrative 
                        of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African</cite> contains two different names and an 
                     appellation (“the African”). While “Olaudah Equiano” was the name given to 
                     Equiano as a child in Igbo, he was also called “Michael” and “Jacob” as an enslaved 
                     boy (by slave owners) before his last slave owner forced him to accept the name “Gustavus Vassa” after a 
                     sixteenth-century Swedish king [<a class="ref" href="#equiano1789a">Equiano 1789a</a>, 92]. In the narrative, Equiano describes 
                     his resistance to this newest arbitrary name by stating that he “refused to answer to my new name, 
                     which at first I did, [and] it gained me many a cuff, so at length I submitted, and
                     was obliged to bear the present 
                     name, by which I have been known ever since” [<a class="ref" href="#equiano1789a">Equiano 1789a</a>, 96]. Denying enslaved Black 
                     people the names that tied them to their families, communities, and cultures was another
                     form of control exerted over 
                     their lives that sought to remove those kinship connections that are crucial to identity
                     and personhood.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Slave owners rewriting Equiano's name sought to erase his past as a free human being and delegitimized 
                     the cultural and spiritual traditions from which that name originated. Hortense Spillers, writing about 
                     these politics of naming in Equiano's narrative, observes that the “captivating party 
                     not only ‘[earned]’ the right to dispose of the captive body, as it sees fit, but
                     [gained], 
                     consequently, the right to name and ‘name’ it” [<a class="ref" href="#spillers1987">Spillers 1987</a>, 69]. 
                     The violent act of renaming enslaved Black people gestured, most importantly, to the
                     power held by white slave owners 
                     in turning free Black people into slaves. The act of naming was intended to fix the
                     position of Black subjects as 
                     not-equal-to the white enslavers. The cruel irony of the name “Gustavus Vassa” was the contradiction between the 
                     Swedish king, white, exalted, and commanding his fate, and the Black man, whose freedom
                     was stolen. Despite the young 
                     boy's understanding of the unfairness of this naming and the violence through which
                     this name was forced on him, the 
                     adult man would eventually retain the name “Gustavus Vassa”. As this was the same name on his manumission 
                     paperwork (reproduced in the narrative for the reader to witness), taking on the name
                     of “Gustavus Vassa” was 
                     necessary for Equiano to protect himself during a time when slavery was still legal. As 
                     Lovejoy's work has traced, this name denoted Equiano's legal, economic, and religious 
                     identity in England, and this was also the name that his wife and children would eventually take 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lovejoy2012">Lovejoy 2012</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">The narrative reintroduces, however, a name (“Olaudah Equiano”) that had been denied to him and which he did not 
                     appear to use in his adult life. The narrative also reclaims Equiano's African origins as a source of his 
                     narrative authority and position himself as a credible speaker on the Middle Passage
                     and the horrors of slavery. 
                     Equiano's abolitionist work later in life was predicated on this credibility that he had
                     successfully 
                     cultivated in Britain. The reclamation of his Igbo name and African origin asserted the failure of the
                     
                     white slave owners in their attempts at cleaving Equiano from his political personhood. Claiming both 
                     names was then an expression of Vassa/Equiano's commitment to the abolitionist movement, 
                     demonstrating  the complex frames through which he understood his own identity and
                     experiences. The name 
                     “Olaudah Equiano” allowed the author a complex and plural self-fashioning beyond the restrictive juridical
                     terms 
                     under which he existed in London [<a class="ref" href="#jaros2012">Jaros 2012</a>, 16]. Authoring his narrative under both 
                     names subverted the racial hegemony by positioning Vassa/Equiano in a liminal space — 
                     simultaneously drawing on the Western definitions of personhood that allowed him to
                     live in England as a 
                     free man while also indicating the racialized dimensions of the white juridical frameworks
                     which applied to and 
                     excluded Black people.

                     of 
                     Vassa/Equiano and selects the Africanist name as worthy of honoring. Complicating the name

                     claims underpinning the

                     infrastructural pathways 
                     (addressed in the concluding section). As Roopika Risam observes, “engaging with the

                     that lay bare the politics

                     cable 
                     line. Nonetheless, Equiano's name gives Google a tangible Africanist connection at a time of strategic 
                     growth and planned development in the continent (such as new data centers), in a way
                     that “Gustavus Vassa” 
                     (a name of Swedish origin) cannot.

                     been a matter of public and scholarly scrutiny and cannot be easily assimilated into
                     a corporate narrative. Immediately 
                     after the publication of Equiano's narrative, newspapers called into question the authenticity of his 
                     claims to African nativity (specifically in the interior of the Bight of Biafra),
                     and Equiano had to 
                     repudiate these attacks as attempts to discredit his testimony [<a class="ref" href="#caretta1999">Caretta 1999</a>, 97–98]. More recent 
                     scholarship however has opened up the question of Equiano's birthplace again. S.E. Ogunde 
                     interprets the narrative as written in the vein of literary travel narratives and
                     thus “to a large 
                     extent fictional” even when Equiano writes of his childhood before slavery 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ogunde1982">Ogunde 1982</a>, 31]. The authenticity of the work was further challenged by Vincent 
                     Caretta's work with baptismal records, which indicate that Equiano was born in South Carolina 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#caretta1999">Caretta 1999</a>, 102]. The contradictions between Equiano's written account and this 
                     archival evidence have been challenged, however, by Lovejoy, who argues that 
                     “preponderant evidence derived from culture and context confirms his African birth” and 
                     offers a differing interpretation of the baptismal records [<a class="ref" href="#lovejoy2006">Lovejoy 2006</a>, 339].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">As this discussion indicates, Equiano's name as well as birthplace are complicated and unsettled matters, 
                     marked as they are by the disrupting force of slavery. In the corporate appropriation
                     of Equiano's 
                     identity, such complications are smoothed out through elision. The irony of this purported
                     honoring of 
                     Equiano's legacy under a capitalist project is further emphasized by the intertwined historical
                     
                     developments of capitalism, colonialism, and slavery in the very time period of Equiano's life. 
                     Olaudah Equiano's entry into the racial economy of slavery is preconditioned on his quantification
                     as 
                     cargo and property and his subjugation to white supremacist systems. And the conditions
                     by which he obtains his 
                     freedom and the qualifications placed on his status as a freed Black man reveal the
                     continuing interpellation of Black 
                     subjects as commodities in the colonial imagination. In 1765, Robert King, the last slave owner to purchase 
                     Equiano, assures him that he will allow Equiano to eventually purchase his freedom if 
                     Equiano can furnish him with “only the same price he gave for [him]” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#equiano1789b">Equiano 1789b</a>, 12]. When the time comes to make good on his promise, King seems 
                     confounded and begins “to recoil” [<a class="ref" href="#equiano1789b">Equiano 1789b</a>, 12]. Just when it 
                     seems that the slave owner will renege on his promise, the white captain of the ship
                     that Equiano has been 
                     sailing on intervenes and exhorts him to make good on his word.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Entirely eliding the exploitative conditions of servitude, the captain frames the
                     situation as such: 
                     “You [the slaveowner] have laid your money out very well; you have received good interest
                     for it 
                     all this time, and here is now the principal at last” [<a class="ref" href="#equiano1789b">Equiano 1789b</a>, 13]. 
                     Equiano's labor, the captain observes, has brought the slaveowner “more than a 
                     hundred a-year”, and he would continue to work for him as a freeman [<a class="ref" href="#equiano1789b">Equiano 1789b</a>, 13]. The 
                     captain's unabashed quantification of Equiano's worth reflects a premise that Eric Williams 
                     forwards in his important 1944 book, <cite class="title italic">Capitalism and Slavery</cite>, that the triangular slave 
                     trade “provided one of the main streams of that accumulation of capital in 
                     England” and enabled the advancement of European empires through mercantile and later industrial
                     
                     capitalism [<a class="ref" href="#williams1944">Williams 1944</a>, 52]. Cedric Robinson terms this foundational interlinking 
                     of racism and capitalism as “racial capitalism”, describing the inevitability of racialism 
                     permeating “the social structures emergent from capitalism” 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#robinson1983">Robinson 1983</a>, 2]. Slavery would be one of these social structures, and it became necessary for the
                     
                     profits of plantation owners, ship captains, and the extended British bourgeoisie.
                     Given this history and 
                     Equiano's experiences, whether and how an IT corporation trading in the circuits of transnational
                     
                     capitalism could honor Equiano's legacy remains an open question and would certainly require more 
                     introspection on the contemporary impacts of datafication in the African continent.

                     offers generous technical 
                     description in reference to this understanding of connectivity. Yoked to this is the
                     socio-political discourse of 
                     <em class="emph">connecting</em> people in underserved locations to each other and to the developed world. This techno-utopian
                     
                     ideal is often touted as the humanitarian mission of companies like Google and Facebook
                     in the Global South 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#thorat2020">Thorat 2020</a>, 23]. The cable's promise to connect people in the region is fraught not just 
                     contemporaneously (as I show later) but also historically, against the scene of the
                     Transatlantic Slave Trade which 
                     contextualizes the project. In her work on Black digital culture, Anna Everett begins by noting the 
                     emergence of “paralinguistic and transnational communicative systems and networks of song, dance,
                     
                     talking drums...” as a means of overcoming the dislocation and fragmentation of ties during slavery
                     and then continues into the exploration of African diasporic consciousness through
                     cyberspace.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p17">The loss of kinship ties, what Hartman calls the “negation of kinship,” was a fundamental
                     rupture of slavery and began with enslaved people stolen from their families and communities,
                     forced into bondage with strangers, and refused the possibility of a shared language
                     (Hartman Scenes 84). In his autobiography, Equiano writes of his futile attempts to
                     return to his family after being kidnapped and while still in the region where he
                     lived. After he is transported to the Americas, he spends years looking for his sister
                     (with whom he had been kidnapped as a young boy but separated soon after). Lamenting
                     his loss, he writes, “by the horrors of that trade was I first torn away from all
                     the tender <span class="hi italic">connections</span> that were naturally dear to my heart” (Equiano, Vol. I: iii <span class="hi italic">emphasis mine</span>). And after this initial splintering, Equiano witnesses a second splintering of family
                     bonds when he is finally transported to Barbados and watches “parents…lose their children,
                     brothers their sisters, husbands their wives” and decries the forced parting of family
                     members as a “new refinement in cruelty [which] adds fresh horror to the wretchedness
                     of slavery” (88).  This exercise of racial discipline was another demonstration of
                     power over Black people, in the intimate matrix of family and community ties. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">The “tender connections” which Equiano holds could not be acknowledged as such by
                     white slave owners who perceived Black people in dehumanizing frames of existence
                     (Equiano). Regulating kinship ties between enslaved Black people was intended to transform
                     people with community and family networks, and social identities and political aspirations,
                     into an individual unit knowable only in the master-slave dyad. To enable networking
                     raised the possibility of revolution, and allowing kinship ties between Black people
                     undercut the property claims that white slave owners held over enslaved Black people
                     (Spillers, 1987: 75). On a wider geographic scale, the oceanic infrastructures and
                     pathways (sea routes, ships, ports, ocean maps, and so on) which enabled networking
                     and trade for Europeans simultaneously enabled the enslavement of Black people. The
                     capacity to regulate connectivity, and above all, the dissemination of information
                     and knowledge (in print and other media), was also crucial to colonial empires seeking
                     to thwart nascent rebellions and revolutions. Despite invoking Equiano's name and
                     the promise of connectivity in the African continent, Google cannot address this historical
                     rupture of slavery or its contemporaneous repercussions. (The point though is not
                     to ask any tech corporation to redress that historical loss, but rather to pursue
                     infrastructural projects grounded in liberatory praxis – a point I return to in the
                     concluding sections.)</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Further implicit in Google's cable project there is a parallel discourse on connectivity
                     and infrastructure in the contemporary postcolonial landscape of Nigeria - focusing
                     not only on the digital divide but also on state sovereignty after independence (Chidozie
                     et al 2017). The press memo released by Google implies that the new cable line will
                     benefit African countries (specifically Nigeria and South Africa) by adding to the
                     existing network capacity in the region<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e719">[2]</a>. In a separate economic report released by Google (2021), the new cable line was
                     positioned to increase internet speeds, reduce domestic Internet prices, and enable
                     greater Internet penetration (Africa Practice). Economic impact assessments do add
                     credence to these claims, as low-cost Internet access can drive economic growth, and
                     the “expansion of the digital economy and peripheral sectors” could create new jobs
                     in Nigeria, South Africa, and Namibia (Adepetun 2022). Since the initial press memo
                     in 2019, the Equiano cable now makes landfall in Togo and Namibia too. Such high expectations
                     have been further fueled by Google's commitment in 2021 to a billion-dollar investment
                     across the African continent in start-ups, connectivity, and other tech initiatives
                     (Pichai 2021). </div>

                     of the tech scene in Nigeria over the next five years. One tangible impact though
                     was reported in August 2023 when the Equiano cable absorbed Internet traffic affected
                     by simultaneous cable breaks in the West African Cable System (WACS) and the South
                     Atlantic 3 (SAT-3/WASC) due to undersea rock falls (Schutters 2023). As undersea cable
                     repairs can take weeks, building redundancy into Internet infrastructure (through
                     multiple cable lines) has become an economic and national security imperative. Cable
                     projects are expensive investments and sole ownership may be unaffordable for many
                     postcolonial nations. Thus, such utilitarian advantages of the new cable line to postcolonial
                     nations, and to postcolonial citizens, cannot be understated, especially if they enable
                     the myriad material, social, and economic benefits that attend Internet access.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">Moreover, as Yeku and Ojebode observe, “digital subjects in Africa are not mere consumers
                     of digital modernity” and historical remediation can create opportunities for conversations
                     and knowledge sharing (22). In their analysis of Google's Equiano doodle for the Google
                     search homepage, they trace both “a commitment to preserving and circulating history”
                     as well as “the capitalist appropriations of historical personalities and legacies
                     from Africa and around the world (8). As a counterpoint, they focus on the reappropriation
                     of Western tech platforms (for instance, the use of a Facebook group to document,
                     disseminate, and interpret Nigerian history). Such paradigms of resistance and subversion
                     are reminiscent of other forms of counter-use of Western technologies (such as radio
                     and telegraph) during colonialism and the independence period in many postcolonial
                     nations. This was the case too in Nigeria where radio networks and mobile cinemas
                     were introduced under British colonization to advance the ‘modernization' of the colonized
                     populace. Yet, as Larkin points out in the Nigerian context, media technologies possess
                     an agentive force, what he terms “autonomous power,” by which techno-social and material
                     processes involved in the implementation of technologies can shift their use and meaning
                     beyond the planner's ideologies and intentions (2008: 4, 20). </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Such socio-economic, historical, and material registers complicate the infrastructural
                     politics of the Equiano cable. The animating issue though is how the cable sustains
                     the continued exploitation of African peoples despite its productive or subversive
                     uses and possibilities. Google's apparent humanitarian commitment to building network
                     capacity in the region is belied by the implications of this capacity for Google itself.
                     Pointing out that terms like “data mining” and “data-rich continent” are common in
                     Africa's tech scene, Abeha Birhane (2019) observes that the techno-social “discourse
                     of “mining” people for data is reminiscent of the colonizer attitude that declares
                     humans as raw material free for the taking.” By facilitating Internet access in postcolonial
                     countries, tech companies create a two-fold opportunity for themselves. First, cable
                     lines create a direct pathway to deliver their content to postcolonial markets without
                     relying on other cable providers or paying transit fees to them. Given the vast reach
                     of Google's digital empire, building their own cable lines to deliver content is preferable
                     to leasing on other cable lines. Second, the cable lines facilitate the datafication
                     of Black and brown people in postcolonial countries, enabling tech companies to harvest
                     data that can be used or sold to other companies (Nyabola 2018). Thus Ricaurte (2019:
                     7) notes that “digital inclusion under this paradigm (the data harvesting business
                     model) means connecting those who are still outside the scope of the data extraction
                     system” to bring them in the ambit of that system. The large investments that companies
                     like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft are making in undersea cable infrastructure
                     anticipates these two ends. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Moreover, Google's sole ownership of the Equiano cable line represents a compromising
                     of infrastructural sovereignty in the postcolonial nation-state in return for Internet
                     connectivity. In other words, the postcolonial nation has to rely on private capital
                     (or public-private partnerships in the case of the other cable lines coming ashore
                     in Lagos) for its citizens to have access to the Internet, a service deemed necessary
                     for the expression of human rights and which governments worldwide have been charged
                     with protecting by the United Nations (UN Resolution A/HRC/32/L.20, 2016). Private
                     ownership of digital infrastructure implies that neither postcolonial countries nor
                     their citizens can entirely determine governing and operating policies for a cable
                     line that will connect them to the Internet. The material infrastructure of the Internet
                     has become a matter of state sovereignty, crucial to the economy and security of modern
                     nation-states. Saskia Sassen (2005) writing about the Internet and state sovereignty
                     observes that the digital age has witnessed the creation of “systems that strengthen
                     the claims of certain actors (corporations and large multinational legal firms) and
                     correspondingly weaken the position of smaller players and states” (555). States rely
                     on Internet infrastructure to access global financial markets, and for all major communications,
                     ranging from matters of state security to citizens' use of the Internet. </div>

                     Lagos and the Equiano line will have to follow licensing codes with Nigeria, this
                     arrangement nonetheless allows a Western corporation use of public land in a postcolonial
                     country to primarily advance its own capitalist interests. Turner (1976) and Nzimiro
                     (1975) have addressed, in other contexts in Nigeria, how foreign multinational corporations

                     as private ownership or public-private partnerships have historically enabled the
                     construction of expensive cable projects. This privatizing tendency follows though
                     a distinct colonial pattern in which a Western entity controls infrastructural pathways
                     in a former colony. Nigeria or Nigerian corporations, for example, do not have a reciprocal
                     cable line – one which they solely control and which is connected to any country in
                     the Western world. This notion might even be unfathomable for national security interests
                     for many countries in the Global North. This model of Western ownership of key global
                     and postcolonial infrastructure undermines the long arc of independence struggles
                     which wrested control away from colonial empires so that postcolonial countries could
                     own, govern, distribute, and legislate their resources and means of production.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">The history of Nigerian telecommunications illustrates these shifts in ownership and
                     control of communications infrastructure. Orji's exhaustive work (2018) on the telecommunications
                     industry in Nigeria traces its origins to a submarine telegraph line established by
                     Cable and Wireless Ltd, a British company, between Lagos and London in 1886 to “link
                     the colonial administration in Lagos with the colonial office in London” (Orji 2018:
                     51). The colonial telegraph networks were a technology of empire and developed as
                     military and bureaucratic imperatives dictated. In 2000, Nigeria's National Policy
                     on Telecommunications looked back on this early development of telecommunications
                     and noted frankly that early networks were “geared towards discharging administrative
                     functions rather than the provision of socio-economic development of the country”
                     (Nigeria – NTP). Instead of prioritizing the development of a robust inter/national
                     telecom network, colonial administration prioritized linking Lagos to London. The
                     decision to connect Lagos to London was also a colonial objective rather than one
                     determined by the Nigerian people or by national interests.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p27">After independence, the Nigerian government planned for rapid growth in telecommunications
                     to redress this colonial approach through a government owned and operated telecom
                     entity. The challenges and limitations of such a government monopoly in Nigeria, particularly
                     corruption and mismanagement, have been discussed at length  and cannot be elided
                     (Ayaji et al 1999). (In much the same way, Gandy (2006) and (Smith 2023) have shown
                     how inequalities cultivated in water infrastructures in Nigeria under colonial rule
                     were sustained by the postcolonial government as a way to consolidate state power.)
                     A similar model of state-led infrastructural development in the telecommunications
                     sector was also followed in other postcolonial countries where the new government
                     was given the ambitious charge of managing a country recovering from colonial rule.
                     Self-determination remained a guiding principle in these nationalized infrastructures:
                     in 1992, when the Nigeria government commercialized (rather than privatized) its major
                     telecom operator, NITEL, it sought to protect its national network from being owned
                     by external companies. With the reminders of colonialism still fresh in the national
                     imagination, protecting this network was considered tantamount to “protecting the
                     country's economic sovereignty and national security interests” (Orji 2018: 58). The
                     major shift to government divestment and liberalization in the telecommunications
                     sector was only undertaken in the late 1990s under pressure by the IMF and World Bank,
                     through the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) and has been criticized by scholars
                     as undermining democratic processes in the country and creating overdependence on
                     multinational corporations (Umezurike 2012, Chidozie et al 2015). I trace this history
                     to point out that political aspirations of self-determination and sovereignty informed
                     public conversations around ownership and management of public services like telecommunications
                     after Nigerian independence.</div>

                     of naming the cable line after Equiano. Equiano's failed attempts to return home to

                     is fearful of the ocean, he writes that he contemplated death by suicide and admits
                     that “could I have got over the nettings, I would have jumped over the side” (Vol
                     1, 73-74). The young boy also witnesses other captives jumping off the ship during
                     that first voyage. While Equiano eventually pushes aside these thoughts, the Atlantic
                     became the resting ground for other enslaved people who died by suicide as well as
                     those who were thrown overboard by ship captains during the voyage. Later in his life,
                     Equiano again comes close to drowning several times – in the Thames and during turbulent
                     storms in Montserrat - as an enslaved ship mate forced into these travels. Without
                     equating Olaudah Equiano (the Black man) and the Equiano cable line and perpetuating
                     his dehumanization, I wish to point out the uncanny recurrences and repetitions that
                     emerge due to the cable's symbolic naming and its resting grounds in the Atlantic.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">The Google cable returns Equiano home in the twenty-first century in a macabre mimicry
                     of the fate of many enslaved people who drowned in the Atlantic Ocean. The fiber optic
                     infrastructure of the Internet is laid on the ocean floor: cable lines are unspooled
                     and dropped off ships and they rest on the ocean bed only coming ashore at a cable
                     landing station (at Lisbon, Lagos, and Cape Town in this case). The scene of this
                     ocean bed contains that invisible mark of slavery, the “bones heaped on the floor
                     of the Atlantic” and the Equiano cable will be layered over that grievous sediment
                     in perpetuity (Hartman, Lose Your Mother: 72). Christina Sharpe's poignant words (2016:
                     14,7) on the “unresolved unfolding” present of slavery are valuable as she suggests
                     that “in the wake, the past that is not past reappears, always, to rupture the present.”
                     Challenging the pastness of slavery, Sharpe writes about anti-Black ideologies and
                     projects as ongoing and continuing. The liquid temporality of the undersea cable –
                     its imbrication of slavery in the contemporary Internet infrastructure in the scene
                     of the Atlantic - raises that haunting reminder of the scene of racial terror. In
                     the hyper-compressed temporal pathway of the fiber optic cable, where time-zones are
                     collapsed and data is summoned near instantaneously, the pastness of slavery overlaps
                     our current moment as doubled image. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">The undersea cable follows an iterative logic: the “state-of-the-art-technology” assembled

                     racial capitalism constitutes yet another instantiation of racial subjugation. In
                     algorithmic terms, iteration represents an automated sequence of instructions which
                     are repeated in loops. Each end point generates a new loop (and can continue ad infinitum)
                     until an end result has been achieved. While the result of each loop can be different,
                     the repetitive nature of the sequence is enshrined in the very code of the system.
                     The systemic values of white supremacy and racial capitalism, especially the construction
                     and perpetuation of racial hierarchies predicated on power and oppression in all facets
                     of society, remain consistent even as they are channeled in morphed and disparate

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">Thus far, I have highlighted how Equiano's life and experiences, evoked by Google's
                     new project, illustrate the extractive politics of racial capitalism that sustained
                     colonialism and informed contemporary data regimes. Equiano's pursuit of freedom from
                     white slaveowners within the limited scope of legal personhood in Western law, raise
                     troubling concerns about the hedged possibility of liberation as long as the systems
                     and operations of racial capitalism continue to exist. In this section, I turn to
                     the desire for freedom and self-determination which animates Equiano's narrative and
                     the implications of that struggle in the context of infrastructural sovereignty and
                     data regimes. To focus solely on Black abjection and its techno-mediation is ultimately
                     insufficient and follows the limited scripts outlined by white supremacy (in its myriad
                     forms) to curtail re-imagined possibilities for subversion, resistance, and revolution.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">As much as the Atlantic is located as a site of racial terror and trauma, this waterway
                     is also configured as a radical wellspring of diasporic kinship and resistant subjectivities.
                     I turn to Olaudah Equiano one last time to uphold the irrepressible desire for freedom
                     and self-determination threaded through his autobiographical account, and the relevance
                     of this emancipatory envisioning in the context of data infrastructures. Despite the
                     pervasive and entrenched infrastructure of racial capitalism, envisioning possibilities
                     for resisting and subverting it are important precisely due to the inequities channeled
                     through it. In his Preface to <span class="hi italic">Freedom Dreams</span>, Kelley (2003) points to Black collective imaginations and freedom dreams as radical
                     forces that have enabled Black intellectuals and activists to envision and pursue
                     alternate futures beyond ‘immediate ordeals.' Equiano's desire to becomes his “own
                     master” and exercise his will independently of white slave owners allows him to look
                     beyond the everyday oppression of slavery meant to wear him down and stilt his life
                     and imagination. Upon his manumission, Equiano terms his new status as “freeman” as
                     the “most desirable in the world,” and experiences freedom not only as a legal condition
                     but also as a feeling of “tumult, wildness, and delirium” that possesses his soul
                     ( Vol II: 16, 19). And after settling in England as a freed man, Equiano takes up
                     the abolitionist cause pursuing a political struggle to free other Black people. The
                     radical desires that Equiano holds on to include the possibility of an enslaved Black
                     person acquiring their freedom, to live and thrive despite white supremacy, to resist
                     and subvert white supremacist institutions, and finally to advocate on behalf of other
                     Black people.</div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">The narrative he eventually writes offers testimony to the nascent possibility of
                     freedom even in the face of entrenched systemic violence and seemingly insurmountable
                     odds of slavery. The possibilities imagined in this text callback to what Christina
                     Sharpe terms as “Black being in the wake as a form of consciousness.” To be in the
                     wake of slavery and to exist in its afterlives, Sharpe places emphasis on the “to
                     be” and “occupy…the infinitive” in that being (14). After manumission, Equiano reclaims
                     the waterways on which he was forced to sail as a means of expressing his political
                     consciousness and enacting his agency. Although he does often take up seafaring because
                     it offers a livelihood, he also expresses his keen interest in seeing the world. In
                     1768, he writes about leaving London because he had “a very great desire to see Turkey…and
                     determined to gratify it,” and in 1771 he notes that “being still of a roving disposition,
                     and desirous of seeing as many different parts of the world as I could, I shipped
                     myself soon after” (86, 96). These instances crafting Equiano as a <span class="hi italic">desiring</span> subject and his ensuing pursuit of these desires reveal a radical act of personhood.
                     To express desire and to seek personal fulfillment was to strike against the very
                     subjugation and denigration instituted by racial hierarchies. The words “<span class="hi italic">I</span> shipped <span class="hi italic">myself</span>” contain a world of possibility – a subject hailing himself and choosing to enact
                     his agency. Sharpe's infinitive “to be” appears here in the “<span class="hi italic">to gratify</span> it” and shows a Black man living in the wake of slavery and affirming his desires,
                     curiosities, and interests in the material, social, and spiritual world. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">Equiano's autobiography demands that its writer be seen fully, as Olaudah Equiano
                     and Gustavo Vassa, in the full scope of his subjectivity rather than the dehumanized
                     frames of slavery. This is an important reminder that datafication, like the archives
                     of slavery, produce Black subjectivity knowable only in abjection. Datafication can
                     only produce, after all, fragmentary evidence by disassembling the human subject into
                     <span class="hi italic">bits</span> of information sorted into geotags, shopping patterns, browsing histories, and such.
                     Katherine McKittrick writing about archival violence terms this the “mathematics of
                     unlivingness” – the epistemic condition in which “blackness originates and emerges
                     in violence and death, black futures are foreclosed by the dead and dying” in histories
                     of slavery and colonialism (18). Black life in the limiting conditions of archival
                     and computational data becomes legible through suffering and death, bits and bytes,
                     fractured and erased. Equiano's abolitionist work strived against the abjection of
                     slavery, and indicates a form of political subjectivity constituted around kinship
                     with other oppressed people – while Black people remain foremost on Equiano's mind,
                     he also notes the mistreatment of indigenous communities and other enslaved groups
                     during his travels. After settling in England as a free man, Equiano takes up the
                     abolitionist cause to free other Black people. Notably, he was appointed to lead a
                     government initiative to repatriate free Black people to Sierra Leone in 1787 (243).
                     His staunch advocacy on behalf of the group eventually leads to his dismissal as he
                     points out the corruption of white agents in the initiative. Equiano's narrative offers
                     an important reminder that radical anti-racist politics emerge not from technological
                     progress (as techno-utopian ideals might suggest) or from institutions and industries
                     invested in racial capitalism but from Black subjects seeking to fashion their own
                     futures. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35">While Equiano's autobiographical account cannot offer a liberatory roadmap for resisting
                     data regimes today, it testifies to the capacity of Black radical imagination to pursue
                     pathways that had been declared foreclosed under the harshest conditions of slavery.
                     In invoking Equiano, Google first entangles slavery and colonialism in the modern
                     Internet infrastructure. But this ironic invocation also channels historical subtexts
                     of resistance during slavery and colonialism, acts of transgression and subversion
                     against systemic oppression, and the capacity of the radical Black imagination to
                     look beyond entrenched systemic logics. In the terse constellation of adjectives and
                     verbs referring to Olaudah Equiano, the press memo only notes that Google's undersea
                     cables <span class="hi italic">carry</span> the names of historical luminaries. To carry Equiano's name is to accept a responsibility
                     to transmit his legacy across space and time. Equally importantly, to carry Equiano's
                     legacy necessitates a commensurate abolitionary praxis of Black liberation to which
                     Equiano himself was dedicated. Radical desires and the tumultuous joy of freedom too
                     are invoked by Olaudah Equiano's name and represent an animating force that can guide
                     our contemporary explorations for equitable infrastructures. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">In closing, I would like to reiterate that the need for robust Internet infrastructures
                     is likely to continue increasing in postcolonial countries with increases in data
                     traffic, AI technologies, and ubiquitous computing worldwide. Despite their appearance
                     as entrenched and pervasive, infrastructures are not totalitarian and are capable
                     of being reshaped and reimagined. To heed the call of Equiano's echoing voice is to
                     ask what an abolitionist and decolonial praxis towards the digital divide looks like.
                     It would be necessary, for a start, for infrastructural projects to be shaped at the
                     ground level, particularly with the leadership of Black, brown, and indigenous peoples
                     whose lives will be impacted by new cable projects in the Global South. Equiano's
                     quest for freedom was accomplished only through bold action, an unwavering determination,
                     and visionary planning. It is imperative that we divest Internet infrastructures from
                     the racial genealogies they emerge from as we are likely to see a further concentration
                     of infrastructural pathways controlled by Western capital. What would Internet infrastructural
                     pathways that support Black liberation and enable Black diasporic connections look
                     like? How would governance models for these Internet infrastructures shift if they
                     were truly grounded in notions of kinship and shared futurity rather than capitalist
                     profiteering? How should the material infrastructure of the Internet in the Black
                     Atlantic account for the historical sediment it rests in while sustaining life-affirming
                     projects for the future? These unanswered questions about possible futures of infrastructural
                     development are brought to the fore by engaging with Equiano's voice.  </div>

                     approach can be expanded in future research to incorporate archival texts on the development
                     of the undersea cable network in West Africa as well as more current sites and conversations
                     of memory-making related to Equiano. There is an urgent need too for additional research
                     on the socioeconomic impact of the Equiano cable in Nigeria, and more broadly, other
                     new cable projects in the African continent. Facebook has announced its own undersea
                     cable project, and there are various extant Internet infrastructure projects (ranging
                     from undersea cables to domestic 5G infrastructure) undertaken under the ambit of
                     China's Belt and Road Initiative. Western capital certainly played a key role in the
                     development of the undersea cable infrastructure but other foreign powers now have
                     vested interests in this arena too. Mapping the scope of such infrastructure interventions
                     requires attentiveness to the competing political, economic, and cultural ideologies
                     driving these various projects, and how they are received on the ground by state and
