                     <p>My Day of DH (Digital Humanities) 2020 included an hour long talk with a social
                        media platform about diversity and inclusion on said platform. Following their
                        initial inquiry, I raised concern around the language of “inclusion,”
                        countering that inclusion implies bringing people into an already existing center.
                        I asked if their BIPOC users really wanted to be included or if they wanted to be
                        allowed to exist on the platform without being disproportionately surveilled. My
                        ability to garner the attention of a social media platform and then critique its
                        work is not something I envisioned for myself when I started out in DH.</p>

               <div class="ptext" id="p2">As an elder millennial, born in the US, I was initially just a user of digital
                  platforms. I was a high school student who built my own website in HTML and a college
                  student who used LiveJournal and Blogspot to connect with a community of women of
                  color
                  activists and artists who grew up online. I used Ning to create a niche Facebook for
                  quirky Black girls and we used Last.FM, Blip, Friendster, Myspace, and whatever else
                  existed, to make room for ourselves on the internet. We shaped corners of those
                  platforms into little safe havens of connection that allowed us to develop our leftist
                  political thinking as we endeavored to make change in the communities from which we
                  came. We were feminists, womanists, radical women of color finding our voices in the
                  liminal spaces of the internet and it was beautiful.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">As a grad student at Emory University, I was able to link the organizing I was doing
                  through digital platforms to digital tools I could use in my research, something that
                  had previously never occurred to me. It was at THATCamp Southeast, one of the initial
                  THATCamps that energized the field of digital humanities in the US, that I saw the
                  possibility of bridging my digital activism with my scholarship. The Humanities and
                  Technology Camp was my first encounter with an unconference, where we as participants
                  created the sessions we wanted to attend. In these sessions I learned how to use Omeka,
                  ViewShare (R.I.P.), Voyant and other digital tools from the people who created them.
                  I
                  transformed my dissertation with digital tools that made my project more compelling
                  and
                  easier to execute. THATCamp introduced me to the field of DH and I was instantly
                  connected to the network of blogs, and later tweets, that were the central nodes of
                  DH
                  community.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">It didn’t take long to realize that the same issues that me and my social justice
                  minded
                  social media friends lamented, were alive and well in DH. The field was a boys’ club,
                  a
                  white boys’ club at that, and there was such an emphasis on doing and building, that
                  critique and reflection were considered ancillary. An early blog post I wrote, “All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of
                  Us Are Brave,” addressed this all too familiar phenomenon of the DH big tent’s
                  inability to recognize its own practitioners if they didn’t fit a conventional mold
                  [<a class="ref" href="#bailey2011">Bailey 2011</a>]. The piece was shepherded through the publication process by
                  Natalie Cecire who used her relative postdoc privilege to add an addendum to the first
                  issue of the <cite class="title italic">Journal of Digital Humanities</cite> that brought
                  critical theory into the DH mix. The zero degrees of separation of a small but digitally
                  invested field, connected through well-funded unconferences and conferences alike,
                  fueled my ability to get published, get a postdoc position myself, and ultimately
                  helped
                  me land a tenure track job.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">And yet, I can’t help but feel the sails of DH starting to deflate. THATCamps are
                  almost
                  entirely gone as the initially generous philanthropic Mellon Foundation funding ran
                  out.
                  DH blogs and Twitter posts have reached a saturation point that thwarts the communal
                  watercooler conversations they used to encourage. The big tent of DH has gotten bigger
                  in terms of faculty and librarians who see themselves as practitioners in the field
                  but
                  the number of graduate students looking to DH for career advancement seems to be
                  plateauing if not dwindling in the US. DH and alt-ac careers are slowly losing their
                  shiny veneer as the market itself offers fewer options for all PhD graduates.</div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">The early concerns of hack vs. yack – can you code or are you just talking about code
                  –
                  remain entrenched and I worry that students are still subtly taught that their DH
                  doesn’t “count” if it’s not heavier on the digital than it is on the humanities. I
                  see students trying to teach themselves coding languages on top of completing their
                  regular coursework. Initiatives to bring HBCUs and liberal arts colleges into the
                  DH
                  universe seem to be about making these smaller communities mirror the larger better
                  funded universities when these schools don’t have the same capacity. Simple tools
                  that
                  make our research easier to do and more accessible to students and communities remain
                  on
                  the margins of the field’s center of gravity. The way that digital pedagogy and its
                  practitioners are subtly disparaged and considered less authentically DH comes to
                  mind. </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p7">At the same time, I am heartened by the persistent if not growing number of BIPOC
                  in the
                  field of DH and its companion disciplines of communication studies and computer science.
                  The creators of this volume and their white allies are doing the work to ensure that
                  DH
                  remains attentive to issues of race, ability, sexuality, and class as the ground of
                  the
                  field continues to shift. Texts like this one provide such an important possibility
                  model for DH collaborative work and I hope we are in store for more.</div>
