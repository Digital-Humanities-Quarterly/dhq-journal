                  <p>Digital reconstructions of classical antiquity are generally ocularcentric,
                     appealing only to the sense of vision. We propose that new technologies may be
                     used to engage the other senses in the act of reception, and specifically here
                     we focus on kinaesthesia, or the sense of self-movement. This paper analyses a
                     phase of the project Ancient Dance in Modern Dancers in which participants
                     created performance pieces in a genre of Graeco-Roman dance for use in a
                     motion-capture system. It was necessary for the performers to develop a range of
                     translational strategies in order to communicate their movement to the system,
                     entailing what we term “distributed reception”, in which the ultimate
                     recipient of ancient source-material is not a human actor but rather the machine
                     with which s/he is in collaboration.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">Digital reconstructions of classical antiquity tend typically to use visualization
                  as
                  their primary sensory vehicle. As the “sensory turn” in
                  historical scholarship moves beyond vision, however (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#butler2013">Butler and Purves 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#toner2014">Toner 2014</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#betts2017">Betts 2017</a>]), the question also
                  arises of how alternative sense-experiences may be re-imagined, and how this
                  re-imagining might be facilitated using digital media. Different forms of sensory
                  engagement generate different forms of knowledge, creating what Foka and Arvidsson
                  have termed the “experiential
                  analogy”, whereby the ephemeral cultural practices of another era are
                  translated into present-day sense experience [<a class="ref" href="#foka2016">Foka 2016</a>]. Foka and
                  Arvidsson concentrate on sound, but equally crucial to knowledge-production is
                  kinaesthesia, or the sense of self-movement. The vital contribution made by
                  kinaesthesia to comprehending physical potentialities and spatial relationships as
                  well as the abstract concepts derived from them have been widely demonstrated in the
                  domain of cognitive science [<a class="ref" href="#sheets-johnstone2011">Sheets-Johnstone 2011</a>] (see also [<a class="ref" href="#gallese2005">Gallese and Lakoff 2005</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#gallagher2005">Gallagher 2005</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#no%C3%AB2004">Noë 2004</a>]). It is our contention that kinaesthetic engagement can also contribute to
                  formulating conceptions of the ancient past, and that digital technology is an ideal
                  tool for fashioning this analogical relationship. Even as self-movement offers the
                  impression of immersive bodily contact with antiquity, virtuality presents a
                  simultaneous reminder of its otherness.

                  or
                  otherwise indeed rely on the visual representation of (physical) materiality such
                  as
                  buildings, bridges or roads through 3D and virtual reality models. 3D models thus
                  make evident how existing digital tools carry assumptions of knowledge as primarily
                  visual, neglecting other sensory detail and thereby sustaining the ocularcentric
                  tradition within humanities research (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#howes2005">Howes 2005</a>, 14]; <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#classen1997">#classen1997</a></span>), as well as idealised representations of

                  entirety. This lack of direct experiential evidence is in fact present in any
                  historical research, sensory or not.

                  interfaces. Digital visualizations, prototypes and reconstructions provide
                  historical insights into aspects of urban development and facilitate critical
                  discussions of the application of digital tools within the context of museology or

                  development of immersive technology, the recent trend is to move beyond static 3D

                  and Motion Tracking (MT) engines enable participation, observation and

                  architecture) and artifacts of the past [<a class="ref" href="#forte2010">Forte 2010</a>]. Materials and
                  environments are further digitally reconstructed as 3D Models (for a review see [<a class="ref" href="#forte2010">Forte 2010</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#vitale2016">Vitale 2016</a>]). These are currently

                  upgrades and sustainability. Our knowledge about the intangible elements of the

                     was set up in 2013 with the aim of translating the verbal and iconographic
                     evidence for Graeco-Roman dance back into movement. Our initial hypothesis was
                     that applying this evidence in the formulation of physical performances would
                     provide an alternative mechanism for understanding dance from the performer’s
                     standpoint, as a kinaesthetic process, rather than its usual treatment as
                     spectacle or ocularcentric product. By drawing on the expertise of
                     professionally-trained dancers, we have been able to produce a range of
                     conjectures for the representation of selected scenarios, and at the same time
                     to extrapolate a number of key principles for the art-form.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7"> Hitherto, ADMD has experimented only with live performance. Digitization has
                     added new variables and raised a new set of questions regarding the relationship
                     between the body of the dancer in the present, ever-mutable moment and the
                     absent figure of the ancient <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span>, for
                     whom the live dancer acts as a <span class="foreign i">sēma</span>, a marker.
                     Live dance practice offered us insights into the vital symbiosis between the
                     <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span> and the libretto, the <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span> and the musician, the <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span> and costume, character, emotions, mask/s
                     and space; the additional layer of digitization placed more acute emphasis on
                     the fundamental process of embodiment. Rather than the proprioceptive (internal
                     sensorimotor) feedback which dominated the dancers’ choices in the development
                     of their live performance pieces, the activation of an external avatar required
                     ongoing interaction with this distorted mirror-image, this not-quite-self which
                     both resisted and responded to the dancers’ manipulation. In setting up this
                     experiment in motion capture, we shifted the point of reception from the human
                     body to its virtual analogue.

                     interaction. For this purpose we used Motion Capture in order to create 3D
                     avatars of the dancers. Once animated, the resulting videos will also enable
                     each dance piece to be analysed from any angle in the context of a virtual

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">Over the last few decades motion capture engines have been mostly enhancing our
                     understanding of normal and pathological human movement and have been used in
                     the context of medical practice and education, gaming and cinema.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e489">[9]</a> Motion capture (or motion tracking)
                     generally refers to the process of recording human actor or object movement and
                     this information is used to animate digital character models in 2D or 3D user
                     animation. Early techniques used images from multiple cameras to calculate 3D
                     positions and assemble them to reconstruct the movement but not the actor’s
                     visual appearance. Improved knowledge of locomotion drove the invention of new
                     methods of observation. Currently, the most common method for the capture of
                     three-dimensional human movement requires a laboratory environment inclusive of
                     markers, fixtures or sensors. The movement of the markers is typically used to
                     capture movement between two adjacent segments (e.g. knee joint, ankles, elbows
                     etc) with the goal of near-precisely recording the movement of the joint (<a href="#figure01">figures 1 &amp; 2</a>). For ADMD’s purposes, the
                     crucial difference between 3D tracking and video recording is that video fixes a
                     static viewpoint and coerces prospective users into a spectatorial role, with
                     all the binary dynamics implied by this relationship.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e499">[10]</a> In contrast, the interactive user plays an active role in
                     determining the order in which already-generated elements are accessed. This is
                     the simplest kind of interactivity, and it allows for variability of
                     interpretations, as opposed to mere spectatorship.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e508">[11]</a> In order to
                     bring the user into the performance space, as it were, alongside the dancer, we
                     found the polyfocal coverage of 3D capture to afford a less restricted medium.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">For the purpose of recording the dancers we used the “Black Box”, an
                     isolated motion capture laboratory space in the ground floor of the Sliperiet
                     facility at Umeå University. In a space of approximately 20m<span class="hi superscript">2</span> (4x5m) we positioned a wooden flooring (3x3m), and
                     initially twelve cameras on different angles to record the dancers. The hardware
                     we used for the motion capture was an OptiTrack 13W system and the interface
                     software was Motive. On the first day, we began warming up one by one the twelve
                     motion capture cameras in by using the “wanding option” OptiTrack CW-500
                     (B= 250mm). We then tested the sensors with an OptiTrack three point sensor
                     triangle (CS 200). The 90 degree triangle was rigid but served as a testing
                     point to observe and to capture the two axes for the 3D capture. The software we
                     used (Motive) offered several different interfaces including:

                     system. The dancers’ feet could not be “captured” at first
                     due to reflection from the concrete floor. The system would not pick up anything
                     lower than 15cm, so the dancers’ feet remained undetectable. While the system
                     was ready, the software was still not reading all the markers properly; it was
                     picking up all 37 out of 37 sensor points, but informing us that it required
                     more markers. This was solved by a combination of adjustments. We raised the
                     floor surface to a height of about 3cm, and used non-reflective wooden boards.
                     We also altered the angle of the cameras and moved the capture area so cameras
                     could be attached to fixed points as opposed to being placed on moveable stands.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">All this resulted in wasting some valuable time. By midday on the first day of
                     laboratory work we still could not capture the whole skeleton as one, and we had
                     to move on to test it with the dancers. While we got the 37 sensor points to
                     show, there were further glitches in the system. For example, we would
                     temporarily lose all movements of the arms and legs (because they had frozen or
                     disappeared), but then manage to detect all the points again after a few moves.
                     We were informed by Sliperiet technician Jim Robertsson that glitches of that
                     sort may be rectified with post-production animation. Another issue was the fact
                     that we could not capture movement in detail – for example hands and feet. While
                     there was no need to capture facial expressions given that historically
                     pantomime dancers normally wore masks, there was absolutely no possibility to
                     capture the movement of fingers or hands, or small, subtle movement. That put
                     some constraints on how the dancers would perform.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">The first question asked by the participating dancers was whether they should
                     modify their performances in any way to compensate for these technological
                     constraints. Many movements in the “Thetis” piece,
                     for example, took place on the ground; but crouching, kneeling, rolling, or
                     reclining brought the dancer perilously close to the plane below which the
                     cameras could not reliably track. We instructed them not to make any initial
                     modifications, but to wait until after reviewing the footage in order to
                     identify problem areas. Feet proved troublesome, placing much of the footwork,
                     the essential <span class="foreign i">pedēmata</span> of <span class="foreign i">orchēsis</span>, out of range, creating glitches in which
                     they popped up reversed at the ankles or vanished altogether from the figure on
                     the interface. Although our dancers typically performed their pieces barefoot,
                     we found that wearing shoes under the suit’s felt slippers tightened the fabric
                     and hence improved the consistency of capture. Another common issue was the
                     concealment of bent limbs, particularly in some of these floor-level positions.
                     Rapid or complex sequences were easier to track if executed in the centre of the
                     performance area, where more of the cameras could track each marker. We added
                     more markers, taking the total suit count up to the maximum of 50. It seems that
                     for dance, and for this genre of dance in particular, more flexibility is needed
                     in the options for positioning the markers on the body. The mask eliminates any
                     need for capturing facial expressions, but the corollary is that a need for
                     greater accuracy accrues to the hands, feet, and torso.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">Another of the issues we encountered had to do with veils, shawls and loose
                     clothing. These costume items are integral to <span class="foreign i">orchēsis</span>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#wyles2008">Wyles 2008</a>] (<a href="#figure08">figures 8–10</a>) but
                     could not be recorded in any possible way. We were advised to use small
                     triangular “rigid body” markers attached to the edges of the
                     cloth, and attached these rigid bodies onto a veil made of semi-transparent
                     gauzy fabric. The rigid bodies we used had sensory properties but also made the
                     thin veil the dancers wore significantly heavier. Moreover, they would create
                     further problems for animators in post-production as they only marked the
                     extremity of the cloth. The inability of the motion capture system to track the
                     movement of the veil, however, presented a creative opportunity as well as a
                     problem. Even if the material object could not be tracked by the sensors, its
                     presence could still be perceived in the quality of the dancers’ movements, as
                     they had to adapt to the constraints the prop imposed on them.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">The use of masks in itself has a profound effect on the way the dancers move.
                     When facial expressions are hidden behind a mask, the dancers can only rely on
                     body language to create meaning through their movements. This also allows them
                     to embody with more ease a wider range of characters or other entities such as
                     landscapes or elemental substances, as their individual self is made less
                     visible. The dancers are aware that the focus of the audience shifts from the
                     face to the whole body, and that they have to adapt their choreography
                     accordingly. In the absence of any expression on the face to read, the effect of
                     very subtle movements, such as those of a shoulder, a finger, or an inclination
                     of the head, is magnified, thereby acquiring the potential to become very
                     powerful and highly significant. Consequently, each movement has to be very
                     precise and neat, as the smallest imprecisions are more likely to catch the
                     audience’s attention and thus to blur the dancer’s intention. Working with a
                     veil (a <span class="foreign i">pallium</span>) equally pushes the dancers to
                     make clearer and more precise propositions. It also forces them to make more
                     ample movements when dancing with it.

                     choreography to those triggered by the use of the mask and of the <span class="foreign i">pallium</span>, and indeed actually amplified them. On the
                     one hand, the avatar appears to become an extension of the mask, as it conceals
                     the dancers’ own identity one step further. It promotes dissociation between the
                     dancer and his performance. The body is perceived to be a kind of raw material
                     that can be shaped at will to produce the desired effects, and is thus less
                     emotionally invested. On the other hand, working with an avatar also imposes
                     constraints which resemble those created by the use of the <span class="foreign i">pallium</span>. It requires that the dancers focus more on
                     the smoothness and details of their movement, and less on their levels of energy
                     and emotions. The movements have to be bigger in order to translate on the
                     screen. Consequently, the dancers have to rely more on their technical skills as
                     well as on the visual cues provided by the avatar, and less on their inner
                     feelings. This also applies to the dancers’ energy levels. How much energy they
                     put into each movement no longer reflects their emotional state, but instead is
                     largely dependent on how much of it is needed to convey the desired effect
                     through the avatar.

                     relationship. Firstly, the dancer is both subject and object, skilled

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18"> In antiquity, <span class="foreign i">orchēstes</span> had no means of seeing
                     the whole of this outer body except as reflected in the movement of a trainer or
                     rival performer. Their sensory feedback was purely proprioceptive. In the
                     studio, our collaborating dancers make use of the mirror; previous ADMD research
                     has embedded the use of video footage in the development process of pieces for
                     performance. The 3D feedback of the screen extends this strategy of separating
                     the visible (exterior) from the kinaesthetic (interior) body. The screen
                     interface was available to our participants throughout, and although they did
                     not typically refer to it during the execution of their performances, it was
                     used in much the same way as a mirror when preparing. This mirror-image,
                     however, was distorted, producing an appreciable disconnect between the motion
                     of the dancer and its on-screen realisation. (A very basic example: because the
                     markers were on the backs of the hands, they remained some 5cm apart on the
                     avatar when the dancer clapped; in order for the avatar to clap, the dancer’s
                     hands must cross.)

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19"> This raises the matter of translation. This has been central to ADMD from the
                     beginning, as we define the activity of participating dancers as a form of
                     intermedial translation, or translation across media:<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e626">[13]</a> performances
                     witnessed in antiquity have been translated into the written texts and static
                     images which are our source-material, and these we then translate back into
                     movement using the kinetic discourses of twenty-first-century dance training and
                     practice. One primary challenge addressed by ADMD has been that of making
                     comprehensible a language of gesture that both references the extant data on
                     <span class="foreign i">orchēsis</span> and resonates for present-day
                     spectators. In the project’s initial phase, it was sufficient that participants
                     invented an idiolect, a private language accessible to other members of the
                     group. Subsequent phases involved public performance and consequently demanded
                     expansion of the gestural vocabulary as well as refinement of its utterance:
                     elements had to be at once precise, repeatable, and recognisable. Instead of
                     addressing human spectators, on the other hand, the Umeå participants were
                     addressing their performances towards the impersonal and inorganic but no less
                     partial and interpretive gaze of the motion-capture system. As when a
                     performance is transferred from an intimate venue to a large stage – which may
                     certainly have been the case for Roman <span class="foreign i">orchēstes</span> –<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e637">[14]</a> gestures suited to the studio had to be adapted in scale and
                     orientation if their effect was to be comparable.

                     above) had shrunk to a fraction of their rehearsal room. In a similar fashion to
                     the multiplication of bodies, the introduction of a screen environment added
                     another dimension to the already-complex spatial dynamics operational in
                     <span class="foreign i">orchēsis</span>. As well as representing
                     character, the <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span> is responsible for
                     establishing his setting: the sea-cave where Thetis is assaulted, the
                     mountainside where Pentheus is caught spying. Without scenery or backdrop, space
                     is transformed imaginatively through the interaction of movement and libretto.
                     The musical soundscape is vital, as it fills up the space like liquid with the
                     mood which the <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span> crystallises and
                     channels. The other fictional setting, however, simultaneously being defined by
                     the movements of our participants was the on-screen grid. In one sense
                     featureless, in that it consists of nothing but the geometric axes that contain
                     the stick-figure or “skeleton”, this anonymous screen-space in fact makes a
                     powerful intervention into the conceptual location of the dance. No longer
                     constitutively identified with the live dancing body and its material context,
                     the dance is transposed into an intermediary, purgatorial zone where it is
                     perceptibly <em class="emph">neither</em> the actions performed by the present-day dancer
                     opposite, <em class="emph">nor</em> those of an ancient <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span>. A participant may be animating (dancing the role of)
                     Pentheus on Mt Cithaeron, but he is at the same time animating (dancing the role
                     of) the skeleton in the grid.

                     academic settings. Through the process of capturing the movements of Roman
                     pantomime, we attempted to give at least partial answer to these questions. We
                     examined first and foremost how the entanglements between technology,
                     scholarship and performance art enable new knowledge production in multiple
                     dimensions. Technology acts as a lens that affects the way we conduct empirical

                     Amphitheatre. With the aid of Humlab-based 3D artist Mattis Lindmark a simple,
                     neutral avatar was first placed within a test space without a specific theatre

                     face on a young/early teenager male body with an olive skin complexion and
                     African hair. The reason for the combination of these aesthetic elements was to
                     reflect that professional dance training started from a young age in antiquity
                     (Libanius, <cite class="title italic">Oration</cite> 64). The final virtual reality
                     prototype is intended primarily for HTC VIVE headmounts, while there are

                     dictates that movement, auditory components and other forms of expression enable

                     no relevant discussions for performance arts in relationship to its gradual

                     about how new technological competences may critically relate historical
                     performances to our current post-human, technologically intertwined condition.
                     As a consequence of this digitization of disciplines that are (incorrectly)
                     considered impractical and valueless, new directions have arisen: the importance
                     of practical engagement, hands-on work, thinking-through-making alongside
                     developments in digital software and hardware [<a class="ref" href="#burdick2012">Burdick et al. 2012</a>]

                     remain equally under-studied and elusive. Against this backdrop, digital
                     infrastructure for academia, recently reiterated as the material presence of

                     art with traditional humanistic research and the role of technology as
                     infrastructure have only been studied in their theoretical potential, and not
                     necessarily addressing organizational tensions related to the installation and

                     some further, practical observations that need to be made. One issue was that
                     the system required a lot of extra calibration and time to test cameras, sensor
                     points and interface response to begin with. In the reality of academic
                     experiments as such that require specific time and resources, it is good, in the
                     future, to allow extra time so as to optimize the empirical part of the process.
                     One striking example was the recalibration early in the workshop that lasted for
                     a total of four hours. The further, practical engagement of scholars and
                     practitioners benefitted greatly from keeping a diary of events, achievements,

                     laboratories should ideally facilitate empirical engagements with text, accessed

                     ancient dance for a post-human world, for a cultural context in which digital

                     may not necessarily remain the sole target audience of ancient texts. Dance, it

                     within the closed circuit of the human body; but we feel on the contrary that

                     firing of muscular innervation into the electrical signals of the motion-capture
                     system and transmit a version of <span class="foreign i">orchēsis</span>
                     meaningful to our many-eyed nonhuman spectator. A feedback loop was created as
                     the dancers’ movements were informed in turn by the reactions of the figure on
                     the screen. Subtle movements, for example, had to be rendered in a more explicit
                     fashion if the system was to register them; hands must overlap to clap; a hidden
                     foot glitches. The dancer dances their avatar like a marionette, but the
                     marionette’s responses also affect the dancer. Agency was thus likewise
                     distributed (as in [<a class="ref" href="#bennett2010">Bennett 2010</a>]). Further modification and
                     refinement of the performance could of course be deferred to post-production,
                     but another option is to develop effective translation techniques for meeting
                     the medium halfway and adapting this dance form to make it comprehensible not
                     just to human viewers but also to the alternative sensory faculties of a
                     machine. Dispensing with the unattainable goal of ever more isomorphic capture,
                     we might instead exploit the given conditions of this unique partnership,
                     creatively accommodating the demands of this obedient yet exacting
                     collaborator.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">In doing so, the dancer’s relationship to the antiquity s/he represents becomes
                     manifest. When the dance is live, it is possible to elide the present-day
                     performer with the absent ancient dancer, to mistake the translation for the
                     source-text and to forget its duplicity, or (less pejoratively) its doubleness;
                     but when, on screen, the skeleton simultaneously appears in all its inhuman
                     smoothness and misapprehended disjointedness, we are reminded of how these
                     performances are inescapably haunted by their predecessors. If and when the
                     avatar appears in its fully reanimated Graeco-Roman guise, the effect will be
                     even more pronounced. The figure in the grid, the imagined <span class="foreign i">orchēstēs</span>, comes into being only as the ghostly
                     body-double of the dancer on the floor: visible as an external analogue of the
                     kinaesthetic metamorphosis experienced within, its separateness supplies an
                     imagined point of origin, a parallel text created in the act of reception.
