                <!-- Include a brief abstract of the article -->
                <p>The aim of this article is to present a model for representing in an explicit and
                    formal way the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, so
                    that this formalization can be machine-actionable. The approach we here propose
                    is based on Semantic Web technologies in order to guarantee interoperability and
                    reuse across scientific communities of diachronic terminological resources that
                    can be thus easily accessed, interconnected and mutually enriched. More
                    specifically, the representation of dynamic evolution of terms and concepts was
                    performed in OWL using the N-ary relations mechanisms. In addition, a set of
                    SWRL rules was set up, in order to automatically identify the evolution of the
                    concepts evoked within a text, as well as the terms representing these concepts.
                    Our model was adopted to formally represent diachronic aspects of Saussure’s
                    terminology as they emerge from his works. An example will be provided to
                    highlight the potential of such a knowledge structuration for gaining a wider
                    understanding of the profound terminological and conceptual changes brought
                    about by the paradigmatic and epistemological revolutions in sciences.</p>

                <head>1. Introduction</head>
                <p>Πάντα ῥεῖ. Everything is subjected to the inexorable law of change: the reality,
                    the categories through which we organize it and the words we use to talk about
                    it.</p>
                <p>This is particularly the case for the history of science. Over the centuries,
                    scholars have built different theoretical models in response to the continuous
                    innovation that emerged from observation sometimes producing a real scientific
                    revolution in the worldview. Needless to say, a change in conceptual level often
                    corresponds to a change in terminology<note>The term terminology is here to be
                        understood as the set of <quote rend="inline">lexical items belonging to
                            specialized areas of usage of one or more languages</quote>
                        <ptr target="#sager1990" loc="2"/>.</note>: new terms can be introduced to
                    express the new system of concepts or old terms can be dismissed when the
                    concept becomes obsolete.</p>
                <p>The aim of this article is to present a model for formally representing the
                    diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, so that this
                    formalization can be machine-actionable. Taking advantage from past experiences
                    conducted in the context of several projects<note><title rend="quotes">Clavius

                        <ptr target="#ruimy2013"/>, and <title rend="quotes">Totus Mundus</title>
                        <ptr target="#piccini2017"/>.</note>, we propose here an approach based on
                    Semantic Web technologies that guarantees interoperability and reuse of
                    diachronic terminological resources across scientific communities.</p>
                <p>The development of standards for representing and exchanging data has always been
                    a concern in the terminological field. Interoperability across terminological
                    formats is basically ensured by adopting the ISO standard 30042: 2008 TBX
                    (TermBase eXchange), an XML-based family of terminology exchange formats
                    compliant with the Terminological Markup Framework (TMF - ISO 16642: 2003).</p>
                <p>Over the last few years, interesting solutions for interoperability have been
                    offered by the Semantic Web technologies and Linked data initiative which allow
                    data to be shared, reused across applications and linked with the resources
                    available on the Web, thus benefiting from the whole datacloud of URIs with
                    which reference resources like DBPedia are already networked.</p>
                <p>In terminology, there has been a growing trend towards representing and
                    publishing terminological resources on the Semantic Web according to Linked Data
                    principles, as demonstrated for example by the NCBO (National Center for
                    Biomedical Ontology) BioPortal, a repository of more than 300 biomedical
                    ontologies and terminologies converted into RDF <ptr target="#salvadores2013"/>;
                    or by the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium <ptr target="#smith2007"/>
                    aiming to create a family of new or extant ontologies based on shared principles
                    compliant with the Semantic Web technologies.</p>
                <p>These and other similar initiatives are all driven by the same need, namely to
                    avoid that terminologies, created by proprietary software, exist independently
                    of each other, hidden in isolated databases. The lack of semantic
                    interoperability, indeed, precludes any possibility of progress, as medical data
                    can be exploited to their full potential only if they are interconnected to each
                    other. Sharing large quantities of data structured in ontologies makes it
                    possible to use IT applications and artificial intelligence systems, enabling
                    thus better diagnostics, early disease prevention and, more generally, a deeper
                    understanding of the human biology and health.</p>
                <p>Another initiative deserving to be mentioned is the Eurovoc management based on
                    technologies in line with W3C recommendations and with the latest developments
                    in classification standards. A collaborative project started in 2019 and
                    undertaken by the Publications Office of the European Union and the
                    International Labour Office <ptr target="#dechandon2019"/> aims to align EuroVoc
                    with other controlled vocabularies and publish them as Linked Open Data. The
                    objective is to improve data accessibility and guarantee large-scale
                    interoperability, thus facilitating the authoring-translating-publishing chain
                    as well as the work in public administrations and international
                    organisations.</p>
                <p>Finally, Cimiano et al. (<ref target="#cimiano2015">2015</ref>) proposed an
                    approach to convert terminological datasets originally stored in TBX format to
                    RDF by means of an online service named TBX2RDF, allowing thereby terminological
                    resources to be used and enhanced across different scientific communities and,
                    in particular, to become part of the great Linguistic Linked (Open) Data cloud
                    (see <foreign>infra</foreign>).</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, as we shall see, using these technologies to represent the
                    diachronic evolution of terminological and conceptual data constitutes an
                    interesting challenge, since OWL (Web Ontology Language), the W3C standard
                    language developed to represent ontologies in the Semantic Web, is fundamentally
                    static and monotonic.</p>

                <head>2. Terminology and diachrony</head>
                <p>In the terminological literature, the diachronic dimension has been neglected for
                    a long time. This was mainly due to the onomasiological, prescriptive and static
                    approach underlying the General Theory of Terminology (GTT) elaborated by Wüster
                    in 1968.</p>
                <p>Wüster’s approach to terminology was based on a neo-positivist referential and
                    taxonomic semiotics <ptr target="#slodzian2000"/>, according to which concepts
                    take precedence over words. In GTT terms are monosemic and concepts are
                    monoreferential; a perfect correspondence is established between them: each
                    concept corresponds to one and only one term. The term is thus equivalent to a
                    symbol, to a <quote rend="inline">désignateur rigide</quote>
                    <ptr target="#kripke1995"/>, since it works in much the same way as the system
                    of proper names works in general language. Conceptual structures, on the other
                    hand, are regarded as universal and static like their referents and any
                    diachronic dimension is neutralised.</p>
                <p>In outlining the theoretical and methodological differences between lexicology
                    and terminology, Cabré (<ref target="#cabre1999">1999: 8</ref>) emphasized that
                    terminology is only concerned with synchronic aspects: <quote rend="block">This
                        view, which today is considered the most systematic, coherent theoretical
                        approach to terms, differs from lexicological theory in three ways: in the
                        priority of the concept over the designation; in being exclusively concerned
                        with the level of the terminological unit and not with the other levels of
                        linguistic description; in excluding any diachronic approach of
                        information.</quote></p>
                <p>Terminology began to open up to diachrony timidly after the <quote rend="inline"
                        >odyssée terminotique</quote>
                    <ptr target="#slodzian2000"/> of the 80s, when an impressive number of term
                    banks, based on the synchronic traditional vision of the Viennese school, were
                    produced and spread (EURODICATOAM, NORMATERM, UNITERM, TERMIUM, IATE etc.).</p>
                <p>In 1988 a symposium entitled <title rend="quotes">Terminologie
                        diachronique</title> was organized by the Centre de Terminology of
                    Bruxelles, but ten years after Møller (1998) still regretted a <quote
                        rend="inline">quantitative and / or qualitative deficit</quote> in that
                    branch of terminology for which he coined the neologism
                        <soCalled>terminochronie</soCalled>.</p>
                <p>Over the last twenty years several studies have been conducted focussing on the
                    evolution of concepts and terms in specialized languages (see inter al. <ref
                        target="#vancampenhoudt1997">van Campenhoudt 1997</ref>, <ref
                        target="#dury2008">Dury 2008</ref>, <ref target="#zanola2014">Zanola
                        2014</ref>, <ref target="#kristiansen2014">Kristiansen 2014</ref>), as well
                    as on methods for compiling diachronic corpora <ptr target="#dury2004"/> and
                    identifying the evolution of knowledge in corpora <ptr target="#picton2009"
                    />.</p>
                <p>As underlined by Dury and Picton (<ref target="#dury2009">2009</ref>), this lack
                    of interest for diachronic aspects in terminology was mainly due to technical,
                    pragmatic, psychological, and most of all theoretical and historical
                    obstacles.</p>
                <p>Diachronic terminology is, indeed, by definition a textual terminology <ptr

                    <ptr target="#pearson1998"/>, a terminology of <soCalled>discourse</soCalled>.
                    Terms must be analysed in their real context of use and must not be be seen as
                    abstract and static labels associated with concepts. They should be rather
                    regarded as linguistic signs, which enter into a dynamic relationship both with
                    the concepts and with the other linguistic signs that constitute the
                    terminological system.</p>
                <p>In a diachronic perspective, terminological work is fundamentally semasiological
                    and descriptive. In order to grasp terminological variation over time, the
                    starting point is the sense that a term acquires within a real linguistic
                    context and the focus is on language as it is actually used
                        (<foreign>Ist-Norm</foreign>), in real specialised (con-)texts and not on
                    language as it should be used (<foreign>Soll-Norm</foreign>). To use Bourigault
                    and Slodzian words (<ref target="#bourigault1999">1999: 31</ref>), <quote

                <p>Texts are usually the unique source that the scholars have at their disposal in
                    order to access disappeared states of languages and more completely understand
                    the history of terms and their evolution over time. Texts play a crucial role to
                    establish when and how words acquire (terminologization) and lose
                    (determinologization) their terminological status, or how a term passes from one
                    specialized field to another or from the intimate pages of a scholar to the
                    entire scientific community.</p>
                <p>Regarding this last aspect, in particular, texts constitute a precious means to
                    record the typical terminological fluctuation that precedes or follows the
                    formation of the so-called <soCalled>normal science</soCalled> state.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, in a phase of <soCalled>normal science</soCalled>, when the
                    development is adherent to what Kuhn (<ref target="#kuhn1970">1970</ref>) calls
                        <soCalled>paradigm</soCalled>, the system of terms is standard, explicitly
                    defined and consensually used within a scientific community.</p>
                <p>In revolutionary phases, on the contrary, when a revision of existing scientific
                    beliefs or practices is involved, terminology can be characterized by great
                    instability. Texts become thus a conceptual and terminological space of
                    creativity, where scholars think, reflect and give a linguistic form to their
                    ideas. In these cases, ephemeral lexical formations are often attested only in
                    the idiolect of the one who forged them without ever taking root within the
                    scientific community.</p>
                <p>An example of this phenomenon will be illustrated in Section 6 with Saussure’s
                    terminology.</p>

                <head> 3. Modelling an Interoperable Terminological Resource</head>
                <p>When modelling a digital scholarly resource, the key point is to choose a model
                    capable of maximizing its usefulness in the community of reference. According to
                    the <title rend="quotes">FAIR guidelines</title>, scholarly data should be
                    Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable <ptr target="#wilkinson2016"
                    />. First of all, for data to be findable, they must be referred to using a
                    globally unique and persistent identifier and must also be indexed in a
                    searchable resource. Furthermore, data must be accessible through a standardized
                    protocol and, at the same time, has to be interoperable in virtue of its
                    representation in a formal and shared knowledge representation language.
                    Finally, to be reusable, data must be <quote rend="inline">described with a
                        plurality of accurate and relevant attributes</quote> (<ref
                        target="#wilkinson2016">ibidem: 4</ref>).</p>
                <p>In order to pursue the FAIR policies and to build fair diachronic terminological
                    resources, our choice was to adopt the paradigms of Semantic Web technologies
                        <ptr target="#bernerslee2001"/> and Linked Data <ptr target="#bizer2011"
                    />.</p>
                <p>The intuition behind the Semantic Web is to shift from a Web of documents, viewed
                    as separate data silos containing unstructured or semi-structured data, to a Web
                    of data where open repositories of semantically enriched data can be accessed
                    and interlinked. To make this vision concrete, the following technologies -
                    often referred to as the Semantic Web layer cake or Semantic Web technology -
                    are used: Resource Description Framework<note><ref
                            target="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">https://www.w3.org/RDF/</ref></note>
                    (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), Web Ontology Language (OWL), Semantic Web Rule
                    Language (SWRL) and SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL).</p>
                <p>Semantic Web and Linked Data best practices require datasets to be published
                    using RDF: data is described as triples in the form of Subject - Predicate -
                    Object, where the Subject is a resource, the Object can be either a resource or
                    a data value (such as a string of character or a number), and the Predicate
                    (also called <soCalled>property</soCalled>) relates the Subject and the Object
                    together. Basically, a dataset in the Linked Data world is a set of triples.</p>
                <p>OWL is a family of languages, based on RDF/XML, and recommended by the World Wide
                    Web Consortium since 2004 for representing and sharing ontologies<note>According
                        to Gruber (<ref target="#gruber1993">1993: 199</ref>), <quote rend="inline"
                            >an ontology is a specification of a conceptualization</quote>.</note>
                    on the Web. There are three variants of OWL, with different levels of
                    expressiveness: OWL Lite, which supports a classification hierarchy and simple
                    constraints; OWL DL, which provides the maximum expressiveness while retaining
                    computational completeness and decidability, and OWL Full which allows for
                    maximum expressiveness, resulting nonetheless undecidable.</p>
                <p>In order to publish structured data on the Web in a way that they can be easily
                    linked to each other, a number of rules was set up by Berners-Lee, known as
                    Linked Data principles. According to them, each entity of a dataset must be
                    uniquely identified by a special <soCalled>address</soCalled> called URI
                    (Uniform Resource Identifier), each URI must be available on the Web via the
                    HTTP protocol<note><ref
                            target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"
                            >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol</ref></note>,
                    each look up of a URI must be answered with useful information and using
                    standards, and finally, whenever possible, data should be linked to other
                    data.</p>
                <p>Over the last years, the Linked Data approach has attracted the attention of a
                    linguistic community becoming more and more sensitive to the question of
                    interoperability between resources. An increasing number of openly available and
                    interconnected linguistic datasets have been published as part of the Web of
                    data, resulting in the so-called Linked Open Data Cloud (LLOD). This trend,
                    nicely visualised in <ref target="https://lod-cloud.net"
                        >https://lod-cloud.net</ref>, is particularly boosted by the Ontology
                    Lexicon (Ontolex) community group, whose activity resulted in the creation of

                    the Lexical Sense class, which constitutes the reification of the relationship
                    between a lexical entry and an ontology entity defined in a given

                        >lemon</title>, in fact, concepts, conceived as extra-linguistic entities,

                <p>Knowledge representation languages underlying Semantic Web technologies are based
                    on binary relations. They typically connect two instances without any temporal
                    information, thus making the representation of time a difficult matter to deal
                    with. In order to tackle this issue, different approaches have been proposed in
                    the literature (see <title rend="italic">inter al.</title>
                    <ref target="#flouris2008">Flouris 2008</ref>, <ref target="#makri2011">Makri

                    the following, a brief description of each approach is provided.</p>

                    <ptr target="#baader2001"/>
                    <ptr target="#calvanese2001"/> are a family of knowledge representation
                    formalisms underlying the Ontology Web Language (OWL-DL). They are a decidable
                    subset of first-order logic. TDLs extend DL with standard temporal logic
                    operators such as <quote rend="inline">always in the future</quote>, and <quote
                        rend="inline">until</quote>. Many TDLs have been proposed in the literature
                        <ptr target="#artale2000"/>
                    <ptr target="#lutz2008"/> with the most expressive of them being undecidable.
                    Extending DL entails to extend OWL, which is based on DL. Since OWL is a W3C
                    recommendation (2004) for publishing and sharing ontologies in a <title
                        rend="quotes">Semantic Web vision</title>, adopting TDL would entail to
                    abandon the Semantic Web framework. On the contrary, the other approaches
                    described in the following can be implemented using OWL directly.</p>
                <p><emph>Versioning</emph>. Another strategy commonly adopted to handle and keep
                    track of ontology modifications in time is versioning: whenever a change takes
                    place, a new version of the resource is created (see Figure 1). Several works
                    are grounded on this approach: Grandi (<ref target="#grandi2009">2009</ref>)
                    presents a multi-temporal RDF database model employing triple timestamping with
                    temporal elements; Zekri et al. (<ref target="#zekri2017">2017</ref>) present an
                    infrastructure and a suite of tools to support the creation and validation of
                    OWL ontologies with time-varying instances; in Tappolet and Bernstein (<ref
                        target="#tappolet2009">2009</ref>), the usage of Named Graphs is
                    proposed.</p>
                <p>The drawback of versioning approach is mainly twofold. Firstly, the fact that a
                    new version of the whole resource needs to be created every time a change occurs
                    leads to redundant information. Secondly, the more numerous the versions of the
                    resource are, the more complex and time-consuming the performance of exhaustive
                    searches becomes.</p>

                    reification.</p>

                <p>Figure 2(a) illustrates how the reification process works: the relation denotes
                    is transformed into a class, here named Reified relation. The subject and the
                    object of denotes, as well as the relation itself, become the attributes of the
                    new class. Let us suppose that the relation denotes links a term <term>ti</term>
                    (in particular its specific sense) to a concept cj at a specific time
                        <term>T0</term>. As shown in Figure 2(b), the relationship denotes(ti, cj,
                    T0) can be reified as new class DenotationEvent with three binary relations:
                    denotes(ti, de), denotes(de, cj), and time(de, T0). The first two relations link
                        <term>ti</term> to <term>cj</term> by means of de, which is an instance of
                    the class DenotationEvent. The third relation assigns a temporal extent
                        <term>T0</term> to <term>de</term>, representing the temporal validity of
                    the original property denotes(ti, cj).</p>
                <p>The main disadvantages of this technique are that: i) the complexity of the
                    ontology increases due to the proliferation of entities, both classes and
                    properties. As a matter of fact, whenever a temporal relation has to be
                    represented, a new object is created; ii) the OWL reasoning capabilities become
                    limited (Welty et al. 2006) and can be maintained only by means of
                    time-consuming strategies, since the reified property is transformed into a
                    class and the characteristics which can be added to a property in OWL (such as
                    functionality, inverse functionality, transitivity or symmetry) are no longer
                    associated directly with the relation itself.</p>
                <p><emph>4D-fluents (four-dimensionalist).</emph> The basic idea is that each entity
                    has a temporal part, described by a set of time slices. Each slice represents a
                    temporal period, in which all the features of an entity remain constant. Changes
                    affect the properties of the temporal part keeping the entity unchanged. In
                    order to add the time dimension to a resource, the TimeSlice and TimeInterval
                    classes with the timeSliceOf and timeInterval properties need to be introduced,
                    as Figure 3 depicts. Let us return to the previous example: the property denotes
                    connects instances of the TimeSlice class and holds between slices of entities.
                    The time slices of an entity have a specific lifetime, that is the time interval
                    of the relation they participate in.</p>
                <p>As in the N-ary model, the domain and the range of the property denotes change in
                    the 4-D fluents approach as well, both represented by the TimeSlice class. So,
                    this model as well suffers from some limitations in OWL reasoning capabilities.
                    With respect to the N-ary model, the 4-D fluents approach is affected by a wider
                    proliferation of entities (compare the blue objects in Figure 2).</p>

                <p>So far, the main mechanisms for representing time evolving information were
                    illustrated.</p>
                <p>In the next two subsections, we present a vocabulary to represent time-related
                    facts, i.e. OWL-Time, and a set of rules, i.e. SWRL, which operate on temporal
                    relations to infer new temporal knowledge and to detect inconsistent
                    assertions.</p>

                                >http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/</ref></note> is an ontology of
                        temporal concepts, conceived to describe the temporal properties of
                        resources. It provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological
                        relations among instants and intervals, together with information about
                        durations and date-time. Figure 4(a) illustrates a diagram of OWL-Time
                        ontology. The properties hasTemporalDuration, hasBeginning, hasEnd, and
                        hasTime provide a standard way to attach time information to ontological
                        entities.</p>
                    <p>Let us consider, for example, that the term ti denotes the concept cj from
                        1898 to 1903. In this case all the needed temporal facts can be specified
                        using OWL-Time vocabulary.</p>
                    <p>However, if we wanted to answer questions like <quote rend="inline">What are
                            the intervals overlapping the interval 1898-1903?</quote>, or <quote
                            rend="inline">what are the relations holding in that interval?</quote>,
                        OWL-Time vocabulary would not be enough. James F. Allen (<ref
                            target="#allen1983">1983</ref>) provided then a calculus for temporal
                        reasoning, by introducing thirteen base relations capturing the possible
                        relations between two intervals (see Figure 4(b)). They allow the
                        computation of any relative position or sequence.</p>
                    <p>In the context of the Semantic Web, these rules can be represented by means
                        of the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), described in the following
                        section. The use of this language makes it possible to assert new instances
                        of relationships between the ontology entities.</p>

                        language based on a subset of Datalog with both unary and binary predicates,
                        representing the rule layer within the Semantic Web stack. The form of these
                        rules is an implication between an antecedent (body) and a consequent
                        (head), each consisting of zero or a conjunction of more atoms.<note>Rules
                            having conjunctive consequents could easily be transformed into multiple
                            rules each with an atomic consequent.</note> Whenever the conditions
                        specified in the antecedent hold, then the conditions specified in the
                        consequent must hold as well. Atoms can be of the form C(x), P(x,y),
                        sameAs(x,y), differentFrom(x,y), or builtIn(r,x,...) where <term>C</term> is
                        an OWL description or data range, <term>P</term> is an OWL property,
                            <term>r</term> is a built-in relation, <term>x</term> and <term>y</term>
                        are either variables or OWL individuals or OWL data values, as appropriate.
                        For example, the following SWRL rule infers if an instant <term>i1</term> is
                        before an instant <term>i2</term>, by verifying a set of premises:</p>
                    <p>Instant(?i1) ∧ Instant(?i2) ∧ inXSDDateTime(?i1, ?y) ∧ inXSDDateTime(?i2, ?w)
                        ∧ <lb/>swrl:lessThan(?y, ?w) <lb/>→ before(?i2, ?i1)</p>
                    <p>where the built-in swrl:lessThan(?y, ?w) is satisfied when the date
                        represented by the variable ?y is earlier than that represented by
                            ?w.<note>For a complete built-ins list, please refer to Section 8 in

                        when temporal information is provided as a date, the qualitative relations
                        are specified using SWRL rules that apply on the quantitative
                        representation. The rules can be applied to qualitative temporal information
                        as well. In the following, a rule about the relation <emph>during</emph> is

                <p>Given the different approaches to modelling time described in the previous
                    section, we chose to adopt the N-ary model.</p>
                <p>The reason for this choice is twofold. First of all, N-ary relations approach is
                    supported by the Ontology Engineering and Patterns Task Force of the Semantic
                    Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group.<note><ref

                            >https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/</ref></note> Secondly, with
                    respect to the perdurantist approach, the N-ary model requires the introduction
                    of a smaller number of objects and thus <quote rend="inline">outperforms the 4D-

                <p>In order to formalize terminology evolution following the N-ary approach, we took
                    inspiration from the model introduced by Preventis et al. (2014)<note>The
                        plug-in for Protégé CHRONOS, devoted to creating and editing temporal

                    ontologies in OWL. In particular, we introduced the following entities: <list
                        type="unordered">
                        <item>the class Event, which represents the reification of a property
                            holding in a certain time. To model the class Event we used the relative
                            type dcmitype:Event taken from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
                            (DCMI) and defined as a <quote rend="inline">non-persistent, time-based

                        <item>the object property during, having the class Event as domain and the

                            is defined as <quote rend="inline">a temporal entity with non-zero

                                    vocabulary<note><ref target="http://purl.org/dc/terms/date"

                        <item>the object property time:temporalProperty, which relates individuals
                            of the class Event respectively to the source and to the target
                            individuals of the original property which has been reified. As we will
                            see in detail shortly, the object properties that are converted into
                            temporal ones are formalised as sub-properties of
                            time:temporalProperty.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Following the N-ary approach outlined above, the terminological layer of our
                    model was formalised by extending the lemon model. The model does not contain a
                    complete collection of linguistic categories; consequently, it builds on Lexinfo
                        ontology<note>Please refer to <ref target="https://www.lexinfo.net/"
                            >https://www.lexinfo.net/</ref></note> in order to provide a vocabulary
                    to describe the properties of linguistic objects. More specifically, the four
                    lexico-semantic relationships defined in Lexinfo, namely synonymy, antonymy,
                    hypernymy, hyponymy<note>In this paper, we considered exclusively these
                        properties as they are directly defined in ontolex. However, other
                        lexico-semantic properties can be taken into account as well, for example
                        translation defined in Lexinfo vocabulary (see <ref
                            target="https://lexinfo.net/">https://lexinfo.net/</ref>).</note> were
                        <soCalled>temporalised</soCalled> and thus converted into sub-properties of
                    time:temporalProperty to indicate their involvement in a temporal event. The
                    same was done for the ontolex properties ontolex:reference, which links every
                    individual of the ontolex:LexicalSense class to a concept defined in an
                    ontology, and ontolex:sense, linking an individual of the class
                    ontolex:LexicalEntry to a specific sense.</p>
                <p>In addition, each of these relations was reified and converted into subclasses of
                    the class Event: senseEvent representing the reification of sense relation,
                    ReferenceEvent representing the reification of the relation linking a sense and
                    an ontology concept, EquivalentEvent, IncompatibleEvent, BroaderEvent,
                    NarrowerEvent representing respectively the reification of synonymy, antonymy,
                    hypernymy, hyponymy relations holding between two senses.</p>
                <p>The class Event as well as its subclasses mentioned above are related to the
                    class time:ProperInterval through the object property during.</p>
                <p>The property during indicates the temporal duration of an event. In particular,
                    its subproperties temporalSense, temporalReference, temporalSynonym,
                    temporalAntonym, temporalHypernym, and temporalHyponym refer to the temporal
                    validity of their respective events. Hence, for example, the class
                    EquivalentEvent is related to the class time:ProperInterval through the relation
                    temporalSynonym, specifying the time period in which the relation of synonymy
                    holds between two senses. Figure 5 shows an example of temporal synonymy
                    representation.</p>
                <p>As we can see, the introduction of an intermediate object, namely the individual
                    of the class EquivalentEvent, splits the static relation linking a subject and
                    an object into two parts. Instead of a single triple linking two senses (s1
                    sense s2), two triples are created, in which the individual of the class
                    EquivalentEvent appears as subject in one case and as object in the other.</p>
                <figure>
                    <head>Synonymy is represented as a temporal event that occurs during an
                        interval: sense sa of a certain lexical entry is asserted to be synonym of
                        sense sb of another lexical entry in a specific time interval i.</head>
                    <figDesc>A flowchart beginning with the EquivalentEvent.</figDesc>
                </figure>
                <p>However, this is not enough. As we underlined above, to define in which period a
                    term is used with a certain sense and to denote a specific concept, scholars
                    need to resort to textual sources.</p>
                <p>As a result, our model is based on the key concept of attestation; more
                    specifically, the senses of a term are linked to the text where they are
                    attested, and for each text the writing time is defined by means of specific
                    relations. To represent texts and attestations, as the main entities
                    constituting the textual layer of our model, we introduced the following
                    entities: <list type="unordered">
                        <item>the class Text, which represents every work produced in a written
                            form. As many methodological and theoretical works have underlined over
                            the years, the notion of text is highly complex and culturally rich and,
                            thus, difficult to define and formalize. A detailed discussion is beyond
                            the scope of this article. The term <term>text</term> is to be
                            understood here in a broad sense, including entities that are very
                            different from each other, such as books, published articles,
                            handwritten notes, drafts of unfinished works etc. It can be considered
                            equivalent to the type <soCalled><term>Text</term></soCalled> as defined
                            in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Type Vocabulary (dcmitype:Text),
                            namely a <quote rend="inline">resource whose content is primarily words
                                for reading</quote>.<note><ref

                                    >http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text</ref></note> If scholars need
                            to use vocabularies providing more subtle distinctions, many models for
                            representing documents in Linked Data have been already proposed,
                            offering an opportunity for high quality bibliographic data to be
                            exposed to the Semantic Web, such as FRBR (Functional Requirements for
                            Bibliographic Records) <ptr target="#carlyle2011"/> or Bibframe
                            (Bibliographic Framework) <ptr target="#kroeger2013"/>. Importantly
                            enough, if a different vocabulary is adopted, the validity of our model
                            is not compromised;</item>
                        <item>the object property hasAttestation, which relates a sense, instance of
                            the ontolex class ontolex:LexicalSense, to an instance of the class
                            Text; a few works about the modeling of the attestation of a term in a
                            document have been already done <ptr target="#khan2017"/>
                            <ptr target="#bellandi2017"/>; for the sake of reuse of existing
                            vocabularies we adopted the hasAttestation property defined by the LAWD
                            (Linked Ancient World Data) ontology<note><ref
                                    target="http://lawd.info/ontology/hasAttestation"

                        <item>the object property hasWritingTime, defined as a subproperty of
                            dcterms:date, which relates an individual of the class Text to an
                            individual belonging to the class time:ProperInterval of the OWL-Time
                            ontology.</item>
                    </list> It is up to the scholar to define the boundaries of the writing
                    interval, which can be qualitative or quantitative. In fact, only in rare cases
                    he/she can define with certainty the extent of the period in which an author has
                    worked on drafting a text, with the aid of internal elements or external sources
                    (for example, the author explicitly declares that he has written that work in a
                    certain period, etc.).</p>
                <p>In most cases, on the contrary, temporal information on the writing process is
                    vague and ambiguous and partially bounded intervals (<soCalled>before
                        X</soCalled>, <soCalled>after Y</soCalled>, etc.) need to be defined.
                    Instead of specifying the exact duration or the starting and ending points in
                    time, scholars describe intervals with respect to their mutual relations, by
                    establishing the terminus post quem or the <foreign>terminus ante
                    quem</foreign>, namely the limits of the possible range of dates in which a work
                    has been written.<note>It is important to underline that every relation defined
                        by the scholar is - by default - considered valid for the entire time
                        interval of the reference corpus.</note></p>
                <p>As for published texts, instead of the hasWritingTime property, the dcterms:
                            issued<note><ref target="http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued"
                            >http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued</ref></note> can be used, with the year
                    of publication constituting the end of the drafting period. An overview</p>

                    <head>Overview of the proposed model. (a) the textual layer is constituted by
                        texts and attestation. (b) the terminological layer relies on a N-ary
                        version of <foreign>ontolex</foreign>, where each reified class is an event
                        having a temporal extent. (c) the ontological layer concerns the formal
                        definitions of the concepts denoted by the terms and it is described with
                        OWL</head>

                <p>To take maximum advantage of the adoption of OWL as the representation language
                    of the resource, we have also conceived a set of SWRL rules to automatize the
                    attribution of some temporal information.</p>
                <p>The following rule states that, if a sense is attested in a text written in a
                    certain time interval, then that sense <soCalled>exists</soCalled> during the
                    same interval.</p>
                <p>Text(?t) ^ time:ProperInterval(?i) ^ hasWritingTime(?t, ?i) ^
                    ontolex:LexicalEntry(?l) ^ ontolex:LexicalSense(?s)<lb/> ^ isAttestedIn(?s, ?t)
                    ^ ontolex:sense(?l, ?s) ^<lb/> swrlx:createOWLThing(?se, ?s)<lb/> ⇾
                    SenseEvent(?se) ^ temporalSense(?l, ?se) ^ temporalSense(?se, ?s) ^ during(?se,
                    ?i)</p>
                <p>More specifically, given a text <emph>t</emph> written in a time interval
                        <emph>i</emph> (defined as an instance of time:ProperInterval), and given a
                    lexical entry <emph>l</emph> with a lexical sense s (these two related to each
                    other through the synchronic ontolex:sense relation) attested in text
                        <emph>t</emph>, then <emph>l</emph> has sense <emph>s</emph> (in a
                    diachronic perspective) during the interval <emph>i</emph>. The premise of the
                    rule is composed of the following steps: i) an anonymous individual se is
                    created ex novo in the antecedent part of the rule using the createOWLThing
                    built-in relation<note><ref
                            target="https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi/wiki/ExtensionsBuiltInLibrary"
                            >https://github.com/protegeproject/swrlapi/wiki/ExtensionsBuiltInLibrary</ref></note>;
                    ii) se is defined, in the consequent part, as an event representing the reified
                    relation (in particular by instantiating it as a member of the class
                    SenseEvent); iii) the property temporalSense is used to relate the lexical entry
                        <emph>l</emph> to <emph>se</emph> and, in turn, to relate <emph>se</emph> to
                    sense <emph>s</emph>; iv) finally, the event <emph>se</emph> is defined as
                    happening in the same time interval <emph>i</emph> during which the text has
                    been written.</p>
                <p>If the sense of a lexical entry is attested in more than one text (each one
                    written in a specific temporal interval), the rule will be fired for each text,
                    relating thus the lexical entry to that sense in a more complex period
                    constituted of multiple time intervals</p>
                <p>Similarly, the temporal validity of the ontolex:reference relation, linking each
                    ontolex:LexicalSense to one and only one concept of an ontology, can be inferred
                    from the writing time of the text as well, using the following SWRL rule:</p>
                <p>Text(?t) ^ time:ProperInterval(?i) ^ hasWritingTime(?t, ?int) ^<lb/>
                    ontolex:LexicalSense(?s) ^ isAttestedIn(?s, ?t) ^ Concept(?c) ^
                    ontolex:reference(?s,<lb/> ?c) ^ swrlx:createOWLThing(?re, ?c)<lb/> ⇾
                    ReferenceEvent(?re) ^ temporalReference(?s, ?re) ^ temporalReference(?re, ?c)
                    ^<lb/> during(?re, ?i)</p>
                <p>If a sense <emph>s</emph> is linked to a concept <emph>c</emph> through the
                    (synchronic) ontolex:reference property, and if s is attested in a specific text
                    t written in the time interval i, then, in a diachronic perspective, the
                    relation reference holds in the same time interval <emph>i</emph> as well. In
                    other words, the fact that a word is used with a particular sense in a specific
                    text is equivalent to saying that in that period that term was used to express
                    that specific concept.</p>

                <head>6. The construction of a diachronic resource: the Saussure case study</head>
                <p>Ferdinand de Saussure (Geneva, 1857-1913), the father of general linguistics,
                    never published his theories on general linguistics and semiotics in an organic
                    work. He strove to structure the flow of his thoughts and ideas in handwritten
                    notes, which are often characterized by a synthetic, fragmentary and hermetic
                    nature. These manuscripts display an obsessive and constant search for clear,
                    effective and unambiguous terms, against the <quote rend="inline">ineptie de la
                        terminologie courante</quote> (Letter to Meillet written in 1984, see <ref
                        target="#benveniste1964">Benveniste 1964</ref>). He changed the meaning to
                    some terms over time, assigned additional specific meanings to already existing
                    terms, used some expressions ephemerally, and even forged new words.</p>
                <p>This terminological fluctuation reflects the difficulties underlying every
                    process of theoretical creation and sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics
                    through which concepts take shape and cut through language to finally find their
                    linguistic expression.</p>
                <p>This process of <foreign>rumination</foreign>
                    <ptr target="#fenoglio2012"/> is typical when dealing with theoretical
                    terminologies as in the case of Saussure, who tries to revolutionize the current
                    linguistic vision and to lay the foundations of linguistics as a science.</p>
                <p>Saussure’s terminology has been the subject of numerous studies <ptr
                        target="#godel1957"/>
                    <ptr target="#engler1968"/>
                    <ptr target="#cosenza2011"/>. In 2011 the first electronic thesaurus of
                    Saussure's terminology, named <title rend="italic">Simple_FdS</title>
                    <ptr target="#ruim2013"/>, was built as part of the project <quote rend="inline"
                        >Per una edizione digitale dei manoscritti di F. de Saussure</quote>,
                    coordinated by the President of the Cercle Ferdinand de Saussure Daniele
                    Gambarara.</p>
                <p>The architecture of <title rend="italic">Simple_FdS</title> was based on the
                    lexical model SIMPLE <ptr target="#lenci2000"/> and was therefore inspired by
                    the Generative Lexicon theory elaborated by Pustejovsky (<ref
                        target="#pustejovsky1995">1995</ref>). The Generative Lexicon theory, mainly
                    applied to general language, has proved to be very effective in the description
                    of specialized language and terminological lexicons as well (for example <ref
                        target="#arauz2012">Aráuz et al. 2012</ref>, <ref
                        target="#sanchezibanez2014">Sánchez Ibáñez and García Palacios 2014</ref>),
                    as it makes it possible to enrich the range of conceptual relations which is
                    traditionally based on generic-specific and part-whole relations.</p>
                <p>Initially, the electronic lexicon was conceived as static and no diachronic
                    aspects were taken into account. Recently, as we shall illustrate in Section
                    6.1, the model here proposed has been adopted to convert this terminological
                    resource from a static repository into a dynamic one.</p>
                <p>As underlined in Section 2, in diachronic terminology the textual dimension plays
                    a crucial role. Consequently, the first step was to build a good corpus, able to
                    represent the diachronic evolution we want to study. The texts included in
                    Saussure’s corpus can be considered as highly representative of diachronic
                    evolution of Saussure’s terminology, embracing all the thirty seven years in
                    which the intellectual activity of the Geneva linguist unfolded. The period
                    covered by the corpus ranges from 1874 - when Saussure wrote his first <title
                        rend="italic">Essai pour réduire les mots du grec, du latin &amp; de
                        l'allemand a un petit nombre de racines</title> - until 1911, the year in
                    which he took the third course of general linguistics, the last academic
                    teaching held before his death, which occurred in 1913 after a long illness.</p>
                <p>Let us see in detail an example of the formalisation of the terminological
                    changes occurring in Saussure's writings.</p>
                <div>
                    <head>6.1 Temporalizing Saussure's terminology: the case of
                            <foreign>signe</foreign></head>
                    <p>As is well known, Saussure's theories have been particularly influential in
                        semiotic studies. He emphasized first the dyadic and complex nature of
                        linguistic sign, which consists of two heterogeneous entities: a signifier
                            (<foreign>signifiant</foreign>), namely the hearer’s psychological
                        impression of a sound, and a signified (<foreign>signifié</foreign>), namely
                        a concept, an abstract idea. This terminology - still in use today - was
                        introduced by the Genevan linguist at the end of his life, after a long
                        theoretical reflection emerging in many of his handwritten pages.</p>
                    <p>Here, as an example, the concept of SIGNIFIER was chosen and the formal
                        representation of the different terms Saussure used over time to designate
                        this concept is illustrated, in accordance with the N-ary model we propose
                        here.</p>
                    <p>In the following, the relationships and the classes taken from existing
                        standard vocabularies will be indicated with prefixes of the respective
                        vocabularies.</p>
                    <p>The concept of SIGNIFIER is denoted by many different terms in Saussurean
                        manuscripts, such as <foreign>signe</foreign>, <foreign>image
                            acoustique</foreign>, <foreign>image verbale</foreign>, <foreign>image
                            vocale</foreign>, <foreign>image auditive</foreign>,

                    <p>More specifically, the term signe is attested intermittently from 1891 to
                        1911 in many works, such as <title rend="italic">De la double essence du
                            langage, Status et Motus, Notes Item, Troisième Cours de linguistique
                            générale</title> etc. To formally represent this, the instance
                        signe_sense, belonging to the ontolex:LexicalSense class, was created and
                        linked - by means of the relation isAttestedIn - to the instances of the
                        class Text representing all the works where the term occurs.</p>
                    <p>The writing period of each text was formally defined. Here the case of <title
                            rend="italic">Double Essence du language</title> is shown.</p>
                    <p>The instance Double_Essence_Writing_Time of the class time:properInterval
                        (subclass of time:Interval) was created and linked to the instance
                        Double_Essence through the relation hasWritingTime. The writing interval of
                        this work, which is supposed to range from 1891 to 1892,<note>See Saussure’s
                            letter to Gaston Paris (30 December 1891). On the date of this

                            >2009</ref>).</note> was formally defined by linking the instance
                        Double_Essence_Writing_Time through the relation time:hasBeginning to an
                        instance of the class time:Instant, defined by the Data Property XSDDateTime
                        with value <quote rend="inline">1891-01-01T00:00:00</quote> as well as
                        through the relation time:hasEnd to an instance of the class time:Instant,
                        defined by the Data Property XSDDateTime with value <quote rend="inline"
                            >1892-12-31T00:00:00</quote>. The same formalisation was performed for
                        each work where this sense of signe was attested.</p>
                    <p>As described in Section 5, on the basis of N-ary approach here adopted,
                            <foreign>ontolex</foreign> relations were reified and the following
                        classes were introduced as subclass of Event: BroaderEvent (reification of
                        the hypernym relation); NarrowerEvent (reification of the hyponym relation);
                        IncompatibleEvent (reification of the antonymy relation); EquivalentEvent
                        (reification of the synonymy relation), ReferenceEvent (reification of the
                        inter-level relation reference) and finally senseEvent (reification of the
                        relation linking a lexical entry to its senses).</p>
                    <p>By firing the two rules illustrated in Section 5, the classes ReferenceEvent
                        and SenseEvent were automatically populated. More specifically, in
                        accordance with the first rule, the instance signe_sense_ts was created and
                        linked by means of the relation temporalSense both to signe_sense
                        (individual of ontolex:LexicalSense class) and to signe_entry (individual of
                        the ontolex:LexicalEntry class). Similarly, by firing the second rule, the
                        individual signe_sense_ref_signifiant_concept was created and linked by the
                        relation temporalReference both to signe_sense and to an ontology concept,
                        described in the <title rend="italic">Simple_FdS</title> ontology.</p>
                    <p>As underlined above, a terminological fluctuation can be observed in
                        Saussure's work as regard to the designation of the concept SIGNIFIER.</p>
                    <p>An attempt to completely renew semiotic terminology is attested in the
                        so-called <title rend="italic">Notes Items</title>. In these handwritten
                        pages, defined by Stetter (<ref target="#stetter1979">1979</ref>) as a
                            <quote rend="inline">fragment sémiologique central</quote>, Saussure’s
                        reflection upon linguistic sign achieved extraordinary theoretical heights.
                        Many heterodox neologisms were introduced, such as <foreign>sème</foreign>,
                            <foreign>sème linguistique</foreign>, <foreign>aposème</foreign>,
                            <foreign>kenôme</foreign>, <foreign>sôme</foreign>,
                            <foreign>contre-sôme</foreign> etc. Here the
                            <soCalled>material</soCalled> part of linguistic sign, namely the
                            <soCalled>signifier</soCalled>, is denoted in certain passages by the
                        term <foreign>aposème</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>This terminology is abandoned later and the term <foreign>signe</foreign>
                        continues to be used to indicate at the same time the
                            <soCalled>material</soCalled> part of the linguistic sign and the whole,
                        namely the combination of SIGNIFIED (concept) and SIGNIFIER (acoustic
                        image).</p>
                    <p>In order to avoid the confusion that the polysemy of the term
                            <foreign>signe</foreign> generated in his students, Saussure introduced
                        in extremis the term <foreign>signifiant</foreign>, during his last course
                        on general linguistics in 1911. He proposed thus to retain the word
                            <foreign>signe</foreign> to designate the linguistic entity as a whole,
                        and to replace the dyad signe and concept respectively by
                            <foreign>signifiant</foreign> and <foreign>signifié</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>To formalise this terminological fluctuation, the instance
                        signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense of the EquivalentEvent class was created and
                        the static triple (signe_sense lexinfo:synonymy aposème_sense) was split
                        into the following two triples in accordance with the N-ary model: (signe
                        temporalSynonym signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense) and
                        (signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense temporalSynonym aposème). The instance
                        signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense was then linked to the interval
                        Notes_Item_Writing_Interval by means of the relation during.</p>
                    <p>In a similar way, the instance signe_sense_syn_signifiant_sense of the
                        EquivalentEvent class was created and linked via temporalSynonym to the
                        individual signifiant. The instance signe was in turn linked - by means of
                        the same relation - to the instance signe_sense_syn_signifiant_sense,
                        belonging to the reified class EquivalentEvent. Finally, the instance was
                        linked to the interval troisième_Cours_Interval (with beginning 1910 and end
                        1911) by means of the relation during.</p>

                        and concepts, and then to answer complex and sophisticated queries. Here are

                    <p>Returning to our Saussure’s case study, let us suppose, for example, that
                        scholars would like to know which terms have been used by the Genevan
                        linguist over time as synonyms of the term <foreign>signe</foreign> (in the

                    <p>As clearly appears in the graph, the formalization previously described makes
                        it emerge immediately Saussure’s unceasing and obsessive work in search for
                        the term that best represented the concept.</p>
                    <p>In an initial period, spanning approximately from 1899 and 1903, Saussure
                        introduces three interesting neologisms: <foreign>signe-idée</foreign>,
                            <foreign>son-idée</foreign> and <foreign>forme-sens</foreign>. These
                        three nominal compounds well reflect the fact that the linguistic sign is
                        composed of two parts that are closely connected as the two sides of a piece
                        of paper. In effect, the bipartite structure of the terms mirrors the dyadic
                        nature of the linguistic sign. Each element of the compound denotes one of
                        the two parts composing the linguistic sign. More specifically, the first
                        constituent of the compound refers to the signifier, i.e. the sound-image
                            (<foreign>signe</foreign>, <foreign>son</foreign>,
                            <foreign>forme</foreign>), while the second element denotes the
                        conceptual side, the idea conveyed by the sign (<foreign>idée</foreign>,
                            <foreign>sens</foreign>).</p>
                    <p>Later, in a time span ranging from 1899 to 1903, Saussure renames
                            <foreign>signe</foreign> as <foreign>sème</foreign> and distinguishes it
                        from its <soCalled>material</soCalled> constituent, named
                            <foreign>sôme</foreign> and from its conceptual part, designated as
                            <foreign>contre- sôme</foreign>, thus introducing a constellation of
                        neologisms derived from ancient Greek, as is usual in scientific
                        terminology.</p>
                    <p>All these neologisms are abandoned and no longer adopted by the Genevan
                        linguist who prefers to continue using more traditional terms such as
                            <foreign>mot</foreign>, <foreign>terme</foreign>, <foreign>signe
                            linguistique</foreign>. These terms are all attested in the three
                        courses of general linguistics held by Saussure in Geneva between 1909 and
                        1911. Here Saussure definitely chooses the term <foreign>signe</foreign> to
                        indicate the whole resulting from the association of form, named
                            <foreign>signifiant</foreign>, and meaning, named
                            <foreign>signifié</foreign>, thus resolving the ambiguity that until
                        then had characterized the term <foreign>signe</foreign>: <quote

                    <p>As clearly emerges from the graph, signe is used in the same period - and in
                        the same texts - with two different meanings, namely to indicate the most
                            <soCalled>concrete</soCalled> part of the linguistic sign
                            (<foreign>signe sense-2</foreign>) as well as to denote the union of a
                        concept and a form (<foreign>signe sense-3</foreign>).<note><foreign>Signe
                                sense-1</foreign> refers to any material entity to which we
                            associate a sense. This meaning is not taken into account here, as not
                            relevant for the purposes of this discussion.</note> This polysemy
                        generates ambiguity, and – as we know – ambiguity should be strongly avoided
                        in terminology where, according to GTT, the term must be monosemic and the
                        concept unambiguous. Saussure is aware of this and therefore during his last
                        course on general linguistics – and more precisely on May 19 1911 – proposes
                        to preserve the term <foreign>signe</foreign> in its third sense and to
                        replace it with the neologism <foreign>signifiant</foreign> as for the
                        second meaning.</p>
                    <p>As Saussure’s case study demonstrates, models and tools devoted to
                        representing and querying diachronic terminological resources play a crucial
                        role in order to better understand the terminological fluctuation and the
                        mobile and progressive conceptualisation which characterize some unstable
                        phases of science.</p>

                <head>7. Conclusion and next steps</head>
                <p>Representing the diachronic evolution of terminological and conceptual data in a
                    formal way constitutes a challenge, since standard formalisms adopted in the
                    Semantic Web for the representation of data have mainly been conceived for
                    static and monotonic information.</p>
                <p>In this work we have proposed a Semantic Web-based model for representing in an
                    explicit and formal way the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a
                    given domain, accompanied by a concrete use case focussing on the evolution of
                    linguistic terminology as attested in Ferdinand De Saussure’s writings.</p>
                <p>The next research objectives are: i) the enrichment of the model, ii) the
                    exploitation of the resource, iii) the extension of the tool LexO to support the
                    construction of diachronic resources.<note>The most recent stable version of
                        LexO is available at <ref target="https://github.com/GitHubAndre/LexO-lite"
                            >https://github.com/GitHubAndre/LexO-lite</ref>.</note></p>
                <p>As far as the enrichment of the model is concerned, we plan to design new SWRL
                    rules for the automatic temporalization of lexico-semantic properties holding
                    between senses, such as synonymy, antonymy etc.</p>
                <p>In addition, in order to manage the cases when the writing period of a text is
                    uncertain, we intend to develop an algorithm exploiting the resource for
                    automatic dating suggestion: the behaviour of terms in those texts, whose
                    writing time is known, will be used to advance hypotheses on the uncertain (or
                    even unknown) writing time periods of the other texts belonging to the corpus
                    under analysis. Needless to say, the accuracy of suggested time periods will be
                    proportionate to the amount of (certain) temporal information already encoded in
                    the diachronic resource.</p>
                <p>A remark is in order: the temporalization approach here illustrated is domain
                    independent and can be virtually applied to any RDF data model. The main
                    drawback is that such an approach requires a significant design effort in
                    modelling and encoding specific sets of temporal rules. In addition, the
                    properties to be temporalized need to be already known at the modelling time.
                    However, in slightly <soCalled>controlled</soCalled> domains like terminology
                    and lexicography, our approach turns out to be effective to describe the
                    historical development of a language, and its many diatopic variations.</p>
                <p>Finally, we are working to extend the tool LexO as to include the management of
                    texts and temporal information. The tool will be designed to relieve scholars
                    from the time consuming (and prone to errors) task of formalising the large
                    amount of entities required to represent the temporal information according to
                    the N-ary model. In addition, thanks to LexO scholars will not be required to
                    manage the formalisms and the languages underlying the Web Semantic technologies
                    such as RDF and OWL.</p>
                <p>The first extension of the tool LexO aimed at the inclusion of temporal
                    information will involve the integration of functions for the management of
                    text. As discussed in Section 2, diachronic terminology is a textual
                    terminology, and terms have to be analysed in their contexts of use. For this
                    reason, LexO will be equipped with a module through which users will be able to
                    import their documents and the relative time information (writing time, date of
                    publishing, etc.), organize them into folders, browse them and link each encoded
                    term to the relative attestations in the corpus.</p>
