                  <p>Tracy L. Barnett is a doctoral candidate at the University of Georgia. Rifles — their meaning to men and their availability in nineteenth-century America — are at the center of her work. Her dissertation, <title rend="quotes">Men and Their Guns: The Culture of Self-Deputized Manhood in the South, 1850–1877,</title> analyzes the historic origins of America’s gun culture and its mutually constitutive relationship to white supremacist ideology. In addition to her traditional scholarship, she is a trained digital historian and the content manager for the <title rend="italic">Athens Death Project</title>.</p>

            <p>A book review of Hannu Salmi’s <title rend="italic">What is Digital History?</title>.
               Salmi’s work offers a clear and coincide introduction to the history of digital
               humanities, notes the current state of the field, and address common criticism faced
               by digital humanists. In particular, this book would be of interest to those teaching
               undergraduate or graduate courses in historical methodology, public history, or
               digital history. </p>

      <body>
         <p>The latest addition to the What is History? series by Polity Books, Hannu Salmi’s <title rend="italic">What
            is Digital History?</title> provides a compelling introduction to the burgeoning field of digital
            history. Interdisciplinary in scope — including art history, public history, and the
            digital humanities — Salmi introduces major concepts, addresses well-known limitations,
            and broadly surveys the state of the field in the United States, Western Europe, and
            beyond. This is not a <q>how-to</q> manual for those building digital projects, but a
            <q>what-is</q> book, which deftly and concisely defines digital history as a branch of
            historical analysis.</p>
         <p>Opening with an overview on digital culture and technology, Salmi grounds his study in
            its historical antecedents. The rapid development of technology in the decades following
            the Second World War provided new tools for scholars. The 1990s, in turn, saw the
            development of the World Wide Web and with it a rapid growth in digital scholarship —
            including the digitization of historical manuscripts and the development of online
            curatorial services. George Mason University’s Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New
            Media (RRCHNM) was founded in 1994; its mission, as Stephen Robertson noted, was <quote
               rend="inline">to democratize the past — to incorporate multiple voices, reach diverse
               audiences, and encourage popular participation in presenting and preserving the
               past</quote>
            <ptr target="#salmi2020" loc="5"/>. Such pioneering projects paved the way for digital
            scholarship on a wider scale. Salmi, in particular, emphasizes the close association
            between digital history and public history within the United States. That was largely
            true for projects and digital centers developed in the 1990s, including the RRCHNM, but
            there are important methodological and philosophical differences between digital history
            and public history; recent digital history projects reflect this divergence. Salmi,
            however, minimizes the distinctions between these two subfields of the historical
            profession.</p>
         <p>The opening chapter, <title rend="quotes">The Digital Past,</title> examines the distinction
            between <quote rend="inline">born-digital</quote> and <quote rend="inline"
               >digitized</quote> data, and the limitations of both forms. From professional emails
            to personal Tweets, the digital age has brought with it a substantial amount of
            ephemera. If preserved, <q>born-digital</q> data offers underused but tantalizing subjects of
            future analysis for historians of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Housing an
            effusion of paper letters, reports, and manuscripts, archives and libraries across the
            globe have made concerted efforts to convert their vast, physical holdings into digital
            representations. Examples of <q>digitized data</q> include the Library of Congress’
            American Memory Project, Google Books, and Spain’s El Archive General de Indias. Salmi,
            a nineteenth-century historian at the University of Turku in Finland, provides myriad
            examples of European digitization projects aimed at historians of the eighteenth and
            nineteenth centuries. Indeed, the merit of this work is its transnational scope. </p>
         <p>Reading, Salmi argues, is not a straightforward process. In <title rend="quotes">Reading
               and Textuality in Digital History,</title> he considers <q>reading</q> in the digital
            age and the use of texts as <q>big data.</q> Close reading and textual interpretation
               <quote rend="inline">have always been at the heart of history as a discipline</quote>
            <ptr target="#salmi2020" loc="8"/>. Digital history, given the vast scope of the
            available data and the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), requires a different
            methodological approach: distant reading. Computer software and researchers mine ‘big
            data’ sets for micro and macro level patterns. Salmi, however, readily notes the
            limitations of OCR software and its many inaccuracies. </p>
         <p>While not a major feature of the work, a cursory analysis of mapping and data
            visualization is included in <title rend="quotes">Mapping and Viewing History.</title>
            Influenced by the development and advancement of geospatial information systems, the
            spatial turn encouraged multidisciplinary collaborations: libraries digitized maps;
            scholars mapped historical data. Image digitization, too, has revolutionized the field,
            according to Salmi. Large-scale digitization of paintings, photographs, and other images
            have permitted <q>distant viewing,</q> a method of using computer software to interpret
            metadata. Focused mainly on art history and image digitization, Chapter 3 minimizes the
            importance of spatial analysis in digital history. Mapping is a powerful tool for
            historical research, and its importance is underestimated here.</p>
         <p>A short fourth chapter, <title rend="quotes">Interdisciplinarity: Challenges for
               Research,</title> surveys some of the complexities of doing digital history. By its
            very nature, digital history is collaborative and reaches across traditional
            disciplinary boundaries. That is not new nor are such problems confined to digital
            history, notes Salmi. In practice, interdisciplinary exploration is difficult given the
               <quote rend="inline">tension between disciplinary thinking and interdisciplinary
               pressure</quote>
            <ptr target="#salmi2020" loc="77"/>. Salmi, however, still encourages collaboration
            while recognizing disciplinary boundaries and each fields’ unique idiosyncrasies. He
            concludes, <quote rend="inline">Digital history . . . is not a discipline; it is a
               branch of historical practice that can also be an interdisciplinary enterprise in
               which the researcher must enter the trading zone</quote>
            <ptr target="#salmi2020" loc="77"/>. In this <q>trading zone,</q> historians may
            question their identity as scholars and must confront the innerworkings of their
            profession and articulate their research procedures to those outside their field.</p>
         <p>In his final chapter, <title rend="quotes">Presenting the Past in the Digital
               Age,</title> Salmi returns to public history. Many digital projects — The Texas
            Slavery Project, for example — strive to present historical information to the public
            via the internet. Other projects pair visualizations with textual information to convey
            historical data and narration. Open-source programs enable historians to create graphs,
            timelines, and word clouds. This chapter, in particular, is helpful for those eager to
            learn more about open-source programs and digital tools, and Salmi lists but does not
            evaluate several specific programs — AntConc, Voyant Tools, D3, ManyEyes, Gephi, and
            TextArc, just to name a few. </p>
         <p>Salmi is at times critical of digital history – addressing paywalls, OCR limitations,
            and interdisciplinary challenges – but he endorses this form of innovative methodology.
            Yet critics of digital history abound, and a more nuanced conversation regarding digital
            history’s limitations may have better served its practitioners, both current and
            future. Nonetheless, this slim volume fulfills an important purpose. Serving as a
            concise, clear introduction to the field, <title rend="italic">What is Digital History?</title> is ideal for
            classroom instruction with advanced undergraduate or early-career graduate students. In
            particular, those teaching introductory historical methodology, public history, or
            digital history in the United States or Europe would be wise to incorporate this text
            into their classrooms. Raising key points and introducing innovative projects, this work
            would without a doubt inspire animated conversations and encourage others to enter the
            field.</p>
