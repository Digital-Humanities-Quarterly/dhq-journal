                  <p>This paper examined seventy-one “<span class="foreign i">Hyakki Yagyō Emaki</span>” 
                     (“Night Parade of One Hundred Demons” Picture Scroll; Demons Scroll) and estimated the artistic editing 
                     process using a digital humanities approach. The edit distance was used to illustrate
                     the lineage trees 
                     of Demons Scrolls, focusing on the arrangement of the demons in the procession. The
                     author concluded that 
                     a type of scroll depicted the demon arrangement closest to the prototype of the renowned
                     Shinjuan lineage 
                     scrolls. By numbering the demons in the procession, the author contributed quantitative
                     evidence to the 
                     ongoing iconographical interpretation debate. The paper ends with a discussion of
                     new questions 
                     regarding Demons Scrolls that have arisen as a result of this research. By applying
                     similar methods to other 
                     materials, the scope of digital humanities can be expanded.

                     barriers between theory

                     humanities and digital/computational methods. 
                     However, continuing this effort is somewhat challenging. The main obstacles are difficulties
                     in understanding each other's languages 
                     and methodologies. To promote interaction with humanities scholars, the digital humanities
                     side should demonstrate how their methods 
                     can contribute to specific humanities research topics. Similarly, humanities scholars
                     should expand their knowledge of digital/computational 
                     approaches. What is needed is not sophisticated tools or presentations but concrete
                     results that address unsolved questions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">Flanders argues that humanities computing does not primarily concern itself with either
                     the discovery of new knowledge or the 
                     validation of existing information. Instead, she suggests that its core function lies
                     in the modeling of that knowledge, and in certain 
                     instances, the modeling of the modeling process itself. According to her, humanities
                     computing is a method of exploring our modes of 
                     knowledge acquisition and the presentation of that knowledge for personal study [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2009">Flanders 2009</a>, par. 10]. Going beyond 
                     Flanders's argument, this paper aims to model how we comprehend a type of artwork
                     using a mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology, 
                     and furthermore discover new knowledge in the field of Japanese art history from a
                     digital humanities perspective.

                     the knowledge discovery in art history by computer 
                     vision technology, Lang and Ommer discussed effective use cases of digital technology,
                     which include a classification and visualization 
                     of age and social status of models in painted portraits. They conveyed the idea that
                     it is not enough to just convert analog methods into 
                     digital ones, as this approach does not capture the unique attributes and potential
                     of digital data. They emphasized that the generation 
                     of new knowledge only becomes possible when we devise new computational methods for
                     handling digital data. This level of knowledge production, 
                     they argue, could not be achieved with analog data and its corresponding methods.
                     The impact of this shift, they stressed, extends beyond 
                     art historians to also touch earlier generations of academics, particularly students

                     is not overly specialized, thereby eliciting broader 
                     interest and utilizing a language mutually comprehensible to each other. In order
                     to meet these criteria, this paper undertakes an examination

                     Demons” Picture Scroll; henceforth, Demons Scroll), which depicts <span class="foreign i">yōkai</span> (Japanese specters) marching 
                     at midnight, have been popular in Japan due to the enigmatic and humorous depictions
                     of demons.  It is believed that numerous Japanese painters 
                     replicated this subject between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, resulting
                     in the formation of several lineages of “<span class="foreign i">Hyakki Yagyō</span>” scrolls.  The creation of multiple copies of these scrolls is indicative of a significant
                     “copy culture” in premodern Japanese art.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">Shinjuan, a sub-temple of Daitokuji temple in Kyoto, owns the most famous version
                     of the Demons Scroll, attributed to Tosa Mitsunobu  (1434–1525) and designated as
                     an important cultural property of Japan (Figure 1). The majority of research on Demons
                     Scrolls has referenced this Shinjuan copy. Since the Shinjuan scroll is believed to
                     be the oldest of the known Demons Scrolls, it is only natural that scholars have focused
                     their attention on it. However, previous research has overlooked an important fact:
                     although many copies depict the same demons as the Shinjuan painting, few scrolls
                     have the same compositional arrangement.  If the Shinjuan scroll is the oldest Demons
                     Scroll, then many more copies with the exact same arrangement should be preserved.
                     The demon arrangement in the Shinjuan scroll is likely one of many variants of the
                     Shinjuan lineage of Demons Scrolls. It is also possible that the configuration of
                     demons in the Shinjuan scroll’s prototype differed from the extant copy.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Researchers of the Demons Scrolls have noted the need to reevaluate the Shinjuan scroll’s
                     significance. Tanaka Takako, a scholar of Japanese medieval literature, stated, “The
                     Shinjuan copy was likely not the prototype of the Demons Scroll, but rather a unique
                     case. In other words, among the numerous Demons Scrolls that circulated between the
                     sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, I believe the Shinjuan lineage was fortuitously
                     propagated” [Tanaka 2002, 220]. Yumoto Kōichi, a collector and researcher of materials
                     pertaining to Japanese specters, wrote, “If the Shinjuan lineage is the standard,
                     other copies omitted certain demons and added new ones. To position the Shinjuan version,
                     its relationship with other types of Demons Scrolls must be clarified” [Yumoto 2005,
                     53]. In response to these studies, the Japanese expert on specter culture Komatsu
                     Kazuhiko stated, “When considering the lineage of Demons Scrolls, we must set the
                     Shinjuan copy aside” [Komatsu 2008, 164]. Based on their perceptions, this paper will
                     present a new theory regarding the Shinjuan scroll.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">In addition to the Shinjuan lineage, there are several other variants with different
                     demons and what appears to be a mixture of two lineages. Tanaka centered her attention
                     on a copy known as the “Tōhaku mohon” (in this paper, the Tōhaku-A scroll). The Tōhaku-A
                     scroll contains all of the demons depicted in the Shinjuan scroll, as well as a large
                     number of additional demons. Tanaka presumed that the original Tōhaku-A lineage predates
                     the Shinjuan lineage and that the latter is an idiosyncratic copy of the Tōhaku-A
                     lineage created by extracting demons from it.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">In 2007, the “Hyakki no zu” (Picture of One Hundred Demons) picture scroll acquired
                     by the International Research Center for Japanese Studies (Nichibunken; in this paper,
                     Nichibunken-A scroll) was discovered to be composed of demons from the Tōhaku-A lineage
                     minus those from the Shinjuan scroll. Komatsu’s investigation of the Nichibunken-A
                     scroll led him to conclude that its prototype dates to the sixteenth century, the
                     same era during which the Shinjuan version is believed to have been painted. Komatsu
                     argued, contrary to Tanaka’s theory, that the original Tōhaku-A was a combination
                     of the Shinjuan and Nichibunken-A compositions. Moreover, Komatsu asserted that Demons
                     Scrolls can be classified into four distinct lineages that do not overlap, and that
                     these lineages were sometimes combined to produce a variety of copies. The four lineages
                     are represented by the Shinjuan, Nichibunken-A, Kyoto City University of the Arts
                     (KCUA), and Hyogo Prefecture Museum of History (Hyogo-A) scrolls [Komatsu 2008, 133].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">The study by Komatsu was the first to investigate and classify sixty-four known Demons
                     Scrolls, including those preserved in the United States and Europe. By examining a
                     diversity of scrolls, Komatsu was able to clarify that there are combined copies of
                     Shinjuan and Nichibunken-A; Shinjuan and KCUA; Shinjuan and Hyogo-A; and Nichibunken-A
                     and KCUA. If we were to accept Tanaka’s theory that the Shinjuan scroll is an idiosyncratic
                     copy, we would have to recognize that demons in Tōhaku-A were neatly separated to
                     form the Shinjuan and Nichibunken-A lineages, with no overlap. However, this is unlikely.
                     In contrast to Tanaka’s theory, Komatsu’s “mixture theory” seems more plausible. The
                     author agrees with the “mixture theory” positing that there are four distinct lineages
                     of Demons Scrolls: Shinjuan, Nichibunken-A, KCUA, and Hyogo-A, and that these were
                     intermixed to produce the Tōhaku-A scroll and other combined copies. However, previous
                     studies, including those by Komatsu, have focused on the differences and interpretations
                     of the images while ignoring the arrangement of the demons. Using the digitized photographs
                     of scrolls that Komatsu collected and others that have recently been made available
                     on the Internet, it is possible to estimate the process by which Demons Scrolls were
                     drawn and edited by successive generations of painters.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">Several previous studies have examined the editorial process of Japanese cultural
                     artifacts. Yano Tamaki has conducted research on the genealogy of esoteric texts on
                     the tea ceremony (chadō) [Yano 1999][Yano 2022], as well as the “Sanjūrokkasen Emaki”
                     (Picture Scroll of Thirty-six Master Poets) [Yano 2006, 36−42], using tools such as
                     SpritsTree  and “Hayashi’s Quantification Theory Family III.”  Nevertheless, these
                     studies rely on textual arrangement, including those that focus on illustrated scrolls.
                     There is a conspicuous lack of previous research that examines the genealogy of picture
                     scrolls based on their visual representations.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">To ascertain the picture scroll editing process, we propose the following estimation
                     model: The fewer the differences between scrolls, the shorter the number of edits
                     between them, and the closer they are to each other in the chain of copying. For instance,
                     if one block differs between scrolls A and B, and between B and C, and two blocks
                     differ between scrolls A and C, the most likely conclusion is that B was created by
                     editing A, and C was created by editing B. (or vice versa). Obviously, one cannot
                     rule out the possibility that C was created by editing A without mediating B, but
                     this is probably not the case.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">This paper utilizes the concept of edit distance in order to quantify the differences
                     between scrolls. Edit distance is a standard method for determining text similarity
                     [Nerbonne 2005].  In recent years, the field of linguistic computing has developed
                     a variety of applications for edit distance, such as historical name normalization
                     [Hämäläinen et al. 2018] [Benito-Santos et al. 2019], text comparison [Bernholz and
                     Zillig 2011] [Hyytiäinen 2022], and analysis of library catalog transmission [Baker
                     et al. 2022]. Its application to visual arts, however, is somewhat challenging because
                     edit distance is rarely applied to non-textual data.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p16">Typically, edit distance is calculated based on the number of edit operations per
                     symbol, but to accommodate this application to Demons Scrolls, we will use symbol
                     blocks (chunks of symbols) as the unit and count the numbers of swap, insertion, and
                     deletion operations on the blocks. This estimation model differs from Levenshtein
                     distance (including insertion, deletion, and substitution) or Damelau-Levenshtein
                     distance (Levenshtein plus transposition of two adjacent characters). We will assume
                     that the differences between the symbol arrays “123456789” (sequence-A), “145678239”
                     (sequence-B), and “167845239” (sequence-C) are due to editing operations. The estimated
                     editing procedure is described in Figure 2. The symbol block “23” in sequence-A first
                     swaps with “45678,” then it turns into sequence-B. Next, the symbol block “45” in
                     sequence-B swaps with “678,” then it becomes sequence-C. The edit distance between
                     A and B (and also between B and C) is one, while the edit distance between A and C
                     is two. In this example, it is plausible that the sequence-A is edited into sequence-B,
                     which is then edited into sequence-C (or vice versa). This estimation model is incapable
                     of determining a single conclusion; it can only indicate what are the plausible processes.
                     Therefore, it is essential to confirm the estimation’s accuracy by employing additional
                     qualitative methods.

                     to apply when parts of a scroll are missing or if the consecutively joined sheets

                     catalogued by Komatsu [Komatsu 2008, 249−254]. We excluded works that were evidently
                     copied after the mid-nineteenth century, and limited our study to the previously mentioned
                     four lineages, as well as works constituting mixed editions of them. Komatsu classified
                     the lineages as follows: class-A (Shinjuan lineage), class-B (Nichibunken-A lineage),
                     class-C (KCUA lineage), and class-D (Hyogo-A lineage).  In addition, he discovered
                     four types of mixed copies, including class-AB (Shinjuan+Nichibunken-A), class-AC
                     (Shinjuan+KCUA), class-AD (Shinjuan+Hyogo-A), and class-BC (Nichibunken-A+KCUA). However,
                     a closer look at these scrolls reveals that Komatsu’s class-AB can be divided further
                     into two classes: class-AB (the Shinjuan scroll demons come first, followed by the
                     Nichibunken-A parade of demons) and class-BA (the demons in the Nichibunken-A scroll
                     come first, followed by those in the Shinjuan scroll). Class-AD can also be divided
                     into AD and DA. Our revised list of works is presented in Appendix in light of these
                     findings.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">As stated at the end of section 2, we identified the demons by focusing on their relative
                     positions in the parade sequence as opposed to minute differences in their depictions.
                     Similar demons appearing in a similar sequence in two scrolls are deemed identical,
                     and the two arrangements are thought to be the same (Figure 3). This method is not
                     applicable to picture scrolls with a strong suspicion of missing or disordered sheets
                     of paper, or to folding screens and hanging scrolls. Therefore, such materials were
                     excluded from the analysis. The target works are consequently limited, as shown in
                     Appendix. We should note that one of the target works (Kyōgaen in class-AC) is a woodblock-printed
                     book and not a painted scroll. We decided to include it because the demons in the
                     book are depicted in sequential order and it contains useful information such as the
                     date of publication.

                     process of the Shinjuan (class-A) lineage, the most popular lineage of Demons Scrolls.
                     As depicted in Figure 4, we identified all the demons in the Shinjuan scroll and assigned
                     numbers to them. Using these numbers, eight other class-A scrolls were converted into
                     symbol sequences. The Shinjuan (No. 1 in Appendix), Itō (No. 7), Iwate (No. 9), NDL-A
                     (No. 12), Nichibunken-B (No. 14), Nichibunken-C (No. 15), Rekihaku-A (No. 18), Rikkyo
                     (No. 21), and Spencer-B (No. 23) are the nine scrolls examined here that show almost
                     the same numbers of demons in comparison to the Shinjuan scroll (Figure 5). In the
                     case of the Shinjuan and Rekihaku-A scrolls, for instance, if we swap two blocks of
                     demons in Shinjuan, (No. 04−07 with 08−30, and No. 20−30 with 31−43 in Figure 4) the
                     demons transform into the arrangement in Rekihaku-A. The edit distance between the
                     two scrolls is therefore two (See Figure 6).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Of these nine scrolls, we omitted the Rikkyo scroll because of its evidently unique
                     arrangement. It has an unusual layout compared to other scrolls and can be considered
                     an atypical copy. The edit distances between eight of the scrolls are shown in Table
                     1. Among them, the arrangement of Nichibunken-B is particularly notable (Yumoto-A
                     [No. 26 in Appendix] has the same arrangement).  This copy is connected to five scrolls
                     (Shinjuan, Itō, NDL-A, Nichibunken-C, and Rekihaku-A) via an edit distance of one.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Based on the matrix of edit distance, multiple possible lineage trees can be drawn.
                     The simplest tree is a structure where the sum of the distances is minimized, or the
                     “minimum spanning tree,” as depicted in Figure 7. Nichibunken-B (Yumoto-A), which
                     is located at the “root” and has the shortest distance to other scrolls, is connected
                     to the Itō, NDL-A, Nichibunken-C, Rekihaku-A, and Shinjuan scrolls at a distance of
                     one, and to the Iwate scroll at a distance of two. Spencer-B is connected at two to
                     the Shinjuan scroll, while Rikkyo is isolated. If the class-A lineage shares a common
                     ancestor, this tree indicates that the Nichibunken-B scroll’s demon arrangement is
                     the closest to it. In other words, it is possible that the Shinjuan scroll is a rearranged
                     version of Nichibunken-B’s prototype.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24">This lineage tree is supported by a comparison of iconographic details. For example,
                     let us investigate whether or not a handle is depicted on the pot lid of the “demon
                     wearing a pot lid” that appears in the latter half of class-A lineage scrolls (Figure
                     8). Japanese art historian Komatsu Shigemi observed that the handle depicted in the
                     Tōhaku-A (No. 49 in Appendix) scroll was missing in the Shinjuan scroll. He stated
                     that “such detailed copying strongly suggests that the Shinjuan scroll was painted
                     based on a prototype” [Komatsu 1979b, 132] and that the Shinjuan scroll had another
                     prototype. If we apply the presence or absence of the “pot lid handle” to the lineage
                     tree depicted in Figure 7, we find that the “handle” is depicted in Nichibunken-B
                     (Yumoto-A), which is at the “root,” and in the Iwate version, but not in other scrolls.
                     This indicates that the presence of the “handle” was clearly distinguished on the
                     lineage tree. While Nichibunken-B (Yumoto-A) retains the demon arrangement of the
                     ancestorial copy relatively well, the Shinjuan and other six scrolls are copies of
                     versions in which the “pot lid handle” was omitted.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">In what ways do the demon configurations of the Nichibunken-B and Shinjuan scrolls
                     differ? As illustrated in Figure 9, the two can be transformed by a single block swap.
                     It is remarkable that some of the movable demon blocks in the Shinjuan scroll can
                     be separated at the paper joins. Five joins in this scroll do not overlap the figures,
                     and three of them are the boundaries where the demons are arranged differently than
                     in Nichibunken-B. In contrast, only one join at the beginning of the Nichibunken-B
                     scroll does not overlap the figure. In other words, the arrangement of the demons
                     in the Shinjuan scroll can be transformed to that of Nichibunken-B by simply detaching
                     the paper joins and rearranging the sheets. If the arrangement of Nichibunken-B is
                     closer to the Shinjuan scroll’s prototype, we can conclude that the order of paper
                     sheets became disordered during a remounting and resulted in the current arrangement
                     in the Shinjuan scroll. This new theory regarding Demons Scrolls emerged from the
                     field of digital humanities. Close inspection reveals that the Shinjuan scroll’s joined
                     sheets of paper are stained along their edges. This indicates that the sheets of papers
                     were separated and preserved for a certain period of time, and is evidence supporting
                     our conclusion that the sheets were incorrectly arranged when the scroll was reassembled.

                     units. If a block of demons appears in multiple copies, it indicates that it was recognized
                     as a “unit” by multiple painters.

                     lady) in Figure 10: whether she is “running toward” the group of ugly women with black
                     teeth  in front of her (No. 24−30) [Komatsu 1979a, 81] [Yumoto 2005, 40], or “escaping”
                     from the cloud of demons that follows (No. 32−) [Yasumura 1987, 43] [Komatsu 2008,
                     39]. An examination of Figure 5 reveals that six scrolls (Itō, Iwate, NDL-A, Nichibunken-B,
                     Nichibunken-C, and Rekihaku-A) contain the common separation of the block between
                     No. 30 and 31. While it is impossible to determine the intentions of the original
                     painter of the class-A lineage, this separation suggests that many painters who copied
                     the scroll may have interpreted the “running fox lady” as “escaping” from the “cloud
                     of demons.” This is another new theory developed through digital humanities. As previously
                     discussed, misordering of the sheets of paper is suspected between section No. 30
                     and 31 in the Shinjuan scroll. In other words, the original compositional arrangement
                     would also have intended the “fox lady” to be “escaping.”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p28">Next, we will examine the ancestry of the class-AB/BA lineages. Class-AB comprises
                     the combined scrolls that begin with Shinjuan demons followed by Nichibunken-A demons,
                     and class-BA is the opposite. In terms of the arrangement of demons, class-AB/BA scrolls
                     share a common characteristic. Near the end of the scrolls, there is a section where
                     three demons from the class-B lineage are interwoven among class-A demons (Figure
                     11). Such shared characteristics would not exist if the prototypes for class-AB and
                     class-BA scrolls were created independently by different painters at different times.
                     Instead, it would be more natural to assume that class-AB/BA scrolls share a common
                     ancestor and later copies followed this sequence as it appears in their ancestor scroll.
                     The characteristics of class-AB/BA scrolls are summarized in Table 2.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">At first glance, it is evident that the majority of demon configurations of the class-A
                     part of the picture scroll are nearly identical to those of the Shinjuan scroll. In
                     contrast, the demons in the class-B part contain more swaps, deformations, and omissions
                     from the Nichibunken-A scroll. In the Kunaichō-A, OHRM, Rekihaku-B, and Tōhaku-A scrolls,
                     a deformation refers to the change from “demon with spear and hat” to “octopus head
                     demon” (Figure 12).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">Among the class-AB scrolls, the only scroll discussed in this paper is the Beatty
                     scroll, which retains the arrangement of demons relatively well. On another front,
                     this method make it possible to trace the genealogy of class-BA. Based on the edit
                     distance among the class-BA scrolls (Table 3), the minimum spanning tree is depicted
                     as a linear connection: Geidai-A to OHRM to Tōhaku-A to Rekihaku-B (or vice versa)
                     with distances of two, two, and one, respectively. As in the case of class-A scrolls,
                     this lineage tree must be evaluated based on qualitative characteristics. The four
                     class-BA scrolls contain four peculiar depictions: a demon with a “pot lid handle”
                     attached or not, a fleeing monkey wearing a hat or not, a spear-carrying demon with
                     an octopus head or not, and a demon holding two leaves depicted or not (Table 4).
                     Using these binary categorical data, Figure 13 is generated as a dendrogram.
                     </div>
                  
                  
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p31">This dendrogram supports the premise that the root of the lineage tree is traceable
                     to Geidai-A. As a result, the most straightforward iconographic transmission started
                     from Geidai-A, which was inherited by OHRM, Tōhaku-A, and Rekihaku-B (Figure 14).
                     First, the “demon with two leaves” motif was omitted from Geidai-A, creating a nested
                     image for OHRM. The “demon with a spear and hat” appearing at the beginning of the
                     scroll was transformed into a “demon with an octopus head” at this time.  When the
                     ancestor of the OHRM scroll was swapped by two blocks, the arrangement of Tōhaku-A
                     was produced. A further one-block swap resulted in the Rekihaku-B arrangement. In
                     addition to OHRM, the Tōhaku-A and Rekihaku-B scrolls also exclude the “demon with
                     two leaves” motif and transform the “demon with a spear and hat” into an “octopus
                     head demon.”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">Based on the preceding, Figure 15 depicts the results of estimating the editing process
                     of the class-AB/BA lineages. Initially, these classes were created relying upon prototypes
                     of the Shinjuan and Nichibunken-A scrolls, but at some point the “demon in a white
                     robe” motif was omitted. The Geidai-A scroll is the closest to the class-BA prototype.
                     The OHRM scroll was created using Geidai-A’s ancestor as a template. In the process,
                     the “demon with a spear and a hat” became an “octopus head demon,” and the “demon
                     with two leaves” motif was omitted. The ancestors of Tōhaku-A and Rekihaku-B were
                     born from the OHRM prototype.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">Let us apply two qualitative characteristics of the iconographic specifics to the
                     results of this estimate. The first characteristic is the presence or absence of a
                     “pot lid handle” in the previously mentioned class-A lineage, and the second is whether
                     or not the “fleeing monkey” in the latter half of the class-B lineage is wearing a
                     hat. As seen in the Nichibunken-B scroll, it can be assumed that the “pot lid handle”
                     was originally a part of the class-A lineage, but that it was eliminated in the Shinjuan
                     scroll. As in the Nichibunken-A scroll, the “fleeing monkey” would have been depicted
                     without a hat in the class-B prototype. These two characteristics were passed along
                     to the Beatty and Geidai-A scrolls. In contrast, a “pot lid handle” was added after
                     the Geidai-A scroll was created, and the “fleeing monkey” was covered with a hat after
                     the OHRM. These characteristics are shared by the Tōhaku-A and Rekihaku-B scrolls.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p34">The editing processes of the class-AC and AD/DA lineages remain to be estimated. As
                     for class-AC, Kyōgaen (No. 55 in Appendix), Sendai (No. 56), Tōdai (No. 58), and Yumoto-F
                     (No. 59) will be considered. It is difficult to determine the edit distance between
                     these works, however, due to the numerous additions, deletions, and swaps of demons
                     from the prototype. The arrangement of demons in the class-A lineage appears to be
                     based not on the Shinjuan scroll but on Nichibunken-B in all of these materials. Consequently,
                     the “pot lid handle” is depicted in all the class-AC scrolls that have survived. It
                     was combined with the ancestor of KCUA to form the class-AC prototype, from which
                     the draft of Kyōgaen (dated 1775) was created.

                     to class-AC, AD shares many characteristics with Nichibunken-B instead of the Shinjuan
                     scroll. Rekisaikan-B and Spencer-C, which retain the arrangement of Nichibunken-B,
                     appear to be the closest to the class-AD prototype.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36">As an example, we will describe how the demons in Rekisaikan-B are arranged. Although
                     the sequence is split and copied, the demons are identical to those in the Nichibunken-B
                     scroll; however, the editing of the demons from Hyogo-A is more complicated. Moreover,
                     the class-D part of the Rekisaikan-B scroll contains two demons that are absent from
                     Hyogo-A. This suggests that the demons within the Hyogo-A scroll may have been repeatedly
                     swapped and eliminated during the copying process from the class-D prototype.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37">On the basis of the preceding argument, the class-AD/DA editing process can be estimated
                     as follows: First, the class-A component of AD/DA scrolls is based on the prototype
                     of Nichibunken-B. The initial class-AD/DA scrolls were created from this and the ancestor
                     of Hyogo-A. However, after the creation of the prototypes, it is difficult to ascertain
                     the genealogies of this lineage. The “pot lid handle” is not depicted in existing
                     class-AD/DA scrolls. Since the prototype of class-A appears to have possessed the
                     “pot lid handle” motif as exemplified in Nichibunken-B, it was likely eliminated around
                     the time the ancestors of these scrolls were painted. If this is the case, class-AD/DA
                     scrolls which include the “pot lid handles” could be the missing link in this lineage.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">Finally, let us summarize the estimation of the editing processes of Demons Scroll
                     lineages (Figure 16). The most important point is that, among the various scrolls
                     in the class-A lineage, the compositional arrangement of demons in Nichibunken-B is
                     older than that of the most famous Shinjuan scroll. In addition, the author argues
                     that the arrangement of demons in the present-day Shinjuan scroll was created through
                     the misordering of its paper sheets. In class-AB/BA scrolls, the arrangement seen
                     in Nichibunken-A was combined with that of the current Shinjuan scroll, whereas class-AC
                     and AD/DA scrolls are assumed to have combined motifs from the ancestor of Nichibunken-B,
                     instead of the Shinjuan scroll. Since Kyōgaen, a class-AC printed book, has a colophon
                     dated 1775, the original class-AC lineage must have been established prior to that
                     year.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">The other datable artifact is Tōhaku-B, a scroll of class-BC that was not examined
                     in detail for this paper. Tōhaku-B contains demons from the KCUA scroll mixed with
                     those from Nichibunken-A (the majority of which are inverted), as well as demons not
                     found in either scroll. It is dated 1617, so it is likely that both the Nichibunken-A
                     and KCUA scrolls were painted prior to that year. Based on the clothing and customs
                     depicted in the scrolls, some scholars believe that their prototypes were painted
                     in the sixteenth century. Since the Shinjuan scroll is also said to have been created
                     in the sixteenth century, the prototype for Nichibunken-B must have been made around
                     or prior to that time. On the other hand, since it is believed that the original Hyogo-A
                     scroll was created during the Edo period (1603–1868), it can be assumed that the class-AD/DA
                     lineages evolved during the same time frame or later.

                     to study Demons Scrolls, focusing on the configuration of demons. The fact that we
                     were able to deduce and reconstruct the rational editing process from the surviving
                     scrolls provides additional support for the “mixture theory” of Demons Scrolls. However,
                     there is one flaw in this paper’s methodology. If the differences in arrangement are
                     the result of changes in the order of the paper sheets occurring in later periods,
                     the conclusion may be affected. Although scrolls with a high probability of misordered
                     paper sheets were excluded from this study in advance, if a disorder is discovered
                     in other scrolls, it will be necessary to reconsider our findings. However, if we
                     consider this kind of disorder to be the result of editing by someone other than the
                     painter, it may not be necessary to exclude all disordered scrolls.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p41">To further strengthen the “mixture theory” of Demons Scrolls, two additional riddles
                     must be solved. First, if there are four distinct lineages, why are the surviving
                     non-class-A scrolls so few in number? There are at least twenty-seven copies in the
                     class-A lineage, but only two in class-B and class-D, and three in the class-C lineages.
                     Second, why are all the demons in the combined scrolls from the class-A lineage? If
                     there were four distinct lineages, one would expect to find a greater number of combined
                     scrolls from lineages other than class-A. The only exception to this rule is Tōhaku-B
                     (class-BC, No. 71 in Appendix); the absence of class-BD and CD scrolls is also a mystery.
                     This may be due to the preferences of the group of painters who replicated the Demons
                     Scroll and/or their patrons. We defer clarification of this point to future art historical
                     research.
