                            University College Cork. She is based in the School
                            of Applied Psychology, and her research involves an
                            experience centered design inquiry into the patient
                            and caregiver relationship, in the context of
                            dementia. It explores the potential of digital
                            technologies to support positive interactions within
                            the home. She has been involved in the exploration
                            of digital technologies within different settings,
                            such as healthcare and the arts and humanities. Her
                            background lies within psychology and HCI, and her
                            passion is people – being curious about them,
                            empathically co-designing with them, and
                            articulating their voices in a way that gives
                            insight to future design and most importantly future
                            wellbeing. See <ref target="http://marygalvin.org"

            </dhq:teaser>
        </front>
        <body>
  <p>The DHSI Colloquium was founded in 2009 by Diane Jakacki and Cara
                Leitch — then doctoral candidates at the University of Waterloo
                and the University of Victoria, respectively — as the DHSI
                Graduate Colloquium. As initially proposed to Ray Siemens, the
                Colloquium would serve as a forum for emerging scholars to
                present their own research. This was particularly valuable in
                that moment, as research presented at major conferences tended
                to focus on the work of more established scholars, with graduate
                students rarely presenting in a capacity other than as research
                assistants. While many generous and supportive principal
                investigators and research supervisors encouraged emerging
                scholars to take ownership of various components of major
                research projects, there were not many outlets for presentation
                of the specific student-driven activities. The DHSI Graduate
                Student Colloquium offered these emerging scholars a platform to
                present formal papers and to demonstrate works in progress to an
                enthusiastic audience comprised of both established and emerging
                DH practitioners, and most importantly, in an environment that
                encouraged constructive feedback and professional guidance.</p>
            <p>In 2012, after three successful years, Ray and the ad hoc
                Colloquium Advisory Committee observed that there was an
                unrealized opportunity to expand the pool of presenters to
                include more scholars at different phases of their careers,
                working across different registers. This coincided with a
                remarkable growth in attendance at DHSI, and so the Colloquium,
                as well as the audience, grew considerably. In order to
                efficiently respond to the increasing volume of abstracts
                submitted for consideration, as well as to accommodate more
                presenters whose work was at different phases of development and
                implementation, the structure of the Colloquium again changed,
                with a variety of shorter formats introduced to accompany the
                longer, more formal papers.</p>
            <p>Two years later, in 2014, the Colloquium underwent further
                transformation when James O’Sullivan and Mary Galvin succeeded
                Diane as the event’s Chairs. Struck by the omnipresent sense of
                community that exists at DHSI, James and Mary set about
                continuing the work of their predecessors by maintaing the
                Colloquium as a venue to present groundbreaking work, remaining
                attractive to scholars as other DH conference, symposia, and
                gatherings proliferate. The introduction of a poster session
                proved hugely successful, a format designed to accommodate those
                projects that are not conducive to the constraints of an oral
                presentation set within a limited timeframe. A mechanism for
                peer-review was incorporated: reviewers are instructed to offer
                constructive criticisms, while the final program is developed in
                an inclusive manner, with space found for any submission deemed
                to be of an acceptable standard. It is testament to the support
                of Ray, and of course, Daniel Sondheim, Assistant Director of
                the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab at the University of
                Victoria, that such a challenging scheduling process is
                facilitated. </p>
            <p>We are in an era of firsts for the DHSI Colloquium: this special
                issue marks the first ever publication to emerge from the
                gathering; a dedicated website, <ref
                    target="http://dhsicolloquium.org"
                    >http://dhsicolloquium.org</ref>, was launched, through
                which proceedings are disseminated; the current CFP features
                themed sessions, <title rend="quotes">Gender and the
                    Digital</title> and <title rend="quotes">Building an
                Inclusive DH Community</title>; and 2016’s poster session will be
                hosted in collaboration with the Electronic Literature
                Organization. The next iteration will also benefit from the
                addition of a local Program Assistant, Lindsey Seatter. But
                while the Colloquium continues to expand and progress, its ethos
                will remain consistent — it is an opportunity for digital
                humanists, whether curious, fledgling, or established, to
                present their research, projects, and ideas within an engaging,
                collegial, and rewarding environment. The products of this
                space — such as the varied, insightful, and rigorous research
                articles found in this special issue — are sufficient
                justification of this approach. </p>
            <p>DHSI is founded on collaborative principles — it is about learning
                through sharing, encouraging curiosity, it is about the creation
                of interpersonal and cross-instutional opportunities — all of
                which underpin the model adopted by the Colloquium. While these
                principles are its foundation, the presenters are very much the
                driving force of the Colloquium, and it is this community that
                will shape its future directions, so that it can continue to
                serve as a platform for the many and diverse voices that make
                our field what it is.</p>
