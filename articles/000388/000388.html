                  <p> Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it is, in
                     fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction facilitates knowledge
                     creation in conversation with and between sources, bringing together disparate
                     times and places, authors and forms of source material, frames of reference and
                     layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as central focus to
                     create the conditions for serendipitous discovery. This “loose
                     hold” on focus results in a knowledgescape with a substantial
                     tacit dimension, with the result that humanists most certainly know more than we
                     can tell. This is not to say that the epistemic process of the humanist is all
                     encompassing, however: administrative work, for example, is viewed as a
                     “true” distraction, and managed accordingly. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and organise
                     the process of extracting information from the reading of sources (be they text,
                     image, landscape or indeed even the self), the notetaking process of the
                     humanist remains stubbornly multimodal, harnessing embodied, material, and
                     spatial dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge environments humanists
                     create around themselves resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a
                     Prezi stack, a physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard
                     stream of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholar’s
                     understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex, sometimes
                     tenuous, and largely undiscovered.

                  <p>This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this understanding
                     of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future paths for using
                     technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction, including: Technology as
                     blurring the line between the personal and the professional, not so much as a
                     labour practice, but as an epistemic one opening the way to the validation of
                     “epistemic emotions” as a valid research input, but also
                     to the more effective convergence of humanities research with other inputs to
                     the identity formation process of seemingly distracted undergraduates; and
                     research infrastructural implications for libraries (where remote storage and
                     electronic catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by
                     reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded upon a
                     new understanding of what the ideal humanistic work environment might be and how
                     to get “below the level” of that work.

                     “reading” are generaly ones of focus, stasis and concentration.
                     Portraits of readers from the 18<span class="hi superscript">th</span> and 19<span class="hi superscript">th</span> centuries have perhaps contributed to this bias,
                     depicting, as they so often do, a figure (very often female) gazing downward at
                     her book, unaware of the spectatorial gaze, her head perhaps resting
                     unconsciously on her hand. Reading a good book is one of the canonically cited
                     means by which to access the psychological state for which psychologist Mihaly
                     Csíkszentmihályi coined the term “flow,” but the flow that we see in our
                     mind’s eye is a strangely static one, an invisible beam of pure attention
                     connecting the ideas of the author and the mind of the reader that is so
                     powerful, that the reader’s body is negated by the purity and undeniability of
                     her focus.

                     may indeed have always been driven by urges quite outside of the social
                     understanding of reading. What is clear, however, is that they depict a
                     particular mode of reading, one designed for pleasure, focussed on escape and on
                     passive abandon to the author’s intentions. In his 2008 essay, “How Scholars Read,” John Guillory defines a difference
                     between such reading for pleasure and scholarly reading, which he describes in
                     some detail as quite a different process all together. Though he plays
                     throughout the essay with a number of possible characterisations that partially
                     define the differences between lay and scholarly reading (extensive versus
                     intensive modalities, close or interpretive reading, browsing and scanning,
                     skimming etc.), in the end the essence of the work of the scholar is found in
                     not the inhabitation of one intensive mode of reading, but of precisely the
                     ability to move between multiple very different modes: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           The technique of scanning can be
                           organized, alert to keywords, names, dates, or other features of a text.
                           This technique is a form of attention, even heightened attention,
                           although the scholarly reader might ignore the continuous meaning of a
                           text, deferring comprehension until some textual signal brings the
                           scanning process to a temporary halt and initiates a more intensive
                           reading. … At some point reading must be decelerated for the purpose of
                           a more analytic reading, which aims to correct distortions produced by
                           scanning.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">This process of accelerating the reading process by scanning, only to decelerate
                     at the call of a textual signal so as to read intensively, is a response to what
                     Guillory elsewhere in the essay refers to as the “clock time of scholarly reading.” This
                     imperative, to absorb more text in the course of a project or career than could
                     be reasonably expected of intensive lay reading strategies, drives the scholar’s
                     need to fast-forward some passages, and savour others in slow motion, and to
                     adopt alternating states of intensity, and of scanning, a process that removes
                     details and yet represents not only attention, but a “heightened
                     state” of attention. It would be tempting to view the alternating
                     currents of scholarly reading as representing a weakness, rather than a
                     strength. If a scholar had infinite time, would she not read everything
                     intensively, absorb every nuance, and be empowered to reflect every possible
                     argument relative to or interpretation stemming from a particular text? We know
                     instinctively that this is neither possible nor ideal, in part because of the
                     nature of the humanistic instrument of scholarship (to be discussed below) and
                     in part because of the work of scholars that point us toward the strengths of
                     this very attentive yet selective method, such as Franco Moretti, who says: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           Distant reading: where distance,
                           let me repeat it, is a condition of knowledge: it allows you to focus on
                           units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices,
                           themes, tropes — or genres and systems. And if, between the very small and
                           the very large, the text itself disappears, well, it is one of those
                           cases when one can justifiably say, Less is more.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Moretti privileges certain kinds of theoretical questions as meeting the
                     requirement of distance, and certainly the example he explores in the article
                     quoted above (nothing less than the problem of world literature) is adequately
                     vast. But every perspective requires some distance, every object of scholarship
                     exists within a frame. Scholarly reading as Guillory describes it is therefore
                     not only an admission of defeat in the face of a deluge of scholarly writing, it
                     is also a framing mechanism for scholarly work in a field that privileges the
                     operational mode of the hunter-gatherer, rather than the agricultural
                     consolidation of activity into a limited space. Humanists accept their sources
                     as they find them, with all of their messy embeddedness and resonances born of
                     their provenance as the creations of human beings and their cultures. The
                     controlled experiments and clean environments of the physics lab do not reflect
                     this experience of reading as a human through the artefacts of human creation.
                     Following this logic, to be attentive in the context of the study of the
                     humanities is to be, paradoxically, distracted, focussing not merely on a
                     central figure, but both the figure and the landscape that surrounds it.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The dichotomy hereby established between the “clean”
                     conditions required for the study of physics and the “mess”
                     of the humanities should not be taken too far, however. The argument that
                     follows should not be read purely as an exercise in valorising terms normally
                     weighted negatively in the face of their more acceptable opposites, nor of
                     proving definitively that the sciences and humanities are essentially different.
                     Discourse, both public and scientific, about research practices suffers too much
                     from such overly simplified, oppositional positioning between different
                     methodologies and disciplines. What I do propose to do, however, is to
                     contribute to the much needed body of reflection about humanities research
                     methods by challenging the valence positioning of some of the key terms that
                     might be applied to them. Central among these oppositional terms is that of
                     distraction versus focus. Humanities scholarship has always held within it the
                     capacity to not only manage, but make productive use of distraction in the way
                     its practitioners find and integrate information. This input process maps to
                     what we might also call reading. Hence it is the distracted reading of the
                     humanities scholars that shapes the way we build our instruments of scholarship,
                     the way we privilege knowledge interactions we deem serendipitous or
                     environments we may ourselves deem chaotic, how we organise information in space
                     and time, what we deem allowable in the frame of constructing scholarship. It
                     also mediates how humanities scholars adopt and use technology.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">The analysis that follows will unpack some of these statements and defend the
                     notion that scholarly reading is not only based on the process of accelerating
                     and decelerating through discrete texts, but through an entire world of signal
                     and noise. Reading, according to this model, does not adhere in the least to the
                     image of immobile reader locked in to the limited space between her face and her
                     book, but is instead a kinetic, embodied, multimodal series of interactions,
                     engaging not only the centre of focus, but the peripheral vision as well. It is
                     a place not of happy accidents, but of prepared minds, where the reading process
                     is not based on an “abuse of the
                     brain” (as per the quote from Ernest Pöppel that stands at the start
                     of this article) but a harnessing of almost primal human urges to seek, to
                     gather, to organise and to narrativise.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">The conclusions that follow are based upon the results of a modest but revealing
                     ethnographic study, conducted in 2015, and known as “Scholarly Primitives and Reimagining Knowledge Led Exchanges”, or
                     SPARKLE [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2017">Edmond, Bagalkot, and O'Connor 2017</a>]. This investigation was inspired by a
                     digital humanist’s frustration: having built a tool addressing an identified
                     need of a humanities community (in this case historians with highly
                     heterogenous, dare we say disorganised, research notes), the project team was
                     somewhat surprised to find that while the result met the specifications of the
                     user community and “solved” the identified
                     “problem,” the target community of historians did not
                     love it, and reverted quickly to their messy analogue ways. Why? The answer, as
                     demonstrated by the eight hours of interviews of a range of historians (medieval
                     and modern, archaeologists, as well as literary and art historians) conducted by
                     the ensuing project, was that the mess and chaos was an inherent part of the
                     scholarly methods, it was a source of strength rather than weakness. The signal,
                     in other words, was inextricably bound up with the noise, and it was precisely
                     the capacity to be distracted that these rich environments facilitated that was
                     key to productive reading experiences.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Noise is, of course, not a phemomenon specific to the humanities. Indeed, an
                     appreciation of noise, in the form of a paradigm-changing
                     “novelty” or indeed “crisis,” can be
                     said to be at the heart of fundamental work such as Thomas Kuhn’s <cite class="title italic">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite>. In that case,
                     however, noise is a disruptor indicating a change in signal, rather than a
                     component of the context that suffuses it. Distraction in humanistic reading is
                     therefore the process by which a scholar manages to create knowledge in
                     conversation with and between sources, bringing together, disparate times and
                     places, authors and forms of source material, but also frames of reference and
                     layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as focus to find the
                     moments of serendipity that lie at the core of so many humanists’ methods.

                     for alignment like with its “brothers in meaning.” A
                     recurrent subtheme within the SPARKLE project interviews was that of clutter, a
                     nearly universal topic that was not prompted by the interview protocol in any
                     way. “[T]he problem with the desk is
                     that often you have to clear a space on it, whereas the sofa is generally
                     kept clear,” said one interviewee, while another made the very
                     insightful comment that: “my desk space
                     tends to be extremely cluttered and messy and not conducive to reading, so …
                     tend to take everything off the table and move it or try and minimise what I
                     am looking at.” The primary reason clutter seems to be such a strong
                     recurrent theme is because of the need to balance focus and attention with the
                     parallel requirement to have certain things – notes, primary or secondary source
                     materials of many types, objects, data, computer environments or tools, or
                     comfort objects such as water, coffee or a lap desk - “at hand” or “beside me.” One interviewee even described this arrangement for her
                     as “almost like a nest.”
                     “I tend not to write in … my
                     departmental office which I use more as a teaching and meeting space, even
                     though I have bookshelf space here, but I tend to write in a box room at
                     home where the stuff is very close to my desk, um, it’s not very scientific,
                     there are piles and piles of paper, the paper somehow forms a useful

                     organisation system to assist information retrieval and prepare for insight. In
                     some cases, the researchers’ understanding of this system is somewhat ad-hoc and
                     intuitive: “I don’t really have [a
                     system], I just flick - I have a good idea of the order when I did
                     something.” In most cases, however, the interviewees were very aware
                     of the underlying structure of their personal information landscape: “I break down the reading by all the
                     different topics that I’m interested in… so that when I come back to it ...I
                     have that all stored in logical chunks that will turn into chapters.”

                     optimise certain kinds of concentration and minimise certain kinds of
                     distraction. Focus is key to constructing a valid argument, but it is also an
                     efficiency concern serving the purpose of managing time constraints. Time
                     pressure was keenly felt by all of the interviewees: “…there are so many claims on my time, kind of 200%
                     claims on my time, so how can I start to segment out?” This reflects
                     Guillory’s “clock time,” but there are specific constraints
                     as well. Often these time constraints arise because of externally limited time,
                     such as the limited hours of an archive or museum, for example, which encourage
                     certain kinds of binge photography and condensed note-taking.

                     information may have as much to do with dealing with these kinds of restrictions
                     as with the nature of the loosely bounded questions and objects being pursued.
                     What might be thought the most obvious strategy for maximizing time (by focusing
                     narrowly on one project before moving on to the next) is not one that fits
                     comfortably with the humanities researcher’s modes of work. In fact the
                     researchers, in particular those at the more senior level, consistently referred
                     to the fact that they would work on several projects at the same time. While
                     this was sometimes viewed in the pejorative (“…when I was at school my Latin teacher called me a
                     ‘flibberty-jibbet’ which ...I think I still
                     am,”
                     “I like to flit around to lots of
                     different things and I try to keep my view broad,”
                     “I have too many projects on the
                     go”), it was clearly also a strategy to manage the implications of
                     potential blockages in insight, access to sources or sustained time for
                     research, ensuring that a mix of activities was available at any given time to
                     provide a good “fit” for the kind of environment, attention
                     and other cognitive resources an individual had to devote to their research.
                     Regardless of how they viewed their own management of time and space, the
                     interviewees consistently displayed a highly developed expertise in the
                     decomposition of large tasks into chunks [<a class="ref" href="#miller1956">Miller 1956</a>] or
                     microtasks [<a class="ref" href="#cheng2015">Cheng et al. 2015</a>], common recommendations for enhancing
                     productivity, but also emerging areas of interest for software developers trying
                     to produce environments and tools to support busy lives characterised by
                     information overload and distraction.

                     culture. For the scientific communities in which the term is most familiar, such
                     as the high energy physics and microbiology research teams studied by Karin
                     Knorr Cetina in her landmark ethnography of science, <cite class="title italic">Epistemic Cultures</cite>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#knorrcetina1999">Knorr Cetina 1999</a>], it takes an external form, either as a device
                     or as a documented procedure. These filters for knowledge creation, made
                     tangible, become a significant contributor to the shared lab capital, and a
                     hallmark of the overall advantage or distinctiveness one lab would have over any
                     other in their ability to produce scientifically relevant results. They also
                     provide a point of focus that can be shared by a team of collaborators, a shared
                     set of readings to define the frame of analysis, or a shared set of actions that
                     can be repeated by different individuals at different times with ostensibly
                     similar results. For the historian, the idea of using any kind of shared or
                     sharable devices or procedures in the knowledge creation process does not
                     resonate with actual practice. Instead, the process of building a scholar’s
                     apparatus is as individual (which is not to say subjective) as it is robust. An
                     appropriate mental image or metaphor for this process is not that of the lens or
                     the dissection manual, but of the dry stone wall, where building blocks of
                     irregular shapes and sizes are laid upon each other to create a matrix through
                     which, depending on its density and maturity, light or air may pass. The
                     materials of which this apparatus is made are acquired largely by reading – of
                     primary and secondary sources, of theoretical material, of foundational texts in
                     other disciplines - but, as anyone who has seen or indeed built a dry stone wall
                     will know, the strength of the construction is not just in the individual
                     stones, but in the way they intersect and lie against each other. The object of
                     reading in to the humanistic apparatus is to create spaces not where the fruits
                     of reading can be kept apart from each other, but precisely where they can
                     interact and influence thinking about each other. A number of distinct reading
                     modes are deployed to achieve this aim.

                     comprised of knowledge of the primary sources, the objects of study. Being
                     “source-led” was a point of pride for many of the
                     interviewees, and the arguments and research questions were seen by and large to
                     emerge from the direct engagement with the primary objects of study: “I don’t really arrive at the argument
                     until the evidence takes me there.” The potential for meandering
                     through a landscape of sources is inherent in this approach, but the researchers
                     also stressed the idea that a single contact with a primary source was never
                     enough to fully comprehend it: “you
                     don’t just look at something once ever;”
                     “reading it five or six times
                     over;”
                     “…doing lots of reading, but also by
                     reading it multiple times.” In most cases, this rereading is however
                     also a process with a time component to it: “ …it’s no good reading anything once … having read
                     something once you may return to it because at a later point you may find
                     it’ll solve a problem for you, or it will have a suggested
                     connection.” As implied in this quotation, the rereading process as
                     it takes place over time, bringing the same text into different jutapositions
                     and contexts within the scholar’s instrument, is widely viewed not only as
                     essential but transformative: “…that
                     involved kind of going back over some of the older stuff that I’d looked at
                     beforehand as well, oh yes very much changed the kind of thing that I was
                     looking for.”

                     research instrument is secondary research. Each researcher’s relationship with
                     their peers as it played out in part via the published scholarship of others was
                     subtly different, but each expressed some kind of strategy for striking a
                     balance between making one’s scholarship appropriately robust and spending too
                     much time reading the work of others, another more specific manifestation of
                     Guillory’s “clock time of scholarship.” The challenges
                     described there were also keenly felt by the SPARKLE interviewees: the thing
                     that “has changed most dramatically if
                     you look back 30 years is the volume of secondary literature, it’s just
                     exploding and getting faster and faster and we’re still expected to stay on
                     top of so much of it.” In spite of the challenges, however, secondary
                     literature is a key component in the humanistic instrument: without embedding
                     and contextualising within the community of practice, scholarship feels
                     insubstantial, and indeed even risky. Ensuring that this base is covered is not
                     always possible, however: “[recognition
                     of the secondary literature is] what I feel that I would need, but I
                     recognise the flaw in the piece but there’s no way that I could commit to
                     that either, so you know I gave them what I had!”

                     described was to focus on particular genres of scholarship (books being more
                     important than articles, for example), or to set a certain representative sample
                     and work within those constraints. The ideal situation, as described, was one of
                     following the trails of connections and references until reaching a point of

                     done] when you start just going round in circles… one of the things I like
                     about [conferences] is that every time you stand up in front of people
                     there’s always the opportunity for someone to say ‘ah but you haven’t read
                     X’, or you haven’t thought about Y, so that is a really important
                     part of the process to really make sure that you’ve covered all your
                     bases.” In this way, reading (and rereading) secondary material is an
                     exercise in itself, but also a part of the all-important dialogue with the
                     primary sources and the researcher’s growing understanding of them. In the
                     process of going “round and round in a
                     few circles and … reevaluating what you already think, reevaluating what
                     other people have suggested,” knowledge of the secondary research
                     provides that key layer of the documented thoughts of others. It helps to test
                     the place of pieces of evidence in an argument, and also to form the overall
                     size and shape of a work, and to contribute to what can often be long periods of
                     semi-active or even inactive gestation (quite often when another project has
                     taken over).

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">These strategies for managing the “clock time of scholarship,”
                     also impacted on the level to which the interviewees felt they could or should
                     engage with disciplines beyond their own, or with theoretical material arising
                     from another discourse, each of which has the capacity to form another layer
                     within the humanistic research instrument. For example, one established
                     researcher confessed about an interdisciplinary project: “I knew I had to be able to really try and
                     not master, but at least engage sincerely with their literature. In fact
                     given the reading I’ve done since, I’m amazed that I got away with
                     it!” Although they present a further challenge, informing one’s work
                     through interdisciplinary investigation was also seen as one of the most
                     invigorating ways to extend one’s filter for research questions: “…the thing I get a real kick out of would
                     be the things that are off to the side… the different ideas, and it is
                     challenging.” Such interactions create new layers in the scholarly
                     stone wall of independent, but integrated sources and influences from which
                     research questions and eventually scholarly output will flow.

                     however. Certain skills, often focussed quite literally on new ways to read,
                     such as paleography or languages, were key to specific disciplines or
                     approaches: “if you’re an early Irish
                     scholar, those people are much more learned than me, it takes them probably
                     a decade and a half before they can even begin - because they need to learn
                     Hiberno-Latin as well as Old Irish - as well as probably Russian, German,
                     French, maybe some Scandinavian languages … the apprenticeship is very
                     long.” The mastery of such fundamentals can be a key differentiator
                     between scholars, and will drive the definition of research questions over the
                     course of a career, as new skills open up access to new source material. They
                     also open up interesting questions about the plasticity of the mind of the
                     humanities researcher, shifting frames not only between different kinds of
                     sources, but code switching as well between distinct semiotic systems.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">Beyond this, however, external factors such as political imperatives or funding
                     priorities can also create layers that highlight attention to certain seams of
                     evidence, or encourage connections to be drawn between things that might
                     otherwise seem disparate. Across society, we can see that the personal and
                     professional spheres are collapsing in a negative way, due to the pervasive
                     influence of technology and its application as a tool for controlling (and
                     extending) labour. But the personal experiences of the scholar form a powerful
                     layer in the epistemic apparatus, and always have. This is what one interviewee
                     called “those itches you want to keep
                     scratching,”
                     “where your own subconscious urges and
                     fascinations come up,” and these may or may not have a direct
                     connection to a recognisable personal history. The personal nature of many
                     research projects is however a largely taboo subject, being viewed as
                     compromising the “objectivity” of science. Such urges can
                     also be seen differently, however, as what anthropologist Thomas Stodulka
                     characterises as a layer of the epistemic apparatus that is essential to
                     analysis, but often discounted as a distraction from objectivity: the emotional. “As embodied products of
                     researcher-researched interactions, emotions may either motivate or
                     discourage further engagement. The emotions that we express (or
                     suppress) and articulate (or mute) in the encounters with our research
                     protagonists, shape the ways in which stories are told and social
                     realities are conveyed. Ignoring the epistemic quality of emotions
                     obstructs our capacity to make valid claims about other peoples’
                     experiences, behaviors, and speech.”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#stodulka2015">Stodulka 2015</a>, 85–86] Every historian, and indeed any scholar of human culture, writes as a
                     human being born into a particular decade and a particular society, and part of
                     the context and framing of the research is most surely derived from the
                     observation of internal phenomena as well as external ones. Even when distanced
                     from their “research protagonists” by barriers of time, space
                     and culture, historians seek to engage their own experiences to build. They
                     demonstrate, as Gadamer stated it, that “Historical knowledge is a mode of
                     self understanding”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#gadamer2004">Gadamer 2004</a>, 237] and, we might add, vice versa. This aspect of how the personal influences
                     research provides for some of the most enduring fascination and utility of the
                     resulting research: “…every historian
                     writes from their own context and how we see history from one generation is
                     going to be completely different … you read … the research done in the 50s
                     and 60s and it comes with a completely different set of assumptions about
                     what’s right and what’s normal and what your basic default assumption about
                     who you are and what history is for, that tells us something about why we
                     tell and retell history. It's also how we explain us to ourselves as well
                     which makes it a really interesting conversation to be part of, ‘cause human
                     beings are creatures of narrative, really!”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">These many layers of the humanist’s instrument combine to create both a scaffold
                     and a filter for the identification of research questions and the development of
                     responses to them. The SPARKLE interviewees were able to describe the process of
                     creating and using these interconnections through reading and rereading very
                     vividly, often providing extensive narratives detailing the development of key
                     elements of their argument: how influences from other areas of study became
                     integrated with and understanding their own area of focus, or how a similar
                     methodology was applied to a different corpus; how they work through the
                     connections between both the evidence they want to present and wider
                     disciplinary trends; how they traverse within and between the layers of their
                     apparatus, knitting together notes and texts, primary and secondary sources,
                     theoretical and methodological insights, extradisciplinary material, hard won
                     archival gems and chance comments from friends and colleagues, gradually
                     resolving any doubts about the reliability of connections and conclusions. The
                     application of this method is about balancing the context in which a piece of
                     information is being situated, and the precise nature of the evidence itself,
                     moving as well between initial reading, and the creation of prosthetics to
                     prompt and promote future reading (note-taking, filing or organizing, condensing
                     information) and preparing for the next foray to gather material (following
                     footnote trails, testing resonances) all along the expected and the unexpected
                     pathways through the evidence, which may be dense and extensive or consist only
                     of fragments. “In most cases the
                     evidence is quite fragmented and you need to compile your evidence across a
                     number of archives, plus literary works, plus narrative sources, chronicles
                     and so on, so you’re building a picture.” This fragmentation, like
                     gaps in the wall, is a challenge to the epistemic authority of the scholar, but
                     it should not be allowed to become a barrier: “I go as thoroughly as I can and within the range of what I can
                     see I will gather as much information as I can before reasonably making a
                     judgement on what I think happened… And I think that’s rigorous and I think
                     sometimes more imaginative and brave or misguided than what scientists do in
                     that you’re willing to take a risk and you’re willing to roam a little more
                     freely outside of your [expertise].”

                     approach, aware that some parts of the planned route will almost surely be
                     blocked, and that their unique constellation of sources and influences may very
                     well be leading across known territory, but in a new way: “there’s a discussion in one of the chapters which ...had
                     my approach been purely literary ... possibly wouldn't have been there at
                     all.” In the end, this researcher will follow the terrain, one hand
                     or foot hold at a time, until it leads … somewhere. That somewhere, like
                     climber’s peak is often shrouded in mist, but it can be inferred - “I was fairly sure that something would be
                     produced of that that would be interesting” – but the process of
                     building some aspects of this journey can feel like “beating my head off what felt like a solid brick wall,
                     to the point where I ended up talking to a couple of lecturers within the
                     department and they were like ‘yeah theory kind of always feels like that
                     when you’re building it.’” At some point, however, momentum
                     takes over “… and then what happens is
                     that all that snowballs and gathers speed and gets to the point where you’re

                     it is the serendipity of the prepared mind that can find subtle connections
                     across space and times. “The time that you
                     have the serendipitous find may occur a year or two years after the initial
                     browse but because you’ve done that initial browse you have embedded a
                     context for later on when you meet it. I think that certainly in my type of
                     history it’s the endless building of more and more context in different
                     contexts, laterally, chronologically or conceptually, and also mining
                     downwards and piling more and more detailed evidence on top of it. I think

                     object”), searching in an electronic source (“…you could put in the thing that you’re looking for, but
                     a whole lot of other entries come up and you go, oh that looks interesting,
                     and it turns out to be a whole lot more interesting than the thing you were
                     looking for”) or through reading (“how did I find them? I found them by reading really widely…
                     How do I come by that motley crew? My own interests, my reading exposure, my
                     language limitations.”) These examples are all relatively
                     conventional in some ways, in that they are based in the experience of insight
                     coming through the finding of something new. Serendipity does not always work
                     this way, however: very often the experiences of serendipity were of ideas
                     sparking together, of connections arcing across the time from exposure to
                     moments of engagement with certain sources and ideas. Serendipity comes from
                     working through sources and absorbing them for what they are, rather than for
                     what you think you may need from them. Serendipity grows out of what you store
                     in the background of your thinking for later use. “Those moments don’t seem to come on call necessarily
                     they just seem to pop up. But the way to get them is just to sort of
                     saturate yourself in the text.” These descriptions of how insight may
                     come unbidden, but not without effort, are reminiscent of Koestler’s theory of
                     how creativity can stem from the collision between matrices of perception, which
                     end in “…laughter, or their fusion in a
                     new intellectual synthesis, or their confrontation in an aesthetic

                     method, and a cornerstone of their version of “professional seeing”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#goodwin1994">Goodwin 1994</a>]. For the historian, the peripheral vision is as important as the central
                     focus: it is here that the real connections may be found, where context is
                     preserved, and where the next projects are being scoped and tested. In many
                     interviews, seeing (or rather not seeing) became a central metaphor for the
                     limits of scholarship. In the archival context, there is an awareness that some
                     objects have been lost or removed from a collection, meaning that “there will be stuff that’s not there that
                     you’ll never see and no one else will, or there’s stuff that you won’t know
                     about.” In secondary literature, there are potential blind spots as
                     well: “I discovered that there was more
                     said, or there had been more said in other disciplines and I didn’t really
                     see.” It also can express how the scholarly method operates: “…when I sort of started seeing, when I
                     started not seeing the parts where it didn’t explain things, where it was
                     adequate but not complete, where there were lapses sort of seeing that I
                     started having a feeling that there was enough here that I could work
                     with.” But the importance of seeing for the harnessing of serendipity
                     – across interactions, across spaces, across time - was one of the most
                     interesting aspects of such utterances: “I have the kind of mind where later I think ‘oh actually those things did
                     fit together’ and I only saw it later and actually it’s only been in
                     recent years I would see myself, and … I actually think that all the things
                     I do do actually fit together, but I think there was a sort of underlying

                     does the introduction of technology into this system leave us? Do the technical

                     increasingly present in the researcher’s apparatus. Although some of the
                     interviewees would have had experience working on digital projects, none of them
                     would have self-identified as primarily a digital humanist. In spite of that,
                     they each gave a sense of how technology was influencing their work. In
                     particular for those historians who worked in archives, the ability to
                     photograph and save images of archival materials was transformative. “You notice a really big difference in
                     somewhere like Kew where you can photograph and somewhere like PRONI [Public
                     Record Office of Northern Ireland] in Belfast where you can’t. It does make
                     a huge difference in terms of the volume of material you can get through …
                     certainly dictates why certain sources are used more than others.”
                     This already ambiguous positioning of increasing access as something that not
                     only supports, but incentivises scholarly attention (potentially to the deficit
                     of other sources and collections that may reveal a different narrative) also
                     comes with a further disadvantage: although the ability to photograph sources
                     may maximise the time one spends physically in an archive (thereby also
                     maximising one’s research travel budget) it doesn’t increase one’s overall
                     available time for reading and analysing the materials captured: “…while it’s fantastic that we can now go
                     into archives and take photos of materials, there is a problem that you take
                     all these photographs and try to remember what you have, and trying to
                     remember that taking photographs of stuff is great, but you have to, you
                     also have to use the time, allocate the time to work through the
                     material.”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p29">Discussions of other technological interventions continued this theme of both
                     benefit and compromise. Laptops are ubiquitous, and often used for analysis of
                     sources or note-taking, but they are seldom seen as flexible and extensible
                     enough to be the only place for these activities: notetaking, as we have already
                     seen, is highly multimodal, and even for analysis one researcher was wishing for
                     “multiple screens.” Databases
                     were used for capturing structured information, but they had to be created for
                     the purpose, and relevant information often then was exported back out to
                     another format, such as a flat spreadsheet or pdf. Even then, one particularly
                     digital scholar commented about his method: “I think this is maybe a key point for Digital Humanities
                     that, certainly for me anyway, the first time I go through a big body of
                     evidence, the hard copy remains crucial and I still find it hard to really
                     do close reading on screen.” On-line searches through bibliographical
                     sources and repositories of scholarship were also common, in particular as a
                     starting point, but never able to support the full scholarly process: “…the jumping off point is certainly always
                     digital, and the majority of the resources that I use are digital, but again
                     I think that tends to increase as you get to know the field better, because
                     you have to read the big books and the big books are almost always in book
                     form.” The common conception of humanist scholars as luddites is
                     clearly not upheld by these accounts – instead, it seems that the available
                     tools simply aren’t up to the standards of these consummate microtaskers and
                     their highly refined, multimodal, embodied methods. As more and more disciplines
                     adopt or adapt big data approaches and methods, we can only expect this gulf to
                     become more pronounced, not only because the source material to underpin big
                     data research in the study of history seems unlikely to emerge any time soon
                     [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2016">Edmond 2016</a>], but also because of the relative diminishment
                     of context and complexity in source material big data research invariably
                     requires [<a class="ref" href="#edmond2018">Edmond et al. 2018</a>].

                     but it is also an element that its practitioners have yet to fully validate as a
                     positive rather than negative force in their knowledge capture and organisation
                     processes. A very good overview of the kinds of statements made by prominent
                     historians on their strategies can be found in Keith Thomas’ excellent diary
                     piece published in the <cite class="title italic">London Review of Books</cite> ([<a class="ref" href="#thomas2010">Thomas 2010</a>]). From clippings to the card index to various forms
                     of organisational technology, from the pigeonholed desk to the white envelope,
                     Thomas’ account is as learned and engaging as it is modest. Herein lies the
                     problem with many discussions of the humanistic method, however, namely the fact
                     that the power of the methods developed for keeping the knowledge harvested by
                     distracted reading in a state of readiness for reuse is obscured by the
                     perception of the methods as being haphazard, not meticulous, curious, outdated,
                     capricious. Many of the researchers interviewed for the SPARKLE project
                     displayed a similar lack of appreciation for the power and rigour of their
                     notetaking processes, describing their notes, for example, as “messy ways of putting things
                     together.” To truly appreciate these strategies, they must be
                     understood not just for the many things they lack, but for the power with which
                     they triangulate between the elementals of humanistic scholarship, such as
                     sources and peer opinion, and the path and cognitive strengths of the individual
                     scholar. They must also be viewed at the macro level, not just at the level of
                     the individual’s curious habits, but as an almost endless set of variations that
                     nonetheless share common goals and structures.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p31"> Scholarly distraction in reading is a powerful and productive force when guided
                     by serendipity and commitment to the values of humanistic scholarship. This is
                     not to say, however, that the epistemic process of the humanists is all
                     encompassing, and that no distractions are viewed negatively. Administrative
                     work, for example, is viewed as a “true” distraction, and
                     distractions in the synthesis and writing phases of work are viewed quite
                     differently than the unexpected appearance of an artefact of interest in a
                     scholarly reader’s peripheral vision (as any reader of popular academic social
                     media feeds such as <cite class="title italic">Shit Academics Say</cite> knows all
                     too well). But blending of the personal and the professional, the mature and the
                     new research projects, the discipline and its neighbors, and indeed the virtual
                     and the analogue all forms a part on an extensive (and, I would say, little
                     understood) system for the pursuit of insight on a relatively unbounded field of
                     enquiry. If we embrace this view of scholarly reading in the humanities as
                     distraction, then a few avenues for future exploration arise: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           First, we need new evidence and new
                           frameworks for validating the kinds of distracted reading processes
                           humanists demonstrate. For example, it might be helpful to view the
                           frame of scholarly reading not via outdated images of absorbed readers,
                           but of something broader, like, for example, a macroscope: “Macroscopes
                           provide a ‘vision of the whole,’ helping us ‘synthesize’ the related
                           elements and detect patterns, trends, and outliers while granting access
                           to myriad details. Rather than make things larger or smaller,
                           macroscopes let us observe what is at once too great, slow, or complex
                           for the human eye and mind to notice and comprehend.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p32"> In addition, validating the place of distraction in the epistemic practices of
                     the scholar can help us to understand the pedogogical place of distraction. Many
                     learners, from undergraduate students to citizen scientists, are by and large
                     more interested in creating a self through their education, than a knowledge
                     base. How can this dimension of their distraction, and the technologies that
                     enable it, be engaged? Can we not do that in the digital humanities better than
                     anywhere else? Early learning emphasises “rich environments”
                     – can we not do the same? Rather than continuing to promote the focussed reading
                     of the book list, young researchers might instead be facilitated to build their
                     own macroscopes, incorporating (though not without questioning the bias that may
                     be found there) the objects and information they discover at the peripheries of
                     their objects of enquiry.

                     also allow us to rethink humanities research infrastructure and environments.
                     The modern library, with its remote storage and electronic catalogue, is
                     bewailed by scholars as a place that diminishes the possibility for serendipity,
                     essentially by reducing distraction. But virtual environments as well suffer
                     from their impetus to centralise activities that may look haphazard, but which
                     are anything but. How do we meet what Edwards et al. defined as the true test of
                     infrastructure, that is that it get “below the level of the work,” when we have redefined what the work
                     is [<a class="ref" href="#edwards2007">Edwards et al. 2007</a>]? In her DH 2016 keynote address, Claire Warwick,
                     asked her audience to imagine new environments for research, ones that might
                     facilitate the humanist and her sources without organising them too strictly.
                     For this vision to become a reality, we will need first to embrace the true
                     nature of the humanists’ distracted journey through the rich environments of
                     knowledge inextricably bound up with the the study of human culture and society.
