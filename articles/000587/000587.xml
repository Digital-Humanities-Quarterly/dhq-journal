               of digital resource consumption and global social equity (Sayers 2016).<note> I would

               architectures, minimalist computing principles work to ensure that the world is not
               falsely separated into a ‘gGlobal “expert” North and a Gglobal “apprentice” South’,
               in which those with resources merely export digital expertise outwards from a claimed
               center to the supposed margins (Gil and Ortega 2016, 29, 23). Minimalist
               computational principles are designed for inclusivity.</p>
            <p> By contrast, contemporary models of scholarly communication — – the composite
               systems through which academics and other intellectuals disseminate their findings
               for global consumption — – appear to be the opposite of minimalist. They cover a full
               and ever-expanding disciplinary range, from natural scientific outputs, tothrough
               humanistic arguments, to social scientific research. Their social processes and
               techniques are vast, involving peer review systems, citations, references, and
               footnotes (Grafton 1999; Fyfe Aileen 2015; Moxham and Fyfe 2018). The technical
               elements of such systems also tend to proliferate, including platforms, persistent
               identifiers, XML standards, digital preservation systems, and manuscript management
               technologies (Gray 2020; Andrews 2020). </p>
            <p>The costs involved in these dissemination systems are also maximal. Since the 1980s,
               rising in line with the expansion of higher education, the cost of subscribing to
               academic serials has outpaced inflation by approximately 6% every year (Bosch and
               Henderson 2018), while library budgets have faced cuts or remained flat (Jurchen
               2020, 161). Over forty years, this amounts to a several- hundredfold price increase.
               A discourse of maximalism and growth seems omnipresent in scholarly
               communications.</p>
            <p> These maximalist principles in scholarly communications have resulted in well-known
               damaging consequences and inequalities. For instance, Thomas Mboa Nkoudou notes the
               spread of an “‘epistemic alienation”’ when researchers at the “‘margins” ’ of the
               Global North’s publication systems must conform to external pressures and norms (Mboa
               Nkoudou 2020). As another example, peer review is supposed to be a system that
               distinguishes work based solely on meritsolely merit rather than any identity
               characteristic of the author. However, criticscritiques of this system note that
               pre-publication peer review has distorting effects of bias towards sensationalist
               claims and <note>
                  <date when="2021-10-12T11:40:00Z"/>Sensationalist claims doesn't seem to relate to
                  the argument here.</note>favors those for whom English is their first language
               (Moore et al. 2017; Eve et al. 2021). Further evidence of biases from peer review
               includes the extraordinary fact that just 1.5% of economics articles in highly ranked
               journals were about countries other than the United States (Das et al. 2013, 112;
               Roh, Inefuku, and Drabinski 2020, 43). </p>
            <p> The spiraling, maximalist costs of the for-profit subscription scholarly publication
               ecosystem also price out much of the world’s population (Kapczynski and Krikorian
               2010; Andročec 2017; Boudry et al. 2019). It is in part this inequality that has
               spurred the ‘open access’ movement (OA) forto research work, which seeks to abolish
               paywalls (Chan et al. 2002; ‘Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the
               Sciences and Humanities’ 2003; Suber et al. 2003; Fitzpatrick 2011; Suber 2012; Eve
               2014). Yet even this movement has come under fire. Built on the premise that nobody,
               worldwide, should be excluded from access to the scholarly record by their
               (in)ability to pay and that the benefits of re-use should be broadly extended to
               third parties using Creative Commons licenses, the road to OA was paved with noble
               intentions. As Ulrich Herb notes, open access was originally “‘embedded in a
               conceptual ensemble of participation, democratisation, digital commons and equality”’
               (Herb 2018, 69). However, parts of this vision have died over time. “‘Nowadays,”’,
               Herb writes, “‘Oopen access seems to be exclusive: to the extent that commercial
               players have discovered it as a business model and article fees have become a
               defining feature of gold open access, open access has increasingly transformed into a
               distinguishing feature and an exclusive element”’ (Herb 2018, 69).</p>
            <p> Thus, the contemporary scholarly communications environment has many defects that
               pertain to inequality and that intersect with its maximalist characteristics. Given
               the goals of minimalist computing, rooted in equity and diversity, might it be
               possible for our scholarly communications to learn from such principles? Is there a
               way in which ideas of “‘scaling small”’ (Adema and Moore 2021) might help these
               systems to contend, as Roopika Risam puts it, “‘Nnot only with the colonial hangovers
               from the cultural record, but also with forces that are actively constructing the
               medium of the digital cultural record — –the internet — –as a hostile environment,”’
               as Roopika Risam puts it (Risam 2018, 6)?</p>
            <p> In the remainder of this article I turn to a specific illicit scholarly
               communications practice that has emerged in recent years: the idea of the “‘pirate”’
               shadow library. These archives, which violate copyright, work around paywalls and
               provide access to all comers. Although frequently on the wrong side of the law,
               shadow library operators conceive of their sites in ethical terms. Framing their
               banditry in terms of a Robin Hood-esque outfit, such sites believe they are robbing
               from the rich to give to the scholarly poor (Faust 2016).<note> (See also Hobsbawm
                  1981.)</note>. See also Hobsbawm 1981). Importantly for the themes of this special
               issue of<hi rend="italic"> DHQ</hi>, I believe that such archives can also be
               understood in certain terms of computational minimalism. As I will go on to detail,
               various technical design principles of these archives lower social barriers to
               participation. This article thus sets out a fresh theoretical terrain for
               understanding what I call “‘minimal-maximal tensions””’ in computational
               architectures and projects. While this discourse is rooted in older information
               technology debates about microkernels versuss macro -kernels (Tanenbaum and Torvalds
               2008), through my case study of Library Genesis — – the shadow library that is the
               main focus of this article — – I seek to unpack a new framework for thinking about
               the relationships between minimal components and maximal outcomes. While Library
               Genesis seeks to “‘shadow”’ an enormous archive, the constraints under which it
               operates lead to a series of unexpected minimalist design principles.</p>
            <div>
               <head>The Growth and Emergence of Shadow Libraries</head>
               <p>Shadow libraries — – pirate archives of copyrighted scholarly publications — –
                  emerged in response to a frustration at the slow growth of open access (Green
                  2017; Brembs 2020). Nonetheless, open- -access advocates remain divided as to
                  whether these “‘guerilla” ’ libraries are a solution to, or merely a symptom of,
                  the ills of scholarly communication (Swartz 2015; Hockenberry 2013; Faust 2016;
                  Machin-Mastromatteo, Uribe-Tirado, and Romero-Ortiz 2016). The two most famous
                  (and interlinked) of these systems for illicit access to pirate scholarship as of
                  2021 are Sci-Hub and Library Genesis.</p>
               <p> The former, Sci-Hub, is a credential-proxying site that bypasses publisher
                  paywalls, primarily for journal articles. Founded by Alexandra Elbakyan in 2011,
                  the site has grown to provide access to at least 68.9% of the 81.6 million
                  scholarly articles registered with Crossref and to 85.1% of all articles published
                  in subscription journals (Himmelstein et al. 2018). The site is based in
                  Kazakhstan, which introduces complex jurisdictional legal issues. It works by
                  collecting credentials from academic institutions, possibly by conducting phishing
                  attacks (Russell and Sanchez 2017). These credentials are then used to fetch any
                  article requested by an end-user. In order to reduce the number of requests to
                  publishers’ sites — – and thereby evade detection and a ban on its credentials — –
                  Sci-Hub caches fetched journal articles in an archive called Library Genesis.
                  Sci-Hub has faced and lost several court cases, particularly in the U.S.A where
                  the publisher Elsevier has been awarded millions of dollars in damages
                  (Schiermeier 2017). Because the site sits outside of U.S. jurisdiction and because
                  Elbakyan has no means of paying such damages, it is unlikely that publishers will
                  see any financial return from these lawsuits. Nonetheless, for much of 2021,
                  Elbakyan paused the ingestion of new articles while awaiting the results of a
                  court case in India, which could rule in Sci-Hub’s favor (Reddy and Mishra
                  2021).</p>
               <p> Library Genesis, by contrast, is the largest and oldest shadow archive on the
                  internet. WithAt over thirty-three terabytes of data in its primary book
                  collection (and with more than sixty terabytes in its pool of scientific journal
                  articles powered by its aforementioned sister project, Sci-Hub), the project is
                  one of the largest repositories of copyright-violating educational ebooks ever
                  created (Bodó, Antal, and Puha 2020). Established over a decade ago <note>

                     dating the article.</note>in 2008, the goal of Library Genesis is nothing short
                  of a totalizing modern Library of Alexandria, albeit without anyone’s legal
                  sanction. As one of its administrators wrote, emphasizing its extra-legal, yet
                  claimed moral and ethical, status: “w‘[W]within decades, generations of people
                  everywhere in the world will grow up with access to the best scientific texts of
                  all time. [...] [T]he quality and accessibility of education to the poor will grow
                  dramatically too. Frankly, I see this as the only way to naturally improve
                  mankind: we need to make all the information available to them at any time”’ (Bodó
                  2018b, 25).<note> It is worth noting that some of the secondary accounts of
                     Library Genesis can tip over into hagiographic commentary, an angle that I seek
                     here to avoid here.</note> Philosophically rooted in the its homeland’s Russian
                  communist principles of its homeland, Russia, and particularly in the Soviet
                  isolationist copyright policies of the twentieth century (Bodó 2018b), Library
                  Genesis is a formidable resource and a large-scale threat to conventional academic
                  publishers (Green 2017).</p>
               <p> Shadow libraries differ in their models, usage patterns, and effects. The
                  Z-library system, for instance, charges for specific formats, such as Amazon
                  Kindle conversion (Dulong de Rosnay 2021). Other pirate libraries such as Library
                  Genesis have no charges at all and their funding mechanisms are unknown, leading
                  to accusations of state subterfuge, (although they do use advertising . (Harris
                  and Barrett 2019). While the total percentage of the market eaten by piracy is
                  unknown, in the general e-book space some studies have shown as that as many as
                  35.1% of books are downloaded illegally (Camarero, Antón, and Rodríguez 2014).
                  What is clear from existing studies of Library Genesis is that it is used by
                  participants worldwide, including inby the wealthier regions of the Global North
                  (Bohannon 2016; Till et al. 2019). Various studies have also shown a citation
                  advantage to papers that appear in Sci-Hub (Correa et al. 2021). However,
                  consideringHowever considering the prevalence of material in this archive, this
                  effect could have been simply be due to the difficulty ofin obtaining the original
                  papers.</p>
               <p> Given that Sci-Hub and Library Genesis are <hi rend="italic">shadows</hi> of the
                  formalised academic publication system, we might expect them to share the
                  maximalist tendencies of mainstream scholarly communications systems. These
                  libraries are, indeed, enormous. Yet what it means to be a “‘shadow”’ has changed
                  over time. It was not until the 18th century that the shadow becamebecomes defined
                  as the colorless inverse image of the object itself. Before this point, shadows
                  were represented, in art and heraldry, as a partial transparency and outline. In
                  heraldic terms, shadows representrepresented at this time an outlined shape that
                  reveals a hidden part of the family tree, not a mirror of it (Pastoureau 2003, 26–2<note>
                     <date when="2021-09-22T14:26:00Z"/>not sure if this is correct</note>7). That
                  is, shadows can be seen as a shameful family link, rather than a precise formal
                  reflection, and such a history reminds us, as Nanna Bonde Thylstrup puts it, of
                  the “‘inherently unstable form of shadow libraries as a cultural construct”’
                  (Thylstrup 2018, 98). In this light, there are several characteristics of shadow
                  libraries that present minimalist design principles and that we can take as
                  refractive and instructive lenses for understanding mainstream practices.</p>

               <head>Minimalist Shadows</head>
               <p>Just what, then, is minimalist about these shadow libraries? Certainly, they are
                  minimalist in terms of the ‘“minimal barriers”’ that they present to their
                  readership for access to scholarly publications. In eliminating paywalls and
                  presenting only a flat search box, with no authentication mechanisms, Sci-Hub and
                  Library Genesis are far simpler than the systems used by formal publishers. By
                  contrast, these archives are<hi rend="italic"> not</hi> minimal in terms of the
                  ‘“minimal space”’ that they consume (Sayers 2016). Nonetheless, I will argue that
                  we can understand shadow libraries in minimal terms along a number of axes:
                  minimalist surface exposure, minimalist metadata design principles, and minimalist
                  distributional principles. I will cover each of these in turn, primarily with
                  respect to Library Genesis.</p>
               <p> To begin with the minimal surface exposure of the site, as a highly illegal,
                  copyright-violating initiative that also wants to achieve worldwide transformation
                  of educational potential, Library Genesis finds itself in a minimal-maximal double
                  bind. On the one hand, it must remain difficult to access, hidden, and must lie
                  low to evade law enforcement. It must be a resource with a minimal surface. On the
                  other hand, to achieve its stated goals, this resource must be accessible and
                  known to as many people as possible. This double bind is not unique to these
                  libraries. Similar minimal-maximal tensions exist within legal digital social
                  justice projects that seek to criticize powerful governmental norms, such as the
                  Global Detention Project. Such platforms are not illegal like , as is Library
                  Genesis, but they seek to criticize often-hostile regimes for a broad audience
                  while avoidingnot welcoming tyrannical government crackdowns. </p>
               <p> Nonetheless, Library Genesis has several technical hurdles to overcome in its
                  quest to retain its minimal surface presence on the internet. Two of these are the
                  use of the Domain Name System (DNS) and the threat of (distributed) denial of
                  service (DDOS) attacks. On the first of these fronts, to provide a memorable
                  location for the archive, Library Genesis uses DNS (Mockapetris 1987). This is the
                  system that translates an address such as gen.lib.rus.ec into an Internet Protocol
                  (IP) address (198.167.223.167, for example). This is a useful system because IP
                  addresses are not easily memorable for humans. However, DNS addresses are subject
                  to takedowns and blocking by Internet Service Providers (ISP). That is, if an
                  allegedly infringed party can persuade a court of law or an ISP that a site’s sole
                  purpose is copyright infringement, the domain name (or IP address) can be blocked
                  for large swathes of users (Bambauer 2012). It is, of course, possible to
                  circumvent such blocks by a variety of techniques, such as not least the trivial
                  the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that routes traffic through a different
                  ISP in a friendlier jurisdiction. Systems such as The Onion Router (TorOR) (Tor)
                  are another way of evading thesesuch blocks (Farnan, Darer, and Wright 2019).</p>
               <p> Library Genesis plays the gamesthea games of whack-a-mole and , or hide-and-seek,
                  with respect to DNS (Schiermeier 2015). Its mirrors rapidly switch between
                  addresses in an attempt to avoid takedowns (Sar 2015). Given the international
                  jurisdictional challenges, it is very hard for countries that <hi rend="italic">do
                  </hi>care about copyright infringement to shut down Library Genesis permanently.
                  The distributed nature of DNS acts in the interests of projects such as Library
                  Genesis as it is simply impossible, at present, to garner the level of
                  international legal compliance that would be necessary to shut down its DNS
                  records permanently. Advances in DNS privacy and encryption are only likely to
                  make this problem more difficult to combat.<note> See, for instance, Schmitt,
                     Edmundson, and Feamster 2018.</note> (see, for instance, Schmitt, Edmundson,
                  and Feamster 2018). That said, Library Genesis also has a communication problem
                  with respect to DNS. If the goal of DNS is to provide memorable addressesing for
                  sites on the internet then changing these addresses within a narrow time window
                  frustrates the ultimate purpose of the system. Sites such as Rreddit — – a
                  contemporary bulletin board system — – serve to spread news of new DNS mirrors,
                  but, of course, once these addresses are public, the takedown process can begin
                  anew. It is a war of attrition and, thus far, Library Genesis is winning the war
                  through its guerilla tactics.</p>
               <p> The small visible central surface of sites such as Library Genesis, only
                  accessible through circumvention technologies such as VPNs, reflects a phenomenon
                  seen in Alternate Reality Games (ARGs). Such hiddenness is characteristic of ARGs,
                  which often have obscure entry points, conventionally referred to as “‘rabbit
                  holes’”:; points of ingress that lure in new users searching for clues (Szulborski
                  2005, 49). For Garcia and Niemeyer, “‘a ‘“good’” rabbit hole is one that, for
                  those not looking for clues, blends into the background and noise of the world” ’
                  (Garcia and Niemeyer 2017, 15). An example of how Library Genesis seeds such a
                  trail, rather than blatantly advertising itself, can be seen in its metadata.
                  Searching for “‘Library Genesis”’ on Google yields a link but its description only
                  reads, “‘Nno information is available for this page’.” Additionally, tThe site
                  does not feature in the top results of “‘download scientific books for free”’.
                  Instead, one needs to be told about the site and thento visit it directly.</p>
               <p> This minimal surface principle is also clear in the site’s upload procedures,
                  which intersect with its minimal metadata implementations. Although Library
                  Genesis has a prominent ‘upload’ link on its homepage, it requires a password to
                  proceed. This gives the impression that uploading is a private activity, conducted
                  only by an elite cadre of individuals who know the magic word.<note> For more on
                     passwords, see Eve 2016.</note> (for more on passwords, see Eve 2016). In
                  reality, though, users who follow the ‘“rabbit hole”’ into the ‘“forum”’ on the
                  site and then register can readily find the requisite username and password to
                  begin uploading.</p>
               <p> There are several reasons why Library Genesis presents such a minimal surface.
                  While, surely, the core reason for Library Genesis’s minimal surface is its
                  illegality, this feature also lowers the potential for rights-holders to flood the
                  site with false metadata and uploads. Indeed, the gravest threat to Library
                  Genesis’s operation would be contamination of its records with inaccurate files,
                  which could cause a denial-of-servicedenial- of service attack against the
                  archive. While the simple reasonanswer is that all uploads must be vetted, it
                  would also be surprising if the use of thethis password would seriously deters a
                  concerted effort to pollute the library<note>

                  </note>. As we will also see, though, the minimalist metadata principles of
                  Library Genesis actively <hi rend="italic">encourage</hi> participation.</p>
               <p> In terms of minimal metadata, it is worth first considering the scale of Library
                  Genesis. The main Library Genesis database collection had just short of 1.2
                  million records (books) in 2014 (Bodó 2018a, 53). As of January 2020, this
                  capacity had more thanover doubled to 2.5 million books. Clearly, a database of
                  epistemological dissent at this size and with this scale of growth requires a
                  lightweight — – or, as we might say, ‘“<hi rend="italic">minimal</hi>”’ — –
                  metadata scheme if it is not to collapse under the strain of its size. Although
                  the ext2 and ext3 filesystems that were commonly used on Linux systems at the time
                  of the database’s inception have a sizablesizeable upper limit of 1.3×1020 files
                  per directory, there are known performance issues in handling more than 10,000
                  (Poirier 2001). There are also issues of integrity monitoring at this scale. When
                  dealing with 2.5 million records, how can one ensure that physical media
                  degradation — “bit rot” — does not lead to corrupted files on the disk <note>

                  not come to light for substantial periods? That said, the scale of Library Genesis
                  pales in comparison to when compared with formal archives. For instance, a report
                  from 2009 noted that there are over 9,000 missing volumes in the British Library’s
                  main collection, illustrating that this problem exists in both the legal and
                  illegal spaces (Dawar and Kennedy 2009). The British Library is also substantially
                  larger than Library Genesis, with a main collection of approximately 170 million
                  items total and 13.5 million books, with a digital collection that is over a
                  petabyte in size (“‘Facts and Figures of the British Library”’ 2020).</p>
               <p> Library Genesis is an enormous archive in terms of total size (maximal), but it
                  is composed of files that are relatively small (minimal). The average (mean) file
                  size in the database is 13.90MB,in 13.90MB with a significant portion of these
                  files being less than 5MB. The file size distribution varies for the different
                  file types within the database. Despite the accessibility challenges of the format
                  — – certainly, the Portable Document Format (PDF)s isare not the best format for
                  screen readers, for instance — – Portable Document Format (PDFs) dominates the
                  archive. For PDFs (n=1,697,927), for instance, the tail is longer to trail off and
                  the average file size is higher at 16.49MB. By contrast, EPUB (n=179,926; average:
                  7.32 MB) and Mobi (n=23,947; average: 4.33MB) bring the mean file sizes down as
                  they can jettison the formatting information inherent in PDF files. Nonetheless,
                  with this volume of small files, addressability is a core performance concern.</p>
               <p> The solution that Library Genesis devised for handling such a vast, proliferating
                  archive composed of relatively small files is based on minimalist principles of
                  metadata, distribution, and hashing. Files are <hi rend="italic">distributed</hi>
                  over multiple directories (calledtermed ‘“buckets”’) while being referenced within
                  a database that includes metadata about the file, as well as but also a
                  message-digest algorithm v5 (MD5) hash n MD5 (message-digest algorithm v5) hash of
                  the file, which serves as a filename. There are 47 metadata fields within the
                  database for each entry,: ID, Title, VolumeInfo, Series, Periodical, Author, Year,
                  Edition, Publisher, City, Pages, PagesInFile, Language, Topic, Library, Issue,

                  Importantly, though, very few of these fields are <hi rend="italic">required</hi>.
                  The subset that are absolutely necessary are kept to a minimum.</p>
               <p> The first of these categories — – file and record information — – pertains to
                  local lookup of the file. For instance, to retrieve a local file for a record, one
                  simply divides the ID field by 1,000 to get the bucket directory, then retrieves
                  the object with the specified ‘MD5’ record from that directory (e.g.
                  “‘243000/9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6”’). To specify the content type, a user
                  can append the “E<note>
                     <date when="2021-09-22T15:24:00Z"/>be consistent with capitalization for field
                     types. either case is probably fine</note>‘extension”’ field (e.g. “‘pdf”’ or
                  “‘epub”’) to the delivered file (and could also infer the multipurpose internet
                  mail extensions or MIME type if necessary). In addition to using the “‘Filesize”’
                  field to check a download, it is also possible to , at any time totime, to verify
                  that the contents of the file have not been corrupted at any time. This
                  verification is achieved by computing the file’s MD5 hash and then comparing this
                  to the database/filename. Although MD5 is a very old (and possibly even
                  ‘“broken”’) hashing algorithm, it has a 1.47x10-29 chance of a random collision
                  (that is, of two files sharing the same hash) (Ramirez 2015). There are no two
                  records within the Library Genesis database that share an MD5 hash as of March 1,
                  the 1st March 2020.<note> This was verified by the MySQLmysql query: ‘SELECT MD5,
                     COUNT(MD5) FROM updated GROUP BY MD5 HAVING COUNT(MD5) &gt; 1;’.</note>
                  Nonetheless, the subdivision into ‘“bucket”’ directories of 1,000 files makes the
                  on-disk likelihood of two files sharing a hash/filename extremely unlikely and
                  further reduces this risk. The verification algorithm means that the detection of
                  corrupt files can be handled automatically rather than on a “‘reporting’ basis”
                  from users (although computing all MD5 hashes in the database is a computationally
                  demanding task given the scale). These field and record information fields are the
                  bare minimum required to retrieve a file from the filestore.</p>
               <p> The second category of metadata field — – file and record properties — – gives
                  specific metadata for a record, such as. For instance, the work’s title and the
                  authors. <note>

                     <date when="2021-10-13T09:22:00Z"/>Thank you</note>Interestingly, for the
                  principles of minimal computational design, the database does not store authors in
                  a structured and linked form, but rather as free-text. Traditionally, if one were
                  designing a relational database where an author could be ascribed to more than one
                  book, one would create a separate database table called “‘author”’ that had
                  properties such as “‘first name,”’, “‘last name,”’, and “‘ORCID ID,”,’ and then,
                  in the “‘books”’ table, link to the author. This would create a mechanism to query
                  an author called, say, “‘Joe Bloggs,”’ and to retrieve all books written by that
                  specific Joe Bloggs. Such a schema would provide high-quality structured data.
                  This is not what Library Genesis does. Instead, it simply stores author names as
                  “‘plaintext.”..’ Sometimes this means that authors and editors are listed in a
                  long string, and it is not clear whether authors of the same name are the same
                  person.</p>
               <p> Such an approach comes with several minimalist computational advantages. The
                  clearest of these are: (1)1. that there is no need to maintain the structural

                  Library Genesis lowers both the computational requirements for maintenance and the
                  barriers for entry/participation by allowing freeform textual input. Given the

                  further minimalist design principles. Instead of storing all metadata locally, the
                  database points to offsite management of such data, allowing for others, likely
                  specialists, to focus entirely on metadata curation, collection, and provision.
                  While this carries some initial lookup overhead for the pirate entering the data,
                  the labor of maintaining this metadata is then outsourced and can be resolved on
                  demand. This all points towards a minimalist labor approach and an awareness that
                  by lowering the threshold for participating to the minimum, the maximalist goals
                  of the project are more likely to be achieved.</p>
               <p> If Library Genesis encodes many of its minimalist functions in its metadata
                  design principles, its distributional characteristics are also emblematic of such
                  operations. The distributional minimalism principle can be seen in discussions
                  about the preservation of the archive and the future of sites such as Library
                  Genesis. </p>
               <p> On the first front of digital preservation, — – the challenge is that this is
                  archive is maximal, not minimal. A reasonable cost estimate for simply the hard
                  disks to mirror the entire 33TB archive as of March 2020 is $1,200. This does not
                  includes neither redundancy in terms of drive failure nor the server hardware in
                  which the hard drives would be housed. In terms of minimal cost scaling, the sheer
                  size of the archive makes for a difficult environment if the local copy is to be
                  complete and usable.</p>
               <p> That said, full preservation in every replica may not be the aim of distribution,
                  and it is of course possible for partial replicas of the database to exist
                  worldwide (Menasché et al. 2013; Neglia et al. 2007). Clients such as aria2 also
                  make it possible to download a single file from a torrent swarm, which in theory
                  makes single books within the Library Genesis archive addressable and retrievable
                  in distributed form. However, the torrent swarm is not ideal for Library Genesis’s
                  use case. Anybody seeding on the network will have an exposed IP address, and it
                  will be clear that they are participating, with legal risk. For this reason it is
                  likely that many users in the swarm will be connecting using VPNs or so-called
                  seedboxes (remote high-bandwidth servers) in order not only to protect their
                  identity, but also to ensure the efficient, high-speed distribution of the
                  material.</p>
               <p> Indeed, in late 2019, coordinating around a pirate archiving initiative known as
                  “‘The Eye,”’ a group of individuals took it upon themselves to ensure the full
                  torrent availability of the Library Genesis filestore. Under this initiative,
                  “‘swarm peers increased from 3,000 seeders to 30,000 seeders,”’ and “‘speeds
                  increased from about 60KB/s on most torrents to over 100MB/s”’ (u/shrine 2020).
                  The users who undertook this illegal initiative viewed their work as
                  “‘charitable,”’ presumably under the rubric of “‘educational advancement,” ’ which
                  has long held eleemosynary status in many jurisdictions. TFor t<note>

                  2019). That said, the torrent archive is not viewed as a long-term viable
                  mechanism for distribution, according to these individuals: “‘It obviously isn't
                  sane to store 33TB long-term, we just want to push this out to archivers”’

               <p> A potentially more viable distribution, storage, and retrieval mechanism proposed
                  for Library Genesis could be the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)) protocol
                  (Rahalkar and Gujar 2020). IPFS presents an addressable, distributed system in

               <p>IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with
                  content addressed hyper links [sic]. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data
                  structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a
                  Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable<note>

               <p> IPFS does not address the anonymity of nodes that participate, meaning that it

                  legal implications. Such problems could, again, be mitigated by the use of
                  anonymity networks such as TorOR. The scalability of IPFS to 33TB of material,
                  spread over 2.5 or so million unique entities of small file sizes is also
                  unproven. An intermediate address lookup table would be needed to translate
                  between the Library Genesis structure and any IPFS version of the platform.

               <p>Throughout this Library Genesis case study, Although this article has been a study
                  of the pirate scholarly communication archive, Library Genesis, I have been
                  proposing a aproposing, throughout, a framework for thinking about minimal-maximal
                  tensions. It is tempting to consider minimalist computing paradigms as the
                  opposite to proliferating maximal systems. In reality, instead, minimalist
                  paradigms can work as fragments of a distributed whole; this is <note>

                  lessons that we can learn from the pirate archive.</p>
               <p> These debates are not, also, abstract, for scholarly communications. At present,
                  various research funders across the globe are embarking on the establishment of
                  their own platforms, to replace the journal ecosystem. Spurred by the same
                  motivations as Library Genesis and Sci-Hub — – the slower-than-desired growth of
                  open access — – the Open Research Europe, Wellcome Open Research, and Gates Open
                  Research platforms represent significant centralizations of research outputs under
                  funder control, as opposed to a distributed journal publishing architecture. These
                  platforms, running on the for-profit F1000 platform owned by Taylor &amp; Francis,
                  bill themselves as “‘megajournals,”’ following the terminology developed by the
                  world’s largest journal, <hi rend="italic">PLOS -ONE</hi>. </p>
               <p> There are many competing interests in these systems. <note>

                  licenses that allow for de-centralization and micro/minimal circulation.</p>
               <p> Library Genesis also yields to us various principles of participation and
                  consumption that are minimal in their design, even while they yield access to a
                  maximal resource. By requiring only the minimum of metadata provision, Library
                  Genesis lowers barriers to participation, an aspect also bolstered by the
                  off-shoring and distribution of its identifier systems. In terms of consumption,
                  the single search box that returns all results for everything, ever, represents a
                  maximal centralization. In terms of ease of use and accessibility, this
                  one-stop-shop demonstrates a concision and minimalism that is lacking in most
                  scholarly communications systems.</p>
               <p> Finally, Library Genesis demonstrates a minimally exposed <note>

                  that there are huge implications for legitimate scholarly communications
                  infrastructures or ‘lessons to be learned’ from this. The more people have access
                  to scholarship and research, the better. The minimally exposed surface of the
                  shadow archive is precisely — and only — because it must remain hidden. The strait
                  that this archive must navigate, though, is the space between its maximal presence
                  and its minimal entrance, ; the rabbit holes of the alternate reality game.
                  scene.</p>
               <p> Nonetheless, in all, I have attempted in this article to document several
                  features of Library Genesis that serve as an index of minimal-maximal
                  infrastructures. At least some of these features could be adopted by mainstream
                  scholarly communications providers to increase not only the resilience of, but
                  also global equity of access to, our publication ecosystems. While shadows are not
                  equal to mirrors, in these senses I contend that there are lessons to be learned
                  from the (shadow) library.</p>
