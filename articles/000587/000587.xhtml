                  <h2>Abstract</h2>


                  <p>At 33TB of data in its main collection, the highly illegal Library Genesis
                     project is one of the largest repositories of copyright-violating educational
                     ebooks ever created. Established over a decade ago in 2008 the goal of Library
                     Genesis is nothing short of a modern Library of Alexandria, albeit without
                     anyone’s legal sanction. As one of its administrators wrote: “within decades,
                     generations of people everywhere in the world will grow up with access to the
                     best scientific texts of all time. [...] [T]he quality and accessibility of
                     education to the poor will grow dramatically too. Frankly, I see this as the
                     only way to naturally improve mankind: we need to make all the information
                     available to them at any time” [<a class="ref" href="#bodo2018b">Bodó
                     2018b</a>]. Rooted in its homeland’s Russian communist principles and
                     particularly the Soviet isolationist copyright policies of the twentieth
                     century, LibGen is a formidable resource and threat to conventional academic
                     publishers.</p>

                  <p>The Library Genesis database had just short of 1.2m records (books) in 2014 [<a
                        class="ref" href="#bodo2018a">Bodó 2018a</a>]. As of January 2020, this
                     capacity has doubled to 2.5m books. In this article, I examine the minimalist
                     computational design choices taken by this maximal-in-intent, illicit archive
                     of epistemological dissent and how such decisions have shaped the scalability
                     and growth of the platform. This includes LibGen’s numerical subdivision of
                     record identifiers into ‘buckets’ to work around directory file limitations in
                     the GNU/Linux operating system; its use of md5 hashing of filenames within
                     directories capped at 1,000 files to avoid future hashing collisions while
                     allowing for on-disk integrity checking; and its use of the MySQL
                     socket/network server as opposed to SQLite or similar disk-based database.</p>

                  <p>Beyond these computational details, though, the theoretical tension that this
                     article highlights is the path dependencies that are set in (illegal)
                     computational projects that have goals of absolute abundance and maximalist
                     capacity, and the minimalist design principles that they must instigate at the
                     outset to ensure a degree of scalability. I also query the ways in which the
                     project’s contested mission statements target an economic (geographic) audience
                     demographic with only minimalist access to high-capacity computing resources. I
                     finally examine the limits on scalability of the distribution of the Library
                     Genesis through its torrent archive and other distributed networking
                     technologies such as IFS, which despite their promise of peer-to-peer
                     redundancy fall down on an archive of this size.</p>

                     work to ensure that the world is not falsely separated into a Global “expert”
                     North and a Global “apprentice” South, in which those with resources merely
                     export digital expertise outwards from a claimed center to the supposed margins

                     the opposite of minimalist. They cover a full and ever-expanding disciplinary
                     range, from natural scientific outputs, to humanistic arguments, to social
                     scientific research. Their social processes and techniques are vast, involving

                     technical elements of such systems also tend to proliferate, including

                     also maximal. Since the 1980s, rising in line with the expansion of higher
                     education, the cost of subscribing to academic serials has outpaced inflation
                     by approximately 6% every year [<a class="ref" href="#bosch2018">Bosch and

                     communications have resulted in well-known damaging consequences and
                     inequalities. For instance, Thomas Mboa Nkoudou notes the spread of an
                     “epistemic alienation” when researchers at the “margins” of the Global North’s
                     publication systems must conform to external pressures and norms [<a

                     example, peer review is supposed to be a system that distinguishes work based
                     solely on merit rather than any identity characteristic of the author. However,
                     critics of this system note that pre-publication peer review favors those for

                     evidence of biases from peer review includes the extraordinary fact that just
                     1.5% of economics articles in highly ranked journals were about countries other
                     than the United States [<a class="ref" href="#das2013">Das et al.

                     inequality that has spurred the open access movement (OA) for research, which

                     that nobody, worldwide, should be excluded from access to the scholarly record
                     by their (in)ability to pay and that the benefits of re-use should be broadly
                     extended to third parties using Creative Commons licenses, the road to OA was
                     paved with noble intentions. As Ulrich Herb notes, open access was originally
                     “embedded in a conceptual ensemble of participation, democratisation, digital
                     commons and equality” [<a class="ref" href="#herb2018">Herb 2018</a>, 69].
                     However, parts of this vision have died over time. “Nowadays,” Herb writes,
                     “Open access seems to be exclusive: to the extent that commercial players have
                     discovered it as a business model and article fees have become a defining
                     feature of gold open access, open access has increasingly transformed into a
                     distinguishing feature and an exclusive element” [<a class="ref"

                     environment has many defects that pertain to inequality and that intersect with
                     its maximalist characteristics. Given the goals of minimalist computing, rooted
                     in equity and diversity, might it be possible for our scholarly communications
                     to learn from such principles? Is there a way in which ideas of “scaling small”

                     hangovers from the cultural record, but also with forces that are actively
                     constructing the medium of the digital cultural record — the internet — as a
                     hostile environment” [<a class="ref" href="#risam2018">Risam

                     illicit scholarly communications practice that has emerged in recent years: the
                     idea of the “pirate” shadow library. These archives, which violate copyright,
                     work around paywalls and provide access to all comers. Although frequently on
                     the wrong side of the law, shadow library operators conceive of their sites in
                     ethical terms. Framing their banditry in terms of a Robin Hood-esque outfit,
                     such sites believe they are robbing from the rich to give to the scholarly poor
                        [<a class="ref" href="#faust2016">Faust 2016</a>] (see also [<a class="ref"
                        href="#hobsbawm1981">Hobsbawm 1981</a>]). Importantly for the themes of this
                     special issue, I believe that such archives can also be understood in certain
                     terms of computational minimalism. As I will go on to detail, various technical
                     design principles of these archives lower social barriers to participation.
                     This article thus sets out a fresh theoretical terrain for understanding what I
                     call “minimal-maximal tensions” in computational architectures and projects.
                     While this discourse is rooted in older information technology debates about
                     microkernels versus macrokernels [<a class="ref" href="#tanenbaum2008"
                        >Tanenbaum and Torvalds 2008</a>], through my case study of Library Genesis
                     — the shadow library that is the main focus of this article — I seek to unpack
                     a new framework for thinking about the relationships between minimal components
                     and maximal outcomes. While Library Genesis seeks to “shadow” an enormous
                     archive, the constraints under which it operates lead to a series of unexpected
                     minimalist design principles.</div>

                     Alexandra Elbakyan in 2011, the site has grown to provide access to at least
                     68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and to
                     85.1% of all articles published in subscription journals [<a class="ref"

                     Kazakhstan, which introduces complex jurisdictional legal issues. It works by
                     collecting credentials from academic institutions, possibly by conducting
                     phishing attacks [<a class="ref" href="#russell2017">Russell and Sanchez
                        2017</a>]. These credentials are then used to fetch any article requested by
                     an end-user. In order to reduce the number of requests to publishers’ sites —
                     and thereby evade detection and a ban on its credentials — Sci-Hub caches
                     fetched journal articles in an archive called Library Genesis. Sci-Hub has
                     faced and lost several court cases, particularly in the U.S. where the
                     publisher Elsevier has been awarded millions of dollars in damages [<a

                     such damages, it is unlikely that publishers will see any financial return from
                     these lawsuits. Nonetheless, for much of 2021, Elbakyan paused the ingestion of
                     new articles while awaiting the results of a court case in India, which could

                     communications systems. These libraries are, indeed, enormous. Yet what it
                     means to be a “shadow” has changed over time. It was not until the 18th century
                     that the shadow became defined as the colorless inverse image of the object
                     itself. Before this point, shadows were represented, in art and heraldry, as a
                     partial transparency and outline. In heraldic terms, shadows represent an
                     outlined shape that reveals a hidden part of the family tree, not a mirror of
                     it [<a class="ref" href="#pastoureau2003">Pastoureau 2003</a>, 26–7]. That is,
                     shadows can be seen as a shameful family link, rather than a precise formal
                     reflection, and such a history reminds us, as Nanna Bonde Thylstrup puts it, of
                     the “inherently unstable form of shadow libraries as a cultural construct” [<a

                     threat of (distributed) denial of service (DDOS) attacks. On the first of these
                     fronts, to provide a memorable location for the archive, Library Genesis uses
                     DNS [<a class="ref" href="#mockapetris1987">Mockapetris 1987</a>]. This is the
                     system that translates an address such as gen.lib.rus.ec into an Internet
                     Protocol (IP) address (198.167.223.167, for example). This is a useful system
                     because IP addresses are not easily memorable for humans. However, DNS
                     addresses are subject to takedowns and blocking by Internet Service Providers
                     (ISP). That is, if an allegedly infringed party can persuade a court of law or
                     an ISP that a site’s sole purpose is copyright infringement, the domain name
                     (or IP address) can be blocked for large swathes of users [<a class="ref"

                     friendlier jurisdiction. Systems such as The Onion Router (Tor) are another way

                     addresses within a narrow time window frustrates the ultimate purpose of the
                     system. Sites such as Reddit — a contemporary bulletin board system — spread
                     news of new DNS mirrors, but, of course, once these addresses are public, the
                     takedown process can begin anew. It is a war of attrition and, thus far,

                     example of how Library Genesis seeds such a trail, rather than blatantly
                     advertising itself, can be seen in its metadata. Searching for “Library
                     Genesis” on Google yields a link but its description only reads, “No
                     information is available for this page.” Additionally, the site does not
                     feature in the top results of “download scientific books for free.” Instead,

                     presents such a minimal surface. While, surely, the core reason for Library

                     potential for rights-holders to flood the site with false metadata and uploads.
                     Indeed, the gravest threat to Library Genesis’s operation would be
                     contamination of its records with inaccurate files, which could cause a
                     denial-of-service attack against the archive. While the simple reason is that
                     all uploads must be vetted, it would also be surprising if the use of the
                     password seriously deters a concerted effort to pollute the library. As we will
                     also see, though, the minimalist metadata principles of Library Genesis

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20"> In terms of minimal metadata, it is worth first
                     considering the scale of Library Genesis. The main Library Genesis database
                     collection had just short of 1.2 million records (books) in 2014 [<a
                        class="ref" href="#bodo2018a">Bodó 2018a</a>, 53]. As of January 2020, this
                     capacity had more than doubled to 2.5 million books. Clearly, a database of
                     epistemological dissent at this size and with this scale of growth requires a
                     lightweight — or, as we might say, “<em class="emph">minimal</em>” metadata
                     scheme if it is not to collapse under the strain of its size. Although the ext2
                     and ext3 filesystems that were commonly used on Linux systems at the time of
                     the database’s inception have a sizable upper limit of 1.3×1020 files per
                     directory, there are known performance issues in handling more than 10,000 [<a
                        class="ref" href="#poirier2001">Poirier 2001</a>]. There are also issues of
                     integrity monitoring at this scale. When dealing with 2.5 million records, how
                     can one ensure that physical media degradation — “bit rot” — does not lead to
                     corrupted files on the disk that may not come to light for substantial periods?
                     That said, the scale of Library Genesis pales in comparison to formal archives.
                     For instance, a report from 2009 noted that there are over 9,000 missing
                     volumes in the British Library’s main collection, illustrating that this
                     problem exists in both the legal and illegal spaces [<a class="ref"
                        href="#dawar2009">Dawar and Kennedy 2009</a>]. The British Library is also
                     substantially larger than Library Genesis, with a main collection of
                     approximately 170 million items total and 13.5 million books, with a digital
                     collection that is over a petabyte in size [<a class="ref"

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21"> Library Genesis is an enormous archive in terms of
                     total size (maximal), but it is composed of files that are relatively small
                     (minimal). The average (mean) file size in the database is 13.90MB, with a
                     significant portion of these files being less than 5MB. The file size
                     distribution varies for the different file types within the database. Despite
                     the accessibility challenges of the format — the Portable Document Format (PDF)
                     is not the best format for screen readers, for instance — PDFs dominate the
                     archive. For PDFs (n=1,697,927), for instance, the tail is longer to trail off
                     and the average file size is higher at 16.49MB. By contrast, EPUB (n=179,926;
                     average: 7.32 MB) and Mobi (n=23,947; average: 4.33MB) bring the mean file
                     sizes down as they can jettison the formatting information inherent in PDF
                     files. Nonetheless, with this volume of small files, addressability is a core
                     performance concern.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22"> The solution that Library Genesis devised for
                     handling such a vast, proliferating archive composed of relatively small files
                     is based on minimalist principles of metadata, distribution, and hashing. Files
                     are <em class="emph">distributed</em> over multiple directories (called
                     “buckets”) while being referenced within a database that includes metadata
                     about the file, as well as a message-digest algorithm v5 (MD5) hash of the
                     file, which serves as a filename. There are 47 metadata fields within the
                     database for each entry, which can be subdivided into categories of file and
                     record information, file and record properties, and external identifiers.<a
                        class="noteRef" href="#d4e486">[4]</a> Importantly, though, very few of
                     these fields are <em class="emph">required</em>. The subset that are absolutely
                     necessary are kept to a minimum.</div>

                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p23">23</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p23"> The first of these categories — file and record
                     information — pertains to local lookup of the file. For instance, to retrieve a
                     local file for a record, one simply divides the ID field by 1,000 to get the
                     bucket directory, then retrieves the object with the specified MD5 record from
                     that directory (e.g. “243000/9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6”). To specify the
                     content type, a user can append the “Extension” field (e.g. “pdf” or “epub”) to
                     the delivered file (and could also infer the multipurpose internet mail
                     extensions or MIME type if necessary). In addition to using the “Filesize”
                     field to check a download, it is also possible to verify that the contents of
                     the file have not been corrupted at any time. This verification is achieved by
                     computing the file’s MD5 hash and then comparing this to the database/filename.
                     Although MD5 is a very old (and possibly even “broken”) hashing algorithm, it
                     has a 1.47x10-29 chance of a random collision (that is, of two files sharing
                     the same hash) [<a class="ref" href="#ramirez2015">Ramirez 2015</a>]. There are
                     no two records within the Library Genesis database that share an MD5 hash as of
                     March 1, 2020.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e509">[5]</a> Nonetheless, the
                     subdivision into “bucket” directories of 1,000 files makes the on-disk
                     likelihood of two files sharing a hash/filename extremely unlikely and further
                     reduces this risk. The verification algorithm means that the detection of
                     corrupt files can be handled automatically rather than on a reporting basis
                     from users (although computing all MD5 hashes in the database is a
                     computationally demanding task given the scale). These field and record
                     information fields are the bare minimum required to retrieve a file from the
                     filestore.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24"> The second category of metadata field — file and
                     record properties — gives specific metadata for a record, such as the work’s
                     title and authors. Interestingly, for the principles of minimal computational
                     design, the database does not store authors in a structured and linked form,
                     but rather as free-text. Traditionally, if one were designing a relational
                     database where an author could be ascribed to more than one book, one would
                     create a separate database table called “author” that had properties such as
                     “first name,” “last name,” and “ORCID ID,” and then, in the “books” table, link
                     to the author. This would create a mechanism to query an author called, say,
                     “Joe Bloggs,” and to retrieve all books written by that specific Joe Bloggs.
                     Such a schema would provide high-quality structured data. This is not what
                     Library Genesis does. Instead, it simply stores author names as “plaintext.”
                     Sometimes this means that authors and editors are listed in a long string, and
                     it is not clear whether authors of the same name are the same person.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25"> Such an approach comes with several minimalist
                     computational advantages. The clearest of these are: (1) there is no need to
                     maintain the structural integrity of the database between tables, and (2) the
                     overhead for entering metadata is greatly simplified by flattening the input.
                     In this way, Library Genesis lowers both the computational requirements for
                     maintenance and the barriers for entry/participation by allowing freeform
                     textual input. Given the size of the database, and the fact that a free-text
                     search can take a long time, the single-field, free-text approach to “author”
                     rather than a linked record also allows interested parties to create their own
                     indexes of the database with relative ease.</div>

                     identifiers) — also entirely optional — demonstrates further minimalist design
                     principles. Instead of storing all metadata locally, the database points to
                     offsite management of such data, allowing for others, likely specialists, to
                     focus entirely on metadata curation, collection, and provision. While this
                     carries some initial lookup overhead for the pirate entering the data, the
                     labor of maintaining this metadata is then outsourced and can be resolved on
                     demand. This all points towards a minimalist labor approach and an awareness
                     that by lowering the threshold for participating to the minimum, the maximalist
                     goals of the project are more likely to be achieved.</div>

                     functions in its metadata design principles, its distributional characteristics
                     are also emblematic of such operations. The distributional minimalism principle
                     can be seen in discussions about the preservation of the archive and the future
                     of sites such as Library Genesis. On the first front of digital preservation,
                     the challenge is that this archive is maximal, not minimal. A reasonable cost
                     estimate for simply the hard disks to mirror the entire 33TB archive as of
                     March 2020 is $1,200. This does not include either redundancy in terms of drive
                     failure or the server hardware in which the hard drives would be housed. In
                     terms of minimal cost scaling, the sheer size of the archive makes for a
                     difficult environment if the local copy is to be complete and usable.</div>

                     be the aim of distribution, and it is of course possible for partial replicas

                     However, the torrent swarm is not ideal for Library Genesis’s use case. Anybody
                     seeding on the network will have an exposed IP address, and it will be clear
                     that they are participating, with legal risk. For this reason it is likely that
                     many users in the swarm will be connecting using VPNs or so-called seedboxes

                     themselves to ensure the full torrent availability of the Library Genesis
                     filestore. Under this initiative, “swarm peers increased from 3,000 seeders to

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33"> IPFS does not address the anonymity of nodes that
                     participate, meaning that it would still be possible to locate a serving entity
                     by IP address, which could have legal implications. Such problems could, again,
                     be mitigated by the use of anonymity networks such as Tor. The scalability of
                     IPFS to 33TB of material, spread over 2.5 or so million unique entities of
                     small file sizes is also unproven. An intermediate address lookup table would
                     be needed to translate between the Library Genesis structure and any IPFS
                     version of the platform. However, IPFS would present a minimalist design
                     platform with the distributed preservation of a maximalist scholarly archive,
                     in which many actors all share a small proportion of the total output,
                     contributing towards a holistic totality in fragmentary participation.
                     Nonetheless, once again, the fragmentary approach, in which smaller portions of
                     the archive are distributed between many actors, rather than in a centralised
                     store, yields a minimal approach to the function of a maximal archival.</div>

                     been proposing a framework for thinking about minimal-maximal tensions. It is
                     tempting to consider minimalist computing paradigms as the opposite to
                     proliferating maximal systems. In reality, instead, minimalist paradigms can
                     work as fragments of a distributed whole; this is one of the lessons that we
                     can learn from the pirate archive.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35"> These debates are not abstract for scholarly
                     communications. At present, various research funders across the globe are
                     embarking on the establishment of their own platforms to replace the journal
                     ecosystem. Spurred by the same motivation as Library Genesis and Sci-Hub — the
                     slower-than-desired growth of open access — the Open Research Europe, Wellcome
                     Open Research, and Gates Open Research platforms represent significant
                     centralizations of research outputs under funder control, as opposed to a
                     distributed journal publishing architecture. These platforms, running on the
                     for-profit F1000 platform owned by Taylor &amp; Francis, bill themselves as
                     “megajournals,” following the terminology developed by the world’s largest
                     journal, <cite class="title italic">PLOS ONE</cite>. There are many competing
                     interests in these systems. Even as such initiatives represent centralizations
                     and maximal architectures, funders insist on open licenses for re-use and
                     re-distribution. Hence, we have centralization efforts mandating licenses that
                     allow for de-centralization and micro/minimal circulation.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> Library Genesis also yields various principles of
                     participation and consumption that are minimal in their design, even while they
                     yield access to a maximal resource. By requiring only the minimum of metadata
                     provision, Library Genesis lowers barriers to participation, an aspect also
                     bolstered by the off-shoring and distribution of its identifier systems. In
                     terms of consumption, the single search box that returns all results for
                     everything, ever, represents a maximal centralization. In terms of ease of use
                     and accessibility, this one-stop-shop demonstrates a concision and minimalism
                     that is lacking in most scholarly communications systems.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37"> Finally, Library Genesis demonstrates a minimally
                     exposed surface, mostly due to its illegality. It would be churlish to pretend
                     that there are huge implications for legitimate scholarly communications
                     infrastructures or lessons to be learned from this. The more people have access
                     to scholarship and research, the better. The minimally exposed surface of the
                     shadow archive is precisely — and only — because it must remain hidden. The
                     strait that this archive must navigate, though, is the space between its
                     maximal presence and its minimal entrance, the rabbit holes of the alternate
                     reality game..</div>

                     to document several features of Library Genesis that serve as an index of
                     minimal-maximal infrastructures. At least some of these features could be
                     adopted by mainstream scholarly communications providers to increase not only
                     the resilience of, but also global equity of access to, our publication
                     ecosystems. While shadows are not equal to mirrors, in these senses I contend
                     that there are lessons to be learned from the (shadow) library.</div>
