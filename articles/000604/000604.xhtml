                  <p>Network representation is a crucial topic in historical social network analysis. The
                     debate around their value and connotations, led by humanist scholars, is today more
                     relevant then ever, seeing how common these representations are as support for
                     historical analysis. Force-directed networks, in particular, are popular as they can
                     be developed relatively quickly, and reveal patterns and structures in data. The
                     underlying algorithms, although powerful in revealing hidden patterns, do not retain
                     meaningful structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. In
                     this article, we question the foreign aspect of this structure that force-directed
                     layout create in historical datasets. We explore the importance of hierarchy in
                     social networks, and investigate whether hierarchies  - strongly present within our
                     models of social structure - affect our perception of social network data. Results
                     from our user evaluation indicate that hierarchical network representations reduce
                     cognitive load and leads to more frequent and deeper insights into historical social
                     networks. We also find that users report a preference for the hierarchical graph
                     representation. We analyse these findings in light of the broader discussion on the
                     value of force-directed network representations within humanistic research, and
                     introduce open questions for future work in this line of research. </p>

                     research. Used to represent relationships between persons or concepts, this type of
                     graphs has also been implemented through various layouts to better support specific
                     tasks and users. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The wide availability of layout algorithms has multiple advantages for researchers
                     who aim to analyze social networks. Force-directed layouts such as the Gephi Atlas
                     drastically simplify the visualization – therefore analysis – of large network data.
                     They reveal patterns and clusters by using complex physical models, all with limited
                     need for user intervention or mathematical expertise. These models excel in domains
                     where datasets are large, and where the goal is to identify the structure – or shape
                     – of the dataset. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">However, the widened access to these automated graph drawing algorithms drives us
                     to
                     interrogate their fitedness for the analysis of humanistic material. On the one hand,
                     force-directed layouts visually remove existing structures in the data, even when
                     these structures are meaningful to users and their daily tasks. On the other,
                     humanistic datasets are often small, but do consist of meaningful inherent clusters,
                     distances and relationships. Such a mismatch leads to representations that can be
                     at
                     odds with users' internal perceptions of the data structure. For instance, family
                     members in a correspondence graph are likely to be spread apart. Similarly,
                     non-contemporary actors can be placed side to side if they share a common
                     correspondent. This inconsistency between mental models and visual representation
                     can
                     become a challenge for users. More critically, it has the potential to impact the
                     adoption of visualization tools as a whole as research suggests usability and user
                     trust, rather than scalability, are main obstacles to adoption of digital tools in
                     the humanities [<a class="ref" href="#thoden2017">Thoden 2017</a>]. </div>

                     layout. This method uses the existing – and already mature - dynamics of
                     force-directed algorithms, and injects a meaningful structure into them to organize
                     them in a way that better supports users’ mental models. We describe the results of
                     a

                     directions for this line of research. Specifically, we interrogate the artificial
                     structure these layouts create, and evaluate whether their disconnect with existing

                     believe this discussion to be critical for two reasons. First, because
                     Human-Computer-Interaction research has shown the importance of the consistency
                     between users’ mental models of information and its digital representation [<a class="ref" href="#doerum2011">Dørum amd Garland 2011</a>]. Second, because visual hierarchy in network graphs strongly affects their
                     spatial organization, and spatial position is believed to be one of the most
                     effective channels in information visualization [<a class="ref" href="#munzner2014">Munzner 2014</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#bertin1973">Bertin 1973</a>]. In
                     this section, we present a discussion on the semantics of hierarchical trees on one
                     side, and force-directed networks on the other. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">First, we illustrate the difference between the two, through the example of two
                     visualisations of historical social networks as can be seen in Figure 1. In Figure
                     1a, a hand-drawn illustration displays the genealogy of the last Byzantine emperor
                     drawn as a collection of trees. This visualization has a strong spatial organization
                     based on family lines, roles, and generational hierarchy. In fact, tree structures
                     can be found in multiple historical representations of networks because they mirror
                     the conception of lineage as a branching linear connected structure. In Figure 1b,
                     we
                     see a contemporary representation of a historical network<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e294">[3]</a>, this time depicting the list of
                     signatories of a marriage contract in Angoulême, France in the 18th century, as well
                     as their extended social networks [<a class="ref" href="#rothschild2014">Rothschild 2014</a>]. This network, developed using
                     Gephi shows the global social structure of this historical community, produced using
                     a force-directed layout, such that highly connected subgroups attract each other,
                     thereby revealing the cliques and subcommunities within the dataset. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">To describe them formally, hierarchical trees (such as Figure 1a) are a sub-category
                     of networks that are acyclic (i.e. there are no loop encountered during a traversal
                     of the tree) and directed (i.e. the relationships described by the edges are
                     one-directional, rather than reciprocal). The hierarchical aspect signifies a certain
                     categorization of the nodes so that those placed on the same level hold a similar
                     value or meaning. Hierarchical trees are a spatial organization whose traces date
                     back to antiquity, and which can be found in a variety of knowledge domains. As
                     described by Drucker in her book Graphesis [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2010">Drucker 2010</a>], trees are interesting
                     because their spatial organization carries meaning. In the case of social networks,
                     this spatial organization becomes an indicator of multiple elements including birth
                     order, generational breadth and span, patterns of marriage [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2010">Drucker 2010</a>]. Another
                     interesting aspect to hierarchical trees is their embedded story-telling. The root
                     node(s), typically placed at the top<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e308">[4]</a> of the hierarchy, creates a visual anchor
                     that drives the reader in, and directs their attention down the edges in a manner
                     which is almost a narrative approach to visualization. </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">On the other hand, force-directed networks (Figure 1b) are mathematical products,
                     where physical simulations ran multiple times on a dataset model attraction and
                     repulsion between nodes, therefore automatically placing nodes with high connectivity
                     close to one another, or at the opposite, resulting in disconnected nodes being
                     placed far from each other, highlighting their disconnect. For Ahnert et al.,
                     force-directed networks “reject hierarchies”, which become hidden and difficult to
                     notice, even if they were strongly present within the dataset <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#ahnert2020">#ahnert2020</a></span>. Modern
                     readings have argued for the advantages of force-directed networks by justly
                     questioning the relevance and accuracy of representing the world in rigidly
                     structured hierarchical roles. In actual historical communities, influence does not
                     necessarily traverse time and generations in a clear-cut linear way. Similarly, trees
                     of knowledge fall short when representing complex webs of information, as the
                     distributed aspect of the web and social networks have clearly illustrated in the
                     past decades<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e318">[5]</a>. </div>

                     network data has an undeniable value, when compared to the visual organization that

                        expressions of processed text or intellectual content is often determined by the

                        visualization. This introduces incidental artifacts of visual information. A point

                     semantics and connotation in the visualization design, especially within humanistic
                     scholarship. In previous work [<a class="ref" href="#lamqaddam2020">Lamqaddam et al. 2020</a>], we report how humanists have
                     consistently commented on the connotative dryness of visualization tools, linking
                     it
                     to a reduction of rich research material [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2012">Manovich 2012</a>]. Through user research, we
                     found that humanist scholars felt a <em class="term">semantic distance</em> between
                     their experience of their research material and practice and its representation in
                     visualization tools. Such tools can end up stripping data of essential meaning-making
                     elements such as temporality, physicality, and terminology. More specifically, we
                     identified structure in conceptualizations and ontologies as one of the
                     characteristics of humanistic research that is often missing in visualizations. We
                     also found proof that meaning, intentionally layered into visualization, had the
                     potential to reduce the semantic distance experienced by scholars, and alleviate
                     their discomfort. In this context, the question of representing data’s hierarchical
                     structures within historical social networks is an interrogation of our Layers of
                     Meaning (LoM) framework, and an investigation of a larger trend in digital humanities
                     scholarship during the data era. </div>

                     of

                     existing force-directed layout algorithms are currently mature and deliver
                     high-quality performance. Perhaps as a consequence, these layouts are supported by
                     major graph drawing libraries and toolkits, which opens future possibilities for
                     wider implementation of hierarchical graph layouts. Force-directed layouts also
                     include parameters to reduce node collision, occlusion, and bring in useful results,
                     such as bringing together highly connected clusters, which, while we do not want it
                     to break inherent hierarchy in the data, still proves to be useful in reducing

                     identify obstacles to adoption of digital tools. Since usability and adoption are

                     placed in the center of the visualization, so saliency does not explain the
                     difference in these results. We suggest that can be caused by the topology of each
                     graph. In the force-layered version, the ties among each family create two horizontal
                     substructures that become the major ground of the visual, while the dog-bone
                     structure in the force-directed layout represent the major part of the ground figure,

                           study results, we describe how hierarchical trees seemingly elicit an engagement
                           with the <em class="emph">data</em>, while force-directed layouts trigger
                           comments about the features and characteristics of the <em class="emph">tool</em>
                           itself. This subtle distinction has relevant implications, as it suggests that the
                           spatial organization of the network affects the perception of the data
                           representation. Visualized data can therefore be integrated in users’ mental
                           models in a way that allows them to analyze and question it; or it can be obscured
                           by the layer of foreign conceptualization that does not allow it to blend with
                           their existing knowledge. As it is, it is critical to encourage representations
                           that allow a connection with the research material itself, and where the
                           visualization features themselves do not become the center of attention for users.
                           We also see this finding as a validating step of the guidelines developed in the
                           Layers of Meaning framework [<a class="ref" href="#lamqaddam2020">Lamqaddam et al. 2020</a>]. In this case, by layering meaning
                           through the structure of network graphs, we find that there is an effect to the
                           level of engagement users have with research data. What seems to be a slight
                           visual difference appears to affect the very focus of users’ attention, which in
                           turn reveals the critical aspect of connotative elements and intentional design
                           choices in visualization. </li>
                        <li class="item">Force-directed network structure as artifact. In the analysis of the recall of
                           social structure information, we note that more participants recalled the
                           existence of a bridge node between the two clusters with the force-directed
                           network. We suggest that this is due to the singular topology of the generated
                           network. In truth, what is a particular visual characteristic of a network
                           topology (a bridge node between two tight clusters) is an abstraction of a
                           significant piece of information in the dataset (a common person bringing together
                           two large families). In a way, the fact that the force-directed layout created
                           this artificial shape helped highlight a very important information in the data,
                           which has been better remembered by participants. From this perspective, we can
                           thus defend that force-directed layouts also <em class="emph">create</em> meaning
                           through the specific topologies they generate. These shapes are often singular, or
                           unique, because they are not a product of intentional design. Rather, then come as
                           the result of computations unique to the dataset, the canvas space and the set
                           parameters. We therefore defend the concept of a force-directed network
                           organization as an artifact in itself. One that holds the potential to carry
                           meaning; to be recognized, analyzed, and categorized. </li>

                           article that one of the strengths of hierarchical tree structures is that they
                           reproduce existing mental models, therefore making it easier to read and grasp
                           information they represent as it fits within scholars’ existing knowledge.
                           However, existing models of knowledge are not necessarily correct, accurate, or
                           good to perpetuate. For instance, conventional family trees carry a variety of
                           assumptions about social structures that make them both limited and limiting when
                           representing real-life data. Worse, these representations, when uncritically
                           absorbed, function as prescriptive principles of how communities should exist in
                           society. There is therefore an undeniable larger implication in the discussion
                           about how social network data should be represented. The improved understanding,
                           preference and lower effort that hierarchical trees bring needs to be balanced –
                           or perhaps complemented - by the novel perspectives that force-directed layouts

                     of
                     historical social networks. We have found, based on a user-centered approach, that
                     humanist participants had a hierarchical mental model of social networks, indicating
                     that there could be advantages to representing social networks in a similarly
                     hierarchical structure. Our study confirmed this hypothesis, as we found that users
                     reported lower cognitive load, more frequent and deeper insights, as well as a
                     significant preference for the hierarchical representations. Despite these results,
                     we nuance these findings by calling attention to the fact that force-directed graphs
                     can carry meaning in their generated topology, allow users to make conclusions on
                     tightness of networks, clusters, and question the accepted dogmas in terms of
                     community structure. However, because social networks are so critical to certain
                     humanistic research domains, the perceptual benefits to hierarchically structured
                     layouts should not be overlooked. As graph-drawing software is often the most
                     accessible way for researchers to gather quick visual overview, we suggest that these
                     layouts should be more commonly supported as alternatives to allow scholars to have
