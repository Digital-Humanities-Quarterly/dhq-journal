                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  
                  <p>This article is a classroom case study of the Intellectual Mixtape Project, an
                     AudioVisual digital humanities module. The intellectual mixtape uses jazz and hip
                     hop as
                     a framework to create an audio compilation and “conversation” that samples
                     literary-audio texts (such as SunRa speeches, Octavia Butler interviews, Tracy K.
                     Smith’s
                     poetry readings, etc.). Each track of the intellectual mixtape has three audios: 1)
                     the
                     literary-audio texts from the syllabus, 2) the students’ voice in their own words,
                     and 3)
                     an audio of the students’ choice. As a companion to each track, students write 500
                     words
                     of liner notes that must include the title of their track and their curation and mixing
                     decisions.Students then publish their entire intellectual mixtape (three or more tracks)
                     with original or “remixed” cover art on an online platform.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The first part of the study will discuss the structure of the intellectual
                     mixtape assignments. In these assignments, students are provided with literary-audio
                     texts, required to complete and submit audio homework assignments, and taught the
                     basics
                     of audio editing. This method of teaching and analyzing literature shifts the practice
                     of literary analysis from top down approaches that privileges the authority of the
                     text
                     and instead encourages the student to “converse” with the text to
                     create new knowledge. This methods also reflects the artistic practice of Afrofuturist
                     artists and theorist who improvise, remix, and sample to create their work.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The second part of the study will discuss a performance and midterm adaptation of
                     the Intellectual Mixtape Project entitled Sound of Space: An Interactive
                     Afrofuturist Experience. “Sound of Space” was an immersive
                     performance with four-sensory stations that featured Afrofuturist themes. The midterm
                     adaptation was showcased in the Cube, a four-story high, state-of-the-art multimedia
                     black
                     box theater at Virginia Tech. In preparation for the performance, students merged
                     sound
                     engineering, 360 degree-video-projection, improvisational performance, and light design.
                     “Sound of Space” introduced students and audiences’ to an
                     immersive Afrofuturist-audio experience and pushed the boundaries of literary
                     analysis.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The third part of the study will address challenges with the Intellectual Mixtape
                     Project. Challenges include finding relevant literary-audio texts and dealing with
                     the
                     many limitations imposed by U.S. copyright law. Some ways to address the
                     challenges imposed by U.S. copyright law might be to 1) reclassify sampling audio
                     as a
                     form of quotation, 2) use databases of copyright-free music, 3) find culturally
                     significant works from lesser-known artists who will license their tracks, and/or
                     4) pay
                     royalties.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">This definition was current and broad enough to cover all the three modules of the
                     course, including the first module, which was the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape
                     assignment. For this assignment, students took several samples from selected audio
                     recordings on the syllabus and added their own voice and another audio recording of
                     their
                     choosing. Students then wrote "liner notes" in which they discussed their choice of
                     samples, the use of their own voice, and how these choices connect to larger discourses
                     within Afrofuturism. As such, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment made
                     use of
                     hacking and/or appropriating as well as deep remixability while engaging a multitude
                     of
                     discourses that make up Afrofuturistic expression.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">In the course, we also engaged other definitions of Afrofuturism such as Alondra Nelson's
                     2002 articulation of the term as "'African American voices' with 'other stories to
                     tell
                     about culture, technology and things to come.' The term [Afrofuturism] was chosen
                     as the
                     best umbrella for the concerns of 'the list' [the AfroFuturism (AF) listserv] — as
                     it has
                     come to be known by its members — sci-fi imagery, futurist themes, and technological
                     innovation in the African diaspora'" (9). Nelson's definition was fitting for our
                     literature course that brought together sci-fi, futurist, and technological stories
                     by
                     Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor, Wanuri Kahiu, among others. Moreover, Ytasha Womack's
                     succinct definition of Afrofuturism as "an intersection of imagination, technology,
                     the
                     future and liberation" from her book <em class="emph">Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and
                        Fantasy Culture</em>, which introduces readers to the paradigm of Afrofuturism, was
                     useful for engaging the works of several artists and the major discourses of Afrofuturism
                     in preparation for the intellectual mixtape assignment.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">Teaching Afrofuturism works within the intellectual mixtape assignment was an innovative
                     method of teaching and analyzing literature and composition techniques that shifted
                     the
                     practice of literary and cultural analysis from top-down approaches that privileged
                     the
                     authority of academic or assigned "texts" to student-centered mixing that encouraged
                     the
                     use of audio, images, and text to create new knowledge. This assignment is within
                     particular traditions of Africana studies and rhetoric and composition, in which students
                     are encouraged and taught to improvise, remix, and sample in order to create distinctive
                     work [<a class="ref" href="#carter2019">Carter 2019</a>]. In particular, the intellectual mixtape assignment also
                     imparts skills such as audio editing, process writing, thematic-website-template building
                     as well as collaboration and performance.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6">Furthermore, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment is what Bryan Carter
                     would
                     consider digital Africana studies and what Kim Gallon refers to as Black digital
                     humanities. Carter's digital Africana studies is an approach to "using a number of
                     digital
                     tools to help us experience Africana studies very differently and to help students
                     express
                     their understanding of whatever that course content happens to be very very differently"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#carter2019">Carter 2019</a>]. Carter's approach is innovative, technological, and
                     pedagogical yet grounded in the field of Africana studies. Similarly, the Afrofuturist
                     intellectual mixtape assignment is grounded in digital Africana studies (since
                     Afrofuturism is a part of Africana studies), and the technologies taught in the assignment
                     are used to strengthen students' understanding of Afrofuturism in unconventional ways.
                     Additionally, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape is a black digital humanities
                     assignment, for it "reveals how methodological approaches for studying and thinking
                     about
                     the category of blackness may come to bear on and transform the digital processes
                     and
                     tools used to study humanity" [<a class="ref" href="#gallon2016">Gallon 2016</a>]. In <em class="emph">Afrofuturism to
                        Vibranium and Beyond</em>, the category of blackness becomes the categories of
                     blackness as the students study, critique, and create counter histories, alternate
                     destinies, and posthuman identities through the aesthetics of their mixtape tracks
                     and
                     their interactive Afrofuturist performance, which are featured later in this article.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">As the title suggests, this article is a case study of the Afrofuturist intellectual
                     mixtape assignment. It proceeds as follows: we first describe the seven-part layout
                     of the
                     Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment. Next, we provide three key aspects to
                     teaching the intellectual mixtape assignment. Then we discuss additional approaches
                     that
                     buttress our analysis of the students' mixtapes in connection to digital humanities
                     and
                     Afrofuturism. Subsequently, we discuss sampling, conversing, and "flowing" in relation
                     to
                     these approaches and examine three examples of students' work. Afterward, we describe
                     the
                     process of preparing for the students' midterm performance in which their mixtapes
                     were

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">The intellectual mixtape is an audio-visual-textual assignment with seven-parts. In
                     part
                     one, students listened to recordings (such as lectures, poems, songs, interviews,
                     etc.)
                     that were assigned (on the syllabus) for homework and class discussion. For the second
                     part, students learned the basics of audio editing in order to create their first
                     tracks
                     of the intellectual mixtape. The first audio editing assignment asked students to
                     improvise in order to learn how to edit audio; therefore, from the beginning, Afrofuturist
                     concepts were pedagogically centered. Their track selections and the mixing decisions
                     were, for the most part, impromptu. For the third part, students created the first
                     of
                     three audio tracks, which was 1 min long. All audio tracks included at least three
                     regions
                     of audio: a sample from audio on the syllabus, a region with their own voice in their
                     own
                     words, and a region of their choosing. As a companion to each track, students wrote
                     500
                     words of liner notes that included a title for the track and their curation and mixing
                     decisions. For the fourth part, students created a second track that was 1.5 minutes
                     in
                     length. The second track was a collaboration with another student in the course; it
                     also
                     featured a sample from the syllabus, a region with their own voices in their own words,
                     and a region of their choosing with liner notes. The fifth part of the assignment
                     was a
                     third audio track that was between 1.5 to 2 minutes in length, and collaboration was
                     optional; the third track had the same criteria for regions and liner notes. For the
                     sixth
                     part, the students posted their three-track mixtape online (often in a web template
                     service such as Wix) with liner notes and included "remixed" or original cover art.
                     In
                     part seven, students performed the intellectual mixtape. In seven weeks, the intellectual
                     mixtape assignment taught students skills such as audio editing, process writing,
                     audio-visual synchronizing, thematic-website-template building as well as collaboration
                     and performance.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9">In order to prepare students to create their mixtapes, we made sure each student had
                     the
                     resources that they needed to succeed. It is important to note that it was not enough
                     for
                     students to have access to the material; it was beneficial that the students engaged
                     with
                     the material in homework assignments and class discussions prior to recording their
                     intellectual mixtapes. When students were exposed to the material prior to creating
                     their
                     intellectual mixtapes, they had additional contexts to build upon. Here, we will highlight
                     three strategies that were instrumental to the success of the assignment–syllabus
                     design,
                     a tech survey, and a workshop on audio-editing. First, curating the syllabus required
                     finding sufficient recordings–preferably MP3 for the intellectual mixtape assignment
                     — and
                     making those recordings available on the syllabus. When there was material essential
                     to
                     the study of Afrofuturism that was not available in an audio or video recording, it
                     was
                     kept on the syllabus and paired with audio dealing with the same subject. For instance,
                     Samuel R. Delany's short story "aye, and Gomorrah" was course reading, and it was
                     paired
                     with an audio interview with Delany. Furthermore, the syllabus only included recordings
                     that were primary sources in which the Afrofuturist artists, scholars, activists,
                     and/or
                     practitioners spoke about their own work. The videos were selected from platforms
                     such as
                     YouTube and Vimeo and then converted to MP3s. There are two distinctions that determined
                     how the audio/video recordings were featured on the syllabus: videos that were
                     "live-action" of the Afrofuturist were added to the syllabus directly, but videos
                     that
                     were slideshows of still photos were converted to MP3 and put on the syllabus as MP3s.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">Second, we began the course with a tech survey to get an inventory of the students'
                     tech
                     needs and to assess their exposure and comfort with the technologies we would use
                     in
                     class.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e267">[1]</a> Our survey had eight questions and was distributed on Survey Monkey a
                     week before classes began.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e270">[2]</a> The survey helped us to determine
                     if students would need loaner equipment and whether they would work with Audacity
                     or
                     GarageBand to learn audio-editing or if we would teach both; it also determined our
                     approach to teaching audio-editing so that the students were comfortable enough with
                     the
                     audio-editing software to complete the assignment.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">Third, we taught the students GarageBand or Audacity, which was a learning objective
                     for
                     the intellectual mixtape assignment. Teaching an overview of audio-editing required
                     some
                     preparation before class such as requiring that everyone had headphones and GarageBand
                     or
                     Audacity (with Lame encoder) installed on their computers by the start of class, creating
                     a shared drive that was available with MP3/WAV files for students to select audio
                     recordings, and disseminating written instructions of what we were covering in class
                     while
                     facilitating a live demonstration. We also made a screencast of the demonstration
                     available, so students could watch later. We gave the students fourteen tasks to complete
                     after they opened the program.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">The students' execution of the audio-editing practice assignment was fast-paced and
                     improvisational. Because of the time constraints, students worked quickly and
                     performatively in a way that they normally would not. They learned and created their
                     practice mixtape tracks on the fly. As a result, we were not concerned if the practice
                     track made sense, and it was not significant if the track stopped abruptly. Instead,
                     when
                     this assignment was assessed, we checked to see if 1) we had received the assignment
                     as an
                     MP3 or as a WAV file, 2) the assignment was 1 minute in length, 3) the track had three
                     different regions in which one was the student's voice, 4) the track included a fade-in
                     or
                     fade-out at some point in the recording, and 5) the track had an effect (it could
                     be a
                     duplicate sound, reverbs, etc.). This assessment gave us an indication of whether
                     or not
                     the students understood the basics of audio-editing and could build on this knowledge
                     to
                     complete the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape project.

                     Afrofuturist artists, scholars, activists, and/or practitioners discussing their work
                     was
                     the substratum of the intellectual mixtape assignment. It was the basis of how the
                     students developed flow, sampled, and engaged in internally persuasive discourse and
                     techno-vernacular creativity. Creating the tech survey allowed us to prepare for our
                     students and guarantee that they had access to equipment and software, as well as
                     ample
                     time to finish assignments. Without this kind of preparation, the course could have
                     been
                     bottle-necked by the technology and diverted focus from the course content. Finally,
                     teaching the basics of audio-editing was one aspect that makes the intellectual mixtape
                     assignment a digital humanities project. The assignment was multimodal and encouraged
                     students to develop their own voices.

                     another useful framework for understanding the intellectual mixtape assignment. Gaskins's
                     methodology of techno-vernacular creativity is reflected in the intellectual mixtape
                     assignment. In the essay, Gaskins describes techno-vernacular creativity as a creation
                     method consisting of appropriation, improvisation, and reinvention. In terms of
                     appropriation, Gaskins writes that Afrofuturists "reclaim cultural artifacts, often
                     to
                     counter dominant social or political systems" [<a class="ref" href="#gaskins2016">Gaskins 2016</a>, 30].
                     Appropriation of a similar kind was evident in the intellectual mixtape assignment.
                     Students appropriated recordings (sample) from the syllabus and used those recordings
                     to
                     create or center their own world views. Gaskins describes Afrofuturists improvisations
                     as
                     "performing, creating, problem-solving, or reacting in the moment and in response
                     to one's

                     learning and making creative decisions quickly (as noted above), and they also improvised

                     was a dialogic process, specifically an internally persuasive discourse. In <em class="emph">Dialogic
                        Imagination</em>, Mikhail Bakhtin defines internally persuasive discourse as "more
                     akin to retelling a text in one's own words, with one's own accents, gestures,
                     modifications" [<a class="ref" href="#bakhtin1991">Bakhtin 1991</a>, 424]. Bakhtin's concept claims that one's
                     own word is already interwoven with someone else's words, and this interweaving creates
                     new words. As such, the intellectual mixtape was an application of internally persuasive
                     discourse in that students selected audio from the syllabus and synthesized it with
                     and/or
                     juxtaposed it against their own voice. The students' mixed/assimilated the recordings
                     and
                     created their own perspectives. Bakhtin's internally persuasive discourse provides
                     a
                     useful framework for understanding how students developed their own discourses in
                     the

                     the
                     importance of students developing and expressing authority, fluency, and flow with
                     language through hip hop as a model for composition.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e370">[4]</a> Specifically, Green defines flow as "a construct that helps to
                     clarify and usefully extend discussions about language, diversity, invention, and
                     voice"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#green2017">Green 2017</a>, 175]. Green's articulation of flow comes from a position
                     that critical writing is not limited to academic writing and that students, in particular,
                     can benefit from critiquing standardized English to develop flexible writing practices
                     that include vernacular in order to engage various audiences, traditions, and histories.
                     Green writes that "flow provides an interesting way of positioning writing for students
                     by
                     focusing discussions of language and composing on features such as rhythm, vernacular
                     eloquence, layering, and rupture in ways that press for newer considerations of language
                     and literature within English studies" [<a class="ref" href="#green2017">Green 2017</a>, 176]. Green's
                     exploration of how flow can be incorporated in English composition courses was a
                     springboard for the intellectual mixtape project, which adopted Green's concept of
                     flow
                     into audio-visual and written compositions in <em class="emph">Afrofuturism: To Vibranium and

                     of sampling and conversing to contextualize their discourse and world views and to
                     further
                     develop their own meanings — their flow. Moreover, the students who created intellectual
                     mixtapes were composing within the tradition that DJ Kool Herc, a founder of hip hop
                     music, created when he isolated and repeated the breakbeat on records, which allowed
                     for

                     this track used humor, irony, and pain to challenge stereotypes and assumptions about
                     black women and their bodies. They presented a series of images for the "Fat Girl
                     Starter

                     singer — must be gospel, must be soul, must be pain," "can I do anything for more
                     than 10
                     minutes?," and "arms that won't stretch all the way around." Lauren Garretson and
                     Starg*rl
                     strengthened their conversation by speaking at the same time, repeating and/or responding
                     to each other. They also affirmed all body types through the track's intro that featured
                     an audio excerpt from the movie <em class="emph">Phat Girlz</em> in which the character Jazmin
                     Biltmore (Mo'Nique) and her friend Stacey are ordering food at a fast-food restaurant.
                     In

                     modifies the order and adds "the works." Additionally, Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl
                     aligned themselves and their images with G/god when they sampled Erykah Badu's lyrics
                     from
                     "On and On" that "If we were made in his image then call us by our names/Most intellects
                     do not believe in god, but they fear us just the same." In their liner notes, Lauren
                     Garretson and Starg*rl wrote, "all our complexities around body and food and womanhood
                     will not shut us out from a new world, planet, mothership connection or community

                     Less"
                     by FutureShe. FutureShe began her track with a personal understanding of space and
                     place
                     that was framed by one of the most well-known Afrofuturist choruses, "space is the
                     place"
                     from Sun Ra's song, self-titled album, and film <em class="emph">Space is the Place</em>. While a
                     context of Afrofuturist acceptance is suggested through the canonized song, FutureShe's
                     flow presented otherness and doubt regarding the possibility of experiencing a utopic
                     space outside of herself. She began the track stating, "Will there be space for me
                     — for
                     all of me?" Her voice also suggested that she must find her own space since elsewhere
                     is
                     inhabited by others. FutureShe then mixed FKA Twigs's "How's That" into her track.
                     FKA
                     Twigs's recording became a companion for her, initiating her to turn within. In her
                     liner
                     notes, FutureShe wrote, "I attempt to exemplify the sort of internal struggles and
                     frustrations with space here on Earth that may eventually lead people to seek space,
                     literally and figuratively, elsewhere." FutureShe's track was a flow that used samples
                     to
                     produce a perspective that the only space where we can truly be accepted is within
                     ourselves. <a href="resources/audio/audio06.mp3" onclick="window.open('resources/audio/audio06.mp3'); return false" class="ref">Track <em class="emph">space is the place</em>

                     students to engage in popular, academic, and mystical discourses connected to
                     Afrofuturists art and practices. The recordings that the students' sampled and mixed
                     provided them with digital media skills used in the digital humanities. The process
                     of
                     audio editing also expanded how the students engaged with language, meaning, and
                     interpretation in an English special topics course. This type of engagement permitted
                     an
                     internally persuasive discourse to be expressed–one in which the students' own ideas
                     were
                     accented from the words of others. Through their sampling and conversing with the
                     assigned
                     recordings, the intellectual mixtape assignment opened up opportunities for students

                     diversity. The students' insights about Afrofuturism gained through the intellectual

                     This
                     supported our Afrofuturist pedagogical framework for two reasons. First, this assignment
                     requires students to engage in a new multimodal form of performance. This is in line
                     with
                     Locke's vision of a multimodal future for liberal arts education. Second, the assignment
                     requires students to reinvent and improvise as they adapt their mixtapes to a performance
                     environment. While the Afrofuturist performance was on the syllabus and the course
                     schedule, students were not instructed to create their mixtapes with their performance
                     in
                     mind. They had to rethink how to perform their mixtapes after they had already been
                     created. Gaskin argues that improvisation and reinvention are an integral part of
                     Afrofuturist artistic practice. In this way, the performance part of the assignment
                     is
                     also Afrofuturist.

                     and on
                     the ceiling of the Cube to allow for fully immersive sound. The Cube is specially
                     designed
                     for spatial computer music research. Vector Based Amplitude Panning is used so that

                     of
                     the Institute for Creativity, Arts and Technology led discussions with the students
                     about
                     ways to adapt the mixtapes to the space, and we required that they apply their knowledge
                     of Afrofuturism to create the performance. Students decided to create an environment
                     in
                     which the audience could freely navigate the space rather than having a fixed separation
                     between the audience and the stage. This holds roots in an Afrofuturist ideal that
                     the
                     demarcation between artist and audience member results in an imbalanced power relationship
                     that should be actively worked against [<a class="ref" href="#gaskins2016">Gaskins 2016</a>]. Students felt that
                     this would allow the audience to fully embody the space in the spirit of the mixtape
                     creation. They also argued that being able to float freely between different corners
                     of
                     the Cube would allow for improvisational movement that would reflect the Afrofuturist
                     desire to find freedom in space. Students decided to make the Cyclorama the centerpiece
                     of
                     the exhibit. They projected an oscillating image of space and played ambient white
                     noise
                     (similar to that heard on an airplane or spaceship) from overhead. The Cyclorama,
                     filled
                     with the sound of space, served as the meditative home base from which the movement
                     toward
                     the Afrofuturist spatialized sounds took place.

                     loop
                     during the performance: Flow, Transport, Testimony, and Funk. The students felt that
                     each
                     of these categories was representative not only of their mixtapes as a whole but also
                     of
                     different themes within Afrofuturist discourse. "Flow" focused on the rhythm and
                     transformation of the self, as in FutureShe's "Space Less," in which she explores
                     how to
                     carve out a space for herself as a black body on Earth. "Transport" focused on the
                     African
                     diaspora, Sankofa (a word in the Twi language and a Ghanian Adinkra symbol meaning
                     "go
                     back and get it," but also the Haile Gerima film <em class="emph">Sankofa</em> about abduction in
                     the transatlantic slave trade), and alien abduction in science-fiction narratives
                     (as in
                     the film <em class="emph">Space is the Place</em>, in which Sun Ra is abducted by a group of white
                     scientists working for NASA who hope to uncover how he travels through space). In
                     "Testimony" students expressed, confessed, and preached their experiences with various
                     forms of oppression, which reflects Sun Ra's testimony of his experience in <em class="emph">Space is
                        the Place</em>. In "Funk," students focused on the Afrofuturist connection between
                     creator and consumer, in which a liberating communal dance welcomes all (as is the
                     case
                     with Parliament Funkadelic's "We Got the Funk").

                  <div class="ptext" id="p38">Once the students' tracks were grouped together, each group was mixed, sequenced,
                     and
                     spliced into four singular looping audio tracks. Students utilized the Cube's unique
                     ability to spatialize audio to have each of the tracks played from a different corner
                     simultaneously. As audience members walked around the perimeter of the Cube, the sound
                     of
                     the next corner would slowly grow louder and the previous corner quieter until audience
                     members were fully immersed in the sound of the next group. In this way, they were
                     "transported" between each audio grouping–transportation, funk, flow, and
                     testimony–spatially. This is reflective of Sun Ra's idea that creation is a form of
                     teleportation as it is in <em class="emph">Space is the Place</em>. This slow gradient of mixed
                     audio recordings was part of the students' design as well; the hope was that this
                     blended
                     and improvisational sound would reflect the sampling and mixing of the mixtapes. This
                     balance had to be carefully checked by the GTA to make sure the sounds did not overwhelm
                     and compete with one another.

                     Students played word association games and constructed "word salad" in order to think
                     generatively about the language and spaces associated with Afrofuturism. As they continued
                     to conceive of the title in relation to the space, they eventually arrived at "Sound
                     of
                     Space" to evoke the meditative "spaceship" sound played overhead in the Cyclorama.

                     wanted to communicate meaning and feeling through more than sound and space imagery
                     in the
                     Cyclorama. The students understood empathic engagement as a core tenet to the creation

                     Afrofuturist art [<a class="ref" href="#hinton2018">Hinton 2018</a>]. They added props and visual aids to each of
                     the four corners of the Cube as a means of increasing empathic engagement with the
                     audience. While 360-degree-virtual reality has been correlated to positive empathetic
                     response, it was our hope that the 360-degree-panoramic projection wall of the Cyclorama
                     and the interactive-immersive experience in the Cube would foster empathy and embodiment
                     among audience members [<a class="ref" href="#bertrand2018">Bertrand et al. 2018</a>]. To produce this, each person was

                     the
                     jarring nature of alien and colonialist abduction. This footage was played on a loop.
                     Also, the "Funk" corner also contained a looped montage but of various funk, dance,
                     and
                     Motown musicians, including Michael Jackson and Parliament Funkadelic. This footage

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42">Next, the "Flow" corner featured an aromatherapy diffuser with a lavender scent. This
                     corner encouraged audience members to close their eyes and tune into their other senses,
                     rather than fixating on the strict visual presence before them. One of the student
                     tracks
                     in this corner asks, "will I be able to find the space within me?" In this spirit,
                     this
                     corner encouraged audience members to look inward to find a sense of space. Lastly,
                     the
                     "Testimony" corner featured a variety of artifacts and instruments from African cultures,
                     which encouraged audience members to participate in the cathartic cleansing of testifying.
                     We adorned a table with a traditional African mud cloth, a bowl (symbolically full
                     of
                     water for cleansing hands and ears), candles, a tambourine, precious stones, an African
                     statue, and an African shield. The students felt that these objects would help bring
                     the
                     audience aesthetically closer to the testimonies in this corner's mixtape tracks,
                     and that
                     "the water" would help the audience embody the feeling of cleansing.

                     flowed
                     through the Cube to see the performance. Midway through the hour and fifteen-minute
                     performance, four students from the course <em class="emph">Improvised and Devised Performance</em>
                     taught by Devair Jeffries and Al Evangelista gave two ten-minute performances in the
                     Cyclorama, which responded to and evolved from the sounds in the space and the audience
                     in
                     the Cube. As intended, many audience members spent significant time seated in the
                     center
                     of the Cyclorama, examining the moving stars. From there, they charted their own courses
                     through the Cube, taking pictures and exchanging experiences. Students in our Afrofuturism
                     course floated through the space to provide guidance and answer questions as needed.

                     embodiment through sound and performance in the digital humanities classroom. Encouraging
                     students to think multimodally and asking them to reinvent and improvise with their
                     own
                     work supports an Afrofuturist pedagogy rooted in the theories of Gaskin and Locke.
                     It also
                     supports a broader digital humanities pedagogy. By asking students to rethink their
                     work
                     in a performance setting, this assignment asks students to form a more intimate and
                     embodied relationship with the creative works studied. Rather than passively quoting
                     from
                     these works, students are asked to envision how these works can be presented so that
                     they
                     will be engaging to a live audience. In doing so, they behave as Afrofuturist creators,
                     many of whom are live performers. Much of this process can be replicated in any digital
                     humanities course in which instructors want students to embody the perspectives of
                     the
                     creators and artists being studied, particularly those courses in which the syllabus
                     contains performance art.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">Given the importance of access to audio, we want to specifically address one major
                     challenge and opportunity for the assignment. During the <em class="emph">Sound of Space</em>
                     performance, community members from the Virginia Tech and Blacksburg area engaged
                     in
                     conversation with each other, members of the Afrofuturism class, and Afrofuturist
                     art. The
                     result was not a performance in which audience members and artists were sharply
                     demarcated, but rather one in which both parties freely exchanged ideas on a level
                     playing
                     field. This holds its roots in Gaskins's idea that in Afrofuturism, "improvisation,
                     call
                     and response, hacking, and tinkering elicit the active engagement and participation
                     of the
                     at-large community (audience)" [<a class="ref" href="#gaskins2016">Gaskins 2016</a>, 29]. Similarly, the
                     intellectual mixtape was created as a means of letting students engage in deep
                     conversation with the works of Afrofuturist artists, rather than analyzing Afrofuturist
                     work as critics or passive third-party observers/reviewers. In both cases, the goal
                     was to
                     synthesize and/or juxtapose the interpreter's (student's or audience member's) own
                     artistic voice with that of the artist. However, this collage-style-artistic practice
                     is
                     discouraged by US Copyright Law. Creating the intellectual mixtape may even constitute
                     copyright infringement.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">Under the US Code of Laws, a "derivative work" such as the intellectual mixtape requires
                     a "master use" license, which can only be obtained by mutual agreement between the
                     owner
                     of the recording and the licensee [17 US Code, § 106]. In the case of the intellectual
                     mixtape, the owners of the recordings were mostly large record labels too difficult
                     to
                     contact in such a short time frame.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e614">[6]</a> The legal penalties for not obtaining proper licenses are unduly
                     severe. Statutory Damages for each case of infringement can be up to $30,000 [17 US
                     Code,
                     § 504c]. This means that in this Afrofuturism course, damages could total $900,000.

                     ought to undergo revision. US Copyright law privileges research on music over a century

                     Law
                     discourages a serious embodiment of any musical recording, which is a fundamental
                     pillar
                     of the Afrofuturist mixtape.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e626">[8]</a> In our class, many students had samples that were longer than 10% of a song. This
                     was because students were encouraged to converse with the discourses of Afrofuturism
                     and
                     use them in their own creative process. In the spirit of Bakhtin's internally persuasive
                     discourse, we want to encourage academic work that is "affirmed through assimilation,
                     tightly interwoven with 'one's own word...' half-ours and half-someone else's" [<a class="ref" href="#bakhtin1991">Bakhtin 1991</a>]. We hope for our students to engage with the material in a way
                     which forces them to converse with and think carefully through the discourses of
                     Afrofuturist creators so that they become creators themselves, rather than limiting
                     themselves to short quotations that could subordinate or elevate their perspectives.
                     In
                     contrast, we argue for the Afrofuturist techno-vernacular creativity identified by
                     Nettrice Gaskins, in which the reappropriation of cultural artifacts is part of
                     "counter-dominant social or political systems" [<a class="ref" href="#gaskins2016">Gaskins 2016</a>]. We feel this
                     reappropriation should be uninhibited by legal regulation and encourage our students
                     to
                     join the continuum of borrowing and remixing that is so fundamental to Afrofuturist
                     work.

                     and easy to execute in a digital humanities classroom. In inviting audience members
                     into
                     the classroom, we underscore the importance of having the intellectual mixtapes be
                     a part
                     of a large-networked conversation, rather than a unidirectional discourse. It is
                     imperative that this work is viewed through the lens of community, and not just as
                     an
                     artifact of the academic system. As Brandon Locke notes, "Media and information literacies
                     and multimodal and digital writing skills are essential for effective communication
                     and
                     civic engagement now and in the future, and liberal arts courses must engage with
                     them"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#locke2018">Locke 2018</a>]. Any digital humanities classroom could host a reception of
                     any kind as part of the midterm or final. In the case of the intellectual mixtape,
                     community members could gather together to eat food, explore the student work that
                     has
                     been created, and discuss their own reactions to the student work with each other,
                     the
                     teacher, or the students themselves.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p54">The intellectual mixtape assignment is an approach to teaching in liberal arts and
                     digital humanities that promotes multimodal scholarship and artistic creation. The
                     seven-part assignment teaches students skills such as audio-editing, process writing,
                     and
                     performing. Though students are asked to make their mixtape tracks in conversation
                     with
                     the recordings they sample, students are also asked to be authorities on their own
                     tracks.
                     The assignment thus emphasizes the importance of students developing their own voice
                     and
                     developing their own sound in order to develop flow. The conversations they create
                     through
                     these interwoven audio recordings constitute internally persuasive discourse and promote
                     empathic engagement both in the intellectual mixtape assignment and in the <em class="emph">Sound of
                        Space</em> performance.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p55">The mixtapes and performance were Afrofuturist appropriations and improvisational
                     conversations in which, without being prompted, all students took on other identities
                     in
                     order to express themselves. While this approach to learning and scholarship is primed
                     for
                     delivery in liberal arts and digital humanities courses, Copyright Law in the United
                     States often inhibits legal use of the intellectual mixtape assignment. It is especially
                     dubious when working with contemporary works, like those found in the body of Afrofuturist
                     work. Even so, the intellectual mixtape is a viable assignment that encourages flow
                     and
                     expression of their individual world views. A digital humanities pedagogy with
                     Afrofuturist intellectual mixtapes is one more step towards a more equitable and engaging
                     future for liberal arts education and the digital humanities.

                     this

                     intellectual mixtape Assignment from David Green who had assigned the intellectual
                     mixtape as a flexible type of annotated bibliography to his graduate students at Howard
                     University.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e410"><span class="noteRef lang en">[5] It is important to note that the
                     intellectual mixtape assignment is clearly a part of the jazz tradition, particularly
                     through the aesthetics of improvisation and conversation. This tradition is examined
                     in
                     the course, especially through the music and teachings of Sun Ra. Also, DJ Kool Herc's
                     example of sampling "Seven Minutes of Funk" is a nod to Afrofuturism through the funk
                     genre's connection to black freedom, utopianism, and the space age.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e614"><span class="noteRef lang en">[6] There are two ways of avoiding copyright
                     infringement in creating an Intellectual Mixtape, but all pose problems: 1) Using
                     music
                     for which the copyright has deliberately been waived by the artist; 2) Negotiating
                     master use licenses with independent artists. Both options provide little help because
                     music of these categories generally come from small independent artists who are rarely
                     popular enough to have had a large cultural impact. If students performed a study
                     using
                     only these songs, they would be prevented from exploring the core and popular texts
                     of
                     Afrofuturism.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e620"><span class="noteRef lang en">[7] As of
                     Donald Trump's 2018 signing of the Music Modernization Act, music copyright generally
                     lasts a century. However, a significant number of Afrofuturist music was published
                     within the last half a century. This means that most significant Afrofuturist works
                     are
                     still protected under US Copyright Law.</span></div>
               <div class="endnote" id="d4e626"><span class="noteRef lang en">[8] Fair Use, as defined in the Copyright Act of 1976, is
                     a law which permits brief excerpts of copyrighted material to be used under certain
                     circumstances, including when it is for education, scholarship, or research [17 US
                     Code, § 106]. Given this provision, one might hope that the intellectual mixtape would
                     be considered Fair Use. While the US Code provides no strict definition for
                     determining Fair Use, this does not appear to be the case [17 US Code, § 106].<br /><br />
                     The US Code of Law provides guidelines for determining Fair Use in lieu of a strict
                     definition [17 US Code, § 106]. Whether or not a particular case constitutes Fair
                     Use
                     is left up to the courts to determine. Therefore, any educator can be taken to court
                     for copyright infringement, even if their case constitutes Fair Use. The US Copyright
                     Office attempts to provide some guidance for these court decisions [<a class="ref" href="#united2016">United States Copyright Circular 2016</a>, 21]. However, it is not clear how these guidelines
                     apply, because they were developed by a committee of Music Publishers and Music
                     Educators in 1976 for the music classroom, not for digital humanities classrooms.
                     However, one provision states that: "For other than performance, single or multiple
                     copies of excerpts may be made, provided that the excerpts do not comprise a
                     'performable unit as a section,' and never more than 10% of the work, and only one
                     copy per pupil." This suggests that the intellectual mixtape may be legal so long
                     as
                     only 10% of each song is used. However, for a typical three-minute song, this is only
                     about 18 seconds.<br /><br />
