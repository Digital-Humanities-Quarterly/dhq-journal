      <dhq:abstract>
        <p>This article is a classroom case study of the Intellectual Mixtape Project, an
          AudioVisual digital humanities module. The intellectual mixtape uses jazz and hip hop as
          a framework to create an audio compilation and “conversation” that samples
          literary-audio texts (such as SunRa speeches, Octavia Butler interviews, Tracy K. Smith’s
          poetry readings, etc.). Each track of the intellectual mixtape has three audios: 1) the
          literary-audio texts from the syllabus, 2) the students’ voice in their own words, and 3)
          an audio of the students’ choice. As a companion to each track, students write 500 words
          of liner notes that must include the title of their track and their curation and mixing
          decisions.Students then publish their entire intellectual mixtape (three or more tracks)
          with original or <soCalled>remixed</soCalled> cover art on an online platform.</p>
        <p>The first part of the study will discuss the structure of the intellectual
          mixtape assignments. In these assignments, students are provided with literary-audio
          texts, required to complete and submit audio homework assignments, and taught the basics
          of audio editing. This method of teaching and analyzing literature shifts the practice
          of literary analysis from top down approaches that privileges the authority of the text
          and instead encourages the student to <soCalled>converse</soCalled> with the text to
          create new knowledge. This methods also reflects the artistic practice of Afrofuturist
          artists and theorist who improvise, remix, and sample to create their work.</p>
        <p>The second part of the study will discuss a performance and midterm adaptation of
          the Intellectual Mixtape Project entitled Sound of Space: An Interactive
          Afrofuturist Experience. <title rend="quotes">Sound of Space</title> was an immersive
          performance with four-sensory stations that featured Afrofuturist themes. The midterm
          adaptation was showcased in the Cube, a four-story high, state-of-the-art multimedia black
          box theater at Virginia Tech. In preparation for the performance, students merged sound
          engineering, 360 degree-video-projection, improvisational performance, and light design.
            <title rend="quotes">Sound of Space</title> introduced students and audiences’ to an
          immersive Afrofuturist-audio experience and pushed the boundaries of literary
          analysis.</p>
        <p>The third part of the study will address challenges with the Intellectual Mixtape
          Project. Challenges include finding relevant literary-audio texts and dealing with the
          many limitations imposed by U.S. copyright law. Some ways to address the
          challenges imposed by U.S. copyright law might be to 1) reclassify sampling audio as a
          form of quotation, 2) use databases of copyright-free music, 3) find culturally
          significant works from lesser-known artists who will license their tracks, and/or 4) pay
          royalties.</p>

        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>In "Afrofuturism to Vibranium and Beyond," a cross-listed graduate and undergraduate
          English special topics course, taught by Tyechia Thompson and assisted by Dashiel Carrera
          (GTA) at Virginia Tech, we engaged several theoretical and artistic frameworks for
          defining Afrofuturism. One such definition was from Reynaldo Anderson and Charles E.
          Jones's edited collection <emph>Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro Blackness</emph>, in
          which they defined Afrofuturism 2.0 as:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity
              reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network
              software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences,
              enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative
              sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic
              techno-cultural Pan African movement. <ptr target="#anderson2016" loc="8"/></quote>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <p>This definition was current and broad enough to cover all the three modules of the
          course, including the first module, which was the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape
          assignment. For this assignment, students took several samples from selected audio
          recordings on the syllabus and added their own voice and another audio recording of their
          choosing. Students then wrote "liner notes" in which they discussed their choice of
          samples, the use of their own voice, and how these choices connect to larger discourses
          within Afrofuturism. As such, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment made use of
          hacking and/or appropriating as well as deep remixability while engaging a multitude of
          discourses that make up Afrofuturistic expression.</p>
        <p>In the course, we also engaged other definitions of Afrofuturism such as Alondra Nelson's
          2002 articulation of the term as "'African American voices' with 'other stories to tell
          about culture, technology and things to come.' The term [Afrofuturism] was chosen as the
          best umbrella for the concerns of 'the list' [the AfroFuturism (AF) listserv] — as it has
          come to be known by its members — sci-fi imagery, futurist themes, and technological
          innovation in the African diaspora'" (9). Nelson's definition was fitting for our
          literature course that brought together sci-fi, futurist, and technological stories by
          Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor, Wanuri Kahiu, among others. Moreover, Ytasha Womack's
          succinct definition of Afrofuturism as "an intersection of imagination, technology, the
          future and liberation" from her book <emph>Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and
            Fantasy Culture</emph>, which introduces readers to the paradigm of Afrofuturism, was
          useful for engaging the works of several artists and the major discourses of Afrofuturism
          in preparation for the intellectual mixtape assignment.</p>
        <p>Teaching Afrofuturism works within the intellectual mixtape assignment was an innovative
          method of teaching and analyzing literature and composition techniques that shifted the
          practice of literary and cultural analysis from top-down approaches that privileged the
          authority of academic or assigned "texts" to student-centered mixing that encouraged the
          use of audio, images, and text to create new knowledge. This assignment is within
          particular traditions of Africana studies and rhetoric and composition, in which students
          are encouraged and taught to improvise, remix, and sample in order to create distinctive
          work <ptr target="#carter2019"/>. In particular, the intellectual mixtape assignment also
          imparts skills such as audio editing, process writing, thematic-website-template building
          as well as collaboration and performance.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment is what Bryan Carter would
          consider digital Africana studies and what Kim Gallon refers to as Black digital
          humanities. Carter's digital Africana studies is an approach to "using a number of digital
          tools to help us experience Africana studies very differently and to help students express
          their understanding of whatever that course content happens to be very very differently"
            <ptr target="#carter2019"/>. Carter's approach is innovative, technological, and
          pedagogical yet grounded in the field of Africana studies. Similarly, the Afrofuturist
          intellectual mixtape assignment is grounded in digital Africana studies (since
          Afrofuturism is a part of Africana studies), and the technologies taught in the assignment
          are used to strengthen students' understanding of Afrofuturism in unconventional ways.
          Additionally, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape is a black digital humanities
          assignment, for it "reveals how methodological approaches for studying and thinking about
          the category of blackness may come to bear on and transform the digital processes and
          tools used to study humanity" <ptr target="#gallon2016"/>. In <emph>Afrofuturism to
            Vibranium and Beyond</emph>, the category of blackness becomes the categories of
          blackness as the students study, critique, and create counter histories, alternate
          destinies, and posthuman identities through the aesthetics of their mixtape tracks and
          their interactive Afrofuturist performance, which are featured later in this article.</p>
        <p>As the title suggests, this article is a case study of the Afrofuturist intellectual
          mixtape assignment. It proceeds as follows: we first describe the seven-part layout of the
          Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment. Next, we provide three key aspects to
          teaching the intellectual mixtape assignment. Then we discuss additional approaches that
          buttress our analysis of the students' mixtapes in connection to digital humanities and
          Afrofuturism. Subsequently, we discuss sampling, conversing, and "flowing" in relation to
          these approaches and examine three examples of students' work. Afterward, we describe the
          process of preparing for the students' midterm performance in which their mixtapes were
          curated and shared with a public audience. In the final part of the article, we question
          whether US Copyright Law is antithetical to multimodal digital literacy studies, flow, and
          empathic engagement with Afrofuturist source texts, and speculate about future uses of the
          intellectual mixtape.</p>

        <head>Intellectual Mixtape Assignment: Project Description</head>
        <p>The intellectual mixtape is an audio-visual-textual assignment with seven-parts. In part
          one, students listened to recordings (such as lectures, poems, songs, interviews, etc.)
          that were assigned (on the syllabus) for homework and class discussion. For the second
          part, students learned the basics of audio editing in order to create their first tracks
          of the intellectual mixtape. The first audio editing assignment asked students to
          improvise in order to learn how to edit audio; therefore, from the beginning, Afrofuturist
          concepts were pedagogically centered. Their track selections and the mixing decisions
          were, for the most part, impromptu. For the third part, students created the first of
          three audio tracks, which was 1 min long. All audio tracks included at least three regions
          of audio: a sample from audio on the syllabus, a region with their own voice in their own
          words, and a region of their choosing. As a companion to each track, students wrote 500
          words of liner notes that included a title for the track and their curation and mixing
          decisions. For the fourth part, students created a second track that was 1.5 minutes in
          length. The second track was a collaboration with another student in the course; it also
          featured a sample from the syllabus, a region with their own voices in their own words,
          and a region of their choosing with liner notes. The fifth part of the assignment was a
          third audio track that was between 1.5 to 2 minutes in length, and collaboration was
          optional; the third track had the same criteria for regions and liner notes. For the sixth
          part, the students posted their three-track mixtape online (often in a web template
          service such as Wix) with liner notes and included "remixed" or original cover art. In
          part seven, students performed the intellectual mixtape. In seven weeks, the intellectual
          mixtape assignment taught students skills such as audio editing, process writing,
          audio-visual synchronizing, thematic-website-template building as well as collaboration
          and performance.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Setting-Up the Assignment</head>
        <p>In order to prepare students to create their mixtapes, we made sure each student had the
          resources that they needed to succeed. It is important to note that it was not enough for
          students to have access to the material; it was beneficial that the students engaged with
          the material in homework assignments and class discussions prior to recording their
          intellectual mixtapes. When students were exposed to the material prior to creating their
          intellectual mixtapes, they had additional contexts to build upon. Here, we will highlight
          three strategies that were instrumental to the success of the assignment–syllabus design,
          a tech survey, and a workshop on audio-editing. First, curating the syllabus required
          finding sufficient recordings–preferably MP3 for the intellectual mixtape assignment — and
          making those recordings available on the syllabus. When there was material essential to
          the study of Afrofuturism that was not available in an audio or video recording, it was
          kept on the syllabus and paired with audio dealing with the same subject. For instance,
          Samuel R. Delany's short story "aye, and Gomorrah" was course reading, and it was paired
          with an audio interview with Delany. Furthermore, the syllabus only included recordings
          that were primary sources in which the Afrofuturist artists, scholars, activists, and/or
          practitioners spoke about their own work. The videos were selected from platforms such as
          YouTube and Vimeo and then converted to MP3s. There are two distinctions that determined
          how the audio/video recordings were featured on the syllabus: videos that were
          "live-action" of the Afrofuturist were added to the syllabus directly, but videos that
          were slideshows of still photos were converted to MP3 and put on the syllabus as MP3s.</p>
        <p>Second, we began the course with a tech survey to get an inventory of the students' tech
          needs and to assess their exposure and comfort with the technologies we would use in
            class.<note>Tyechia Thompson first used a tech survey in her courses in 2016 at the
            recommendation of Bryan Carter, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Digital Humanities,
            which was the first year she taught the intellectual mixtape assignment in its current
            iteration.</note> Our survey had eight questions and was distributed on Survey Monkey a
          week before classes began.<note><ref target="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZB7KSPS"
              >https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZB7KSPS</ref></note> The survey helped us to determine
          if students would need loaner equipment and whether they would work with Audacity or
          GarageBand to learn audio-editing or if we would teach both; it also determined our
          approach to teaching audio-editing so that the students were comfortable enough with the
          audio-editing software to complete the assignment.</p>
        <p>Third, we taught the students GarageBand or Audacity, which was a learning objective for
          the intellectual mixtape assignment. Teaching an overview of audio-editing required some
          preparation before class such as requiring that everyone had headphones and GarageBand or
          Audacity (with Lame encoder) installed on their computers by the start of class, creating
          a shared drive that was available with MP3/WAV files for students to select audio
          recordings, and disseminating written instructions of what we were covering in class while
          facilitating a live demonstration. We also made a screencast of the demonstration
          available, so students could watch later. We gave the students fourteen tasks to complete
          after they opened the program.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head>Handout given to students that chose to use Audacity.</head>

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png" style="height: 300px;"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The students' execution of the audio-editing practice assignment was fast-paced and
          improvisational. Because of the time constraints, students worked quickly and
          performatively in a way that they normally would not. They learned and created their
          practice mixtape tracks on the fly. As a result, we were not concerned if the practice
          track made sense, and it was not significant if the track stopped abruptly. Instead, when
          this assignment was assessed, we checked to see if 1) we had received the assignment as an
          MP3 or as a WAV file, 2) the assignment was 1 minute in length, 3) the track had three
          different regions in which one was the student's voice, 4) the track included a fade-in or
          fade-out at some point in the recording, and 5) the track had an effect (it could be a
          duplicate sound, reverbs, etc.). This assessment gave us an indication of whether or not
          the students understood the basics of audio-editing and could build on this knowledge to
          complete the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape project.</p>
        <p>Curating the syllabus with sufficient and appropriate audio recordings that featured the
          Afrofuturist artists, scholars, activists, and/or practitioners discussing their work was
          the substratum of the intellectual mixtape assignment. It was the basis of how the
          students developed flow, sampled, and engaged in internally persuasive discourse and
          techno-vernacular creativity. Creating the tech survey allowed us to prepare for our
          students and guarantee that they had access to equipment and software, as well as ample
          time to finish assignments. Without this kind of preparation, the course could have been
          bottle-necked by the technology and diverted focus from the course content. Finally,
          teaching the basics of audio-editing was one aspect that makes the intellectual mixtape
          assignment a digital humanities project. The assignment was multimodal and encouraged
          students to develop their own voices.</p>

        <head>A Layered Approach to the Intellectual Mixtape</head>
        <p>In Brandon T. Locke's article "Digital Humanities Pedagogy as Essential Liberal
          Education: A Framework for Curriculum Development" in the <emph>Digital Humanities
            Quarterly</emph> special issue <emph>Imagining the DH Undergraduate: Special Issue in
            Undergraduate Education in DH</emph>, he provides a framework for digital humanities
          projects or what he calls digital liberal arts curriculum. He argues that the liberal arts
          are well suited for the integration of digital skills, given the course goals of liberal
          arts courses. He writes:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">Educators in the liberal arts must continue to grapple with emerging
              forms of communication and analysis, or we risk leaving our students lacking in
              critical areas of the liberal arts. Media and information literacies and multimodal
              and digital writing skills are essential for effective communication and civic
              engagement now and in the future, and liberal arts courses must engage with them. This
              flexible and extensible framework offers one fruitful route, by developing digital
              humanities projects intended to impart such skills while engaging with domain-specific

        <p>Locke uses the term "domain" to suggest the discipline of a specialist that is taught to
          students alongside technical objectives. Locke's framework is useful for understanding the
          intellectual mixtape assignment. This assignment, as presented in the course
            <emph>Afrofuturism to Vibranium and Beyond,</emph> engaged the domain-specific content
          of Afrofuturism alongside media and communication literacies. The intellectual mixtape
          assignment met the course outcomes for many liberal arts courses through teaching skills
          such as process writing, collaborating, engaging discourses, articulating one's
          perspective, text and audio-editing, and managing projects.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Nettrice R. Gaskins' essay "Afrofuturism on Web 3.0" in Reynaldo Anderson
          and Charles E. Jones's <emph>Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness</emph> provides
          another useful framework for understanding the intellectual mixtape assignment. Gaskins's
          methodology of techno-vernacular creativity is reflected in the intellectual mixtape
          assignment. In the essay, Gaskins describes techno-vernacular creativity as a creation
          method consisting of appropriation, improvisation, and reinvention. In terms of
          appropriation, Gaskins writes that Afrofuturists "reclaim cultural artifacts, often to
          counter dominant social or political systems" <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="30"/>.
          Appropriation of a similar kind was evident in the intellectual mixtape assignment.
          Students appropriated recordings (sample) from the syllabus and used those recordings to
          create or center their own world views. Gaskins describes Afrofuturists improvisations as
          "performing, creating, problem-solving, or reacting in the moment and in response to one's
          environment and inner feelings" <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="30–31"/>. In the
          intellectual mixtape assignment, students improvised their audio-editing demonstration by
          learning and making creative decisions quickly (as noted above), and they also improvised
          during their performance in the Cube when they interacted with audience members.<note>How
            we taught audio-editing and how the students created the interactive Afrofuturist
            experience in the Cube at Virginia Tech will be described in more detail later in this
            essay.</note> Lastly, Gaskins describes reinvention (of the self) as techno-vernacular
          creativity due to the way "Afrofuturists often use digital and non-digital avatars as
          tools for transcendence, reinvention, or for existing in and moving between worlds or
          realities" <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="31"/>.</p>
        <p>Reinvention (of the self) was adopted by most students creating futuristic content who
          took on a pseudonym such as Grim Reaper, FutureShe, or StarGirl for the intellectual
          mixtape assignment. This reinvention of the self is significant because students model
          this Afrofuturists aesthetic without prompting. The use of appropriation (sampling),
          improvisation, and reinvention within the intellectual mixtape assignment are just some of
          the ways that the students' mixtapes are created from an Afrofuturists framework. Locke's
          and Gaskins's frameworks in digital humanities and Afrofuturism, respectively, show how
          this assignment integrates a digital liberal arts curriculum as well as Afrofuturist
          techno-vernacular creativity.</p>
        <p>Our framing of digital humanities and Afrofuturism in the intellectual mixtape assignment
          was a dialogic process, specifically an internally persuasive discourse. In <emph>Dialogic
            Imagination</emph>, Mikhail Bakhtin defines internally persuasive discourse as "more
          akin to retelling a text in one's own words, with one's own accents, gestures,
          modifications" <ptr target="#bakhtin1991" loc="424"/>. Bakhtin's concept claims that one's
          own word is already interwoven with someone else's words, and this interweaving creates
          new words. As such, the intellectual mixtape was an application of internally persuasive
          discourse in that students selected audio from the syllabus and synthesized it with and/or
          juxtaposed it against their own voice. The students' mixed/assimilated the recordings and
          created their own perspectives. Bakhtin's internally persuasive discourse provides a
          useful framework for understanding how students developed their own discourses in the
          intellectual mixtape.</p>
        <p>Though varied, Locke's, Gaskins', and Bakhtin's frameworks and methods show the layered
          approach to teaching and executing the intellectual mixtape assignment. The assignment's
          goals (audio editing, process writing, composing, collaborating, etc.) are prevalent
          within the liberal arts and incorporate the use of media technologies. This approach to
          teaching Afrofuturism encouraged students to engage and create using Afrofuturists methods
          of appropriation, improvisation, and reinvention of the self. Also, through the dialogic
          process of creating the intellectual mixtape tracks, students had an opportunity to
          develop their own ideas in conversation with the assigned Afrofuturists recordings.</p>

        <head>Flowing Through Conversation and Sampling</head>
        <p>In "Flow as a Metaphor for Changing Composition Practices," David Green addresses the
          importance of students developing and expressing authority, fluency, and flow with
          language through hip hop as a model for composition.<note>Tyechia Thompson sampled the
            intellectual mixtape Assignment from David Green who had assigned the intellectual
            mixtape as a flexible type of annotated bibliography to his graduate students at Howard
            University.</note> Specifically, Green defines flow as "a construct that helps to
          clarify and usefully extend discussions about language, diversity, invention, and voice"
            <ptr target="#green2017" loc="175"/>. Green's articulation of flow comes from a position
          that critical writing is not limited to academic writing and that students, in particular,
          can benefit from critiquing standardized English to develop flexible writing practices
          that include vernacular in order to engage various audiences, traditions, and histories.
          Green writes that "flow provides an interesting way of positioning writing for students by
          focusing discussions of language and composing on features such as rhythm, vernacular
          eloquence, layering, and rupture in ways that press for newer considerations of language
          and literature within English studies" <ptr target="#green2017" loc="176"/>. Green's
          exploration of how flow can be incorporated in English composition courses was a
          springboard for the intellectual mixtape project, which adopted Green's concept of flow
          into audio-visual and written compositions in <emph>Afrofuturism: To Vibranium and
            Beyond</emph>.</p>
        <p>Flow as a nonstandard, flexible writing practice is expanded when adopted in text and
          audio compositions. In creating their intellectual mixtapes, students used the techniques
          of sampling and conversing to contextualize their discourse and world views and to further
          develop their own meanings — their flow. Moreover, the students who created intellectual
          mixtapes were composing within the tradition that DJ Kool Herc, a founder of hip hop
          music, created when he isolated and repeated the breakbeat on records, which allowed for
          him to create his own meaning through looping part of the song. His technique allowed for
          other contexts of the beat (how it would be used–sampling), expanded the conversation of
          the beat (where the beat would be heard), and developed an expression for future flows to
          emerge.</p>
        <p>In an interview on <emph>Fresh Air</emph>, Kool Herc describes finding records to expose
          to his audience and watching his audience's anticipation of a record's breakbeat. He
          states:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">When we first heard a record called "Seven Minutes of Funk." We
              heard it in a place called (um) at Hunt's Point. And Jay-Z used it, and a few other
              people used that same record. And that came out of my collection. And when we played
              that record, or what we did, Coke [La Rock] did it. Coke put the record on, and we all
              walked off the stage. <ptr target="#herc2005"/></quote>

        <p><ref target="resources/audio/audio03.mp3"> Interview with DJ Kool Herc on <emph>Fresh
              Air</emph>. </ref></p>
        <p>What DJ Kool Herc describes above are contexts and conversations that emerge from the
          record "Seven Minutes of Funk." He explains how each iteration of "Seven Minutes of Funk"
          flows with its own meaning and authority–whether it is from Jay-Z's "Ain't No Nigga" or
          YG's "Why You Always Hatin." Furthermore, though DJ Kool Herc's technique is a founding
          aesthetic of hip hop music, it is improvisational because Herc and Coke La Rock provide an
          improvisational conversation between the song and the live audience, and because the
          sample (appropriation) is reinvented in each iteration by artists such as Jay-Z and YG
          (which is also a conversation).<note>It is important to note that the intellectual mixtape
            assignment is clearly a part of the jazz tradition, particularly through the aesthetics
            of improvisation and conversation. This tradition is examined in the course, especially
            through the music and teachings of Sun Ra. Also, DJ Kool Herc's example of sampling
            "Seven Minutes of Funk" is a nod to Afrofuturism through the funk genre's connection to
            black freedom, utopianism, and the space age.</note> This same process of sampling and
          conversing was the basis of the intellectual mixtape assignment, and it is what created
          flow in David Green's articulation of the term. It was in students' flow–their intentions,
          voice, self-acceptance, and diversity–that emerged in this assignment. We will now examine
          three tracks for how students' flow was expressed.</p>
        <p>An intellectual mixtape track "Xe3" (pronounced Chi) by TSaunds featured conversation and
          flow. In "Xe3," TSaunds sampled "Tales of Dr. Funkenstein," "Venus Fly" by Grimes and
          Janelle Monáe, and "Window Licker" by Aphex Twin. TSaunds mixing of these audio recordings
          led to his creation of a story of a young man being teleported from his apartment to Xe3
          (a planet in another universe) through a funky Spotify transmission. In the liner notes,
          TSaunds wrote:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">I used this beat [a sound effect from "Window Licker"] because it
              connects to George Clinton's claim that P-Funk is constantly evolving and always
              present to those who want the funk and its liberty. In fact, the funk and its
              vibrations [are] what help the young man be connected with Xe3. Additionally, Grimes
              is one of my favorite artists and her collaboration with Janelle Monáe on the song and
              music video is pure genius and sci-fi. Layered with this beat are various clips of
              audio from <emph>Tales of Dr. Funkenstein</emph>. <ptr target="#tsaunds2019"/></quote>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <p><ref target="resources/audio/audio04.mp3"> Track "Xe3" created by student artist TSaunds.
          </ref></p>
        <p>TSaunds explained that he is evolving P-funk through his sampling of a sound effect from
          "Window Licker." He used the liberty of P-funk to sample Grimes and Janelle Monáe and
          further develop a sci-fi sound. He also sampled several excerpts from <emph>Tales of Dr.
            Funkenstein</emph>, a documentary on George Clinton, for the additional context of
          P-funk. TSaunds flow emerged as the unique story he told of a liberating teleportation,
          and it was a direct result of the conversations with the tracks he sampled.</p>
        <p>There are two Afrofuturist tracks where self-acceptance emerged from flow. The first
          track is titled "FAT GYALS" by Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl. The students who created
          this track used humor, irony, and pain to challenge stereotypes and assumptions about
          black women and their bodies. They presented a series of images for the "Fat Girl Starter
          Pack" that include "cookies before and after dinner," "eating just because I can," "great
          singer — must be gospel, must be soul, must be pain," "can I do anything for more than 10
          minutes?," and "arms that won't stretch all the way around." Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl
          strengthened their conversation by speaking at the same time, repeating and/or responding
          to each other. They also affirmed all body types through the track's intro that featured
          an audio excerpt from the movie <emph>Phat Girlz</emph> in which the character Jazmin
          Biltmore (Mo'Nique) and her friend Stacey are ordering food at a fast-food restaurant. In
          the film, Stacey proceeds to order for Jazmin (on the skinny side of the menu), but Jazmin
          modifies the order and adds "the works." Additionally, Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl
          aligned themselves and their images with G/god when they sampled Erykah Badu's lyrics from
          "On and On" that "If we were made in his image then call us by our names/Most intellects
          do not believe in god, but they fear us just the same." In their liner notes, Lauren
          Garretson and Starg*rl wrote, "all our complexities around body and food and womanhood
          will not shut us out from a new world, planet, mothership connection or community of
          aliens." The track "FAT GYALS" was an Afrofuturist audio conversation about presence,
          inclusion, and acceptance. <ref target="resources/audio/audio05.mp3"> Track "FAT GYALS"
            created by student artists Starg*rl and Garretson. </ref>
        </p>
        <p>Flow was also demonstrated through sonic, rhetorical layering in the track "Space Less"
          by FutureShe. FutureShe began her track with a personal understanding of space and place
          that was framed by one of the most well-known Afrofuturist choruses, "space is the place"
          from Sun Ra's song, self-titled album, and film <emph>Space is the Place</emph>. While a
          context of Afrofuturist acceptance is suggested through the canonized song, FutureShe's
          flow presented otherness and doubt regarding the possibility of experiencing a utopic
          space outside of herself. She began the track stating, "Will there be space for me — for
          all of me?" Her voice also suggested that she must find her own space since elsewhere is
          inhabited by others. FutureShe then mixed FKA Twigs's "How's That" into her track. FKA
          Twigs's recording became a companion for her, initiating her to turn within. In her liner
          notes, FutureShe wrote, "I attempt to exemplify the sort of internal struggles and
          frustrations with space here on Earth that may eventually lead people to seek space,
          literally and figuratively, elsewhere." FutureShe's track was a flow that used samples to
          produce a perspective that the only space where we can truly be accepted is within
          ourselves. <ref target="resources/audio/audio06.mp3">Track <emph>space is the place</emph>
            created by student artist FutureShe. </ref></p>
        <p>The creation and performance of the intellectual mixtape provided opportunities for
          students to engage in popular, academic, and mystical discourses connected to
          Afrofuturists art and practices. The recordings that the students' sampled and mixed
          provided them with digital media skills used in the digital humanities. The process of
          audio editing also expanded how the students engaged with language, meaning, and
          interpretation in an English special topics course. This type of engagement permitted an
          internally persuasive discourse to be expressed–one in which the students' own ideas were
          accented from the words of others. Through their sampling and conversing with the assigned
          recordings, the intellectual mixtape assignment opened up opportunities for students to
          flow and express what mattered to them in terms of sound, perspective, acceptance, and
          diversity. The students' insights about Afrofuturism gained through the intellectual
          mixtape assignment became an interactive experience of Afrofuturism with empathy at the
          center of the creation.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Performing the Intellectual Mixtape</head>
        <p>The students also adapted their intellectual mixtapes to a performance environment. This
          supported our Afrofuturist pedagogical framework for two reasons. First, this assignment
          requires students to engage in a new multimodal form of performance. This is in line with
          Locke's vision of a multimodal future for liberal arts education. Second, the assignment
          requires students to reinvent and improvise as they adapt their mixtapes to a performance
          environment. While the Afrofuturist performance was on the syllabus and the course
          schedule, students were not instructed to create their mixtapes with their performance in
          mind. They had to rethink how to perform their mixtapes after they had already been
          created. Gaskin argues that improvisation and reinvention are an integral part of
          Afrofuturist artistic practice. In this way, the performance part of the assignment is
          also Afrofuturist.</p>
        <p>Performing the intellectual mixtape was predominately student-led and took 2-3 weeks. We
          asked thought-provoking questions and created an environment for students to apply
          Afrofuturists concepts, practices, and discourses to create their performance. <emph>Sound
            of Space: An Interactive Afrofuturist Experience</emph> was performed in the Cube, a
          42ft high performance and research space in the Moss Arts Center at Virginia Polytechnic
          Institute and State University. The Cube has a high-density loudspeaker array of 150
          loudspeakers. These loudspeakers spread around the entire perimeter, up the walls, and on
          the ceiling of the Cube to allow for fully immersive sound. The Cube is specially designed
          for spatial computer music research. Vector Based Amplitude Panning is used so that
          audience members can precisely pinpoint a sound source from any point in the room <ptr
            target="#lyon2016"/>. The Cube can fit up to 198 people and features the Cyclorama, an
          optional large 360-degree-panoramic projection wall in the center.</p>
        <p>In preparation for the midterm intellectual mixtape performance, we and staff members of
          the Institute for Creativity, Arts and Technology led discussions with the students about
          ways to adapt the mixtapes to the space, and we required that they apply their knowledge
          of Afrofuturism to create the performance. Students decided to create an environment in
          which the audience could freely navigate the space rather than having a fixed separation
          between the audience and the stage. This holds roots in an Afrofuturist ideal that the
          demarcation between artist and audience member results in an imbalanced power relationship
          that should be actively worked against <ptr target="#gaskins2016"/>. Students felt that
          this would allow the audience to fully embody the space in the spirit of the mixtape
          creation. They also argued that being able to float freely between different corners of
          the Cube would allow for improvisational movement that would reflect the Afrofuturist
          desire to find freedom in space. Students decided to make the Cyclorama the centerpiece of
          the exhibit. They projected an oscillating image of space and played ambient white noise
          (similar to that heard on an airplane or spaceship) from overhead. The Cyclorama, filled
          with the sound of space, served as the meditative home base from which the movement toward
          the Afrofuturist spatialized sounds took place.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure07">
          <head>Students preparing in the Cyclorama.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure07.jpg" style="height: 300px;"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The students then grouped the mixtapes into four categories that were played on a loop
          during the performance: Flow, Transport, Testimony, and Funk. The students felt that each
          of these categories was representative not only of their mixtapes as a whole but also of
          different themes within Afrofuturist discourse. "Flow" focused on the rhythm and
          transformation of the self, as in FutureShe's "Space Less," in which she explores how to
          carve out a space for herself as a black body on Earth. "Transport" focused on the African
          diaspora, Sankofa (a word in the Twi language and a Ghanian Adinkra symbol meaning "go
          back and get it," but also the title of a Haile Gerima film about abduction in the
          transatlantic slave trade), and alien abduction in science-fiction narratives (as in the
          film <emph>Space is the Place</emph>, in which Sun Ra is abducted by a group of white
          scientists working for NASA who hope to uncover how he travels through space). In
          "Testimony" students expressed, confessed, and preached their experiences with various
          forms of oppression, which reflects Sun Ra's testimony of his experience in <emph>Space is
            the Place</emph>. In "Funk," students focused on the Afrofuturist connection between
          creator and consumer, in which a liberating communal dance welcomes all (as is the case
          with Parliament Funkadelic's "We Got the Funk").</p>
        <p>Once the students' tracks were sorted into groups, each group was mixed, sequenced, and
          spliced into four singular looping audio tracks. Students utilized the Cube's unique
          ability to spatialize audio to have each of the tracks played from a different corner
          simultaneously. As audience members walked around the perimeter of the Cube, the sound of
          the next corner would slowly grow louder and the previous corner quieter until audience
          members were fully immersed in the sound of the next group. In this way, they were
          "transported" between each audio grouping–transportation, funk, flow, and
          testimony–spatially. This is reflective of Sun Ra's idea that creation is a form of
          teleportation as it is in <emph>Space is the Place</emph>. This slow gradient of mixed
          audio recordings was part of the students' design as well; the hope was that this blended
          and improvisational sound would reflect the sampling and mixing of the mixtapes. This
          balance had to be carefully checked by the GTA to make sure the sounds did not overwhelm
          and compete with one another.</p>
        <p>In addition to designing the space itself, students had to conceive of a title for the
          performance. We brainstormed the title for the performance over multiple meetings.
          Students played word association games and constructed "word salad" in order to think
          generatively about the language and spaces associated with Afrofuturism. As they continued
          to conceive of the title in relation to the space, they eventually arrived at "Sound of
          Space" to evoke the meditative "spaceship" sound played overhead in the Cyclorama.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure08">
          <head>Poster for Sound of Space performance.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure08.jpg" style="height: 300px;"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Though sound is the substratum of the <emph>Sound of Space</emph> performance, students
          wanted to communicate meaning and feeling through more than sound and space imagery in the
          Cyclorama. The students understood empathic engagement to be a core tenet to the creation
          of Afrofuturist art <ptr target="#hinton2018"/>. They added props and visual aids to each
          of the four corners of the Cube as a means of increasing empathic engagement with the
          audience. While 360-degree-virtual reality has been correlated to positive empathetic
          response, it was our hope that the 360-degree-panoramic projection wall of the Cyclorama
          and the interactive-immersive experience in the Cube would foster empathy and embodiment
          among audience members <ptr target="#bertrand2018"/>. To produce this, each person was
          asked to beat a Garifuna Drum upon entering the Cube.</p>
        <p>Additionally, for the "Transportation" corner, a montage of alien imagery and footage
          from the <emph>Blair Witch Project</emph> was created through the contribution of an
          undergraduate videographer. This footage allowed the audience to experience first-hand the
          jarring nature of alien and colonialist abduction. This footage was played on a loop.
          Also, the "Funk" corner also contained a looped montage but of various funk, dance, and
          Motown musicians, including Michael Jackson and Parliament Funkadelic. This footage was
          selected by the students, who found videos on Youtube they felt were aesthetically
          cohesive and sent them to the videographer. These images were meant to celebrate
          Afrofuturism as a form of embodied, innovative, eclectic, and physical expression.</p>

        <p>Next, the "Flow" corner featured an aromatherapy diffuser with a lavender scent. This
          corner encouraged audience members to close their eyes and tune into their other senses,
          rather than fixating on the strict visual presence before them. One of the student tracks
          in this corner asks, "will I be able to find the space within me?" In this spirit, this
          corner encouraged audience members to look inward to find a sense of space. Lastly, the
          "Testimony" corner featured a variety of artifacts and instruments from African cultures,
          which encouraged audience members to participate in the cathartic cleansing of testifying.
          We adorned a table with a traditional African mud cloth, a bowl (symbolically full of
          water for cleansing hands and ears), candles, a tambourine, precious stones, an African
          statue, and an African shield. The students felt that these objects would help bring the
          audience aesthetically closer to the testimonies in this corner's mixtape tracks, and that
          "the water" would help the audience embody the feeling of cleansing.</p>

        <p>The midterm intellectual mixtape performance took place on March 7th, 2019, in the middle
          of the afternoon. Members from both the Virginia Tech and the Blacksburg community flowed
          through the Cube to see the performance. Midway through the hour and fifteen-minute
          performance, four students from the course <emph>Improvised and Devised Performance</emph>
          taught by Devair Jeffries and Al Evangelista gave two ten-minute performances in the
          Cyclorama, which responded to and evolved from the sounds in the space and the audience in
          the Cube. As intended, many audience members spent significant time seated in the center
          of the Cyclorama, examining the moving stars. From there, they charted their own courses
          through the Cube, taking pictures and exchanging experiences. Students in our Afrofuturism
          course floated through the space to provide guidance and answer questions as needed.</p>

        <p>The <emph>Sound of Space</emph> performance serves as a useful model for exploring
          embodiment through sound and performance in the digital humanities classroom. Encouraging
          students to think multimodally and asking them to reinvent and improvise with their own
          work supports an Afrofuturist pedagogy rooted in the theories of Gaskin and Locke. It also
          supports a broader digital humanities pedagogy. By asking students to rethink their work
          in a performance setting, this assignment asks students to form a more intimate and
          embodied relationship with the creative works studied. Rather than passively quoting from
          these works, students are asked to envision how these works can be presented so that they
          will be engaging to a live audience. In doing so, they behave as Afrofuturist creators,
          many of whom are live performers. Much of this process can be replicated in any digital
          humanities course in which instructors want students to embody the perspectives of the
          creators and artists being studied, particularly those courses in which the syllabus
          contains performance art.</p>

      <div>
        <head>The Challenges of Copyright Law</head>
        <p>Given the importance of access to audio, we want to specifically address one major
          challenge and opportunity for the assignment. During the <emph>Sound of Space</emph>
          performance, community members from the Virginia Tech and Blacksburg area engaged in
          conversation with each other, members of the Afrofuturism class, and Afrofuturist art. The
          result was not a performance in which audience members and artists were sharply
          demarcated, but rather one in which both parties freely exchanged ideas on a level playing
          field. This holds its roots in Gaskins's idea that in Afrofuturism, "improvisation, call
          and response, hacking, and tinkering elicit the active engagement and participation of the
          at-large community (audience)" <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="29"/>. Similarly, the
          intellectual mixtape was created as a means of letting students engage in deep
          conversation with the works of Afrofuturist artists, rather than analyzing Afrofuturist
          work as critics or passive third-party observers/reviewers. In both cases, the goal was to
          synthesize and/or juxtapose the interpreter's (student's or audience member's) own
          artistic voice with that of the artist. However, this collage-style-artistic practice is
          discouraged by US Copyright Law. Creating the intellectual mixtape may even constitute
          copyright infringement.</p>
        <p>Under the US Code of Laws, a "derivative work" such as the intellectual mixtape requires
          a "master use" license, which can only be obtained by mutual agreement between the owner
          of the recording and the licensee [17 US Code, § 106]. In the case of the intellectual
          mixtape, the owners of the recordings were mostly large record labels too difficult to
          contact in such a short time frame.<note>There are two ways of avoiding copyright
            infringement in creating an Intellectual Mixtape, but all pose problems: 1) Using music
            for which the copyright has deliberately been waived by the artist; 2) Negotiating
            master use licenses with independent artists. Both options provide little help because
            music of these categories generally come from small independent artists who are rarely
            popular enough to have had a large cultural impact. If students performed a study using
            only these songs, they would be prevented from exploring the core and popular texts of
            Afrofuturism.</note> The legal penalties for not obtaining proper licenses are unduly
          severe. Statutory Damages for each case of infringement can be up to $30,000 [17 US Code,
          § 504c]. This means that in this Afrofuturism course, damages could total $900,000.</p>
        <p>US Copyright Law discourages the embodiment of Afrofuturist tracks despite the
          demonstrated pedagogical benefits. As such, we are left wondering if US Copyright Law
          ought to undergo revision. US Copyright law privileges research on music over a century
          old and many films prior to 1964, for which the copyright has already expired.<note>As of
            Donald Trump's 2018 signing of the Music Modernization Act, music copyright generally
            lasts a century. However, a significant number of Afrofuturist music was published
            within the last half a century. This means that most significant Afrofuturist works are
            still protected under US Copyright Law.</note> Music of this age predates most original
          recorded music, and in particular, all of the audio content that was included on the
          syllabus was created within the last 60 years.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, by limiting the appropriate sample length to 10% of a song, US Copyright Law
          discourages a serious embodiment of any musical recording, which is a fundamental pillar
          of the Afrofuturist mixtape.<note><p>Fair Use, as defined in the Copyright Act of 1976, is
              a law which permits brief excerpts of copyrighted material to be used under certain
              circumstances, including when it is for education, scholarship, or research [17 US
              Code, § 106]. Given this provision, one might hope that the intellectual mixtape would
              be considered Fair Use. While the US Code provides no strict definition for
              determining Fair Use, this does not appear to be the case [17 US Code, § 106].</p>
            <p>The US Code of Law provides guidelines for determining Fair Use in lieu of a strict
              definition [17 US Code, § 106]. Whether or not a particular case constitutes Fair Use
              is left up to the courts to determine. Therefore, any educator can be taken to court
              for copyright infringement, even if their case constitutes Fair Use. The US Copyright
              Office attempts to provide some guidance for these court decisions <ptr
                target="#united2016" loc="21"/>. However, it is not clear how these guidelines
              apply, because they were developed by a committee of Music Publishers and Music
              Educators in 1976 for the music classroom, not for digital humanities classrooms. One
              provision states that: "For other than performance, single or multiple copies of
              excerpts may be made, provided that the excerpts do not comprise a 'performable unit
              as a section,' and never more than 10% of the work, and only one copy per pupil." This
              suggests that the intellectual mixtape may be legal so long as only 10% of each song
              is used. However, for a typical three-minute song, this is only about 18 seconds.</p>
          </note> In our class, many students had samples that were longer than 10% of a song. This
          was because students were encouraged to converse with the discourses of Afrofuturism and
          use them in their own creative process. In the spirit of Bakhtin's internally persuasive
          discourse, we want to encourage academic work that is "affirmed through assimilation,
          tightly interwoven with 'one's own word...' half-ours and half-someone else's" <ptr
            target="#bakhtin1991"/>. We hope for our students to engage with the material in a way
          which forces them to converse with and think carefully through the discourses of
          Afrofuturist creators so that they become creators themselves, rather than limiting
          themselves to short quotations that could subordinate or elevate their perspectives. In
          contrast, we argue for the Afrofuturist techno-vernacular creativity identified by
          Nettrice Gaskins, in which the reappropriation of cultural artifacts is part of
          "counter-dominant social or political systems" <ptr target="#gaskins2016"/>. We feel this
          reappropriation should be uninhibited by legal regulation and encourage our students to
          join the continuum of borrowing and remixing that is so fundamental to Afrofuturist
          work.</p>
        <p>Additionally, in his 2010 Langston Hughes Visiting Professorship Lecture at the
          University of Kansas, Professor Adam Banks asks:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">Will we stand with a set of copyright and intellectual property
              codes, laws and conventions, that have pushed more and more severely in the direction
              of huge corporate interests...?</quote>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="figure14">

          <media mimeType="video/mp4" url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/508958639"/>
        </figure>
        <p>He also notes that every course syllabus forms "a mixtape compilation of other's text and
          ideas compiled, ranging, combines, with our own various critical gestures..." <ptr
            target="#banks2010"/>. As such, it seems antithetical to academic practice to have one
          form of compilation be suppressed while others are allowed to flourish. Why must we limit
          ourselves to short quotations of these audio text sources when we know full well that
          academic discourse is a constant resynthesis of existing ideas? Why should the
          intellectual mixtape be forced to conform to the narrative that sources of knowledge can
          be easily traced and attributed, when academic discourse often involves a recombination of
          internally persuasive ideas? We argue instead that in order for the digital humanities to
          more fully realize an Afrofuturist praxis, copyright law should be challenged just as it
          has been for decades by practitioners of Afrofuturist art.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>The various pedagogical methods here could be realized in any number of digital
          humanities classrooms, not just in the context of an Afrofuturism course.<note>Tyechia
            Thompson has used the intellectual mixtape assignment in five different courses
            (including an online course) at three different universities.</note> The ideas of remix,
          flow, and embodied knowledge are increasingly becoming a part of academic and artistic
          creation today. As such, it makes sense for other courses within liberal arts and social
          sciences, particularly those that have a substantial corpus of audio materials, to use the
          intellectual mixtape as a new form of academic discourse. The intellectual mixtape does
          not necessarily have to be a replacement for traditional academic discourses. It could be
          used in conjunction with traditional academic writing as a means of getting the student to
          engage with primary sources in as many ways as possible or as a way of prompting a student
          to engage empathically with a text before they use it to support their own theories.</p>
        <p>While replicating the performance in the Cube is near impossible because of the unique
          nature of the space, holding a reception for student art-scholarship is very compelling
          and easy to execute in a digital humanities classroom. In inviting audience members into
          the classroom, we underscore the importance of having the intellectual mixtapes be a part
          of a large-networked conversation, rather than a unidirectional discourse. It is
          imperative that this work is viewed through the lens of community, and not just as an
          artifact of the academic system. As Brandon Locke notes, "Media and information literacies
          and multimodal and digital writing skills are essential for effective communication and
          civic engagement now and in the future, and liberal arts courses must engage with them"
            <ptr target="#locke2018"/>. Any digital humanities classroom could host a reception of
          any kind as part of the midterm or final. In the case of the intellectual mixtape,
          community members could gather together to eat food, explore the student work that has
          been created, and discuss their own reactions to the student work with each other, the
          teacher, or the students themselves.</p>
        <p>The intellectual mixtape assignment is an approach to teaching in liberal arts and
          digital humanities that promotes multimodal scholarship and artistic creation. The
          seven-part assignment teaches students skills such as audio-editing, process writing, and
          performing. Though students are asked to make their mixtape tracks in conversation with
          the recordings they sample, students are also asked to be authorities on their own tracks.
          The assignment thus emphasizes the importance of students developing their own voice and
          developing their own sound in order to develop flow. The conversations they create through
          these interwoven audio recordings constitute internally persuasive discourse and promote
          empathic engagement both in the intellectual mixtape assignment and in the <emph>Sound of
            Space</emph> performance.</p>
        <p>The mixtapes and performance were Afrofuturist appropriations and improvisational
          conversations in which, without being prompted, all students took on other identities in
          order to express themselves. While this approach to learning and scholarship is primed for
          delivery in liberal arts and digital humanities courses, Copyright Law in the United
          States often inhibits legal use of the intellectual mixtape assignment. It is especially
          dubious when working with contemporary works, like those found in the body of Afrofuturist
          work. Even so, the intellectual mixtape is a viable assignment that encourages flow and
          expression of their individual world views. A digital humanities pedagogy with
          Afrofuturist intellectual mixtapes is one more step towards a more equitable and engaging
          future for liberal arts education and the digital humanities.</p>
