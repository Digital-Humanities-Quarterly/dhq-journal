        <div><head>Introduction</head>
        <p>In "Afrofuturism to Vibranium and Beyond," a cross-listed graduate and
        undergraduate English special topics course, taught by Tyechia Thompson
        and assisted by Dashiel Carrera (GTA) at Virginia Tech, we engaged several
        theoretical and artistic frameworks for defining Afrofuturism. One such
        definition was from Reynaldo Anderson and Charles E. Jones's edited collection
        <emph>Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro Blackness</emph>, in which they
        defined Afrofuturism 2.0 as:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting
              counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network
              software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences,
              enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the
              speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an
              important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement.
              <ptr target="#anderson2016" loc="8"/></quote>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <p>This definition was current and broad enough to cover all the three
        modules of the course, including the first module, which was the Afrofuturist
        intellectual mixtape assignment. For this assignment, students took several
        samples from selected audio recordings on the syllabus and added their own
        voice and another audio recording of their choosing. Students then wrote "liner
        notes" in which they discussed their choice of samples, the use of their own
        voice, and how these choices connect to larger discourses within Afrofuturism.
        As such, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment made use of hacking
        and/or appropriating as well as deep remixability while engaging a multitude of
        discourses that make up Afrofuturistic expression.</p>
        <p>In the course, we also engaged other definitions of Afrofuturism such as
        Alondra Nelson's 2002 articulation of the term as "'African American voices'
        with 'other stories to tell about culture, technology and things to come.'
        The term [Afrofuturism] was chosen as the best umbrella for the concerns of
        'the list' [the AfroFuturism (AF) listserv] — as it has come to be known by its
        members — sci-fi imagery, futurist themes, and technological innovation in the
        African diaspora'" (9). Nelson's definition was fitting for our literature
        course that brought together sci-fi, futurist, and technological stories
        by Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor, Wanuri Kahiu, among others. Moreover,
        Ytasha Womack's succinct definition of Afrofuturism as "an intersection
        of imagination, technology, the future and liberation" from her book
        <emph>Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture</emph>, which
        introduces readers to the paradigm of Afrofuturism, was useful for engaging
        the works of several artists and the major discourses of Afrofuturism in
        preparation for the intellectual mixtape assignment.</p>
        <p>Teaching Afrofuturism works within the intellectual mixtape assignment
        was an innovative method of teaching and analyzing literature and composition
        techniques that shifted the practice of literary and cultural analysis from
        top-down approaches that privileged the authority of academic or assigned
        "texts" to student-centered mixing that encouraged the use of audio, images,
        and text to create new knowledge. This assignment is within particular
        traditions of Africana studies and rhetoric and composition, in which
        students are encouraged and taught to improvise, remix, and sample in order
        to create distinctive work <ptr target="#carter2019"/>. In particular, the intellectual
        mixtape assignment also imparts skills such as audio editing, process
        writing, thematic-website-template building as well as collaboration and
        performance.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment is what Bryan
        Carter would consider digital Africana studies and what Kim Gallon refers to
        as Black digital humanities. Carter's digital Africana studies is an approach
        to "using a number of digital tools to help us experience Africana studies very
        differently and to help students express their understanding of whatever that
        course content happens to be very very differently" <ptr target="#carter2019"/>.
        Carter's
        approach is innovative, technological, and pedagogical yet grounded in the
        field of Africana studies. Similarly, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape
        assignment is grounded in digital Africana studies (since Afrofuturism is a
        part of Africana studies), and the technologies taught in the assignment are
        used to strengthen students' understanding of Afrofuturism in unconventional
        ways. Additionally, the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape is a black digital
        humanities assignment, for it "reveals how methodological approaches for
        studying and thinking about the category of blackness may come to bear on
        and transform the digital processes and tools used to study humanity"
        <ptr target="#gallon2016"/>.
        In <emph>Afrofuturism to Vibranium and Beyond</emph>, the category
        of blackness becomes the categories of blackness as the students study,
        critique, and create counter histories, alternate destinies, and posthuman
        identities through the aesthetics of their mixtape tracks and their interactive
        Afrofuturist performance, which are featured later in this article.</p>
        <p>As the title suggests, this article is a case study of the Afrofuturist
        intellectual mixtape assignment. It proceeds as follows: we first describe the
        seven-part layout of the Afrofuturist intellectual mixtape assignment. Next, we
        provide three key aspects to teaching the intellectual mixtape assignment. Then
        we discuss additional approaches that buttress our analysis of the students'
        mixtapes in connection to digital humanities and Afrofuturism. Subsequently, we
        discuss sampling, conversing, and "flowing" in relation to these approaches and
        examine three examples of students' work. Afterward, we describe the process
        of preparing for the students' midterm performance in which their mixtapes were
        curated and shared with a public audience. In the final part of the article,
        we question whether US Copyright Law is antithetical to multimodal digital
        literacy studies, flow, and empathic engagement with Afrofuturist source texts,
        and speculate about future uses of the intellectual mixtape.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Intellectual Mixtape Assignment: Project Description</head>
        <p>The intellectual mixtape is an audio-visual-textual assignment with
        seven-parts. In part one, students listened to recordings (such as lectures,
        poems, songs, interviews, etc.) that were assigned (on the syllabus) for
        homework and class discussion. For the second part, students learned the basics
        of audio editing in order to create their first tracks of the intellectual
        mixtape. The first audio editing assignment asked students to improvise in
        order to learn how to edit audio; therefore, from the beginning, Afrofuturist
        concepts were pedagogically centered. Their track selections and the mixing
        decisions were, for the most part, impromptu. For the third part, students
        created the first of three audio tracks, which was 1 min long. All audio tracks
        included at least three regions of audio: a sample from audio on the syllabus,
        a region with their own voice in their own words, and a region of their
        choosing. As a companion to each track, students wrote 500 words of liner notes
        that included a title for the track and their curation and mixing decisions.
        For the fourth part, students created a second track that was 1.5 minutes
        in length. The second track was a collaboration with another student in the
        course; it also featured a sample from the syllabus, a region with their own
        voices in their own words, and a region of their choosing with liner notes. The
        fifth part of the assignment was a third audio track that was between 1.5 to 2
        minutes in length, and collaboration was optional; the third track had the same
        criteria for regions and liner notes. For the sixth part, the students posted
        their three-track mixtape online (often in a web template service such as Wix)
        with liner notes and included "remixed" or original cover art. In part seven,
        students performed the intellectual mixtape. In seven weeks, the intellectual
        mixtape assignment taught students skills such as audio editing, process
        writing, audio-visual synchronizing, thematic-website-template building as well
        as collaboration and performance.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Setting-Up the Assignment</head>
        <p>In order to prepare students to create their mixtapes, we made sure each
        student had the resources that they needed to succeed. It is important to
        note that it was not enough for students to have access to the material;
        it was beneficial that the students engaged with the material in homework
        assignments and class discussions prior to recording their intellectual
        mixtapes. When students were exposed to the material prior to creating their
        intellectual mixtapes, they had additional contexts to build upon. Here, we
        will highlight three strategies that were instrumental to the success of the
        assignment–syllabus design, a tech survey, and a workshop on audio-editing.
        First, curating the syllabus required finding sufficient recordings–preferably
        MP3 for the intellectual mixtape assignment — and making those recordings
        available on the syllabus. When there was material essential to the study of
        Afrofuturism that was not available in an audio or video recording, it was
        kept on the syllabus and paired with audio dealing with the same subject.
        For instance, Samuel R. Delany's short story "aye, and Gomorrah" was course
        reading, and it was paired with an audio interview with Delany. Furthermore,
        the syllabus only included recordings that were primary sources in which the
        Afrofuturist artists, scholars, activists, and/or practitioners spoke about
        their own work. The videos were selected from platforms such as YouTube and
        Vimeo and then converted to MP3s. There are two distinctions that determined
        how the audio/video recordings were featured on the syllabus: videos that were
        "live-action" of the Afrofuturist were added to the syllabus directly, but
        videos that were slideshows of still photos were converted to MP3 and put on
        the syllabus as MP3s.</p>
        <p>Second, we began the course with a tech survey to get an inventory of
        the students' tech needs and to assess their exposure and comfort with
        the technologies we would use in class.<note>Tyechia Thompson first used a tech survey
        in her courses in 2016 at the recommendation of Bryan Carter, Ph.D., Director
        of the Center for Digital Humanities, which was the first year she taught the
        intellectual mixtape assignment in its current iteration.</note>
        Our survey had eight questions
        and was distributed on Survey Monkey a week before classes
        began.<note><ref target="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZB7KSPS">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZB7KSPS</ref></note> The survey
        helped us to determine if students would need loaner equipment and whether
        they would work with Audacity or GarageBand to learn audio-editing or if we
        would teach both; it also determined our approach to teaching audio-editing so
        that the students were comfortable enough with the audio-editing software to
        complete the assignment.</p>
        <p>Third, we taught the students GarageBand or Audacity, which was a learning
        objective for the intellectual mixtape assignment. Teaching an overview
        of audio-editing required some preparation before class such as requiring
        that everyone had headphones and GarageBand or Audacity (with Lame encoder)
        installed on their computers by the start of class, creating a shared drive
        that was available with MP3/WAV files for students to select audio recordings,
        and disseminating written instructions of what we were covering in class
        while facilitating a live demonstration. We also made a screencast of the
        demonstration available, so students could watch later. We gave the students
        fourteen tasks to complete after they opened the program.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure01">
          <head>Handout given to students that chose to use Audacity.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure01.png"/>
        </figure>
        <figure xml:id="figure02">
          <head>Handout given to students that chose to use Garageband.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The students' execution of the audio-editing practice assignment was
        fast-paced and improvisational. Because of the time constraints, students
        worked quickly and performatively in a way that they normally would not. They
        learned and created their practice mixtape tracks on the fly. As a result, we
        were not concerned if the practice track made sense, and it was not significant
        if the track stopped abruptly. Instead, when this assignment was assessed,
        we checked to see if 1) we had received the assignment as an MP3 or as a
        WAV file, 2) the assignment was 1 minute in length, 3) the track had three
        different regions in which one was the student's voice, 4) the track included
        a fade-in or fade-out at some point in the recording, and 5) the track had
        an effect (it could be a duplicate sound, reverbs, etc.). This assessment
        gave us an indication of whether or not the students understood the basics of
        audio-editing and could build on this knowledge to complete the Afrofuturist
        intellectual mixtape project.</p>
        <p>Curating the syllabus with sufficient and appropriate audio recordings
        that featured the Afrofuturist artists, scholars, activists, and/or
        practitioners discussing their work was the substratum of the intellectual
        mixtape assignment. It was the basis of how the students developed
        flow, sampled, and engaged in internally persuasive discourse
        and techno-vernacular creativity. Creating the tech survey allowed us to
        prepare for our students and guarantee that they had access to equipment
        and software, as well as ample time to finish assignments. Without this kind
        of preparation, the course could have been bottle-necked by the technology
        and diverted focus from the course content. Finally, teaching the basics of
        audio-editing was one aspect that makes the intellectual mixtape assignment
        a digital humanities project. The assignment was multimodal and encouraged
        students to develop their own voices.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>A Layered Approach to the Intellectual Mixtape</head>
        <p>In Brandon T. Locke's article "Digital Humanities Pedagogy as Essential
        Liberal Education: A Framework for Curriculum Development" in the <emph>Digital
        Humanities Quarterly</emph> special issue <emph>Imagining the DH Undergraduate:
        Special Issue in Undergraduate Education in DH</emph>, he provides a
        framework for digital humanities projects or what he calls digital liberal
        arts curriculum. He argues that the liberal arts are well suited for the
        integration of digital skills, given the course goals of liberal arts courses.
        He writes:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">Educators in the liberal arts must continue to grapple with emerging
        forms of communication and analysis, or we risk leaving our students lacking
        in critical areas of the liberal arts. Media and information literacies and
        multimodal and digital writing skills are essential for effective communication
        and civic engagement now and in the future, and liberal arts courses must
        engage with them. This flexible and extensible framework offers one fruitful
        route, by developing digital humanities projects intended to impart such skills
        while engaging with domain-specific content. <ptr target="#locke2018"/></quote>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <p>Locke uses the term "domain" to suggest the discipline of a specialist that
        is taught to students alongside technical objectives. Locke's framework is
        useful for understanding the intellectual mixtape assignment. This assignment,
        as presented in the course <emph>Afrofuturism to Vibranium and Beyond,</emph>
        engaged the domain-specific content of Afrofuturism alongside media and
        communication literacies. The intellectual mixtape assignment met the course
        outcomes for many liberal arts courses through teaching skills such as process
        writing, collaborating, engaging discourses, articulating one's perspective,
        text and audio-editing, and managing projects.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Nettrice R. Gaskins' essay "Afrofuturism on Web 3.0" in
        Reynaldo Anderson and Charles E. Jones's <emph>Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of
        Astro-Blackness</emph> provides another useful framework for understanding the
        intellectual mixtape assignment. Gaskins's methodology of techno-vernacular
        creativity is reflected in the intellectual mixtape assignment. In the essay,
        Gaskins describes techno-vernacular creativity as a creation method consisting
        of appropriation, improvisation, and reinvention. In terms of appropriation,
        Gaskins writes that Afrofuturists "reclaim cultural artifacts, often to counter
        dominant social or political systems" <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="30"/>.
        Appropriation of
        a similar kind was evident in the intellectual mixtape assignment. Students
        appropriated recordings (sample) from the syllabus and used those recordings
        to create or center their own world views. Gaskins describes Afrofuturists
        improvisations as "performing, creating, problem-solving, or reacting in
        the moment and in response to one's environment and inner feelings"
        <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="30–31"/>. In the intellectual mixtape assignment, students improvised
        their audio-editing demonstration by learning and making creative decisions
        quickly (as noted above), and they also improvised during their performance
        in the Cube when they interacted with audience members.<note>How we taught audio-editing and how
        the students created the interactive Afrofuturist experience in the Cube
        at Virginia Tech will be described in more detail later in this essay.</note> Lastly,
        Gaskins describes reinvention (of the self) as techno-vernacular creativity due
        to the way "Afrofuturists often use digital and non-digital avatars as tools
        for transcendence, reinvention, or for existing in and moving between worlds or
        realities" <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="31"/>.</p>
        <p>Reinvention (of the self) was adopted by most students creating futuristic
        content who took on a pseudonym such as Grim Reaper, FutureShe, or StarGirl
        for the intellectual mixtape assignment. This reinvention of the self is
        significant because students model this Afrofuturists aesthetic without
        prompting. The use of appropriation (sampling), improvisation, and reinvention
        within the intellectual mixtape assignment are just some of the ways that the
        students' mixtapes are created from an Afrofuturists framework. Locke's and
        Gaskins's frameworks in digital humanities and Afrofuturism, respectively, show
        how this assignment integrates a digital liberal arts curriculum as well as
        Afrofuturist techno-vernacular creativity.</p>
        <p>Our framing of digital humanities and Afrofuturism in the intellectual
        mixtape assignment was a dialogic process, specifically an internally
        persuasive discourse. In <emph>Dialogic Imagination</emph>, Mikhail Bakhtin
        defines internally persuasive discourse as "more akin to retelling a text in
        one's own words, with one's own accents, gestures, modifications"
        <ptr target="#bakhtin1991" loc="424"/>.
        Bakhtin's concept claims that one's own word is already interwoven
        with someone else's words, and this interweaving creates new words. As such,
        the intellectual mixtape was an application of internally persuasive discourse
        in that students selected audio from the syllabus and synthesized it with
        and/or juxtaposed it against their own voice. The students' mixed/assimilated
        the recordings and created their own perspectives. Bakhtin's internally
        persuasive discourse provides a useful framework for understanding how students
        developed their own discourses in the intellectual mixtape.</p>
        <p>Though varied, Locke's, Gaskins', and Bakhtin's frameworks and methods
        show the layered approach to teaching and executing the intellectual mixtape
        assignment. The assignment's goals (audio editing, process writing, composing,
        collaborating, etc.) are prevalent within the liberal arts and incorporate the
        use of media technologies. This approach to teaching Afrofuturism encouraged
        students to engage and create using Afrofuturists methods of appropriation,
        improvisation, and reinvention of the self. Also, through the dialogic process
        of creating the intellectual mixtape tracks, students had an opportunity
        to develop their own ideas in conversation with the assigned Afrofuturists
        recordings.</p>

        <div><head>Flowing Through Conversation and Sampling</head>
        <p>In "Flow as a Metaphor for Changing Composition Practices," David
        Green addresses the importance of students developing and expressing
        authority, fluency, and flow with language through hip hop as a
        model for composition.<note>Tyechia Thompson sampled the intellectual
        mixtape Assignment from David Green who had assigned the intellectual
        mixtape as a flexible type of annotated bibliography to his graduate
        students at Howard University.</note> Specifically, Green defines flow as "a
        construct that helps to clarify and usefully extend discussions about language,
        diversity, invention, and voice"
        <ptr target="#green2017" loc="175"/>. Green's articulation of
        flow comes from a position that critical writing is not limited to academic
        writing and that students, in particular, can benefit from critiquing
        standardized English to develop flexible writing practices that include
        vernacular in order to engage various audiences, traditions, and histories.
        Green writes that "flow provides an interesting way of positioning writing
        for students by focusing discussions of language and composing on features
        such as rhythm, vernacular eloquence, layering, and rupture in ways that
        press for newer considerations of language and literature within English
        studies" <ptr target="#green2017" loc="176"/>.
        Green's exploration of how flow can be incorporated
        in English composition courses was a springboard for the intellectual mixtape
        project, which adopted Green's concept of flow into audio-visual and written
        compositions in <emph>Afrofuturism: To Vibranium and Beyond</emph>.</p>
        <p>Flow as a nonstandard, flexible writing practice is expanded when adopted
        in text and audio compositions. In creating their intellectual mixtapes,
        students used the techniques of sampling and conversing to contextualize their
        discourse and world views and to further develop their own meanings — their flow.
        Moreover, the students who created intellectual mixtapes were composing within
        the tradition that DJ Kool Herc, a founder of hip hop music, created when
        he isolated and repeated the breakbeat on records, which allowed for him to
        create his own meaning through looping part of the song. His technique allowed
        for other contexts of the beat (how it would be used–sampling), expanded the
        conversation of the beat (where the beat would be heard), and developed an
        expression for future flows to emerge.</p>
        <p>In an interview on <emph>Fresh Air</emph>, Kool Herc describes finding
        records to expose to his audience and watching his audience's anticipation of a
        record's breakbeat. He states:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">When we first heard a record called "Seven Minutes of Funk." We heard it in
        a place called (um) at Hunt's Point. And Jay-Z used it, and a few other people
        used that same record. And that came out of my collection. And when we played
        that record, or what we did, Coke [La Rock] did it. Coke put the record on, and
        we all walked off the stage. <ptr target="#herc2005"/></quote>

          Interview with DJ Kool Herc on <emph>Fresh Air</emph>.
        </ref></p>
        <p>What DJ Kool Herc describes above are contexts and conversations that emerge
        from the record "Seven Minutes of Funk." He explains how each iteration of
        "Seven Minutes of Funk" flows with its own meaning and authority–whether it
        is from Jay-Z's "Ain't No Nigga" or YG's "Why You Always Hatin." Furthermore,
        though DJ Kool Herc's technique is a founding aesthetic of hip hop music, it
        is improvisational through Herc and Coke La Rock providing an improvisational
        conversation to occur between the song and the live audience, and through how
        the sample (appropriation) is reinvented in each iteration by artists such as
        Jay-Z and YG (which is also a conversation).<note>It is important to note that the
        intellectual mixtape assignment is clearly a part of the jazz tradition,
        particularly through the aesthetics of improvisation and conversation.
        This tradition is examined in the course, especially through the music and
        teachings of Sun Ra. Also, DJ Kool Herc's example of sampling "Seven Minutes
        of Funk" is a nod to Afrofuturism through the funk genre's connection to black
        freedom, utopianism, and the space age.</note> This same process of sampling
        and conversing was the basis of the intellectual mixtape assignment, and it
        is what created flow in David Green's articulation of the term. It was in
        students' flow–their intentions, voice, self-acceptance, and diversity–that
        emerged in this assignment. We will now examine three tracks for how students'
        flow was expressed.</p>
        <p>An intellectual mixtape track "Xe3" (pronounced Chi) by TSaunds featured
        conversation and flow. In "Xe3," TSaunds sampled "Tales of Dr. Funkenstein,"
        "Venus Fly" by Grimes and Janelle Monáe, and "Window Licker" by Aphex Twin.
        TSaunds mixing of these audio recordings led to his creation of a story of
        a young man being teleported from his apartment to Xe3 (a planet in another
        universe) through a funky Spotify transmission. In the liner notes, TSaunds
        wrote:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">I used this beat [a sound effect from "Window Licker"] because it connects
        to George Clinton's claim that P-Funk is constantly evolving and always
        present to those who want the funk and its liberty. In fact, the funk and its
        vibrations [are] what help the young man be connected with Xe3. Additionally,
        Grimes is one of my favorite artists and her collaboration with Janelle Monáe
        on the song and music video is pure genius and sci-fi. Layered with this beat
        are various clips of audio from <emph>Tales of Dr. Funkenstein</emph>.
        <ptr target="#tsaunds2019"/></quote>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <p><ref target="resources/audio/audio04.mp3">
          Track "Xe3" created by student artist TSaunds.
        </ref></p>
        <p>TSaunds explained that he is evolving P-funk through his sampling of a sound
        effect from "Window Licker." He used the liberty of P-funk to sample Grimes
        and Janelle Monáe and further develop a sci-fi sound. He also sampled several
        excerpts from <emph>Tales of Dr. Funkenstein</emph>, a documentary on George
        Clinton, for the additional context of P-funk. TSaunds flow emerged as the
        unique story he told of a liberating teleportation, and it was a direct result
        of the conversations with the tracks he sampled.</p>
        <p>There are two Afrofuturist tracks where self-acceptance emerged from flow.
        The first track is titled "FAT GYALS" by Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl. The
        students who created this track used humor, irony, and pain to challenge
        stereotypes and assumptions about black women and their bodies. They presented
        a series of images for the "Fat Girl Starter Pack" that include "cookies before
        and after dinner," "eating just because I can," "great singer — must be gospel,
        must be soul, must be pain," "can I do anything for more than 10 minutes?,"
        and "arms that won't stretch all the way around." Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl
        strengthened their conversation by speaking at the same time, repeating and/or
        responding to each other. They also affirmed all body types through the track's
        intro that featured an audio excerpt from the movie <emph>Phat Girlz</emph>
        in which the character Jazmin Biltmore (Mo'Nique) and her friend Stacey
        are ordering food at a fast-food restaurant. In the film, Stacey proceeds
        to order for Jazmin (on the skinny side of the menu), but Jazmin modifies
        the order and adds "the works." Additionally, Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl
        aligned themselves and their images with G/god when they sampled Erykah Badu's
        lyrics from "On and On" that "If we were made in his image then call us by
        our names/Most intellects do not believe in god, but they fear us just the
        same." In their liner notes, Lauren Garretson and Starg*rl wrote, "all our
        complexities around body and food and womanhood will not shut us out from a new
        world, planet, mothership connection or community of aliens." The track "FAT
        GYALS" was an Afrofuturist audio conversation about presence, inclusion, and
        acceptance.

        </ref>
          </p>
        <p>Flow was also demonstrated through sonic, rhetorical layering in the
        track "Space Less" by FutureShe. FutureShe began her track with a personal
        understanding of space and place that was framed by one of the most well-known
        Afrofuturist choruses, "space is the place" from Sun Ra's song, self-titled
        album, and film <emph>Space is the Place</emph>. While a context of
        Afrofuturist acceptance is suggested through the canonized song, FutureShe's
        flow presented otherness and doubt regarding the possibility of experiencing
        a utopic space outside of herself. She began the track stating, "Will there
        be space for me — for all of me?" Her voice also suggested that she must find
        her own space since elsewhere is inhabited by others. FutureShe then mixed FKA
        Twigs's "How's That" into her track. FKA Twigs's recording became a companion
        for her, initiating her to turn within. In her liner notes, FutureShe wrote,
        "I attempt to exemplify the sort of internal struggles and frustrations with
        space here on Earth that may eventually lead people to seek space, literally
        and figuratively, elsewhere." FutureShe's track was a flow that used samples
        to produce a perspective that the only space where we can truly be accepted is
        within ourselves.

        <p>The creation and performance of the intellectual mixtape provided
        opportunities for students to engage in popular, academic, and mystical
        discourses connected to Afrofuturists art and practices. The recordings
        that the students' sampled and mixed provided them with digital media skills
        used in the digital humanities. The process of audio editing also expanded
        how the students engaged with language, meaning, and interpretation in an
        English special topics course. This type of engagement permitted an internally
        persuasive discourse to be expressed–one in which the students' own ideas
        were accented from the words of others. Through their sampling and conversing
        with the assigned recordings, the intellectual mixtape assignment opened up
        opportunities for students to flow and express what mattered to them in terms
        of sound, perspective, acceptance, and diversity. The students' insights
        about Afrofuturism gained through the intellectual mixtape assignment became
        an interactive experience of Afrofuturism with empathy at the center of the
        creation.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Performing the Intellectual Mixtape</head>
        <p>The students also adapted their intellectual mixtapes to a performance
        environment. This supported our Afrofuturist pedagogical framework for two
        reasons. First, this assignment requires students to engage in a new multimodal
        form of performance. This is in line with Locke's vision of a multimodal
        future for liberal arts education. Second, the assignment requires students
        to reinvent and improvise as they adapt their mixtapes to a performance
        environment. While the Afrofuturist performance was on the syllabus and the
        course schedule, students were not instructed to create their mixtapes with
        their performance in mind. They had to rethink how to perform their mixtapes
        after they had already been created. Gaskin argues that improvisation and
        reinvention are an integral part of Afrofuturist artistic practice. In this
        way, the performance part of the assignment is also Afrofuturist.</p>
        <p>Performing the intellectual mixtape was predominately student-led and took
        2-3 weeks. We asked thought-provoking questions and created an environment
        for students to apply Afrofuturists concepts, practices, and discourses to
        create their performance. <emph>Sound of Space: An Interactive Afrofuturist
        Experience</emph> was performed in the Cube, a 42ft high performance and
        research space in the Moss Arts Center at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
        and State University. The Cube has a high-density loudspeaker array of 150
        loudspeakers. These loudspeakers spread around the entire perimeter, up the
        walls, and on the ceiling of the Cube to allow for fully immersive sound. The
        Cube is specially designed for spatial computer music research. Vector Based
        Amplitude Panning is used so that audience members can precisely pinpoint a
        sound source from any point in the room <ptr target="#lyon2016"/>.
        The Cube can fit up to
        198 people and features the Cyclorama, an optional large 360-degree-panoramic
        projection wall in the center.</p>
        <p>In preparation for the midterm intellectual mixtape performance, we
        and staff members of the Institute for Creativity, Arts and Technology led
        discussions with the students about ways to adapt the mixtapes to the space,
        and we required that they apply their knowledge of Afrofuturism to create the
        performance. Students decided to create an environment in which the audience
        could freely navigate the space rather than having a fixed separation between
        the audience and the stage. This holds roots in an Afrofuturist ideal that the
        demarcation between artist and audience member results in an imbalanced power
        relationship that should be actively worked against <ptr target="#gaskins2016"/>.
        Students
        felt that this would allow the audience to fully embody the space in the spirit
        of the mixtape creation. They also argued that being able to float freely
        between different corners of the Cube would allow for improvisational movement
        that would reflect the Afrofuturist desire to find freedom in space. Students
        decided to make the Cyclorama the centerpiece of the exhibit. They projected
        an oscillating image of space and played ambient white noise (similar to that
        heard on an airplane or spaceship) from overhead. The Cyclorama, filled with
        the sound of space, served as the meditative home base from which the movement
        toward the Afrofuturist spatialized sounds took place.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure07">
          <head>Students preparing in the Cyclorama.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure07.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>The students then grouped the mixtapes into four categories that were played
        on a loop during the performance: Flow, Transport, Testimony, and Funk. The
        students felt that each of these categories was representative not only of
        their mixtapes as a whole but also of different themes within Afrofuturist
        discourse. "Flow" focused on the rhythm and transformation of the self, as in
        FutureShe's "Space Less," in which she explores how to carve out a space for
        herself as a black body on Earth. "Transport" focused on the African diaspora,
        Sankofa (a word in the Twi language and a Ghanian Adinkra symbol meaning
        "go back and get it," but also the Haile Gerima film <emph>Sankofa</emph>
        about abduction in the transatlantic slave trade), and alien abduction in
        science-fiction narratives (as in the film <emph>Space is the Place</emph>,
        in which Sun Ra is abducted by a group of white scientists working for NASA
        who hope to uncover how he travels through space). In "Testimony" students
        expressed, confessed, and preached their experiences with various forms of
        oppression, which reflects Sun Ra's testimony of his experience in <emph>Space
        is the Place</emph>. In "Funk," students focused on the Afrofuturist connection
        between creator and consumer, in which a liberating communal dance welcomes all
        (as is the case with Parliament Funkadelic's "We Got the Funk").</p>
        <p>Once the students' tracks were grouped together, each group was mixed,
        sequenced, and spliced into four singular looping audio tracks. Students
        utilized the Cube's unique ability to spatialize audio to have each of the
        tracks played from a different corner simultaneously. As audience members
        walked around the perimeter of the Cube, the sound of the next corner would
        slowly grow louder and the previous corner quieter until audience members
        were fully immersed in the sound of the next group. In this way, they were
        "transported" between each audio grouping–transportation, funk, flow, and
        testimony–spatially. This is reflective of Sun Ra's idea that creation is a
        form of teleportation as it is in <emph>Space is the Place</emph>. This slow
        gradient of mixed audio recordings was part of the students' design as well;
        the hope was that this blended and improvisational sound would reflect the
        sampling and mixing of the mixtapes. This balance had to be carefully checked
        by the GTA to make sure the sounds did not overwhelm and compete with one
        another.</p>
        <p>In addition to designing the space itself, students had to conceive of a
        title for the performance. We brainstormed the title for the performance over
        multiple meetings. Students played word association games and constructed "word
        salad" in order to think generatively about the language and spaces associated
        with Afrofuturism. As they continued to conceive of the title in relation to
        the space, they eventually arrived at "Sound of Space" to evoke the meditative
        "spaceship" sound played overhead in the Cyclorama.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure08">
          <head>Poster for Sound of Space performance.</head>
          <graphic url="resources/images/figure08.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Though sound is the substratum of the <emph>Sound of Space</emph>
        performance, students wanted to communicate meaning and feeling through
        more than sound and space imagery in the Cyclorama. The students understood
        empathic engagement as a core tenet to the creation of Afrofuturist art
        <ptr target="#hinton2018"/>.
        They added props and visual aids to each of the four corners of the
        Cube as a means of increasing empathic engagement with the audience. While
        360-degree-virtual reality has been correlated to positive empathetic response,
        it was our hope that the 360-degree-panoramic projection wall of the Cyclorama
        and the interactive-immersive experience in the Cube would foster empathy and
        embodiment among audience members <ptr target="#bertrand2018"/>.
        To produce this, each person
        was asked to beat a Garifuna Drum upon entering the Cube.</p>
        <p>Additionally, for the "Transportation" corner, a montage of alien imagery
        and footage from the <emph>Blair Witch Project</emph> was created through
        the contribution of an undergraduate videographer. This footage allowed the
        audience to experience first-hand the jarring nature of alien and colonialist
        abduction. This footage was played on a loop. Also, the "Funk" corner also
        contained a looped montage but of various funk, dance, and Motown musicians,
        including Michael Jackson and Parliament Funkadelic. This footage was selected
        by the students, who found videos they felt were aesthetically cohesive on
        YouTube and sent them to the videographer. These images were meant to celebrate
        Afrofuturism as a form of embodied, innovative, eclectic, and physical
        expression.</p>
        <figure xml:id="figure09">

          <graphic url="resources/images/figure10.jpg"/>
        </figure>
        <p>Next, the "Flow" corner featured an aromatherapy diffuser with a lavender
        scent. This corner encouraged audience members to close their eyes and tune
        into their other senses, rather than fixating on the strict visual presence
        before them. One of the student tracks in this corner asks, "will I be able
        to find the space within me?" In this spirit, this corner encouraged audience
        members to look inward to find a sense of space. Lastly, the "Testimony"
        corner featured a variety of artifacts and instruments from African cultures,
        which encouraged audience members to participate in the cathartic cleansing
        of testifying. We adorned a table with a traditional African mud cloth, a
        bowl (symbolically full of water for cleansing hands and ears), candles, a
        tambourine, precious stones, an African statue, and an African shield. The
        students felt that these objects would help bring the audience aesthetically
        closer to the testimonies in this corner's mixtape tracks, and that "the water"
        would help the audience embody the feeling of cleansing.</p>

        <p>The midterm intellectual mixtape performance took place on March
        7th, 2019, in the middle of the afternoon. Members from both the
        Virginia Tech and the Blacksburg community flowed through the Cube to see
        the performance. Midway through the hour and fifteen-minute performance, four
        students from the course <emph>Improvised and Devised Performance</emph> taught
        by Devair Jeffries and Al Evangelista gave two ten-minute performances in the
        Cyclorama, which responded to and evolved from the sounds in the space and the
        audience in the Cube. As intended, many audience members spent significant time
        seated in the center of the Cyclorama, examining the moving stars. From there,
        they charted their own courses through the Cube, taking pictures and exchanging
        experiences. Students in our Afrofuturism course floated through the space to
        provide guidance and answer questions as needed.</p>

        <p>The <emph>Sound of Space</emph> performance serves as a useful model for
        exploring embodiment through sound and performance in the digital humanities
        classroom. Encouraging students to think multimodally and asking them to
        reinvent and improvise with their own work supports an Afrofuturist pedagogy
        rooted in the theories of Gaskin and Locke. It also supports a broader digital
        humanities pedagogy. By asking students to rethink their work in a performance
        setting, this assignment asks students to form a more intimate and embodied
        relationship with the creative works studied. Rather than passively quoting
        from these works, students are asked to envision how these works can be
        presented so that they will be engaging to a live audience. In doing so, they
        behave as Afrofuturist creators, many of whom are live performers. Much of this
        process can be replicated in any digital humanities course in which instructors
        want students to embody the perspectives of the creators and artists being
        studied, particularly those courses in which the syllabus contains performance
        art.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>The Challenges of Copyright Law</head>
        <p>Given the importance of access to audio, we want to specifically address
        one major challenge and opportunity for the assignment. During the <emph>Sound
        of Space</emph> performance, community members from the Virginia Tech and
        Blacksburg area engaged in conversation with each other, members of the
        Afrofuturism class, and Afrofuturist art. The result was not a performance in
        which audience members and artists were sharply demarcated, but rather one in
        which both parties freely exchanged ideas on a level playing field. This holds
        its roots in Gaskins's idea that in Afrofuturism, "improvisation, call and
        response, hacking, and tinkering elicit the active engagement and participation
        of the at-large community (audience)"
        <ptr target="#gaskins2016" loc="29"/>. Similarly, the
        intellectual mixtape was created as a means of letting students engage in deep
        conversation with the works of Afrofuturist artists, rather than analyzing
        Afrofuturist work as critics or passive third-party observers/reviewers. In
        both cases, the goal was to synthesize and/or juxtapose the interpreter's
        (student's or audience member's) own artistic voice with that of the artist.
        However, this collage-style-artistic practice is discouraged by US Copyright
        Law. Creating the intellectual mixtape may even constitute copyright
        infringement.</p>
        <p>Under the US Code of Laws, a "derivative work" such as the intellectual
        mixtape requires a "master use" license, which can only be obtained by
        mutual agreement between the owner of the recording and the licensee [17
        US Code, § 106]. In the case of the intellectual mixtape, the owners of
        the recordings were mostly large record labels too difficult to contact
        in such a short time frame.<note>There are two ways of avoiding copyright
        infringement in creating an Intellectual Mixtape, but all pose problems: 1)
        Using music for which the copyright has deliberately been waived by the artist;
        2) Negotiating master use licenses with independent artists. Both options
        provide little help because music of these categories generally come from
        small independent artists who are rarely popular enough to have had a large
        cultural impact. If students performed a study using only these songs, they
        would be prevented from exploring the core and popular texts of Afrofuturism.</note>
        The legal penalties for not obtaining
        proper licenses are unduly severe. Statutory Damages for each case of
        infringement can be up to $30,000 [17 US Code, § 504c]. This means that in this
        Afrofuturism course, damages could total $900,000.</p>
        <p>US Copyright Law discourages the embodiment of Afrofuturist tracks despite
        the demonstrated pedagogical benefits. As such, we are left wondering if US
        Copyright Law ought to undergo revision. US Copyright law privileges research
        on music over a century old and many films prior to 1964, for which the
        copyright has already expired.<note>As of Donald Trump's 2018 signing of the
        Music Modernization Act, music copyright generally lasts a century.
        However, a significant number of Afrofuturist music
        was published within the last half a century. This means that most significant
        Afrofuturist works are still protected under US Copyright Law.</note>
        Music of this age predates most original
        recorded music, and in particular, all of the audio content that was included
        on the syllabus was created within the last 60 years.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, by limiting the appropriate sample length to 10% of a song,
        US Copyright Law discourages a serious embodiment of any musical recording,
        which is a fundamental pillar of the Afrofuturist
        mixtape.<note><p>Fair Use, as
        defined in the Copyright Act of
        1976, is a law which permits brief excerpts of copyrighted material to be used
        under certain circumstances, including when it is for education, scholarship,
        or research [17 US Code, § 106]. Given this provision, one might hope that the
        intellectual mixtape would be considered Fair Use. While the US Code provides
        no strict definition for determining Fair Use, this does not appear to be the
        case [17 US Code, § 106].</p>
        <p>The US Code of Law provides guidelines for determining Fair Use in lieu
        of a strict definition [17 US Code, § 106]. Whether or not a particular case
        constitutes Fair Use is left up to the courts to determine. Therefore, any
        educator can be taken to court for copyright infringement, even if their
        case constitutes Fair Use. The US Copyright Office attempts to provide
        some guidance for these court decisions <ptr target="#united2016" loc="21"/>.
        However, it is not clear how these guidelines apply, because they were
        developed by a committee of Music Publishers and Music Educators in 1976
        for the music classroom, not for digital humanities classrooms. However,
        one provision states that: "For other than performance, single or multiple
        copies of excerpts may be made, provided that the excerpts do not comprise a
        'performable unit as a section,' and never more than 10% of the work, and only
        one copy per pupil." This suggests that the intellectual mixtape may be legal
        so long as only 10% of each song is used. However, for a typical three-minute
        song, this is only about 18 seconds.</p>
        </note> In our
        class, many students had samples that were longer than 10% of a song. This
        was because students were encouraged to converse with the discourses of
        Afrofuturism and use them in their own creative process. In the spirit of
        Bakhtin's internally persuasive discourse, we want to encourage academic work
        that is "affirmed through assimilation, tightly interwoven with 'one's own
        word...' half-ours and half-someone else's" <ptr target="#bakhtin1991"/>.
        We hope for our
        students to engage with the material in a way which forces them to converse
        with and think carefully through the discourses of Afrofuturist creators so
        that they become creators themselves, rather than limiting themselves to short
        quotations that could subordinate or elevate their perspectives. In contrast,
        we argue for the Afrofuturist techno-vernacular creativity identified by
        Nettrice Gaskins, in which the reappropriation of cultural artifacts is part
        of "counter-dominant social or political systems" <ptr target="#gaskins2016"/>.
        We feel this
        reappropriation should be uninhibited by legal regulation and encourage our
        students to join the continuum of borrowing and remixing that is so fundamental
        to Afrofuturist work.</p>
        <p>Additionally, in his 2010 Langston Hughes Visiting Professorship Lecture at
        the University of Kansas, Professor Adam Banks asks:</p>
        <p>
          <cit>
            <quote rend="block">Will we stand with a set of copyright and intellectual property codes, laws
        and conventions, that have pushed more and more severely in the direction of
        huge corporate interests...?</quote>
          </cit>
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="figure14">
          <head>Professor Adam Banks in his Langston Hughes Visiting
            Professorship Lecture at the University of Kansas.</head>
          <media mimeType="video/mp4" url=""/>
        </figure>
        <p>He also notes that every course syllabus forms "a mixtape compilation
        of other's text and ideas compiled, ranging, combines, with our own various
        critical gestures..." <ptr target="#banks2010"/>.
        As such, it seems antithetical to academic
        practice to have one form of compilation be suppressed while others are allowed
        to flourish. Why must we limit ourselves to short quotations of these audio
        text sources when we know full well that academic discourse is a constant
        resynthesis of existing ideas? Why should the intellectual mixtape be forced
        to conform to the narrative that sources of knowledge can be easily traced
        and attributed, when academic discourse often involves a recombination of
        internally persuasive ideas? We argue instead that in order for the digital
        humanities to more fully realize an Afrofuturist praxis, copyright law should
        be challenged just as it has been for decades by practitioners of Afrofuturist
        art.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Conclusion</head>
        <p>The various pedagogical methods here could be realized in any
        number of digital humanities classrooms, not just in the context of
        an Afrofuturism course.<note>Tyechia Thompson has used the intellectual
        mixtape assignment in five different courses (including an online course)
        at three different universities.</note> The ideas of remix, flow, and embodied
        knowledge are increasingly becoming a part of academic and artistic creation
        today. As such, it makes sense for other courses within liberal arts and
        social sciences, particularly those that have a substantial corpus of audio
        materials, to use the intellectual mixtape as a new form of academic discourse.
        The intellectual mixtape does not necessarily have to be a replacement
        for traditional academic discourses. It could be used in conjunction with
        traditional academic writing as a means of getting the student to engage with
        primary sources in as many ways as possible or as a way of prompting a student
        to engage empathically with a text before they use it to support their own
        theories.</p>
        <p>While replicating the performance in the Cube is near impossible because of
        the unique nature of the space, holding a reception for student art-scholarship
        is very compelling and easy to execute in a digital humanities classroom. In
        inviting audience members into the classroom, we underscore the importance of
        having the intellectual mixtapes be a part of a large-networked conversation,
        rather than a unidirectional discourse. It is imperative that this work is
        viewed through the lens of community, and not just as an artifact of the
        academic system. As Brandon Locke notes, "Media and information literacies and
        multimodal and digital writing skills are essential for effective communication
        and civic engagement now and in the future, and liberal arts courses must
        engage with them" <ptr target="#locke2018"/>. Any digital humanities classroom
        could host
        a reception of any kind as part of the midterm or final. In the case of
        the intellectual mixtape, community members could gather together to eat
        food, explore the student work that has been created, and discuss their own
        reactions to the student work with each other, the teacher, or the students
        themselves.</p>
        <p>The intellectual mixtape assignment is an approach to teaching in
        liberal arts and digital humanities that promotes multimodal scholarship and
        artistic creation. The seven-part assignment teaches students skills such as
        audio-editing, process writing, and performing. Though students are asked to
        make their mixtape tracks in conversation with the recordings they sample,
        students are also asked to be authorities on their own tracks. The assignment
        thus emphasizes the importance of students developing their own voice and
        developing their own sound in order to develop flow. The conversations
        they create through these interwoven audio recordings constitute internally
        persuasive discourse and promote empathic engagement both in the intellectual
        mixtape assignment and in the <emph>Sound of Space</emph> performance.</p>
        <p>The mixtapes and performance were Afrofuturist appropriations and
        improvisational conversations in which, without being prompted, all students
        took on other identities in order to express themselves. While this approach
        to learning and scholarship is primed for delivery in liberal arts and digital
        humanities courses, Copyright Law in the United States often inhibits legal
        use of the intellectual mixtape assignment. It is especially dubious when
        working with contemporary works, like those found in the body of Afrofuturist
        work. Even so, the intellectual mixtape is a viable assignment that encourages
        flow and expression of their individual world views. A digital humanities
        pedagogy with Afrofuturist intellectual mixtapes is one more step towards a
        more equitable and engaging future for liberal arts education and the digital
        humanities.</p>
