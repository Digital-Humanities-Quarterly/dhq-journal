                  <h2>Abstract</h2>
                  <p>Decades of digitisation have made a wealth of digital cultural material available
               online. Yet search — the dominant interface to these collections — is incapable of
               representing this abundance. Search is ungenerous: it withholds information, and
               demands a query. This paper argues for a more generous alternative: rich, browsable
               interfaces that reveal the scale and complexity of digital heritage collections.
               Drawing on related work and precedents from information retrieval and visualisation,
               as well as critical humanistic approaches to the interface, this paper documents and
               analyses practical experiments in generous interfaces developed in collaboration with
               Australian cultural institutions.</p>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1"> Imagine yourself outside an art gallery in a far-off city, with a collection you
               don’t know well. You enter the building to find a small, drab lobby with an attendant
               at a desk. The attendant asks you to enter your query on a small slip of paper. Not
               knowing the collection, and not seeking anything in particular, you write down
               something arbitrary, and pass it over. The attendant disappears for a moment before
               returning with a line of artworks sitting on trolleys. These are paraded, ten at a
               time, through the lobby. You can submit another query at any time, calling forth more
               trolleys, but there seems to be no way to explore the gallery beyond this small
               lobby. </div>

               libraries, archives, galleries and museums around the world, where keyword search is
               the central — often the <em class="emph">only</em> — way to access the collection. The
               dichotomy embodied here can be framed through the notion of generosity. Decades of
               digitisation have made a wealth of digital cultural material available online. The

               around 128 million digitised newspaper articles. A recent survey of some 1200
               institutions in the UK and Europe found that 80% have digitised collections, and
               these are increasingly coming online [<a class="ref" href="#enumerate2014">ENUMERATE 2014</a>]. This is a truly
               generous mass: large, abundant, ample. Yet in response to this abundance, collection
               interfaces wheel out miserly lists, one page at a time. Generosity entails more than
               scale, too: another of its senses describes an ethos of giving or sharing freely.
               These values tally well with the aims of many collecting institutions — especially
               public institutions, mandated to provide broad and open access. But here too, search
               is ungenerous. It fails to be liberal in sharing: instead of throwing open the doors,
               its greeting is "Yes, what?"</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> As an interface, search fails to match the ample abundance of our digital
               collections and the generous ethos of the institutions that hold them. A more
               generous interface would do more to represent the scale and richness of its
               collection. It would open the doors, tear down the drab lobby; instead of demanding a
               query it would offer multiple ways in, and support exploration as well as the focused
               enquiry where search excels. In revealing the complexity of digital collections, a
               generous interface would also enrich interpretation by revealing relationships and
               structures within a collection. </div>

               Empirical research shows that many visitors come to a museum website seeking specific
               information [<a class="ref" href="#fantoni2012">Fantoni et al. 2012</a>]. However, a significant number of visitors
               do not have a specific goal: in a survey of the motivations of some 34,000 visitors
               to Dutch museum websites, 29% report seeking specific information, but 21% visit to
                  "engage in casual browsing"[<a class="ref" href="#intknd">INTK n.d.</a>]. Another recent study finds that browse features are valued
               highly by non-expert visitors to online art collections [<a class="ref" href="#lopatovska2013">Lopatovska et al. 2013</a>]. Thus from the user’s perspective, search is an incomplete solution. </div>

               random sampling of works. Experimental and overtly poetic approaches to digital
               collections — such as Tim Sherratt’s <cite class="title italic">

               However, these examples are the exception, rather than the rule; and in some cases
               generosity is only superficial. The <a class="ref"
                        href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collection"
                        onclick="window.open('http://www.metmuseum.org/collection'); return false">Met Museum’s</a> beautiful browse-centric interface leads abruptly to a
               standard search display, showing thirty records at a time. This ostensibly browsable
               interface (like the Rijksmuseum’s) is in fact a highly curated set of predefined
               starting points, rather than a comprehensive representation of the collection. </div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"> The stakes here are high, because the interface plays an inescapable role in
               mediating digital heritage. Whether a command-line console or an immersive
               visualisation, these collections come to us in some specific, concrete form; and
               crucially, that form is constructed and contingent. It can always be otherwise. As
               our cultural heritage is increasingly networked and digital, the life and use of that
               heritage will increasingly be conditioned by the forms in which it reaches us, how it
               is made concrete and available both for scholars and the wider public. As argued
               above, search-centred conventions offer meagre representational tools; while there
               are promising signs of a new generosity emerging, much more is possible. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7"> To demonstrate and interrogate that potential, this paper documents applied research
               into generous interfaces for cultural collections. In order to frame the problem more
               thoroughly, it first draws together a range of practical precedents and related
               theory from fields spanning information retrieval, human-computer interaction,
               information visualisation and digital humanities. This interdisciplinary terrain
               provides a useful framework, but also raises important tensions between the
               philosophical orientations of these fields; I argue finally for a humanistic model of
               interface and interaction that emphasises exploration and interpretation over task
               and information retrieval. Next, the paper presents a series of practical projects
               developed in partnership with Australian cultural institutions: <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite> (supported by Manly Public Library and the State Library of
               New South Wales); <cite class="title italic">Australian Prints and Printmaking</cite> (in
               partnership with the National Gallery of Australia); and <cite class="title italic">Discover the Queenslander</cite> (with the State Library of Queensland). I
               reflect on these projects as a designer and developer, and analyse them against the
               conceptual framework outlined earlier, offering practical strategies and critical
               injunctions for the creation of generous interfaces. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8"> In the opening scenario search is cast as the villain; but it’s also, more usefully,
               a puzzle. How did we come to be trapped in the search box; and do the limitations of
               search indicate richer alternatives? Search has a deep heritage in the history of
               computing, and especially the field of library and information science; it is deeply
               ingrained in the thinking and practices of digital collections, but equally its
               limitations have long been documented in the scholarship around information
               retrieval. As Belkin, Oddy and Brooks wrote in 1982, "One can identify two assumptions basic to the best-match
                     [search] principle: that it is possible for the user to specify precisely the
                     information that he/she requires; and, that information needs ... are
                     functionally equivalent to document texts" [<a class="ref" href="#belkin1982">Belkin et al. 1982</a>, 63]. Both of these questionable assumptions are directly relevant to digital
               cultural collections. As Taylor’s foundational work on information needs explains, a
               search query is a compromised and imperfect expression of a feeling that arises as a "vague dissatistfaction" [<a class="ref" href="#taylor1962">Taylor 1962</a>]. Rather than an information need, Belkin and collaborators propose an "anomalous state of knowledge", and observe that "in general, the user is unable to specify precisely what is needed
                  to resolve that anomaly"[<a class="ref" href="#belkin1982">Belkin et al. 1982</a>, 62]. Some twenty-five years later, little seems to
               have changed: writing on "grand challenges for information
                  retrieval", Belkin states: "only considering specified search as the basis for IR models
                     and techniques, is clearly inadequate, and inappropriate" [<a class="ref" href="#belkin2008">Belkin 2008</a>, 50]. Yet despite its flaws, search has been so effective that other techniques
               have been largely neglected — at least in practice. Research suggests that for
               humanities scholars search is both ubiquitous and imperfect. Kemman and colleagues
               confirm the dominance of Google and keyword search for contemporary researchers [<a class="ref" href="#kemman2013">Kemman et al. 2013</a>]. Rimmer and collaborators report that humanities
               researchers tend not to use advanced search techniques, but do use more exploratory
               strategies including "chaining" — following links through the
               literature via citations — and browsing, especially in physical libraries [<a class="ref" href="#rimmer2008">Rimmer et al. 2008</a>]. </div>

                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"> Browsing is the most prominent practical alternative to search, though in digital
               collections browse-based collection interfaces are typically impractical and
               uninspired: pages of alphabetised lists. By contrast, theorists in information
               retrieval argue that browsing is "a rich and fundamental human information behaviour" [<a class="ref" href="#chang1993">Chang and Rice 1993</a>]. The literature on browsing develops a portrait of a complex, open-ended,
               embodied human experience, rather than the input-output exchange that characterises
               traditional information retrieval [<a class="ref" href="#rice2001">Rice et al. 2001</a>, 2]. Researchers
               develop models of browsing with a number of relevant features. Browsing is an
               iterative process that entails scanning [<a class="ref" href="#rice2001">Rice et al. 2001</a>, 178] or
               glimpsing [<a class="ref" href="#bates2007">Bates 2007</a>] a field of potential resources, and selecting or
               sampling items for further investigation and evaluation. Browsing entails movement
               through a field of resources [<a class="ref" href="#rice2001">Rice et al. 2001</a>, 220]; Kwasnik stipulates
                  "movement in a connected space"[<a class="ref" href="#kwasnik1992">Kwasnik 1992</a>, 2.4.4]. This movement depends in turn on
               orientation: a knowledge of the "structure and content" of the
               browsing field and an ability to navigate within it [<a class="ref" href="#kwasnik1992">Kwasnik 1992</a>].
               Where information retrieval is premised on a specific intention or question, browsing
               reflects broader and more complex motivations. Browsing may be instrumental and
               purposeful, or intrinsically pleasurable; it may be cognitively or affectively
               rewarding, or both [<a class="ref" href="#rice2001">Rice et al. 2001</a>, 221–22]. We may browse with or
               without a goal in mind, and goals may change as the process unfolds. The model of
               browsing that emerges here ultimately challenges the instrumentalist basis of
               disciplines such as information retrieval; as Toms suggests, successful browsing is
               not a "task" but a pleasure [<a class="ref" href="#toms2000">Toms 2000</a>, 447]. </div>

               humanities researchers, physical libraries seem to be favoured as browsable,
               serendipitous and enjoyable information spaces [<a class="ref" href="#rimmer2008">Rimmer et al. 2008</a>, 14].
               Theorists of browsing offer some clues as to how browsing can be supported in digital
               environments. Bates critiques the conventional forms — "a long
                  list or a set of thumbnails" and calls instead for "rich scenes, full of potential objects of interest, that the eye can take in at
                  once" — what she terms a "massively parallel
                  glimpse"[<a class="ref" href="#bates2007">Bates 2007</a>]. Toms and Bates both emphasise stability and orientation;
               interface elements that establish and maintain continuity within a browsing space

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11"> From the complementary fields of interface design and information visualisation,
               Shneiderman’s "visual information seeking" approach is deservedly
               influential [<a class="ref" href="#shneiderman1996">Shneiderman 1996</a>]. Shneiderman sets out a
                  "mantra" for the visual exploration of digital collections:
                  "overview first, zoom and filter, then
                  details-on-demand". Overview is a <em class="emph">zoomed out</em> view of the whole
               collection; zoom and filter enable focus on a subset; detailed information on an item
               is displayed in its context (maintaining orientation). Shneiderman adds tasks for
                  "relate" — to view relationships between items;
                  "history" — preserving the user’s path through the system; and
                  "extract" — to save and share selected views or subsets.
               Shneiderman emphasises information visualisation here, and his approach has been most
               influential in that field; in later work with Greene et al. the implications of this
               approach for digital libraries are spelled out clearly. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12"> In a paper that amounts to a how-to manual for generous interfaces, Greene and
               colleagues observe that designers "often fail to provide
                  appropriate views...to give an overall sense of the structure and materials
                  available"[<a class="ref" href="#greene2000">Greene et al. 2000</a>, 1]. Drawing on library and information studies, they
               emphasise the "information surrogate" in collection
               interfaces; surrogates (such as catalog records) are compact, browsable abstractions
               of primary content — rich scenes for Bates’ "massively parallel
                  glimpse". In this formulation a <em class="emph">preview</em> (for example a
               thumbnail image) provides a surrogate for a single item; an <em class="emph">overview</em>
               provides a surrogate for a collection of items. The authors show how previews and
               overviews can be nested and articulated in systems designed for interactive "information seeking" (as distinct from information
               retrieval). Given suitable data, we can break collections into intelligible
               aggregates or subsets, reveal relationships between these, and link these overviews
               to previews of collection items. Surrogates should be "salient"
               (to the "task" and "needs" of users),
               hierarchical (showing multiple levels while maintaining orientation) and leverage
               structures in the collection (using temporal ordering, for example) [<a class="ref" href="#greene2000">Greene et al. 2000</a>, 8–9]. The authors also indicate some of the design
               challenges involved: overviews should be "fairly
                  exhaustive", but limits in the data might "limit the
                  coverage of the overview"; a preview should faithfully represent its
               object, but nonetheless "has the potential to be
                  misleading"[<a class="ref" href="#greene2000">Greene et al. 2000</a>, 7]. These points lead into important questions about
               the representation of digital cultural collections, to be taken up below. </div>

               density, browsability and generosity they trounce most contemporary interfaces to

               or Shneiderman’s notion of exploratory "information
                  seeking" in digital collections? Why are we still, it seems, stuck in the
               search box? Perhaps, as Kemman and colleagues suggest, Google’s uncanny effectiveness
               reassures us that search is the only interface we need [<a class="ref" href="#kemman2013">Kemman et al. 2013</a>];
               or academic work in information retrieval and visualisation has simply failed to
               connect with the custodians of our increasingly digital cultural heritage. The
               reasons are beyond the scope of this paper, except to note that the practical work
               presented here is aimed squarely at this implementation gap — creating rich,
               browsable interfaces for large, real-world digital collections. </div>

               issues. In applying techniques from information retrieval and visualisation to
               cultural material, this project must negotiate with a significant interdisciplinary
               boundary. Johanna Drucker poses the challenge clearly as she critiques the use of
               information visualisation within the digital humanities: bar charts and Google maps,
               she argues, constitute an epistemological Trojan horse [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2011">Drucker 2011</a>].
               These devices conceal realist models of knowledge — claims to transparently show
                  "what is" that are at odds with the critical tradition of the
               humanities. Similarly in calling for a model of "humanistic interface
                  design", Drucker critiques the orientation of mainstream HCI and
               information visualisation [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>]. In the work of researchers
               such as Shneiderman, Drucker says, we find a "pragmatic, but
                  highly mechanistic" approach, based on functional models of task and goal
               that are inappropriate in the humanities, where "distraction,
                  engagement, flow experience and pleasure-driven activity are not goal-oriented,
                  but motivated by the process"[<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>, para 32]. Rather than borrowing from HCI, Drucker
               calls on the digital humanities to reinvent interface design in a form "suited to its critical principles". </div>

               — is ubiquitous in HCI and IR. However those fields also suggest the seeds of
               alternative approaches, and these in turn, I suggest, offer ways forward for generous
               interfaces. The theorisations of browsing outlined above, for example, quickly exceed
               a narrow task focus; like Drucker, they recognise that browsing can be its own reward

               a query, an anomalous state of knowledge [<a class="ref" href="#belkin1982">Belkin et al. 1982</a>]. In other
               formulations such as exploratory search, outlined by Marchionini, information-seeking
               emerges as a complex, open-ended process, rather than a goal-oriented transaction

                  Following the ﬂaneur’s attitude toward the city, the information ﬂaneur sees
                  beauty and meaning in growing information spaces. By envisioning the information
                  ﬂaneur as a curious, creative, and critical persona, we promote a shift from

                  seeking is an inherently complex human experience"[<a class="ref" href="#dörk2011">Dörk et al. 2011</a>, 2]. The information flaneur embodies this model,
               emphasising curiosity and pleasure while maintaining a critical and reflective
               stance. For the info-flaneur, immersion in complex information is an everyday
               experience; casual, ambient, and cultural, rather than need-driven and instrumental.
               The authors also offer practical suggestions for flaneur-friendly interfaces,
               emphasising a continuum between "horizontal exploration" —
               overview, orientation, and multi-dimensonal browsing — and "vertical immersion" — the pleasures of detailed investigation and

               search alone is "inadequate"[<a class="ref" href="#belkin2008">Belkin 2008</a>, 50], while models of browsing offer richer, more
               complex models of experience, interaction and interpretation. Yet digital collections
               do not support browsing well: Bates observed in 2007 that browse interfaces consisted
               mainly of lists, and little has changed [<a class="ref" href="#bates2007">Bates 2007</a>]. Shneiderman,
               Greene and collaborators make essentially the same case for the value of visual
               exploration in digital collections, and offer concrete examples and techniques to
               that end [<a class="ref" href="#greene2000">Greene et al. 2000</a>]. In fact, across this literature — spanning
               information retrieval, information visualisation and HCI — a consistent set of
               principles emerges for browsable or exploratory interfaces: overview — Bates’ "massively parallel glimpse"; detail or preview of individual

               interdisciplinary middle ground that builds on pragmatic approaches while also
               critically interrogating their performance. Reflective practice is a useful approach
               here because it occupies a similarly in-between site, shuttling between
               conceptualisation, practical production and analysis. In my experience the making of
               generous interfaces is not a neat implementation but a productive wrangling of

               school sporting teams and real-estate advertising. Manly Library makes the images

               but workably compact representation of the collection as a whole. "Show everything" — a provocative edict from visualisation
               studio Stamen Design [<a class="ref" href="#jones2009">Jones 2009</a>] — offers a simple and literal-minded
               starting point. We adopted this approach in previous Java-based projects [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2009">Whitelaw 2009</a>][<a class="ref" href="#hinton2010">Hinton and Whitelaw 2010</a>]; but here it was not technically (let alone perceptually)
               feasible to render all 7000 items in the web browser. Creating a navigable overview
               thus requires some kind of intermediate representation, a set of proxies that
               aggregate all 7000 items into a smaller number of appropriate clusters. <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite> clusters the collection in two different
               dimensions, providing twin but complementary representations. One set of clusters
               simply groups items by decade (including a group for undated items); the other uses a
               frequency analysis of terms in item titles, creating sets of items grouped around
               specific, characteristic terms. The title clusters were developed here in the absence
               of other metadata (such as tags) that might help group related items, and extensively
                  "tuned" to the specific qualities of this collection. In my experience this
               experimental process of wrangling patchy and idiosyncratic metadata is characteristic

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22"> This clustered data provides the basis for the visual interface design. Groups of
               items become tiles in a browsable mosaic; each tile represents a cluster, and offers
               clues to — and previews of — the items it contains (see Figure 1). Each tile is a
               visual composite; an overlay of synoptic features and specific contents. The size of
               each tile is related to the number of items in that cluster — a summative,
               quantitative representation. Tiles also show the key facet of that cluster; either
               most frequent title term, or decade. Hovering over a larger tile also reveals a
               deeper list of title terms (synoptic qualitative features). Finally each tile shows
               the actual images within its cluster, and these preview images gradually change so
               that each tile progressively reveals its contents. Thus the interface as a whole
               forms a slowly shifting mosaic, as if rotating a complex, multi-faceted object. In
               the terms of Greene et al, this is a heirarchical interleaving of preview and
               overview: at any moment each tile offers both a preview of a specific item, and an
               overview of the other items it contains. The mosaic as a whole forms a composite,
               higher-order overview, encoding collection structure and distribution while also
               revealing its visual character and texture. Selecting a tile opens a horizontal
               slider display for browsing items in that cluster, while maintaining the context of
               the mosaic interface and the sense of global orientation that it provides. Selecting
               an item displays a large image in a lightbox, along with links to the item’s
               permanent URLs on the Manly Library site and Trove, where they can be bookmarked,

               40,000 works by more than 4,000 artists. In a project commissioned by the Gallery, I
               worked with Ben Ennis Butler to develop three separate "generous"
               interfaces offering multiple, complementary views. Launched in March 2013, these <a class="ref"

               on the main collection site as a prominent alternative to search. In this case the
               metadata is comprehensive, with highly structured relationships including detailed
               information on works and artists. Digitised images are available for around half of
               the works in the collection. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p24"> The structured data here enables two separate overview interfaces, each focusing on
               a different aspect of the collection. In the <cite class="title italic">All Artists</cite>
               interface all 4000 of the collection’s creators, printers, publishers, workshops and
               artists appear as a sortable array of tiles. Each one includes the artist’s name,
               birth and activity dates, gender, and number of works in the collection. Some data
               points are visually encoded: gender (including companies) is represented in a
               colour-coded left-hand border, while number of works is reflected in the width of the
               tile. Scanning a page of these tiles the distribution of males, females, and
               companies is immediately apparent. Similarly the "long tail"
               distribution of works within the collection is clear; most artists contribute a small
               number of works, while a few contribute many works. A panel of facets filters the
               display according to role, work count, and gender; so for example we may focus on
               female artists, or female printers, or only female printers with more than ten works
               in the collection. While such facets are a familiar feature in many collection search
               interfaces, there are two key differences here. These facets are also visual
               variables — bar-chart elements that show patterns of distribution at a glance.
               Second, these facets don’t require a preceding search, but enable refinement
               (Shneiderman’s "zoom and filter") of the initial overview as well
               as comparison of different subsets — showing, for example, the relative distributions
               of male and female artists for different roles. </div>

               overview focusing on works, rather than artists. The central device here is a
               chronological bar graph: each horizontal bar shows number of works per decade, and is
               segmented in turn into different work types such as intaglio, monoprint, and relief.
               We also include a section for undated works — essential to ensure that inevitably
               patchy metadata does not compromise the representation of works in the collection.
               The resulting graph is informative in itself, showing the chronological shape of the
               collection and the relative distribution of different print types. The boom in
               stencil printing in the 1970s and 80s, for example, is clear. The graph also acts as
               an interface; selecting a segment loads the corresponding set of works into the right
               hand pane. These cropped thumbnails provide a rich and immediate visual sample of the
               character of each group of works, and an exploratory interface in themselves.
               Hovering reveals full work images, titles and artists; clicking loads a larger image
               in the central pane. By showing three levels of scale concurrently — from whole
               collection, to focused subset, to individual work — the <cite class="title italic">Decade
                  Summary</cite> provides a single-screen interface to the entire 40,000-work
               collection. The hierarchy of scales provides a sort of visual compression of the
               collection, but also supports juxtapositions and lateral readings, encouraging
               context-rich exploration. </div>

               overview as a local or "inner" view. The <cite class="title italic">Works and Networks</cite> display focuses on a single artist, showing their
               works as a navigable grid; networks here refers to relationships between artists and
               other makers — a signficant factor in the collaborative artform of printmaking. The
               display lists each artist’s collaborators by role (printers, publishers, studios
               etc); selecting one re-focuses the display on that individual. Browsing collaborators
               and their works leads to new discoveries, and still more collaborations. Rather than
               a synoptic overview of the collection, this display encourages a piecing together of
               local views through the same "chaining" process Rimmer and
               colleagues identify in humanities information seeking [<a class="ref" href="#rimmer2008">Rimmer et al. 2008</a>].
               This display also works in conjunction with the two overviews: focusing on an artist
               in the <cite class="title italic">All Artists</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Decade
                  Browser</cite> views loads the corresponding artist in <cite class="title italic">Works
                  and Networks</cite>. Thus the three interfaces work together to provide a
               three-way parallax (triangulation?) while the more immersive
                  "innerview" of <cite class="title italic">Works and Networks</cite>
               complements the top-down overview of the other displays. This echoes the articulation
               of horizontal exploration and vertical immersion that Dörk and collaborators identify
               in the exploratory behaviour of the information flaneur [<a class="ref" href="#dörk2011">Dörk et al. 2011</a>, 7]. </div>

               create a rich, exploratory, visual interface for a wide audience, improving on some

               collection provides rich opportunities for a generous interface. Once again we
               construct two complementary views of the collection. The Mosaic view reuses the
               mosaic-tile approach from <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite>, segmenting the
               collection by year (Figure 5). Tile sizes show the distribution of the collection by
               date, and again the tiles progressively reveal their contents; in this case each
               tile’s slide show is also directly navigable. As in <cite class="title italic">Manly
                  Images</cite>, the mosaic provides a glanceable overview that shows both the
               shape of the collection and a changing chronological sampling of its contents; here
               the mosaic also provides a self-sufficient interface to navigate the entire

               contents of the collection through item-level metadata (Figure 6). The layout is
               conventional: a panel of facets, term-clouds and filters provides a navigable
               overview, mediating the display of individual items in an orderly grid below. Filters
               are cross-linked and update dynamically: selecting a specific year will refine the
               term clouds for that subset, while focusing on a specific subject or creator will
               show the temporal distribution of those items. Grid items reflect the current
               filters, but can also be used to modify those filters through their own item-level
               attributes, within the context of the grid. Where the main filter panel emphasises
               global overview, and the exploration of collection-wide features and correlations,
               the item-level controls enable navigation through local affinity or relationship. </div>

               palette for each item — a form of automatic content-based metadata. The filter panel
               includes a colour "overview", an aggregated 64-colour palette
               based on items in the current selection. Colours also act as filters, selecting items
               whose palettes contain similar shades, while also cross-linking with date, creator
               and subject. Colour becomes a visually engaging tool for browsing the collection, but
               also reveals the structures and patterns within it; the favoured palettes of specific
               artists, or the rapid turn away from colour illustration towards monochrome
               photography in the final years of the newspaper. </div>

               features are elided or ignored. <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite> shows this
               clearly. The title view selects and priveleges title terms, and runs them through a
               computational process that strongly shapes the final interface. A recursive process
               groups items around the most frequently occurring terms, creating ever-smaller
               clusters down to a lower threshhold (here five items). But these clusters don’t
               account for the whole collection: some 380 items remain unclustered in a
                  "long tail" with relatively infrequent title terms. They appear
               in the "others" tile — a false unity that marks the point where
               this aggregation process is finally defeated by the diversity of the collection. So
               to one of the central representational questions of overview — the cost, as it were,
               of compression: <em class="emph">what misses out? </em> In this case it is the heterogenity of
               the long tail — the outliers or oddities in the collection. Where overviews emphasise
               quantitative features — the distribution of items within a collection — they will
               often privelege the common, and hide (or minimise) the rare. Metadata and collection
               structure matters; tightly-structured metadata (such as dates) makes for easier
               aggregations, as shown in <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Discover the Queenslander</cite>. We can account for items with
               missing metadata relatively easily (<cite class="title italic">Decade Browser, Manly
                  Images</cite>); but complex, unstructured, diverse metadata (terms, tags,
               subjects) resists the compression that overview demands. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p35"> This resistance is more (and more important) than a technical inconvenience: the
               complexity and diversity of digital cultural collections is central, I assert, to
               their character and their value. This complexity is exactly what a generous interface
               should aspire to reveal, so this is a significant challenge, especially when it can
               be difficult to distinguish between the signal of long-tail diversity and the noise
               of poor metadata. In response this work presents some specific strategies for
               overviews that honor complexity and represent diversity. Multiple overviews can form
               complementary composites, revealing different aspects of a collection — what Drucker
               terms "parallax"[<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>, para 39]. The <cite class="title italic">All
                  Artists</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Decade Browser</cite> interfaces to the
               Prints and Printmaking collection demonstrate this, as do the Mosaic and Grid views
               in the <cite class="title italic">Queenslander</cite> project. Links between different
               views encourage a shuttling or alternation, emphasising the parallax effect — as in
               the <cite class="title italic">Queenslander</cite>, where Mosaic tiles link to the Grid
               view for the corresponding year. Multiple views also make an important metatextual
               point: that any interface is intrinsically contingent, rather than necessary. If we
               can create two or three different overviews, why not four or five? A
                  "parallax" interface suggests an open-ended proliferation of
               partial views; rather than a single total or definitive representation, it emphasises
               a human interpretive process. </div>
                  <div class="counter">
                     <a href="#p36">36</a>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p36"> Another strategy used here is the layering and juxtaposition of different
               representational forms within a single overview, creating a form of internalised
               parallax that provokes rather than determines interpretation. In <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The Queenslander</cite> overviews
               are also multi-faceted previews; aggregations are shown as tiles that juxtapose
               generalising aggregate features (term or year, item count) with the specific texture
               of individual items. Previews act as rich exemplars that support interpretive
               inferences about the collection — a stitching together of inevitably partial proxies
               and clues supplied by the interface. The tiles in <cite class="title italic">Manly
                  Images</cite> combine (specific) image with (aggregate) text in this way. The use
               of animation in both interfaces adds a layer of temporal parallax, a gradual
               unfurling that reveals the diversity within each aggregate. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p37"> For Greene and collaborators both previews and overviews are information surrogates;
               one of their key guidlines is to "use salient surrogates"[<a class="ref" href="#greene2000">Greene et al. 2000</a>, 8]. "Salience" here requires
                  "a solid understanding of data and users"; the
               interface designer should identify the most important or prominent features for a
               given task, with a given collection. Of course this rests on a stack of questionable
               assumptions, including the very existence of a "task" and a
               knowable and generalised "user"; any pre-baked salience
               immediately closes down alternative readings of the collection. By using multiple and
               multi-level surrogates (also among Greene’s recommendations) we hope to support
               open-ended exploration and interpretation, presenting a rich set of partial
               information — fragments and clues that invite further investigation. Drucker’s call
               for "fragmented and correlated points of view that resist
                  self-evident reification" resonates here [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>, para 39]. </div>

               overarching goal in creating browsable interfaces. On the other hand these
               experiments suggest that content discovery is only part of the story. Cross-linked
               and hierarchical displays emphasise context — complex, multi-dimensional
               relationships between items — as well as macro-scale patterns and structures within
               collections. As with overview however, we regard these features as contingent and
               generative, prompting further investigation, rather than claiming to show <em class="emph">what
                  is</em>. For example the Australian Prints <cite class="title italic">Decade
                  Summary</cite> shows a noticeable "bump" in relief printing in
               the 1920s and 30s; investigation reveals the work of noted Australian artist Margaret
               Preston and her Japanese-influenced wood-cut techniques, as well as a strong graphic
               turn among her contemporaries. These discoveries both reinforce and complicate a
               familiar art-historical narrative of Australian Modernism, hinting at the milieu
               around a prominent individual such as Preston. While the overview’s dimensions —
               decade and print type — enable this discovery, those dimensions are not necessarily
                  "salient" (prominent or significant) in themselves. Rather they
               form a scaffold or framework against which more complex features can be investigated.
               Similarly in <cite class="title italic">The Queenslander</cite>, the year-based histogram
               acts as an interpretive lens as well as a navigable overview. It reveals, among other

               overview; they are well suited to a model of exploration that emphasises process and
               interpretation, as in Kwasnik’s theory of browsing [<a class="ref" href="#kwasnik1992">Kwasnik 1992</a>]. In
               the <cite class="title italic">Works and Networks</cite> interface to <cite class="title italic">Australian Prints and Printmaking</cite>, each view is strictly local — showing
               a single artist’s works and collaborators — yet in wandering the local connections we
               can develop a complex appreciation of intra-collection structures that is not
               available via an overview such as the <cite class="title italic">Decade Browser</cite>.
               Similarly in <cite class="title italic">The Queenslander</cite>, the grid view encourages
               traversing the collection through related slices or subsets; local, partial views
               that build up a more fine-grained familiarity. Linking innerviews with overviews
               promotes the alternation between modes that Dörk and colleagues see as characteristic
               of exploration in complex information spaces [<a class="ref" href="#dörk2011">Dörk et al. 2011</a>, 7]. </div>

               For the contemporary information-flaneur digital collections are sites for leisure
               and pleasure as much as focused investigation; so why not drift idly, rather than
               clicking and scrolling? The animated tiles in <cite class="title italic">Manly

               passive, contemplative mode of engagement as well as active navigation. Passive or
               ambient collection displays would be well suited to contexts beyond the web browser —
               from on-site institutional displays to domestic media environments. The proposal for
               generous interfaces thus extends beyond the web, to consider a generous (and various)
               range of technical platforms and cultural modes of encounter. </div>

               Javascript, and run in modern, standards-compliant browsers on a wide range of
               devices and platforms. <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite> and the Prints and
               Printmaking interfaces use jQuery; <cite class="title italic">The Queenslander</cite> uses
               Angular.js; in either case, the data parsing and processing, and construction of the
               interface is handled in the browser. This approach is effective and light-weight; it
               simplifies design and development, but does introduce some interesting challenges,
               especially with larger collections. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p42"> A search-based collection interface uses a traditional client/server architecture.
               The server hosts the source data (in the form of a database); clients send requests
               for data, and the server replies with a small set of results. This model mirrors the
               search paradigm; in general the server’s only mode of response is to reply to a
               query. By contrast, constructing an overvew requires some level of data for the
               entire collection. In the work presented here we use two complementary approaches.
               For smaller collections (in <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The Queenslander</cite>) we package the whole collection’s metadata
               into a single static (JSON) file; the <cite class="title italic">Manly Images</cite>
               metadata for 7000 images packs down to around 700kb. This client-side approach has a
               number of advantages. Because the browser retains a complete representation of the
               collection, it can build and rebuild the display without reloading the metadata. The
               collection can be clustered, filtered and traversed without the performance penalty
               of a server / database request; the result is a more responsive interface and faster,
               easier exploration. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p43"> Client-side item metadata is practical for a collection of 5000, but not for
               5,000,000 items. Overviews of larger collections depend on some form of aggregate or
               summary data. In the case of the <cite class="title italic">Decade Summary</cite>
               overview, a custom API generates an aggregated table of item counts per decade and
               print type. Selecting a facet or segment of the collection triggers a second API call
               delivering item-level metadata for the relevant works. In this case the overview data
               is a single additional layer on top of the item data; for larger collections a deeper
               tree of overviews would be necessary. While there are no significant technical
               obstacles to providing such overviews, off-the-shelf frameworks and infrastructures
               (which underpin most digital cultural collections) are not designed to provide this
               sort of synoptic data. So far our own work has emphasised "front
                  end" or client-side development; generous interfaces for large
               collections will require more back-end development to provide the data that rich
               overviews demand. </div>

               The projects presented here reflect an ongoing process of practical experimentation
               and the development of an ad-hoc repertoire of strategies and techniques. The
               underlying design process here is one of hands-on investigation and iterative
               exploration, as well as an attentiveness to the digital materials involved (as
               described by [<a class="ref" href="#armitage2009">Armitage 2009</a>]). Notably in order to understand the
               features of a collection that might be represented, we must first represent the
               collection: the riches and voids in each collection are only evident through a
               process of exploratory visualisation. Synoptic devices such as histograms and tag
               clouds offer starting points for sketches, which can in turn develop into
               fully-fledged interfaces. For a designer this process presents a challenge in that
               preconceived visual or information structures rarely survive contact with the
               collection data. At the same time, exploratory visualisations can lead to further
               work with the metadata, which in turn transforms the potential representations. Given
               the wide range of potential interfaces and the potentially endless circularity of
               exploration and revisualization, our approach in these projects is pragmatic. We
               adapt familiar visualisation and interface conventions such as column graphs and
               timelines, facets and tags. While these may not be the optimal representational forms
               for generous interfaces, they offer practical starting points. </div>

               interfaces require also raises some interesting challenges to conventional roles and
               capacities. Traditional collection interfaces reflect a clear delineation of
                  "back end" (collection management and metadata) and
                  "front end" (web design) as distinct functions and roles.
               Generous interfaces require a combination of approaches and skills spanning
               visualization, information design, data analysis, manipulation and processing. My
               collaborators and I draw on backgrounds in digital art and design and specifically
               creative code, where hybrid skill-sets and a playful, pragmatic experimentalism are

               us largely through the web browser, and thus they are shaped and conditioned by
               practices (and philosophies) of interface design and information retrieval, as well
               as by "back end" processes of collection, curation and
               digitisation. In this paper I argue that search, as the dominant interface to our
               cultural collections, is inadequate. Keyword search is ungenerous: it demands a
               query, discourages exploration, and withholds more than it provides. This paper
               argues instead for <em class="emph">generous interfaces</em> that better match both the ethos
               of collecting institutions, and the opportunities of the contemporary web. Generous
               interfaces provide rich, navigable representations of large digital collections; they
               invite exploration and support browsing, using overviews to establish context and
               maintain orientation while revealing detail at multiple scales. Generous interfaces
               use multiple, fragmentary representations to reveal the complexity and diversity of
               cultural collections, and to privilege the process of interpretation. While they draw
               on techniques and models established in information retrieval and visualisation,
               generous interfaces emphasise process, pleasure and thoughtful engagement rather than
               the functional satisfaction of an information need. Like any interface or
               visualisation, these interfaces are inescapably contingent and constructed; as the
               representational scope of the interface multiplies so do the cultural stakes, and the
               need for critical attention and reflective practice. Yet if there are risks in doing
               too much, they are outweighed by the opportunities of doing more with the immense
               riches of our digital cultural collections. As the experiments presented here show,
               much more is possible. </div>
