                     practices in the humanities and arts in Lithuania, based on a major European
                     survey conducted by the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and
                     Humanities (DARIAH) in 2014 and 2015. The survey was aimed at understanding
                     existing scholarly practices, methods and tools that are applied by researchers,
                     as well as attitudes towards digital technologies in research and scholarship.
                     This article analyzes specific aspects of scholarly research activities and
                     digital needs in Lithuania, and provides evidence-based insights on the national
                     digital humanities landscape.

                     computational methodologies for humanities research [<a class="ref" href="#schreibman2004">Schreibman, Siemens, and Unsworth 2004</a>]. As a field of study it became more akin to a
                     common methodological outlook, rather than just dependent on digital data or
                     even digital technologies [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2012">Kirschenbaum 2012</a>]. The definition of
                     digital humanities presented in the Digital Humanities Manifesto, originally
                     published in 2008, puts emphasis on research activity by describing digital
                     humanities as a variety of scholarly practices evolving along digital data,
                     media tools and techniques:

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> While scholarly practices are in the very essence of the concept, defying and
                     understanding them remains an important task for researchers, especially in the
                     field of information behavior, its management, curation and communication, and
                     use of digital technologies within information science. The nature of digital
                     humanities as an interdisciplinary field, where research practice continues on
                     developing differently within separate research areas, or (even more so) it
                     tends to hinge on a single project or individual research, entails inevitable
                     complexity. Nowadays, the enhancement of the scholarly research process is being
                     challenged by the need to build an infrastructure for digital scholarship
                     similar to that already established in the sciences, commonly identified as
                     <em class="emph">Cyberinfrastructure</em> or <em class="emph">eScience</em>
                     [<a class="ref" href="#crane2007">Crane, Babeu, and Bamman 2007</a>]. Its development and capacity to support the field
                     and ensure better research quality strongly relies on identification of actual
                     scholarly needs. Even if it is hard to predict the full form of such an
                     infrastructure in the future, the identification of services already in use may
                     significantly contribute to its establishment, shifting from isolated, project
                     based applications to ubiquitous and often invisible elements of a shared
                     infrastructure [<a class="ref" href="#crane2007">Crane, Babeu, and Bamman 2007</a>].

                     which derived from the data collected from interviews of social science
                     researchers, included six generic features, such as starting, chaining,

                     Endeavours in seeking to perceive the basic functions of the digital humanities
                     lead to the notion of “scholarly
                     primitives”, the term describing scholarly activities, which are
                     independent from theoretical orientation and cross the boundaries of different
                     research disciplines [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2000">Unsworth 2000</a>]. Similar principles apply to
                     the idea of “methodological
                     commons”, as the set of the most common activities that inter-connect
                     different content, tools and methods [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2002">Mccarty and Short 2002</a>]. The later
                     notions were developed into recombination of scholarly activities under five
                     main categories, such as searching, collecting, reading, writing and
                     collaborating [<a class="ref" href="#palmer2009">Palmer et al. 2009</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> A digital humanities taxonomy, on the other hand, is a pragmatic expression of
                     classifying such activities and representing them in a categorized manner. In
                     2005, the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) ICT methods network started to
                     develop a taxonomy of computational methods, showcasing digital humanities in
                     practice in order to understand the impact of digital content, tools and methods
                     on humanities and arts scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#ahds2004">AHDS Projects and Method Database 2004</a>]. The taxonomy
                     serves as a controlled vocabulary and classifies method terms according to two
                     dimensions: firstly, “content
                     types”, based on the nature of the content of the digital resource
                     employed, and, secondly, “function
                     types”, based on the broad functions commonly undertaken in digital
                     resource creation processes [<a class="ref" href="#speck2005">Speck 2005</a>]. The taxonomy was later
                     adopted by the Digital Humanities Observatory (DHO) and by the Oxford University
                     Digital Humanities Programme, and used for the description of digital humanities
                     projects, thus providing a framework for understanding how digital methods
                     enable research practice and how they work with existing content and tools [<a class="ref" href="#hughes2015">Hughes, Constantopoulos, and Dallas 2015</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5"> Another initiative on developing a Digital Humanities Taxonomy was launched by
                     Project Bamboo and its Digital Research Tools (DiRT) Directory, which focused on
                     allowing researchers to find and compare digital research resources and software
                     tools [<a class="ref" href="#DiRT2016">DiRT 2016</a>]. In collaboration with DARIAH-DE, the national
                     project affiliated with DARIAH-EU in Germany, it developed the Taxonomy of
                     Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH). The taxonomy splits
                     into three main categories: a) research activities, b) research objects, and c)
                     research techniques, and includes more detailed sub-categories with descriptions
                     [<a class="ref" href="#TaDiRAH2016">TaDiRAH 2016</a>]. The creation of TaDiRAH was based on a
                     pragmatic, bottom-up and user centric approach, where the emerging taxonomy
                     framework was developed by summarizing existing collections of content and
                     allowing tool users such as scholars, developers and practitioners to review and
                     add content [<a class="ref" href="#luise2016">Luise et al. 2016</a>].

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"> A more profound view on scholarly work inevitably leads to the development of a
                     conceptual domain model, or ontology, that seeks to be more theoretically
                     rigorous than a taxonomy. Such an ontology could help to establish a common
                     understanding and vocabulary within the digital humanities community, to link
                     content, tools and methods and tackle their heterogeneity, as well as to
                     approach theoretical issues questioning critically the underlying processes of
                     contemporary scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#hughes2015">Hughes, Constantopoulos, and Dallas 2015</a>]. The creation of a digital
                     humanities ontology is an ongoing effort, undertaken by the Digital Curation
                     Unit, Athena Research Centre in collaboration with the Network for Digital
                     Methods in the Arts and Humanities (NeDiMAH) and DARIAH-EU [<a class="ref" href="#NeDiMAH2015">NeDiMAH 2015</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#DARIAH-EU2018">DARIAH-EU 2018</a>]; the first edition of the upper and middle layers

                     (NeMO) is based on the Scholarly Research Activity Model (SRAM), which
                     conceptualizes the research process through a network of inter-related entities,
                     such as actors, activities, methods, procedures, resources, formats, tools and
                     services, and goals. It seeks to capture three complementary aspects of
                     research, i.e., from the point of view of actors (agency), processes and
                     resources, using the central notion of activity to provide a common ground for
                     all of them [<a class="ref" href="#benardou2013">Benardou, Constantopoulos, and Dallas 2013</a>]. The NeMO ontology seeks to encompass
                     not just digital humanities work in the stricter sense but also
                     digitally-enabled work in general by including a broad spectrum of humanities
                     disciplines and covering in equal measure methods focused on use and
                     modification of digital resources, as well as research methods representing all
                     phases of the scholarly research life cycle [<a class="ref" href="#hughes2015">Hughes, Constantopoulos, and Dallas 2015</a>].

                     European survey on scholarly practices and digital needs in the arts and

                     humanities at national and international levels. Given the pragmatic
                     limitations, the priority was given to reveal the aspects and research needs of
                     scholarly practices relevant to the capabilities of data and content driven
                     digital infrastructures, such as DARIAH-EU; thus the survey “sought to collect reliable

                     researchers who provided country-based reports of statistically-significant
                     results. This article is the presentation of the Lithuanian results on scholarly
                     work and the employment of digital methods and tools by the national digital
                     humanities community, conducted as part of this broader research. It seeks to
                     present the national position towards digital humanities and to provide insights
                     on the existing research community that is engaged or interested in using
                     various digital tools in scholarly work, based on the evident statistical
                     results, which has never been collected to systematically approach the issue
                     related to national information practice, even though the digitization of
                     cultural heritage and the creation of digital research data along with
                     digitally-enabled scholarly work has been going on in Lithuania for more than 20
                     years. The first study designed to analyze the effect of digital technologies
                     was done in 2003 in the area of archaeology and underlined an existing necessity
                     indicated by the majority of archaeologists to use digital data in research,
                     which was mainly driven by personal research interests [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2006">Laužikas 2006</a>]. Significant drawbacks at the moment were
                     associated with obsolete software, lack of digitized research data and low level
                     of standardization in the area of digital archaeology [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2006">Laužikas 2006</a>]. Another study more broadly related to the
                     development of national digital humanities infrastructure was carried out by the
                     Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2012">Laužikas 2012</a>]. It
                     attempted to provide an overview and analysis situation regarding the
                     digitization of cultural heritage and research data in relation to existing
                     national information infrastructures. The analysis showed the creation and
                     development of the Lithuanian digital research infrastructure would be greatly
                     influenced by institutional, technological and function distribution factors,
                     and less so by legal and administrative factors, while the influence of economic
                     and social factors would be the least important [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2012">Laužikas 2012</a>].
                     However, the research did not include any analysis of scholarly activity and did
                     not seek to capture the needs of researchers working in the area of digital
                     humanities. Another similar study done in 2014 focused on the strategic
                     management of heritage digitization in Lithuania and sought to develop a
                     conceptual approach towards digital cultural heritage presenting it in a
                     changing social context of “network society”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2014">Laužikas and Varnienė 2014</a>]. The issue of the study was on heritage digitization, which was carried
                     out without fully evaluating the social context and consolidating resources,
                     thus resulting in poor quality digitization products, which were unrelated and
                     satisfied the needs of institutions rather than of the users [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2014">Laužikas and Varnienė 2014</a>]. Additionally, periodic statistical studies of the
                     Lithuanian scientific and scholarly institutions and research communities are
                     carried out providing important evidence-based data on the current national
                     research situation and statistical trends. Two of them, conducted within the
                     time span of the survey, are considered relevant for this publication to provide
                     insights on the quantitative aspects of human sciences in Lithuania [<a class="ref" href="#bumelis2014">Bumelis et al. 2014</a>]

                     none of these studies had properly assessed the prevalence of digital
                     technologies across all humanities disciplines and the impact of digital
                     research at national, nevertheless international, scales. The DARIAH European
                     survey on scholarly practices and digital needs in the arts and humanities
                     disseminated at the national level was the first attempt to fill the gap in
                     information practices and information behaviour research by comprehensively
                     identifying and analyzing scholarly activities in the digital environment
                     carried out by Lithuanian scholars. Furthermore, it was the first assay to
                     compare the national phenomena with the European dimensions, thus providing an
                     international context to the Lithuanian case study and seeing it as an integral
                     part of the European digital humanities community.

                     research centers<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e448">[3]</a> that conduct research in the arts and humanities or are engaged in
                     digitization activities and digital cultural heritage projects. Professional
                     associations or societies, such as librarians, museum professionals, archivists,
                     archaeologists, historians, etc., were also addressed. Thus the survey was
                     designed to focus on defining a broader community of digitally-enabled
                     researchers. The survey was disseminated as DARIAH digital humanities survey and
                     explicitly invited scholars working in the field of digital humanities and arts,
                     as well as scholars working in the area of digitization and also with digital
                     technologies to respond. Therefore, the assumption was made that all 137
                     respondents should be considered to be a part of the national community of
                     digital humanities, though the proficiency to adopt digital technologies may
                     vary among community members. Based on the survey results, this assumption later
                     on led to the distinction of “digitally-enabled humanists” and
                     “digitally-aware humanists”, both considered to be relevant to a
                     current state and development of the national digital humanities research
                     community. The study draws attention to scholars and actual scholarly work that
                     happens not only in digitization projects or within digital infrastructure, but
                     also very much depends on one’s personal attitudes and needs, thus contributing
                     to a better understanding of the national state of art digital research

                     indicators, gender and age, were used to define basic demographic aspects of
                     respondents. The former indicated that the majority of researchers working in
                     the arts and humanities field are female (60,6%), while male researchers
                     constitute 39,4% of the community (see <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>).
                     The ratio of male to female digital humanities scholars is consistent with the
                     general characteristics of the Lithuanian scientific community. As indicated in
                     the “Report of the Lithuanian science state”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#bumelis2014">Bumelis et al. 2014</a>] the ratio of female researchers has been
                     consistently increasing over the last decade and it is one of the highest in the
                     European Union countries exceeding an estimated EU average by 20%.

                     followed by linguistics and archaeology, which are equally represented by 16,8%
                     of respondents (see <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>). Furthermore, art,
                     history of art or visual studies is practiced by 13,3% of researchers, while
                     8,9% of respondents represent language and literature-related disciplines.
                     Traditionally, a significant leaning towards text-based disciplines, such as
                     history, linguistics and literature, is very common in digital humanities, while
                     the relation with archaeology is more complex even though archaeology havs been
                     at the forefront of using ICT methods and tools [<a class="ref" href="#huggett2012">Huggett 2012</a>].
                     The national composition of digital humanities disciplines complies with general

                     in the field of archaeology, where its relation with digital humanities is

                     professional status [<a class="ref" href="#dallas2017">Dallas et al. 2017</a>]. It indicates that both
                     communities consist of a greater number of female researchers, which is higher
                     by 21,2% in Lithuania and 13,1% in Europe. It also shows that the larger part of
                     digital humanists (53,3% in Lithuania and 39,5% in Europe) belong to the
                     middle-age (36-50 years) group. Moreover, a greater majority of scholars (57,7%

                     research are the main indicators confirming the presence of digital humanities.
                     One of the goals of the survey was to measure to what extent digital media is
                     actually used in scholarly work, by asking the respondents to indicate whether
                     they use or are interested in using digital media for their research. The
                     interpretation of the responses in the Lithuanian context becomes even more
                     important as there is neither an explicit definition of the national digital
                     humanities, nor a well-established digital humanities research community
                     supporting the field. Moreover, the digitization of heritage and scientific data
                     in Lithuania faces major challenges, such as decentralization of national
                     digitization activities, low level of standardization, weak interinstitutional
                     cooperation and the lack of interoperability between different research
                     infrastructures [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2012">Laužikas 2012</a>]. Therefore, tracing the actual use
                     of digital media is an important task, showcasing the prevalence of the national
                     digital humanities field and the persistence of existing digital practices in
                     scholarly research. As shown by the survey data the Lithuanian community of
                     digital humanists involves not only advanced digital researchers or steady
                     digital methods and tools users, but also includes intermediate users and
                     digitally aware scholars. The great majority (89,1%) of scholars who responded
                     to the survey indicated that digital technologies are very relevant in their
                     work (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>). Herewith the majority of the
                     community represented by 58,4% of respondents are advanced digital humanists,
                     who acknowledged regular use of digital methods and tools in research (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>). 30,7% of respondents noted that they are
                     interested in using digital methods or tools representing a substantial
                     proportion of digitally-enabled or highly digitally-aware humanists, who are
                     likely to become more persistent digital humanities researchers in the near
                     future (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>). On the other hand, 10,9% of
                     scholars said that they neither use, nor are interested in using digital methods
                     or tools. The latter group of reluctant scholars cannot be determined by any
                     particular characteristic in relation to respondents age, research discipline,
                     etc. Thus it should be associated with lack of motivation to use digital
                     technologies, which could be caused by different reasons. A recent study of
                     digital humanities users [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2012">Warwick 2012</a>] points out that humanities
                     scholars could be very easily deterred from using digital infrastructures for
                     numerous factors, including technical problems, complicated interfaces, poor
                     quality of resources, incomplete content, etc. To learn new skills in order to
                     deal with technological complexities requires persistent and highly motivated
                     users, who appear to be only a few [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2012">Warwick 2012</a>]. While
                     institutional decentralization is defined as the main existing problem in the
                     Lithuanian arts and humanities [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2012">Laužikas 2012</a>] it also could
                     explain the lack of interest in using digital technologies. Separate
                     institutions relying on individual digitization projects usually are not able to
                     accumulate enough financial or technological resources to develop highly usable
                     digital products, as well as to digitize vast collections or data sets that
                     could face the needs of all scholars working in the field. On the other hand,
                     the willingness of “digitally-reluctant scholars” to
                     participate in the digital humanities survey also reveals a certain concern
                     about digital humanities expressed by participants. 10,9% of theresearch
                     community may also represent a significant proportion of digitally-aware
                     humanists, who currently monitor digital research developments and may become
                     potential users of digital infrastructures in the future.

                     relates to the type of material being accessed. E-publishing and online access
                     to journals and books expands the research possibilities for scholars, and has
                     many advantages in scope and speed over printed material. Most importantly, it
                     welcomes new means of communication by incorporating multimedia, hypermedia or
                     interactivity into published scholarly work. Scholarly journal publication is

                     (64,2%), as well as archival holdings, which are quite commonly (46,7%) studied
                     by using some non-digital device or form. 30,7% scholars read printed scholarly

                     and archival holdings in print form or on an analogue device is still a common
                     practice among researchers. On the other hand, articles in scholarly journals or
                     conference proceedings are becoming far less commonly accessed in their printed
                     form, while images, maps, video and audio are mainly consulted in some digital
                     form and very rarely in printed or analogue form. The latter, and especially
                     video and audio resources, are also more likely to be consulted on mobile
                     devices, such as tablets and smartphones, even if these devices in general are
                     not as widely used as desktop and laptop computers. The greater use of mobile
                     devices to view maps, as well as audio and video material goes in line with the
                     most recent tendency to adopt these kinds of resources in interactive cultural
                     heritage representations by using new media and GPS based mobile applications.

                     work focus on core scholarly activities that are common across disciplines, such
                     as searching, collecting, reading, writing, collaborating, etc. [<a class="ref" href="#palmer2009">Palmer et al. 2009</a>]

                     with five major activities, or processes, representing different stages of the
                     research cycle, such as: 1) discovery, collection and creation of research
                     assets; 2) organization, structuration and management; 3) annotation, enrichment
                     and curation; 4) processing, analysis and visualization; 5) publishing,
                     dissemination and communication, and were asked to identify on which stage they
                     usually employ digital methods and tools. As shown in <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>, all five suggested activities, connected with successive
                     stages of the scholarly research process, are relevant to researchers. The
                     initial research stage shows the highest level of digital methods and tools
                     application. Indeed, the most frequent purpose of using digital methods or tools
                     cited by researchers was to discover, collect or create their research assets
                     (83,9%). Also organizing, the following stage of structuring or managing
                     research data (76,6%), as well as processing, analyzing or visualizing research
                     assets (the penultimate stage of scholarly research), were also very frequently
                     mentioned as a purpose of using digital technologies (75,2%). Less frequent use
                     of digital methods or tools is reported with regard to the middle stage (i.e.
                     annotate, enrich or curate their research assets) and the last stage (i.e.
                     publishing, disseminating or communicating about one’s research) of the
                     scholarly research process. However, it should be noted that over half of the

                        used to organize, structure or manage research data. The most widespread
                        among Lithuanian digital humanists are offline tools, such as a word
                        processor (98,5%) or spreadsheet application (75,9%) (see <a href="#figure15">Figure 15</a>). MS Excel or MS Office programs are

                        own keyword lists or thesauri to the same extent as standard ones, though a
                        personal keyword list is slightly more preferable for usage (see <a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>). 41,2% of researchers are frequent
                        users of personal keywords and 35,4% use standard keyword lists or thesauri.
                        However, one of three researchers report that they seldom, or never use
                        standard or personal keyword lists or thesauri (see <a href="#figure18">Figure 18</a>). The latter fact relates to an indicated low level of
                        standardization and lack of strategic reglementation in national research
                        infrastructures dealing with scholarly data [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2012">Laužikas 2012</a>].

                        Cultural heritage sector had adopted a national digitization strategy, which

                        using a bibliographic management application whereas it is very often used
                        by 7,5% and often used by 9% of scholars. One of five respondents (19,5%)

                     <div class="ptext" id="p51"> A wide range of activities and tools were identified by researchers when
                        trying to describe digital practices linked with data processing, analysis
                        and visualization. Mentioned examples mainly concentrated on data analysis
                        where the choice for the particular digital method or tool depends on
                        specific data that is relevant to respondents’ research field, e.g. for
                        archaeological data analysis ArcGIS, ArcMap and WinBasp tools are used,
                        linguistic analysis uses tools provided by AntConc and WordSmith software,
                        and social network analysis is often implemented with Gephi software (see
                        <a href="#table04">Table 4</a>). On the other hand, many digital
                        methods and tools are versatile and spread across different digital
                        humanities disciplines. Such examples include qualitative, quantitative,
                        comparative, computational, statistical, web analysis, etc. and a list of
                        appropriate tools that allow to process data, e.g. MS Excel, MS Word,
                        Loglet, Mathcad, HAMLET, MAXQDA, PSPP, SPSS, OriginLab, Google Analytics,
                        etc. (see <a href="#table04">Table 4</a>). Other activities to process
                        research data include programming, transcribing, audio and video editing.
                        Some of them also mention tools used for these purposes, e.g. online
                        keyboard TypeIt for phonetic transcription or Adobe Premiere Pro and
                        Videopad software – for video editing (see <a href="#table04">Table
                           4</a>). The visualization of data, including drawing and 3D
                        visualization, is another important activity mentioned by researchers. The
                        most common image processing tools are Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop,
                        CorelDRAW and AutoCAD (see <a href="#table04">Table 4</a>).

                        e.g. an institutional repository or portal, an open content journal, one’s
                        own website or blog and social media sites. A distinction between the latter
                        was made having in mind an existing diversity of social media sites where
                        dissemination is done through different ways or different kinds of content.
                        Also, not all social media tools could be used to the same extent.
                        Respectively a few options were suggested to respondents in order to avoid
                        overgeneralization of social media tools. Proposed options include scholarly
                        community sites (e. g. academia.edu, ResearchGate) (1), generic online
                        content communities (e. g. Slideshare, Flickr, Youtube) (2) and social
                        networks (e. g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+) (3). An important aspect of
                        collaboration in the digital humanities community is the shift over the last
                        two decades from a focus on the audience to participation that includes
                        scholars, students and the general public [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2009">Borgman 2009</a>]. Many
                        scholars are familiar with Web 2.0 tools and social media possibilities
                        allowing to be engaged in more profound scholarly communication and perform
                        miscellaneous participatory activities. The use of these technologies is an
                        important indicator showcasing the change of information behavior in the
                        context of scholarly communication.

                        means to disseminate their research results. The survey revealed that the
                        dissemination of scholarly work in Lithuania is mostly done through an open
                        content journal or publication (see <a href="#figure20">Figure
                           20</a>). 30,1% of the respondents use it very often and 36,8% of them
                        often. 23,5% of researchers indicated using it seldom, while 9,6% of them
                        stated they never used such means of dissemination.

                        (see <a href="#figure20">Figure 20</a>). Scholarly community sites
                        (e.g. academia.edu, ResearcGate, etc.) are the most popular type of social
                        media used in research dissemination, followed by social networks (e.g.
                        Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc.). 11,6% of respondents are very frequent
                        and 14% frequent users of online academic communities, while social networks
                        are very frequently used by only 3,9% and frequently by 10,2% of
                        researchers. One out of four (24%) researchers are occasional users of
                        online scholarly communities and one out of five (19,7%) of social networks.
                        However, the majority of researchers never use scholarly communities (50,4%)
                        or social networks (66,1%) to promote research.

                        in the national digital humanities as researchers prefer more formal ways of
                        dissemination, such as journals or institutional portals. Social media usage
                        patterns demonstrate a slow shift towards participatory and more
                        collaborative scholarly communication, but do not indicate a breakthrough
                        point in the community. Usually researchers with adequate Web/Web 2.0 skills
                        have a greater variety of information practices, more choices for multi
                        communication, and more tools in social media [<a class="ref" href="#gu2011">Gu and Widen-Wulff 2011</a>]. Thus
                        a wider application of Web 2.0 technologies in national digital humanities
                        may be expected in the future, when researchers will develop a specific set
                        of skills and a certain level of confidence in using them.

                        publishing preferences regarding scholarly work. Publishing in their native
                        language is the priority for Lithuanian researchers as it is done by the
                        majority (79,5%) of them. English is the most preferred second language for
                        publishing research work as 19% of scholars stated they primarily publish in
                        English. Only 1% primarily publish in some other language (see <a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a>). The major preference for publishing
                        in national language and relatively low proportions of other languages used
                        in scholarly publishing suggest that international cooperation and
                        collaboration between researchers in digital humanities is inadequate.

                     <div class="ptext" id="p60"> Collaboration is one of the most important aspects relevant to the current
                        state of digital humanities. It is known that traditional humanities still
                        obtains an image of the “lone scholar”, while digital
                        humanities are becoming more collaborative [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2009">Borgman 2009</a>].
                        Collaboration is an effective way to produce new knowledge and could be
                        easily and effectively done in a digital environment. Some of the Lithuanian
                        scholars mentioned collaborative learning as part of their scholarly
                        activities (see <a href="#table05">Table 5</a> above). Respondents
                        were also asked to state how often they collaborate with others on research
                        projects. It seems that collaboration is quite common research practice
                        among Lithuanian scholars as 24,1% do it very often and 46,6% often
                        collaborate with others (see <a href="#figure22">Figure 22</a>). 24,8%
                        of respondents stated that they collaborate seldom and only 4,5% said they
                        never collaborate with others on a research project. The results of the
                        survey appear to contradict the conclusion presented in the “Report of the Lithuanian science state” showing a
                        very low level of collaboration in the humanities research [<a class="ref" href="#bumelis2014">Bumelis et al. 2014</a>]. However, as noted by the report authors
                        themselves, the estimations were made according to the index of co-authored
                        publications, which deals with an objective and easily measured data, but it
                        does not take into account other means of collaboration. An existing example
                        like this suggests that in some cases the impact of humanities research
                        might be nationally underestimated as present strategies on evaluating
                        scholarly research might be questionable.

                        particular practices revealed few important disparities that deserve closer
                        attention. One of the aspects that separates the national field of digital
                        humanities from the European dimension is the use of social media for
                        research purposes. It concerns not only dissemination or scholarly
                        communication, but also involves the discovery and collection of research
                        assets. Only 12,70% of Lithuanian digital humanists very often or often seek
                        information via social media, while almost twice as many (22,70%) scholars
                        in Europe use it for the same purpose (see <a href="#figure25">Figure

                     statements regarding their research needs on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is
                     the least important and 10 is the most important. The survey revealed that all
                     available statements of needs are relevant to Lithuanian digital humanists.
                     Nevertheless, improved findability or access to existing digital research
                     resources, having an average score of 9,2, seems to be the most important
                     requirement for the majority of scholars (see <a href="#figure27">Figure
                        27</a>). Additionally, respondents also noted that digitization of
                     research resources (av. sc. 8,6) and improved access to digital tools and
                     software (av. sc. 8,3) are important issues for them as well (see <a href="#figure27">Figure 27</a>). It seems that the digitization of
                     research data still remains one of the most essential requirements since 2003,
                     seeing that the absolute majority of archaeologists (93,3%) at that time
                     indicated the necessity to digitize research material [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2006">Laužikas 2006</a>]. The period of 2005–2009 is considered to be a
                     turning point in national cultural policy with an approval of strategic
                     documents in the area of digitization, which consolidated memory institutions
                     and fostered collaboration in national cultural heritage digitization activities
                     [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2014">Laužikas and Varnienė 2014</a>]. In spite of the fact that there has been a
                     significant increase in quantitative digitization of cultural heritage resources
                     over the last decade, the digitization of data still remains an important matter
                     for researchers. One of the reasons leading to inefficient outcomes of digital
                     projects is the prevalence of conservative strategic management resulting in
                     poor quality digitization products, which do not satisfy users’ needs [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2014">Laužikas and Varnienė 2014</a>]. Moreover, as noted in the national case study of
                     2011 on digitization of cultural heritage and scientific data [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2012">Laužikas 2012</a>], existing research infrastructures had accumulated
                     digital and digitized content with great social and cultural significance, but
                     they still require more efficient access. This could be achieved by aggregating
                     them in a single infrastructure and by developing a more consistent national
                     strategy for existing digital scholarly data [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2012">Laužikas 2012</a>].
                     Finally, it is also important to note that digitization is a continuing activity
                     evolving along with digital tools and software, which require ongoing
                     development. Therefore these requirements must always be properly considered in
                     future projects and national digitization activities.

                     Networking or collaboration is one of the most important aspects of digital

                  <div class="ptext" id="p69"> The least important needs stated by digital researchers include courses or
                     workshops on digital humanities (av. sc. 6,6) and online support from a
                     professional assistant (e.g. archivist, librarian, curator, etc.) to find online
                     material (av. sc. 6,4) (see <a href="#figure27">Figure 27</a>). The latter
                     indication confirms that Lithuanian scholars highly depend on their personal
                     skills to navigate the complexities of digital humanities research and do not
                     consider help “from outside” to be crucially important. One
                     of the reasons relates to the evolution of national digital research, which at
                     least in the field of digital archaeology was fostered by personal research
                     interests bringing up self-taught digital humanists [<a class="ref" href="#lau%C5%BEikas2006">Laužikas 2006</a>]. However, the qualitative development in the national digital humanities
                     greatly relies on professional competence-based training, which is pointed out
                     to be one of the priorities for the national digitization strategy in 2014–2020

                     between national and European digital humanities communities both underlying the
                     importance of improving the access to existing digital research resources, which
                     is the key concern altogether. Other important needs for both national and
                     international communities include the continuity of digitizing current
                     non-digital resources, ensuring better access to digital tools or software and
                     fostering networking among scholars and research institutions in the field of
                     digital humanities. Minor deviations between national and European level
                     researchers could be traced when other needs (e.g. online information, technical
                     or professional support, digital humanities courses and workshops) are
                     considered. In comparison, they are valued with a lower score by European
                     researchers and more appreciated by national scholars. It suggests that
                     Lithuanian digital humanists, who in many cases are self-taught and driven by
                     personal motivation, place more value on the opportunity of getting professional
                     training, as well as receiving technical support and competent assistance.

                     the Lithuanian digital humanities community is in many ways similar to one
                     established in Europe as they both show great similarities in research community
                     composition, as well as in patterns of using digital methods and tools during
                     the research process. There was no indication of any distinctive national
                     phenomena that would significantly contradict the usual European research
                     practice suggesting that in many ways Lithuanian digital humanities should be
                     seen as an integral part of a global practice enabled by digital technologies
                     that crosses disciplinary and geographical borders.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p72"> As seen from the national response sample, which composes 12,4% of all
                     Lithuanian scholars in the humanities, digital humanists vary in their abilities
                     to effectively apply digital methods and tools in scholarly work, and most
                     probably to understand particular aspects of digital research itself. Whereas
                     the majority of the community (58,4%) are considered to be advanced digital
                     humanists, who indicated using digital methods and tools on a regular basis, a
                     substantial proportion of scholars (30,7%) should be perceived as
                     digitally-enabled humanists, who tend to declare interest in digital methods and
                     tools instead of constant usage. Furthermore, despite the fact that nowadays
                     it’s hard to imagine research work being done without the help of a computer or
                     the Internet, 10,9% of Lithuanian scholars expressed a reluctant attitude
                     towards the use of digital technologies when the option of stating “I neither
                     use, nor I am interested in using digital methods or tools” was left
                     open. While the reluctant approach may indicate main drawbacks associated with
                     digital technologies, it also may represent weak understanding and perception of
                     digital methods and tools, as well as of digital humanities. The latter group of
                     scholars represents a notable proportion of digitally-aware humanists, who admit
                     lacking knowledge about digital research and/or does not consider themselves to
                     be part of the digital humanities community, but judging by their responses to
                     other questions these researchers actually use digital methods and tools in
                     their work, though to a lesser extent. The issue of perceiving one’s identity as
                     a digital humanist is part of broader discussion focusing on existing
                     complexities related to the definition of digital humanities, which brings down
                     the typology and broadly conceived landscape of digital scholarship [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2010">Svensson 2010</a>]. However, these dimensions were out of the scope of
                     the DARIAH survey and remains an important task for further qualitative research
                     within the DiMPO working group.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p73"> The use of digital media in scholarly research is widespread in national, as
                     well as European research communities. While a desktop or laptop PC is the
                     primary mean to consult all types of research material, mobile devices show a
                     high potential to become an alternative medium in the future, especially for
                     visual and interactive research data (e.g. video, images, maps, audio). On the
                     other hand, non-digital material and analogue devices still play and important
                     role in scholarly research as it is a common practice to use digital devices in
                     parallel with non-digital, especially in case of viewing books and archival
                     records. Generally, this tendency is relatively more explicit among European
                     digital humanists, whereas Lithuanian scholars reported being far less likely to
                     use non-digital devices, which means that there is a significant amount of
                     digitized or born-digital research data available to the national research
                     community.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p74"> Digital methods and tools are used by scholars throughout the whole research
                     cycle that starts with research data collection and ends with research results
                     dissemination. However, it seems that digital methods and tools serve better in
                     particular research cycle stages, which concern discovery, organization,
                     analysis and dissemination of research data. Accordingly, a great deal of tools
                     specifically named by researchers support the latter activities, which not only
                     reveals the most common competencies and skills developed by European digital
                     humanists, but also showcase a current situation of tools available on the
                     digital research market. The main drawback in this case is digital annotation,
                     enrichment and curation tools that serve the intermediate stage of the research
                     cycle, which opens a discussion on the potential of developing more efficient
                     tools enhancing the practice. In fact, as noted by the study on scholarly
                     annotation “established Humanities Computing
                     (HC) areas of interest, do not seem always to connect with the actual
                     process of the research work being carried out by most humanists”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p75"> It is important to note that the main difference between the European and
                     national scholarly communities occur in the last stage of the research cycle,
                     which concerns publishing, dissemination and communication of research results.
                     National digital humanists are less keen on using digital methods and tools, and
                     are still accustomed to long-established research dissemination practices.
                     Moreover, the use of social media for research purposes seems to be particularly
                     underestimated by Lithuanian scholars. Social media as an innovative
                     communication and dissemination tool has been increasingly employed by
                     individuals and business companies over the last decade, and the overall use of
                     social media by Lithuanian enterprises takes a median position among the
                     European Union countries [<a class="ref" href="#sms2016">"Social media – statistics" 2016</a>]. A national study of scholarly
                     communication facing these concerns could provide insights on the issue of
                     innovative communication and help to ensure better preservation, quality and
                     outreach of Lithuanian digital humanities research results in the future.
