                  <p>This article outlines an innovative photographic technique
                     used to digitize the Malcolm Francis McGregor Epigraphic
                     Squeeze collection held by the Department of Classical, Near
                     Eastern and Religious Studies at the University of British
                     Columbia (UBC) in collaboration with a branch of the UBC
                     library system called Digital Initiatives. The squeezes are
                     photographed using a TTI Repro-Graphic Workstation 4060,
                     Sinar 86H cameraback and digital CMV lenses using
                     CaptureShop image processing software. The images undergo
                     further processing using Photoshop CS6 and the HDR merge and
                     Photomerge tools. The result creates a stunningly clear
                     image which fully captures the details of the squeeze and
                     specifically its three-dimensional quality.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">As the field of Digital Humanities grows and the interest in
                     digital resources for teaching and research increases,
                     scholars are finding new and innovative ways to make
                     traditionally inaccessible or restricted material available
                     to a wider audience. Due to the fragile nature of some
                     teaching and research collections, especially those
                     comprising material from the Greek and Roman worlds,
                     curators are constantly presented with the challenge of
                     finding photographic techniques which safely and effectively
                     replicate the objects in digital format. Many such projects
                     include the University of Florida’s Digital Epigraphy and
                     Archaeology project, the Smithsonian’s digitization of the
                     Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery
                     Archives and Cornell University Library’s Photographs of
                     Stones – Mysteries at Eleusis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e203">[1]</a> The
                     Department of Classical, Near Eastern and Religious Studies
                     (CNERS) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) has
                     recently digitized such a collection, one which contains
                     over 1000 squeezes of inscriptions from ancient Greece
                     dating from the 5<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century to
                     the 2<span class="hi superscript">nd</span> century BCE.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p2"> While a squeeze in general refers to a molding, cast,
                     impression, or copy of an object or design made by pressing
                     a pliable substance around or over it, an epigraphic squeeze
                     in particular is the impression of an inscription on stone.
                     This specific variety of squeeze utilizes filter paper, a
                     porous paper for filtering liquids most often employed in
                     the field of chemistry. The process of creating a squeeze is
                     quite simple: first, the filter paper is dampened and placed
                     atop the inscription. Next, a horsehair brush is used to hit
                     the paper so that the paper is pressed into the grooves of
                     the stone. Finally, once the paper has dried, it is
                     carefully peeled off and a mirror copy of the inscription is
                     revealed. [<a class="ref" href="#woodhead1981">Woodhead 1981</a>, 78–80]

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3"> The final product is known as an epigraphic squeeze and is
                     an invaluable tool for research in the field of Greek and
                     Latin epigraphy – when encountered in the field,
                     inscriptions are most commonly located on immovable stones,
                     either due to their substantial size or their secondary use
                     as <em class="emph">spolia</em> (the intentional inclusion of ancient
                     artifacts and building materials in later structures). For
                     example, if an inscription is on a stone which is built into
                     a church, a private residence, a wall, etc., or if the stone
                     itself weighs several hundred pounds, the only way to study
                     said inscription is on-site. Photographs of the stone,
                     depending on the lighting, can obscure letters or
                     misrepresent the incongruities of the stone. A squeeze,
                     however, offers an affordable and practical solution to this
                     problem: epigraphic squeezes allow scholars to virtually
                     transport the stone to research institutions worldwide.
                     Unlike photographs, a squeeze provides three-dimensional
                     information and is an exact replica of the original
                     inscription. This squeeze can then be photographed, scanned,
                     digitized, and manipulated in a variety of ways. A
                     well-curated squeeze collection can allow for detailed and
                     comparative study of a range of inscriptions, quickly and
                     systematically.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4"> Although the advantages of using squeezes for research far
                     outweigh the disadvantages, there are some issues associated
                     with their use. First, squeezes are difficult to store and
                     to maintain long-term. While the modified filter paper does
                     provide a mirror copy of the inscription, the paper itself
                     is thin, fragile and prone to disintegration, tearing, water
                     damage, and mold. Second, the squeezes themselves must be
                     stored flat and separated into small piles of only a few
                     squeezes so that the weight of the topmost squeezes does not
                     flatten the letters on those below. For this reason they are
                     commonly stored in thin drawers in customized cabinets made
                     expressly for this purpose. Third, because the direct
                     impression of the inscription is found on the underside of
                     the squeeze, epigraphic squeezes are often read backwards
                     since the letter forms are more legible on this side. The
                     reader must then read the squeeze from right to left, using
                     a magnifying glass to see all of the details necessary for a
                     thorough analysis of the inscription. Finally, the curators
                     of epigraphic collections of many museums – including one of
                     the only epigraphic museums in the world, the Athens
                     Epigraphical Museum – have issued a ban on the creation of
                     additional squeezes for fear of further damaging the stone
                     inscription The implication of this ban is that
                     already-established squeeze collections are likely to be the
                     only such collections that will ever exist. This fact
                     renders the existing collections all the more precious, and
                     the various digitization projects even more significant. The
                     fragility of squeeze collections highlights the importance
                     of creating digital records of these important historical
                     documents which preserve the detail and three-dimensional
                     nature of the squeeze and the information contained within
                     it.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p6"> The McGregor squeeze collection was donated by Dr. Malcolm
                     McGregor, renowned scholar of Athenian history and Greek
                     epigraphy and a former professor in the Department of
                     Classics (before it was merged with Near Eastern and
                     Religious Studies) at UBC. His collection largely comprises
                     inscriptions from Attica from the 5<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century BCE, some inscriptions from Nemea
                     (approximately 100 km south-west of Athens) from the same
                     period, and several decrees dating to the 2<span class="hi superscript">nd</span> century BCE. This collection
                     contains 1051 squeezes and, although this number includes
                     several duplicate copies of select inscriptions, access to
                     this large amount of material allows for the possibility of
                     studying inscriptions from these geographic areas and
                     periods in one place. The most notable squeezes in the
                     collection are the squeezes of the Athenian Tribute Lists
                     (ATLs), which were the main focus of McGregor’s research for
                     many years and the subject of his formative work: together
                     with H.T. Wade-Gery and B.D. Merritt, McGregor authored the
                     definitive volumes on a reconstruction of these lists which
                     include both texts and translations of the documents
                     (Meritt, Wade-Gery, McGregor 1939-1953). The McGregor
                     squeeze collection at UBC is a result of the research and
                     study carried out for these volumes. The original
                     inscriptions are held in the Athens Epigraphical Museum and
                     are difficult for scholars to study firsthand, as their
                     monumental height (3.5 m at their tallest) reduces
                     visibility.

                     dedications to Athena which once stood on the Acropolis of
                     Athens. These inscribed records list the annual
                     <em class="emph">aparchai</em> ("first-fruits") dedicated to
                     the goddess Athena by members of the Delian League, a group

                     <em class="emph">aparchai</em> represent one-sixtieth of the
                     overall tribute paid to the treasury to be used for this
                     purpose [<a class="ref" href="#jim2014">Jim 2014</a>, 204–205]. The lists of
                     dedications began to be inscribed in 454 BCE, when the
                     league’s treasury was moved from Delos to Athens, and the
                     contents of the lists are often used as a way to study the
                     development of the so-called Athenian Empire. Because the
                     annual <em class="emph">aparchai</em> by each member of the Delian
                     League was re-assessed every four years, the lists trace the
                     progression and comparative tribute exacted from these
                     communities as well as the wealth that was placed under the
                     control of Athens. They also provide details on revolts by
                     particular members from the league, as the offerings from
                     these respective members would often disappear from the list
                     for a few years. Overall, the ATLs are an important resource
                     for understanding the economic and political climate of the

                  <div class="ptext" id="p9"> The greatest challenge in creating superior digital images
                     of epigraphic squeezes is the three-dimensional nature of
                     the squeeze as an object. The letter forms of most squeezes
                     are only slightly indented, due to the shallow carving on
                     the stones themselves and, as mentioned above, scholars
                     working with the squeezes themselves generally find them
                     easier to read by reading the underside so that the letters
                     are raised – the implication of this methodology is that the
                     words are read backwards, from right to left. A simple
                     photograph of the squeeze produces a flat and often
                     illegible image that does not allow for a detailed study of
                     the letter forms, eliminating potential reconstructions of
                     fragmentary inscriptions. Alternatively, flatbed scanning
                     runs the risk of flattening the raised letters, forever
                     altering the quality of the original squeeze. One research
                     group attempting to digitize squeezes has pioneered the use
                     of surface reconstruction to create a three-dimensional
                     image from a two-dimensional photograph of the epigraphic
                     squeeze [<a class="ref" href="#barmpoutis2010">Barmpoutis, Bozia, Wagman 2010</a>]. Although this
                     procedure is affordable as it requires only a flatbed
                     scanner and a particular computer algorithm, it relies on
                     shape reconstruction of particular letter forms. This
                     presents a problem for squeezes that are damaged or have
                     fractures or incomplete letter forms. Other
                     inscription-digitization projects have relied on laser
                     scanners [<a class="ref" href="#landon2006">Landon and Seales 2006</a>] and Reflectance
                     Transformation Imaging Systems [<a class="ref" href="#earl2011">Earl et al. 2011</a>]
                     which can highlight letters and other details on the stone
                     that have worn away through time or have been obscured
                     through reuse of the stone for another purpose. These
                     technologies provide detailed surface maps of the artifact
                     in a three-dimensional model but are potentially prohibitive
                     to a larger audience due to the need of specialized hardware
                     and/or software to view and study the images.

                     automated HDR merge function is used to create a single
                     image with all of the dynamic range of the three different
                     exposures. RAW files are used in this case because they
                     retain the maximum amount of information from the captured
                     images; compressing the image to TIF or JPG format results
                     in both a loss of detail and images incompatible with the
                     HDR merge tool. In the case of the larger squeezes,
                     Photoshop’s Photomerge tool was used to fully capture the
                     original squeeze. Even though the vacuum table of the TTI
                     measures 4x6 feet, the total area captured by the camera is
                     much smaller even when the camera is raised to its highest
                     level on the support arm. In these situations, a series of
                     pictures are taken, ensuring that there is at least a 30%
                     overlap of pixels within each image. Photoshop can then use
                     this overlap to seamlessly stitch the images together using
                     the Photomerge tool. It is more time-effective to take four
                     photos with considerable overlap than to attempt this
                     maneuver with only three photos – this often leads to
                     insufficient pixel correlation to create a collage and one
                     must then start over. The photographic and post-processing
                     techniques described above create an image with the texture

                     text, not the edge of the filter paper, is horizontal to the
                     reader. While epigraphists are accustomed to reading

                     collection, including the Athenian Tribute Lists, and select
                     inscriptions we use most frequently for undergraduate
                     instruction. The stones of the ATL’s Lapis Primus have been
                     reconstructed into the 3.5 meter-high replica of the
                     original stele. While this allows the museum to showcase the
                     inscriptions' monumental scale, this type of display makes
                     photography of the stones decidedly difficult. Despite this,
                     we were able to acquire the necessary images of the original
                     stone inscriptions which will be added to our website for
                     additional context for the squeezes. The addition of the
                     photographs from the Epigraphical Museum will facilitate the
                     use of the database as a comprehensive research and teaching
                     tool for epigraphers, scholars, and students alike, since
                     photos of many of these stones are not readily available
                     elsewhere. By displaying the photograph and squeeze
                     side-by-side on the website, interested parties (students,
                     scholars, and the general public) can compare the quality of
                     the words on the stone versus the squeeze for themselves and
                     explore all resources available.

                     Digital Initiatives is prohibitively expensive, we strongly
                     believe that the quality of our images and a similar
                     workflow could be achieved at a lower cost to anyone
                     interested in replicating our imaging process. The camera
                     model and light array are available at different price
                     points and in different sizes. The vacuum table is not
                     essential and can be replaced with any flat surface. The
                     most important aspects for reproducing our photographic
                     technique are a camera stand to mount the camera over the
                     squeeze; remote shutter capabilities to ensure that there is
                     no shadow cast on the squeeze; and a bright, neutral light
                     array installed on one side of the camera, placed at a 45
                     degree angle. While CaptureShop software automates the
                     process of taking three different exposures of the squeeze,
                     the same process could easily be done manually. In fact, DI
                     upgraded from CaptureShop to CaptureFlow in September of
                     2014, and different program features – including the loss of
                     the automatic bracketing feature used to photograph the
                     majority of the squeezes – forced us to find an alternative
                     method. We completed the squeeze photography by taking a
                     single shot with the Sinar 86H camera and created bracketed
                     images with Photoshop by creating two duplicate files and
                     changing the exposure settings. From there, the process is
                     identical to what was described above.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">Photoshop C2 or newer is essential to replicate the overall
                     quality of the images: this was the first version of
                     Photoshop with the HDR-Merge tool. HDR merge will combine
                     the RAW camera files of three different exposures into a
                     single image, while still retaining the highlights and
                     shadows from the over- and under-exposed images. For larger
                     squeezes, the same technique as outlined above can be
                     applied by taking multiple photos and then stitching them
                     together using Photomerge. The process of digitally
                     stitching images together with Photoshop is entirely
                     automated and can be easily mastered by anyone with basic
                     technological proficiency. Using this fundamental
                     methodology, similar projects can replicate our process
                     without the full technological arsenal that this project
                     employs. DI is equipped with Photoshop CS5 and CS6, which
                     have improved upon the early HDR-merge tool so we cannot
                     attest to the usability or quality of merged images with
                     earlier versions of Photoshop.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20"> Scholars in the field of Greek epigraphy have long been able
                     to make squeezes of inscriptions but sharing them with the
                     broader academic community has been a continuous challenge.
                     The earliest publications of inscriptions – for example the
                     Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum (SEG) and the
                     Inscriptiones Graecae (IG) - focused on providing
                     transcriptions of the text due to financial and practical
                     constraints of including photographs when the field of
                     photography was in its infancy. Thus, scholars had access to
                     the text of the inscriptions but vital contextual and visual
                     information was notably absent. A visual representation of
                     object itself is necessary for a balanced appreciation of
                     the inscription both as a text and as an archaeological
                     artifact [<a class="ref" href="#tupman2010">Tupman 2010</a>]. The Internet has
                     expanded the availability of images to broader audiences but
                     the digitization of epigraphic sources, particularly
                     squeezes, continues to challenge the curators of epigraphic
                     collections. For example, Oxford University’s Centre for the
                     Study of Ancient Documents (CSAD) began an early imaging
                     project in 1997.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e434">[8]</a>
                     Although the challenges faced by their project are the same
                     issues all other such projects face today – namely finding a
                     non-destructive means of digitally rendering the images and
                     providing access for their detailed study – CSAD’s project
                     was also confined to smaller image sizes due to server
                     constraints that are not a problem for more recent servers.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e439">[9]</a> Current digitization
                     projects are not constrained in the same way, due to
                     advances in technological capabilities and online storage
                     facilities – full-size archival standard image files no
                     longer present storage challenges for most users. However,
                     the images from CSAD are nonetheless legible, and, more
                     importantly, they represent the foundation for all other
                     digitization projects that have followed since.

                     of a larger trend in the Digital Humanities scholarship
                     towards the development of innovative methods to fully
                     capture the three-dimensional nature of epigraphic squeezes.
                     The development of these techniques relies heavily on
                     scholarly collaboration and interdisciplinary discussions
                     both within particular university communities (such as our
                     collaboration on this project with Digitial Initiatives) and

                     interested in Epigraphy and Cultural Heritage. Our project
                     participated in the conference and we look forward to being
                     involved in this network and future collaboration with other

                     collection and digitization methods but also to be part of
                     the vibrant and dynamic field of digital epigraphy. To quote
                     Charlotte Tupman, "the key to improving
                     digital publication further appears to lie in the way in
