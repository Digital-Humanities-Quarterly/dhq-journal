                  <p>In this article I propose that motion capture (mocap) and virtual reality (VR) technology
                     can be used to record and visualize movement histories as a supplement to oral histories
                     or for when a memory is based in a embodied experience. One specific example would
                     be the
                     presentation of illness narratives. To illustrate this situation, I examine the concept
                     of
                     illness narratives, particularly those created by dance artists, and use my movement
                     history, <em class="emph">Lithium Hindsight 360</em>, as a case study. This analysis comes from the
                     perspective of a hybrid movement artist, VR creator, archivist and digital humanist,
                     with
                     first-hand experience of the challenges encountered when creating a movement history.
                     The
                     challenges are presented within the context of mocap recording, data curation, digital
                     preservation and sustainability issues. I end this article by providing some basic
                     practical strategies and recommendations for researchers who are new to documenting
                     movement histories.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Human narratives are one of the most compelling and versatile information sources.
                     One
                     specific category, oral histories, "play a unique role in to documenting cultural
                     heritage
                     and in preserving memories of historical and everyday events" [<a class="ref" href="#tebeau2013">Tebeau 2013</a>].
                     These verbal narratives have traditionally been recorded in audio, video and as written
                     transcriptions. Based on the importance of how an oral history is performed [<a class="ref" href="#abrams2010">Abrams 2010</a>] and of how much information physical gestures and facial
                     expressions can convey [<a class="ref" href="#ritchie2003">Ritchie 2003</a>], a question arises about whether the
                     media formats listed above sufficiently capture all the nuances of non-verbal information.
                     By extension, there is also a question of whether all memories can be verbalized and
                     if
                     other means of expression are better suited for communicating the content of those
                     memories.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p2">The issue of performance and non-verbal information within an oral history poses a
                     complex translation problem. Video recordings or "videohistory" helps capture physical
                     movement and nuances that audio recordings and transcripts cannot [<a class="ref" href="#williams2011">Williams 2011</a>]. Furthermore, certain kinds of cultural experiences cannot be
                     fully described using only words. A concrete example of this are descriptions of symbolic
                     poses and gestures used for complicated rituals. Similarly, physical interactions
                     between
                     individuals and their reactions to situations also lose their nuance when described
                     verbally or through controlled cinematography. From an ethical standpoint, voice and
                     photographic images can be potentially compromising even if censored or modified.
                     This may
                     be important if a memory includes some form of physical trauma, distress or injury.
                     Based
                     on the notion that an oral history is the verbal recounting of an experience, then
                     it
                     could be posited that a movement history is a kinesthetic rendering of lived human
                     experiences where identifying voice and visuals could be obscured if needed.

                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p3">With these factors in mind, I propose that the concept of a "movement history" be
                     considered for memories that are based in physical embodied experiences which can
                     be
                     difficult to describe with only words or depict using photographs and video. This
                     definition reflects Albert Lichtblau's statement that "physically active remembering
                     also
                     influences the narration, especially when psychology and mentality can be brought
                     into
                     contact with the past [<a class="ref" href="#lichtblau2011">Lichtblau 2011</a>]. Additionally, I recommend that
                     movement histories be captured and presented in a way which enables a viewer to see
                     all
                     angles and details of the movement rather than be restricted to a single angle or
                     framing.
                     It is currently easiest to achieve this effect by combining mocap and VR technology
                     with
                     the understanding that other technologies may be used in the future.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">I begin my exploration of this concept by reviewing how the evolution of oral history
                     practices can lead to the creation of movement histories. For this article, I will
                     focus
                     on illness narratives expressed through somatic movement practices with my own movement
                     history, <em class="emph">Lithium Hindsight 360</em> as a case study. Following that I offer some
                     practical insights from my own experience as a motion capture (mocap) and virtual
                     reality
                     (VR) researcher to offer practical tips and relatively affordable technology solutions.
                     One key issue will be the dissemination and accessibility of the mocap data as there
                     is
                     still a usability barrier in the form of technological devices. Additional resources
                     tailored to content creators helping to maintain the movement dataset and accompanying
                     visualization interfaces are also suggested.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p5">The roots of this article started in my previous research on digital dance preservation.
                     As a choreographer and digital archivist, I was intent on finding a practical way
                     to
                     preserve human movement as accurately as possible. At first I believed very strongly
                     in
                     all the existing preservation practices, whether it was collecting good metadata,
                     using
                     high quality video for documentation or ensuring that a repository followed the Open
                     Archival Information System [OAIS] model. These practices worked well in the archives
                     and
                     libraries where I worked, but were not so feasible as an independent artist working
                     alone.
                     From an archivist's perspective it meant processing haphazardly maintained content.
                     From a
                     choreographer's perspective, it was frustrating to be unable to see and analyze all
                     the
                     nuances of how a dance work was performed.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">By luck, dance scholar Jeffrey Friedman happened to be teaching an oral history workshop
                     in Boston around this time. Hearing him talk about dance-specific examples was very
                     useful
                     as I prepared to conduct my own interviews. Very quickly, however, I encountered the
                     same
                     problem that had plagued me for documenting dance: how does one verbally describe
                     movements that defy words?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">This problem eventually formed the basis for my practice-based research on creating
                     movement-based pathographies. My original motivation for using mocap and VR was to
                     give
                     patients and viewers alike a sense of privacy. After constructing my initial prototype,
                     however, I realized another benefit. By using mocap data to create an animation viewable
                     in VR, viewers could have complete freedom to examine the movement from any angle
                     or
                     distance. In some ways this meant a more unbiased form of moving image documentation
                     in
                     that the framing of the content had not been decided for the viewer.

                     with oral history which I address later in this article. The most obvious commonality
                     is
                     the autobiographical narrative based on an individual's memory. This common trait
                     thus
                     made me start to wonder about the possibility of movement-based equivalent to oral
                     history
                     – that is, a movement history.

                     recollection of and/or commentary on significant events, although they may also be
                     centered on daily life or more private events. The fact that these memories are not

                     precise [<a class="ref" href="#matusiak2017">Matusiak et al. 2017</a>] can be seen as problematic or beneficial in that it
                     can affect the accuracy and presentation of content. To avoid frustration, interviewers
                     are encouraged to think of oral history as a shared responsibility with those whom
                     they
                     are interviewing [<a class="ref" href="#ritchie2003">Ritchie 2003</a>]. To that end, the extent to which an oral
                     historian must gain the trust of their subjects is no small matter. When this trust
                     is
                     well-placed, a potential platform for communicating information through narratives
                     is
                     created. This platform can be useful for bringing awareness to marginalized communities

                     dance
                     for performance strategies that can help add nuance. The connection between dance
                     and oral
                     histories is that dances are a part of oral tradition that can be intangible and ephemeral
                     in such a way that challenges the act of documentation itself [<a class="ref" href="#whatley2017a">Whatley 2017a</a>]. Furthermore, "Dance also challenges other experts to think about devising imaginative
                     methods or scoring, notating, annotating, and archiving a processual, somatic, and
                     multisensory practice" [<a class="ref" href="#whatley2017a">Whatley 2017a</a>]. Since a movement history is still
                     based on a personal memory, it would be logical to look at how somatic dance forms
                     that
                     embrace the unique attributes of an individual body for strategies on how to recall,
                     express and perform embodied experiences in a physical manner.

                     of
                     their bodies and their relationship to other bodies in a way that generates a sort
                     of
                     autobiography. These movement practices can also be used to literally illustrate life
                     events which leads to a form of double-layered autobiography. Improvisational methods
                     may
                     incorporate internal and/or external questioning which then becomes reminiscent of
                     an oral
                     history interview. The range of somatic movement practices range from the Asian
                     disciplines of yoga and tai chi to more recent systems such as Feldenkrais and Body
                     Mind

                     for artistic expression: Authentic Movement, Contact Improvisation and Skinner Releasing
                     Technique amongst others. Steve Paxton, founder of Contact Improvisation, was known
                     for
                     his Small Dance ritual which guides the individual to examine their own body. This
                     self-examination was later part of Paxton's documentation about his process which
                     essentially served a sort of autobiography of his body [<a class="ref" href="#corin2017">Corin 2017</a>].

                     based on both his own life events and his body's mechanics. Jones helped pioneer the
                     combining of somatic movement practices with motion capture technology. The particular
                     nature of Jones' works yielded what could be considered a type of movement history.

                     technology in particular can be integrated across all aspects of the process, whether
                     it
                     is in recording, archiving or disseminating content [<a class="ref" href="#boyd2011">Boyd 2011</a>]. It is
                     therefore reasonable to assume that oral history can evolve to the next level of
                     incorporating virtuality. This is already present in projects such as the previously
                     mentioned Dimensions in Testimony exhibition. Virtuality can be used for various purposes
                     whether it is to increase access, create a sense of immersion, generate a sense of
                     embodiment or any other number of reasons. For movement histories, the goal is to
                     allow
                     viewers to examine physical memories without being invasive to the source. To that
                     end,
                     mocap and VR can help create a safer way to view and interact with such content.

                     motion analysis to mainstream entertainment. Conceptually mocap has its roots in Eadweard
                     Muybridge's animation experiments and Max Fleischer's rotoscope device [<a class="ref" href="#boucher2011">Boucher 2011</a>]. Technologically, the systems used at the time of writing
                     descend from motion tracking systems developed in the 1970s and 1980s. One such example
                     are the point light displays developed by Gunnar Johansson [<a class="ref" href="#jensenius2013">Jensenius 2013</a>].
                     Since then a variety of systems have been released such as sensor-based systems that

                     on accelerometers and camera-based optical systems using infrared markers. The latter

                     of system allows for reliable tracking and orientation of joints [<a class="ref" href="#jensenius2013">Jensenius 2013</a>] and accurate capture that enables a variety of data

                     (degrees
                     of freedom) interactive context. The term "6DOF" refers to the three directions in

                     the head can move (3DOF) combined with the three directions in which the body can

                     through space [<a class="ref" href="#cisneros2019b">Cisneros et al. 2019b</a>] An added benefit of VR is that it is fully
                     immersive and therefore visual distractions can be eliminated. Untethered headsets
                     such as
                     the <em class="emph">Oculus Quest</em> provide additional freedom in movement. This adds to a sense
                     of immersion which can be a useful element for supporting a narrative. Previous concerns
                     about motion sickness and ergonomic issues [<a class="ref" href="#cobb1999">Cobb 1999</a>] are being addressed
                     through improved headset design, increased graphics computing power and a generally
                     better
                     understanding of VR design principles. Researchers such as Michael Madary and Thomas
                     K.
                     Metzinger have released recommendations for more ethical design [<a class="ref" href="#madary2016">Madary and Metzinger 2016</a>] and constant updates in software platforms and standards also contribute to an improved
                     experience. Another benefit of using an immersive environment is the ability with
                     which it
                     is possible to blend both visual and aural media with sound playing as vital a role
                     to
                     immersion as visuals. This balance between types of media may help address Mark Tebeau's

                     A
                     specific type of memory rooted in phenomenology is the illness narrative. The purpose
                     of
                     an illness narrative is to share a patient's perspective on experiencing symptoms,
                     treatment, stigma and other aspects of an illness [<a class="ref" href="#frank1995">Frank 1995</a>]. This
                     perspective may agree or contrast with a medical professional's. Like oral histories,
                     illness narratives can focus on specific incidents, lifelong stories or become part
                     of a
                     collection of multiple narratives. More importantly, certain types of patients such
                     as the
                     chronically ill can be categorized as part of a marginalized and/or silenced group
                     who are
                     able to regain their voice through sharing their stories [<a class="ref" href="#hawkins1999">Hawkins 1999</a>].
                     Abrams states that "Oral history was intended to give a voice to the voiceless, a
                     narrative to the story-less and power to the marginalized" [<a class="ref" href="#abrams2010">Abrams 2010</a>].
                     From this perspective, the collective experiences of patients can potentially reflect

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Within the history of medicine, the use of oral history has evolved significantly
                     over
                     time. Oral histories were initially conducted for male figures of influence in medicine
                     before taking on a social history role in the 1970s and a supporting evidence role
                     in the
                     1990s [<a class="ref" href="#winslow2011">Winslow and Smith 2011</a>]. It was the course of this evolution that the question
                     of how to provide a patient's history as opposed to that of a doctor's came into
                     existence. Scholars such as Arthur W. Frank and Arthur Kleinman would start to collect
                     and
                     analyze the narratives of patients while G.Thomas Couser would start to bring the
                     term
                     "pathography" forward into the 20th century.

                     in
                     that it is limited to a written account of physical illness [<a class="ref" href="#hawkins1999">Hawkins 1999</a>].
                     Her approach would later be challenged by performing arts scholars such as Alex Mermikides

                     of such a practice becomes more questionable when the experiences of traditionally

                     external

                  <div class="ptext" id="p30">The concept of phenomenology is the central driver for illness narratives as evidenced
                     by
                     the research of aforementioned medical humanists Frank and Carel as well as S. Kay
                     Toombs
                     and others. Within narrative medicine, phenomenology refers to the experience of having
                     an
                     illness, whether referring to the sensation of symptoms, daily living and/or contextual
                     experiences [<a class="ref" href="#carel2013">Carel 2013</a>]. It therefore makes sense to extend the narrative
                     medicine approach to movement-based illness narratives regardless of documentation
                     method.
                     For my own work <em class="emph">Lithium Hindsight 360,</em> a set of somatic movement-based

                     Both <em class="emph">Lithium Hindsight 360</em> and <em class="emph">[pain]Byte</em> are based on the lived
                     experiences of their respective creators with an emphasis on community engagement.
                     Anonymizing the identities of the mocap performers for ethical purposes was another

                     structure the movement and perform the memory. I chose this approach because I noticed
                     that universally relatable physical gestures and movements being expressed by mental
                     health patients while sharing their experiences in a group setting. Examples might
                     include
                     hand tremors, moving slowly due to exhaustion or agitated rapid gesticulation with
                     the
                     arms. For translating and structuring memories into movement, I adapted the Life Art
                     Process to help me identify key positions and gestures with specific experiences.
                     To do
                     this, I first compiled a list of commonly known adolescent bipolar disorder symptoms,
                     read
                     the individual testimonials in medical reports and then tried to translate what I
                     had
                     read. Based on that experience, I decided that it was more appropriate to use my own
                     bodily experience as a patient with bipolar disorder. This decision lead to the creation
                     of two different scenes, "Symptoms" and "Maintenance".
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div>
                  <div class="ptext" id="p32">In "Symptoms", individual symptoms are depicted by a group of mannequins that resemble
                     each other. They are anchored by a mannequin attempting to ask for help but unable
                     to
                     articulate its needs. Presenting the physical movements without an explanation of
                     the
                     symptom can make a viewer pause and rethink their previous understanding of what a
                     mental
                     health condition looks or feels like. For "Maintenance" viewers are taken through
                     a
                     standard day of waking up, taking medicine, anxiety over interacting with others,
                     exhaustion from feigning good health and then the return to bed. This scene has a
                     more
                     traditional dance sequence as I used to dance to relieve anxiety and stress. The majority
                     of the movement is more pedestrian to the point of almost looking like pantomime.
                     Since
                     the predominant physical feeling was the sensation of constantly falling apart, the
                     avatar
                     is also constantly shifting and appearing to disintegrate before stabilizing again.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p33">To perform and generate all of the movement, I used various forms of improvisation
                     methods including Contact Improvisation and Authentic Movement to sequence the positions
                     and gestures into a narrative. At this level, I was not thinking about using specific
                     vocabulary from a technique. Instead I was adapting concepts such as initiating movement
                     from an internal point or using a video camera as my "witness" rather than a person.
                     Taking this approach helped me avoid "performing" or overdramatizing my movements.
                     Finally, my own movement style or "voice" is influenced by martial arts forms such
                     as tai
                     chi. This results in movement that is alternatively fluid and percussive.

                     with
                     his choreography. When I realized that this type of heterophenomenology exacerbates

                     raised by Susan Kozel about agency and representation that could lead to silencing

                     patient. If this type of heterophenomenology is done in conjunction with patients
                     then it
                     may be ethically possible and accurate for a third party to portray the experiences

                     project is that it is very expensive or technically difficult to generate. In the
                     earlier
                     days of mocap and VR this would have been accurate given the experimental nature and
                     limited access to technologies. As of 2020, there is a constantly growing range of
                     consumer-level hardware and software tools that are still capable of producing high
                     quality results. The simplification of user interfaces and procedures enables creators
                     and
                     researchers to think more holistically about their approach rather than having to
                     become
                     expert programmers and technicians. In this section I offer tips generated from
                     discussions with some of the experts referenced in this article as well as my own
                     personal
                     experiences with multiple hardware systems and recording scenarios. For further details
                     on
                     tasks such as selecting a mocap system, data clean-up, preservation and getting started
                     with a project, please see the Appendix.

                     Subjects may need to exaggerate their movements slightly to avoid occlusion issues.
                     This
                     too depends on the type of system and the level of subtlety being captured. For example,
                     a
                     motion sensor like the Kinect can capture full-body, facial and finger data with a
                     single

                     allows
                     the subject to become accustomed to the direct or indirect impact of a mocap system
                     on
                     their body. This is similar to the process of an interviewer engaging with their subject

                     her
                     overview of mocap dance, Kim Vincs reminds readers that concepts such as gravity,
                     race,
                     and gender can all be manipulated in post-production [<a class="ref" href="#vincs2015">Vincs 2015</a>]. This
                     manipulation eases the pressure for a "perfect" performance and provides the option
                     of
                     hiding certain physical traits. More technical factors such as pre-acceleration of
                     the
                     body and thinking in terms of motion trails rather than shapes may help with recording
                     cleaner data. Movement artist-researcher Steph Hutchison conscientiously adapted her
                     practice to the requirements of a mocap system to yield better results [<a class="ref" href="#hutchison2013">Hutchison and Vincs 2013</a>]. One practical modification was in thinking of the markers on
                     her body as "partners" to work with rather than struggle with.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p39">At the time of writing, it is generally recommended to conduct shorter takes of a
                     movement history for several technical reasons. The first is that a system can glitch
                     out
                     which would then affect the system calibration and therefore render the rest of the
                     mocap
                     data unusable. This glitching can happen regardless of whether an inertial, optical
                     or
                     other system is used. Another reason is that most human bodies have a limit for how
                     long
                     they can continuously move. A trained body may be able to move continuously for a
                     long
                     time whereas a less active person may be fatigued after several minutes. Finally a
                     long
                     take will lead to a larger file that may be harder for an animation software to process
                     and visualize. The mocap recording process will usually yield several files per session,
                     so a consistent file naming scheme and stable storage system is essential. This may
                     seem
                     like a routine course of action but these steps can easily be forgotten when caught
                     up in
                     the moment or pressed for time. Finally, if a transcription and analysis of the movement
                     is necessary, it may be useful to use systems such as Labanotation and Laban Movement
                     Analysis. Both Labanotation and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) were based on the work
                     of
                     modern dance pioneer Rudolf Laban [<a class="ref" href="#eddy2009">Eddy 2009</a>]. Labanotation is a graphical
                     method of notating movement while LMA is a method for describing the quality and
                     motivation of movement. The two systems can be used together or separately.

                     recording them and to remember that access, storage and preservation are part of this
                     process as well [<a class="ref" href="#sant2017">Sant 2017</a>]. Although this fact may seem normal to any
                     archivist, librarian or other information professional, it is not always obvious to
                     laypersons. A significant difference between movement histories and artistic works
                     using
                     mocap is that a history focuses on authentically presenting what has been practiced
                     or
                     lived whereas artistic works typically strive to create a certain aesthetic or explore
                     the
                     differences between each performance of said work. Therefore the need to preserve
                     multiple
                     iterations of a history or striving for a technically perfect performance is
                     eliminated.

                     metadata standards would be expected. Implementing such practices, however, also comes
                     with a significant cost [<a class="ref" href="#matusiak2017">Matusiak et al. 2017</a>]. To help relieve the burden on data
                     stewards, it may be useful for movement history creators to reference the strategies
                     of
                     existing artists' toolkits [<a class="ref" href="#skinner2015">Skinner 2015</a>] and habits of new media artists
                     [<a class="ref" href="#post2017">Post 2017</a>]. Furthermore, the previously theoretical concept of networked
                     digital archives [<a class="ref" href="#macdevitt2012">MacDevitt 2012</a>] has already materialized in the form of
                     widespread cloud computing services. The need for large and flexible storage space
                     is
                     better served by these services than traditional servers.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p44">In the past, the recording of mocap and its subsequent visualization was technically
                     complicated and costly. The process of mocap is still not as simple as making an audio
                     recording, but evolutions in digital technology certainly make it easier. Similar
                     things
                     could be said about VR as new tutorials, hardware sets and software solutions continue
                     to
                     be released. For the immediate future, the most frequent use of movement histories
                     might
                     be as a complementary pairing with oral histories. Examples include a voiceover
                     accompanying an illness narrative using mocap or a written account of a traumatic
                     event
                     accompanied by movement illustrating key moments. A future concern for this type of
                     visualization is that of enabling accessibility for the visually impaired [<a class="ref" href="#hughes2015">Hughes 2015</a>]. In the future, haptics might be able to help resolve vision
                     impairment or reliance on text by conveying a different type of a sensory information.

                     initial work conducted at Deakin Motion Lab and the Institute for Intelligent Systems

                  <div class="ptext" id="p45">On a more personal level, I had two major revelations while constructing my own movement
                     history. The first discovery was that the reactions to my LH360 experience often reflected
                     more about a viewer's previous perceptions about mental health and the communities
                     they
                     came from than any truth or understanding about the experience being shown to them.
                     In
                     other words, it was possible to induce reflexivity and intersubjectivity through
                     presenting abstracted movement in an immersive environment. Patients would express
                     relief
                     and motivation that someone else was sharing an experience similar to theirs. Non-patients
                     would question their previous perceptions of mental health patients. As I had never
                     encountered this kind of reaction when similar movement was presented as a live
                     performance, I was extremely surprised by this result. Presenting the VR experience
                     and
                     the publications about it have also brought me into contact with a wide range of artists
                     and researchers working on similar projects.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p46">These kinds of connections and discoveries are why I became an interdisciplinary
                     practice-based researcher in the arts rather than an artist, archivist or other type
                     of
                     humanities researcher. Traditionally, artistic practice is supposed to speak for itself
                     through the artistic work itself and academic research should be presentable through
                     textual publications. Yet there are still forms of human-generated content that are
                     too
                     multi-faceted to be presented using only one kind of media or without contextual
                     information. The <em class="emph">LH360</em> development process relied on methodologies such as
                     autoethnography, reflective practice and user experience design as well as an
                     understanding of various artistic technique. Furthermore, I received comments that
                     viewing
                     the VR experience enhanced an understanding of its associated publications and vice
                     versa.
                     Based on my experience with creating <em class="emph">LH360</em>, I believe that forms of artistic
                     expression can be utilized for purposes other than creating pure works of art or
                     entertainment. The concept of an artistic practice-based researcher has been acknowledged
                     in academic circles since the 1980s [<a class="ref" href="#candy2006">Candy 2006</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#nelson2013">Nelson 2013</a>] which means that there are pioneers to look up to, a current
                     peer community, and most likely an increase in this type of researcher. Regardless
                     of
                     whether one comes from an academic, artistic or hybrid approach, increasing developments
                     in visual, aural, and haptic technologies should make it more feasible to reproduce
                     non-verbal content that addresses all the senses. Over time, these innovations may
                     lead to
                     more multi-dimensional presentations of individual memories, historical events and
                     entire
                     cultures.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p47">The first thing that researchers should consider is their choice of mocap system.
                     Ideally
                     the system should be chosen based on the type of movement recorded, frequently used
                     body
                     part(s), portability and need for anonymity. It may be tempting to choose a system
                     for its
                     cost, convenience or availability but this can later create problems. A comparison
                     of
                     several systems is provided below to illustrate how the attributes of a system could
                     be
                     problematic or simply not useful for a researcher. The information is a combination
                     of
                     general knowledge and my personal experience using the listed system. It is by no
                     means an
                     extensive listing of all systems currently available on the market. For a more detailed
                     look into mocap systems, I recommend reading the white paper released by Epic Games

                  <div class="ptext" id="p48">Another aspect to consider about choosing a hardware system is the software platform
                     that
                     accompanies it as well as the external software platforms that the hardware can interface
                     with. Software can affect how cleanly motion is captured, provide easier ways to clean
                     up
                     and manipulate the data, or even enable faster sharing. In some situations, the hardware
                     may not be the most robust, but the software makes the rest of the process easier.
                     Most
                     systems will come with their own proprietary software or require use of a licensed
                     program. Ultimately the final decision should take into consideration whether one
                     is
                     recording full body large movements or smaller subtle movements, whether identity
                     is an
                     issue, if factual accuracy is required or if emotional expressiveness is the main
                     priority.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p49">Just like with any other data set, mocap data clean-up is extremely time consuming.
                     The
                     clean-up process usually consists of manipulating coordinates using either a linear
                     graph
                     editor or actual points in 3D space. While there are tools to help automate the process
                     it
                     is useful for researchers to review the raw capture and the cleaned-up version to
                     ensure
                     that vital details are not accidentally erased. By contrast, mapping the data to a
                     3D
                     model to generate an animation can be relatively quick so long as the skeleton has
                     been
                     properly mapped.
