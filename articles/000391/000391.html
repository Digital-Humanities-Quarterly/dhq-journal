                  <p> In this essay, I examine the presence and use of laptops in the classroom
                     through the lens of boredom. Now that we can carry around an incredibly powerful
                     little computer in our pockets or bring a lightweight laptop to class, boredom
                     is a feeling that we almost never have to face anymore. We instantly alleviate
                     the slightest hint of impatience or aimlessness with a single glance at our
                     screens. But what introspective capacities do we neglect when we reflexively
                     give ourselves over to the distractions of the outside world? What might
                     dwelling within our boredom open up to students? Using my undergraduate
                     Introduction to Digital Media course as a case study, I argue that a humanistic
                     approach to digital media provides STEM students in particular with a means of
                     contextualizing technical detail within larger sociopolitical systems, and that
                     a focus on individual habits of attention can provide an important hinge between
                     the granular and the global. Next, I reflect on the pressures produced by the
                     very devices we studied on the classroom environment, and frame our experiences
                     within some of the most influential writings on boredom as a historically and
                     technologically conditioned mood. I then conclude with some speculations on
                     planning for boredom within a laptop policy that is capable of accounting for a
                     range of learning styles.

               <div class="ptext" id="p1">It wasn't until I taught an Introduction to Digital Media course that, ironically,
                  I
                  began questioning my policy on laptops in the classroom. Since my first experience
                  as a teaching assistant in graduate school, I've allowed and even embraced them.
                  During the inevitable conversation on laptops among colleagues, I was always the
                  person arguing that students use these machines to write, read, and think for the
                  vast majority of their academic activities. To exclude laptops from the classroom,
                  a
                  space in which students learn <em class="emph">how</em> to write, read, and think, would be
                  disingenuous. Given my training in media theory and digital humanities, terms like
                  “distraction” and “attention” in this context evoked a faintly naive
                  technological determinism, as if the cognitive abilities of our students could be
                  single-handedly warped by machines. Even the most influential quantitative studies
                  —
                  such as “The Laptop and the Lecture”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#hembrooke2003">Hembrooke and Gay 2003</a>] or “The Pen is Mightier than the
                  Keyboard”
                  [<a class="ref" href="#mueller2014">Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014</a>] — left me unconvinced, largely because they assumed an
                  analytic framework absent historical background, medium specificity, and cultural
                  context, in which the presence of “the laptop” in a single Ivy League lecture
                  course is made to speak for all possible learning situations. Historians and
                  theorists of media technologies have provided depth and nuance to figurations like
                  these for decades.

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p2">While I maintain my skepticism of broad generalizations about the laptop as a unitary
                  technology and “the student” as a fixed cognitive quantity, the experience of
                  teaching a course that took digital media as both its object and method of inquiry
                  forced me to rethink my assumptions about the presence of laptops and other screens
                  in class. Much of our energy was devoted to figuring out how we might embrace the
                  laptops glowing before us at the same time as we explored the history, culture, and
                  politics of the information coursing through them. And yet we still experienced the
                  inevitable draining of our attention, the sense that the laptop was becoming
                  something more than simply a handy object lesson for our topic of discussion. Of
                  course, attention, energies, and enthusiasms wax and wane with any semester. As we
                  approach summer, laptops seem to follow an ecliptic plane as they gradually move
                  from the polite position off to one side (as recommended in the syllabus section on
                  screen etiquette) to the rather less polite one directly in front of us. And with
                  them come the glazed-over eyes, the suspiciously busy keystrokes, the stifled grins
                  apropos of nothing that anyone else can see. But where I would normally write off
                  this change as simply part of the academic year's circadian rhythms, something about
                  this course made me think a little differently about it.
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p3">Digital media, our object of study, had gone from being a means of reflexive pedagogy
                  to a noticeable drain on the flow of the course. In previous years, I had wonderful
                  results using laptops for exercises in textual analysis and collaborative
                  annotation, as well as the occasional fact check or live event look-in. The events
                  of this particular semester, however, led me to wonder: at what point does our
                  attention to digital media shift from an attitude of analysis to one of distraction?
                  After all, distraction is a specific form of attention to something. As Paul North
                  writes, “"Distraction is diversion, and
                  diversion is a version of attention"”
                   [<a class="ref" href="#north2012">North 2012</a>]. But distraction is a version of attention that is no longer directed by
                  volition, discipline, or desire. When we are distracted by something, we feel the
                  direction of our conscious minds pulled by something outside of ourselves. In taking
                  digital media as an object and means of study, what then marks the transition from
                  attention guided by disciplinary frameworks and measured contemplation to attention
                  dispersed and unsynchronized, diluted by the sheer depth and variety of interesting
                  things to give our attentions to?
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p4">The natural fear on my part as an educator was that this gradual shift was the
                  product of boredom. I thought back to my previous classes and initial instincts
                  about allowing laptops in the classroom. Of course, I can justify the decision based
                  on my theoretical commitments as a scholar of digital media. But what if I was
                  simply afraid of ever risking the presence of classroom boredom in the first place?
                  What if allowing laptops and their periodic distractions was just a means of taking
                  a measure of pressure off myself, someone who not only has an obligation to keep
                  students fully engaged and present, but also feels often like a performer in front
                  of all those eyes?
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p5">In this essay, I examine boredom from two angles: as a mood currently undergoing
                  uniquely historical transformations, and as a potentially useful pedagogical
                  technique. When someone becomes bored, their natural response is to find an object,
                  idea, or activity to latch on to, a distraction to pass the time. We distract
                  ourselves from the discomfort of boredom. Now that we can carry around an incredibly
                  powerful little computer in our pockets or bring a lightweight laptop to class,
                  boredom is a feeling that we almost never have to face anymore. We instantly
                  alleviate the slightest hint of impatience or aimlessness with a single glance at
                  our screens. Teaching an Introduction to Digital Media left me wondering what would
                  happen if, rather than tolerating or even embracing the distraction that laptops can
                  bring to the classroom, I simply let myself let my students feel bored. Boredom
                  today is like a disease on the verge of eradication that we would be woefully
                  unprepared to deal with were it ever to return. But what introspective capacities
                  do
                  we neglect when we reflexively give ourselves over to the distractions of the
                  outside world? What might dwelling with our boredom open up to students?
               </div>
               
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div>
               <div class="ptext" id="p6">I begin with the example of my digital media course, which attracted majors from
                  across the disciplines, including a majority contingent of computer science
                  students. In order to bridge the many different forms of expertise and associations
                  surrounding digital media that were brought to the table, we drew on a conversation
                  format used at the historic Macy conferences on cybernetics. In their final project,
                  students were encouraged to examine their daily habits as users of digital devices.
                  Drawing on these experiences, I describe how a humanistic approach to digital media
                  provides STEM students in particular with a means of contextualizing technical
                  detail within larger sociopolitical systems, and how a focus on individual habits
                  of
                  attention can provide an important hinge between the granular and the global. Next,
                  I reflect on the pressures produced by the very devices we studied on the classroom
                  environment and frame our experiences within some of the most influential writings
                  on boredom as a historically and technologically conditioned mood. I then conclude
                  with some speculations on planning for boredom within a laptop policy that is

                     theorists in the 1940s, cyberneticians in the 1950s, and the architects of
                     networked computation in the 1960s. But only now have we begun to live out the
                     futures that were dreamed of by these technologists. Today with our digital
                     devices, we experience their dreams as beliefs, daily routines, and

                  <div class="ptext" id="p8">Intro to Digital Media was a class that began by examining the historical roots
                     of information as both a technology and a concept. We then proceeded down a
                     “stack” of topics in digital culture: code, interface,
                     device, infrastructure, and power. Each of these topics was explored through a
                     comparative framework, using hands-on exercises and readings from across the
                     disciplines, including the philosophy of computation, history of technology,
                     cultural studies, literary criticism, science fiction, and media theory.
                     Students were encouraged to think historically (how have media been experienced
                     as “new” at different moments in time?), theoretically (how
                     exactly do we address “medium” as an object of study), and tactically (how
                     can we use our local experience of digital devices as a framework for thinking
                     global networks?). Throughout the semester, in-class exercises linked the theory
                     we encountered in our readings to everyday practice, including a “<a href="https://myshadow.org/detox" onclick="window.open('https://myshadow.org/detox'); return false" class="ref">data detox</a>” designed

                     class: roughly half of the students who registered were computer science majors,
                     with the remainder coming from various humanities programs. This made for an
                     interesting experiment in cross-disciplinary communication at the undergraduate
                     level that, for me, opened up questions about the specific kind of expertise
                     that a humanities education offers. What practices should we model in the
                     context of classes on digital media, especially when many students already enter
                     with a high degree of technical literacy? What values can a humanities education
                     impart for the kinds of careers that STEM students will be entering into? My
                     students had acquired very different forms of expertise over their respective
                     programs of university study. And so making our ideas clear didn't just entail
                     clarifying the individual frameworks we used when thinking about technology, but
                     also our various styles of attention toward technology as an object of study.
                     Our disciplines are, after all, specific forms of attention, as Paul North
                     argues. A discipline is “a <span class="foreign i">Wissenschaft,</span> a methodical, repeated relation to
                     sanctioned objects, an institutionalized attention”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p10">One of our inspirations in speaking from individualized sets of experience and
                     expertise was the conversation format for the famous 1950s Macy Conferences on
                     cybernetics. These conferences featured presentations from engineers,
                     biologists, social scientists and humanists all interested in new theories of
                     communication, the boundaries between human and machine, and the question as to
                     whether the operation of new computers could help us understand the inner
                     workings of the brain. The proceedings read like a who's who of mid-century
                     intellectual history, with Norbert Wiener, Claude Shannon, Gregory Bateson,
                     Margaret Mead, and John Von Neumann all sharing often highly technical research
                     from the cutting edge of their respective disciplines. During each of the
                     two-day conferences, held once or twice a year from 1946-1953, participants were
                     given the opportunity to deliver a formal paper. But if at any time during that
                     presentation there were another participant who didn't understand a particular
                     term or concept, that person would interrupt the speaker and ask for
                     clarification. Either an explanation would be given and the presentation would
                     continue, or a larger conversation would emerge from that point of clarification
                     until it eventually arced back into the main presentation.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p11">This format was incredibly useful to us. Then, as now, the concept of the digital
                     required a great deal of explication, especially among people of such different
                     backgrounds. For example, during the seventh Macy Conference in March 1950, the
                     neuroscientist Ralph Gerard presented on “Some Problems
                     Concerning Digital Notions of the Central Nervous System.” When
                     posing the question of whether the electrical activity between the brain and the
                     nervous system should be understood as analog or digital signals, Gregory
                     Bateson interrupts Gerard and says, “I
                     am a little disoriented by the opposition between analogical and
                     digital,” wondering if all involved could “tidy up our vocabulary.” John Von Neumann, the
                     mathematician and pioneering figure in the history of computing, jumps in to
                     admit, “It is very difficult to give
                     precise definitions . . . although it has been tried repeatedly. Present use
                     of the words ‘analogical’ and ‘digital’ in science is not
                     completely uniform.” J.C.R. Licklider, a psychologist known for his
                     work on the perception of sound, complicates the situation further when he asks
                     what intuitive sense a non-specialist would make of these terms: “To a lay man analogical and digital are
                     not opposites and any very clear sense.” The conversation spins out,
                     until finally Licklider returns to the original subject of Gerard’s
                     presentation, adding, “I am afraid we
                     have disturbed the course of things about this too much. . . . We will use
                     the words as best we can.”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">Not only were these researchers hammering out a scientific consensus on emerging
                     models for the body and on new computing machines, but they also were debating
                     the specific words that should be used to communicate these concepts across
                     academic disciplines and to the public. It's as if they understood that public
                     discourse about these new technologies could determine their eventual future.
                     Then, as now, the distinctions we make between analog and digital, information
                     and data, are not hard and fixed. These aren't entities with necessary and
                     sufficient technical conditions. They are instead a matter of perception, of
                     ontologies, of culture. The refractory manner in which each of my students used
                     these terms in conversation reflects that diversity. But it also required
                     negotiating the various forms of disciplinary attention that each student
                     brought to digital media, whether they were inclined to understand them
                     primarily as aesthetic experiences or political realities, as legal entities or
                     financial propositions. Our terms often slipped out of alignment and that was
                     okay. The challenge was to make sure that all of the different forms of
                     attention these students had been trained in were synchronized rather than
                     working at cross purposes.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">For their final project, students were asked to direct these different forms of
                     disciplinary attention to a single digital device that was particularly resonant
                     in their daily lives. If we find ourselves ceaselessly distracted by the devices
                     we use to read and communicate every day, this project was an experiment in
                     rerouting those distractions through a deep material literacy regarding where
                     our devices come from and how they are made. Students selected a specific
                     digital device and traced the lifecycle of its manufacture, use, re-use, and
                     disposal. Doing so is a very big task. A single smartphone, for instance,
                     contains over two hundred chemical compounds, and the scale of its production is
                     truly global: from rare-earth metal mines in Baotou to data centers in Iowa,
                     from grey markets in Jakarta to electronics scrap yards in Delhi. But even
                     though smartphones allow their users to inhabit countless
                     “social” worlds simultaneously, the material world of the
                     smartphone itself remains invisible to its users.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p14">So, students were presented with many different methods for going about their
                     research, and there were many different pieces of the puzzle they could choose
                     to focus on. It was understood that no two final projects would look alike. The
                     project consisted of two components. First, students produced some form of
                     conceptual model of their artifact, using a map, icons, matrices, or 3D
                     modeling. Some decided to create supply chain maps of their artifact using <a href="http://www.sourcemap.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.sourcemap.com/'); return false" class="ref">Sourcemap</a>, which allows anyone to
                     create a map annotated with text, images, and videos of the locations of a
                     device's material inputs, manufacturing, and shipping. Other students expressed
                     the composition of their artifact using symbol systems like <a href="http://www.gerdarntz.org/isotype" onclick="window.open('http://www.gerdarntz.org/isotype'); return false" class="ref">Isotype</a> (International
                     System Of Typographic Picture Education), created by Otto Neurath and Gerd Arntz
                     in the 1920s and 30s. Isotype — as well as similar symbol systems like the
                     Pictorial Communication Language (<a href="http://picol.org/picol_icon_font" onclick="window.open('http://picol.org/picol_icon_font'); return false" class="ref">PICOL</a>), <a href="https://thenounproject.com/" onclick="window.open('https://thenounproject.com/'); return false" class="ref">The Noun

                        icons</a> — provided a means of schematizing the various components of
                     each device. Students then wrote reflective papers that situated their artifacts
                     within the historical and conceptual frameworks we explored in class.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p15">Some traced a single rare-earth element in order to understand the entirety of
                     their device, like the cobalt used in keyboards or the tantalum used in iPhones.
                     Others took an infrastructural approach, tracing the environmental impact of
                     streaming a single film on Netflix, or of running Wikipedia's data centers. A
                     few conducted comprehensive tear downs of popular gadgets like the Amazon Echo
                     or Fitbit activity trackers. Exploring the material specificities of their
                     devices gave students a means of better understanding what Bruce Sterling calls
                     the “cognitive load” of each
                     device: their capacity for attention and distraction [<a class="ref" href="#sterling2005">Sterling 2005</a>]. Much like scholars of book history who challenge their students to assemble
                     a codex from scratch to better appreciate the technology of the book, my aim was
                     to have students use this much more granular understanding of their devices’
                     construction in everyday practice.

                     being more than just our object of study. Its presence in the classroom put
                     pressure on our attempts to synchronize the different disciplinary frameworks
                     and kinds of attention that students had been familiarized with by their majors.
                     And so I began turning to theorists of older, early-twentieth-century media —
                     cinema and radio — for some of the most influential writing on the relationship
                     between attention, distraction, and boredom. If boredom was the impulse driving
                     us to check our screens, then maybe these writings could help us imagine the
                     ways that boredom might be redirected toward different pedagogical ends.

                     boredom has a history mirroring that of modernity [<a class="ref" href="#goodstein2005">Goodstein 2005</a>]. In the 1920s, Siegfried Kracauer identified boredom and distraction as moods
                     central to understanding an emerging white-collar or
                     “salaried” class in Weimar Germany. As the Berlin
                     correspondent for the <cite class="title italic">Frankfurter Zeitung</cite>
                     feuilleton — Walter Benjamin celebrated Kracauer's appointment to the post by
                     writing, “"It is good for the city to have
                     its enemy within its walls”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2005">Benjamin 2005 [1930]</a>] — Kracauer described offices and spaces of entertainment as complex
                     expressions of this white collar culture. Urban audiences in Weimar Germany
                     flocked to massive cinema palaces designed by modern architects. Unlike earlier
                     forms of programming, in which multiple short films were shown together as part
                     of a single admission, cinema palaces featured one film as the culmination of a
                     revue containing dancers, special effects, and musicians entertaining the
                     audience before the film began. Kracauer described the experience of attending
                     these cinemas as “the total artwork
                     of effects”: 
                     <blockquote>
                        <p>
                           Spotlights shower their beams
                           into the auditorium, sprinkling across festive drapes or rippling
                           through colorful, organic looking glass fixtures. The orchestra asserts
                           itself as an independent power, its acoustic production buttressed by
                           the responsory of the lighting. Every emotion is accorded its own
                           acoustic expression and its color value in the spectrum — a visual and
                           acoustic kaleidoscope that provides the setting for the physical
                           activity on stage: pantomime and ballet. Until finally the white surface
                           descends and the events of the three-dimensional stage blend
                           imperceptibly into two-dimensional illusions.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p18">Where others saw these films as trivial diversions, Kracauer sensed something
                     genuinely new in the diversity of their audience. Unlike the more
                     class-segregated populations of rural towns, four million Berliners meant by
                     sheer necessity that all kinds of people circulated through the same cinemas, “a process that creates the
                     <em class="emph">homogenous cosmopolitan audience</em> in which everyone has
                     the <em class="emph">same</em> responses, from the bank director to the sales

                     these entertainments, Kracauer argued that the rhythm of cinema's distractions
                     corresponded to the intensity of modern industrial labor. One thinks of the
                     famous scene in Chaplin's <cite class="title italic">Modern Times</cite> (1936) in
                     which the Tramp is ingested by the assembly line he finds impossible to keep
                     pace with. The repetitive drudgery of that labor is doubled by the audience's
                     response to its representation in the cinema, where “The stimulations of the senses
                     succeed one another with such rapidity that there is no room left
                     between them for even the slightest contemplation”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#kracauer1995b">Kracauer 1995b [1926]</a>, 326]. The forms of labor to which the audience was submitted outside the
                     cinema found a kind of catharsis in the collective emotional shocks produced by
                     film, like convulsive laughter or screams of surprise. Which meant for Kracauer
                     that distraction had become newly elevated “to the level of culture”

                     it was experienced across class divisions. Distraction allowed individual
                     spectators within the mass audience to perceive themselves as a collective
                     whole. In the cinema, “the audience encounters itself;
                     its own reality is revealed in the fragmented sequence of splendid sense
                     impressions. Were this reality to remain hidden from the viewers, they
                     could neither attack nor change it; its disclosure in distraction is

                      [<a class="ref" href="#kracauer1995b">Kracauer 1995b [1926]</a>, 326]. In its ability to enable new forms of cohesion, solidarity, and
                     self-awareness, distraction thus served for Kracauer as cinema's “aesthetic vocation.”

                     same way as Kracauer described it for the cinema. When we allow ourselves to be
                     distracted by a laptop, do we experience the shared sensation of a mass or a
                     “public” as John Dewey and later Jürgen Habermas
                     described it [<a class="ref" href="#dewey1927">Dewey 1927</a>]
                     [<a class="ref" href="#habermas1991">Habermas 1991 [1962]</a>]? Is there an intentionality behind that desire to
                     become conscious of some community or collective whole outside of ourselves, and
                     can we characterize that drive toward distraction as a desire? In a remarkable
                     book on social media and distraction, Dominic Pettman suggests to the contrary
                     that distraction has become less a means of experiencing the hidden truth of our
                     collective existence and more of a dispersal of any shared focus as we all see
                     completely different things at different moments in our social media feeds.
                     Distraction today “is composed of
                     millions of tiny moments of engineered <em class="emph">attention</em> (or vice
                     versa)” that have the effect of scattering the public focus “so that we <em class="emph">never feel the
                        same way</em> as other potential allies and affinities at the same
                     moment”

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">Boredom, as Kracauer described it in another essay of 1924, has since undergone
                     similar transformations [<a class="ref" href="#kracauer1995a">Kracauer 1995a [1924]</a>]. While distraction was a
                     collective experience of the masses coming to understand their coexistence,
                     Kracauer saw boredom as the solitary mood of an individual having an experience
                     of the self. Distraction found its true “aesthetic vocation” in the cinema, an art
                     form that synchronized the sensoriums of crowded rooms of people from across
                     class divisions. But Kracauer understood boredom as an individual capacity that
                     was taken away by the live broadcast medium of radio. “Since many people feel compelled to broadcast, one
                     finds oneself in a state of permanent receptivity, constantly pregnant with
                     London, the Eiffel Tower, and Berlin. Who would want to resist the
                     invitation of those dainty headphones? . . . Silent and lifeless, people sit
                     side by side as if their souls were wandering far away”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#kracauer1995a">Kracauer 1995a [1924]</a>, 332–33]. In giving us over to the flow of
                     other minds on the airwaves, radio sets “allow oneself to be chased away.” But what do
                     we lose in that escape? The experience of boredom makes us confront ourselves,
                     whether it be in a state of isolation, expectation, or repetition. For Kracauer,
                     boredom “provides a kind of
                     guarantee that one is, so to speak, still in control of one's own
                     existence”
                     [<a class="ref" href="#kracauer1995a">Kracauer 1995a [1924]</a>, 334]. Distraction is a state we experience
                     together. Boredom is a feeling we face alone.

                     different ways, as Adam Phillips writes: “Clearly, we should speak not of
                     boredom, but of boredoms, because the notion itself includes a
                     multiplicity of moods and feelings that resist analysis”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#phillips1994">Phillips 1994</a>, 78]. Martin Doehlemann (cited in [<a class="ref" href="#svendsen2005">Svendsen 2005</a>]) distinguishes
                     between at least four different types of boredom, including situative boredom
                     (when we wait for something or someone in particular: a flight to arrive, a
                     lecture to end), the boredom of satiety (when we have had so much of something
                     that it becomes impossible to appreciate any more of the same), existential
                     boredom (when we desire or await not something in particular but the very
                     feeling of desire or expectation itself), and creative boredom (when we are
                     forced to go through the motions of a tedious, repetitive task with no hope for
                     spontaneity or variation). And yet for all the forms that boredom can take,
                     Kracauer's description of an emerging medium like radio having a decisive effect
                     on the way we experience boredom feels especially meaningful today. While the
                     collectivizing effects of cinematic distraction have evolved into a much more
                     atomized experience of scattered attention with digital media, the essential
                     crowding out of boredom by broadcast radio finds an analogue in the way we look
                     to our screens today. But what kinds of boredom are specifically foreclosed by
                     those distractions? And what would happen if we openly encouraged our students
                     to be bored in the classroom?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">Adam Phillips notes that “boredom is
                     akin to free-floating attention.” When we are bored we are “waiting, unconsciously, for an
                     experience of anticipation”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#phillips1994">Phillips 1994</a>]. Walter Benjamin writes in <cite class="title italic">The Arcades
                        Project</cite> convolute titled “Boredom, Eternal
                     Return”: “We are bored when we don’t know
                     what we are waiting for. That we do know or think we know is nearly
                     always the expression of our superficiality or inattention. Boredom is
                     the threshold of great deeds”
                      [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin1999">Benjamin 1999 [1927-1940]</a>, D2, 7]. Awaiting stimulus, purpose, any object at all on which to fix our
                     attention, boredom challenges us to confront the expansiveness of an
                     interminable present. When we push aside this feeling with a glance at our
                     screens, we open ourselves up to an entire world of information that ends up
                     crowding out the possibility of dwelling with one's own discomfort and
                     uncertainty. But we can learn from the challenge that boredom presents to
                     us.

                     <em class="emph">being</em> boring. While we very rarely have occasion to be bored
                     today, boredom remains a state that we can clearly convey to others by
                     telegraphing our indulgence in distraction, intentionally or otherwise. It is
                     too simple to say, for instance, that we constantly give ourselves over to
                     distraction either for the sake of itself or out of some instinctual avoidance
                     of boredom. Staring at a laptop or glancing at a phone: not only do these
                     gestures encompass a number of activities (paying a bill, taking a note, finding
                     a street), they are also gestures that signify distinct things in different
                     social contexts. Sometimes we want to appear busy even when we're not (waiting
                     for a friend at a bar), and sometimes we're rude when we don't mean to be
                     (waiting for an important message). So, one pedagogical challenge is to think
                     about how we want our students to perform boredom differently in the classroom.
                     If we agree that being bored is a worthwhile pursuit, how then do we foster
                     moments of boredom for our students, as well as model that practice outside of
                     the classroom?

                  <div class="ptext" id="p25">By encouraging boredom, I don't mean to suggest that we have students concentrate
                     harder no matter the cost or encourage them to fix their attention in any
                     particular way, as so many self-help books and corporate seminars now preach
                     under the banner of “mindfulness.” Boredom instead means roaming within
                     boundaries predetermined by our own interiorities rather than by digital
                     distractions: the harshly-lit space of the classroom, the text under discussion
                     as it's half-heard and floating in and out of conscious attention, the echoes of
                     a motorcycle some distance from campus, the argument we had that morning, and so
                     on. The discomfort of boredom, of “free-floating attention”
                     as we search for something to latch on to, creates a montage of attentional
                     objects. Boredom is mindfulness the hard way.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p26">Nor do I mean to suggest that we ban laptops altogether, a clumsy approach that
                     in fact privileges a single, idealized body and mind. The laptop ban is based on
                     the ableist assumption that these devices serve the same function in the way
                     that every student learns. Further, allowing laptops in the classroom only for
                     those students who struggle with learning issues like dysgraphia or dyspraxia
                     effectively outs their disability among their peers. This is what some pedagogy
                     researchers refer to as an “accommodationist” approach:
                     accommodating deviations from an assumed ideal to suit the needs of students who
                     don't fit that normative paradigm, rather than planning for accessibility in
                     advance [<a class="ref" href="#tremain2013">Tremain 2013</a>]. The laptop policy should be viewed
                     instead, as James Lang suggests, as an instrument to be calibrated throughout a
                     single class: for instance, laptops closed during the opening ten minutes for
                     group discussion, then open again for a writing assignment or lecture portion,
                     inviting laptop use so long as we are transparent with our students about how
                     and why we want them to be used [<a class="ref" href="#lang2016">Lang 2016</a>](). This approach has
                     the benefit of inviting a range of learning styles throughout the class session.
                     And it opens up the possibility for strategically encouraging boredom during
                     moments when we could all benefit from a measure of cognitive wandering.

                     missing the small moments of lag time on the aging, six-year-old computer that
                     it replaced. Previously, all I could do was wait and watch the spinning icon as
                     a website slowly loaded, or when switching between applications. Now, programs
                     load the instant they are invoked, as if the machine had anticipated my desires.
                     I have become acutely aware of how the rhythms of my work have changed as a
                     result. These moments of lag time with my old laptop allowed on the one hand for
                     the contemplation of the unseen, inner workings of the system. Why is this
                     taking so long? Has the program crashed? Can I free up any memory to make things
                     run faster? And on the other hand, these moments inadvertently allowed for a
                     brief meditative pause in which the slight interruption of my machine's slowness
                     punctuated a train of thought or a task I was working at. They were like little
                     micro-doses of boredom, the only time in my day that truly allowed for boredom
                     as such.

                     resisting the urge to fill the silence during a gap in conversation, might
                     invite students to be bored in a structured way. While distraction is attention
                     without direction, boredom is attention without object. The longer we delay the
                     resolution of a boredom that we have introduced into the classroom, the greater
                     the variety of objects and associations students are encouraged to bring to the
                     table. Making space for boredom gives us a way to forestall and frame our urge
                     for digital distractions without pretending like it's possible or even desirable
                     ever to be fully beyond their reach.
