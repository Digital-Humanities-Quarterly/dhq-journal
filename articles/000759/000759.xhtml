                  <p>This case study illustrates how carefully designed digital publications can make significant
                     contributions to 
                     decolonizing ethnomusicology. Drawing upon my recent experience creating <cite class="title italic">Sekuru's Stories</cite>, 
                     a co-authored digital humanities project featuring music from Southern Africa, I suggest several ways 
                     for ethnomusicologists to engage this decolonizing potential. Among other issues,
                     I discuss which digital platforms 
                     may prove most readily accessible to users with limited internet access, outline options
                     for making content available 
                     in indigenous languages, and highlight special interactive features such as comparative
                     map viewers and 3D imaging. 
                     I also discuss considerations in building digital projects that will prove accessible,
                     robust, and sustainable over 
                     time, as well as specific strategies for cultivating a wide audience. One highlight
                     of digital publication is its 
                     ability to support multiple navigation options, including both linear and non-linear
                     ways of moving through content. 
                     Similarly, digital projects can integrate both narrative and non-narrative formats,
                     blending aspects of monograph and 
                     website. When these considerations are taken into account, well-designed digital projects
                     are uniquely capable of 
                     reaching a wide audience of scholars, students, and laypeople. As evidence, I analyze
                     data from Google Analytics 
                     showing that the primary readership for our project is located in Southern Africa. I argue that digital 
                     humanities projects can prove accessible and engaging for non-specialists without
                     sacrificing scholarly rigor, and I 
                     call upon ethnomusicology to embrace the decolonizing potential of digital work. I
                     conclude by outlining concrete 
                     steps to place the digital humanities more firmly at the heart of our discipline.

                  <div class="ptext" id="p1">Shortly after arriving in Zimbabwean territory in the mid-1890s, the British South
                     Africa Police established a 
                     small camp in the town of Chinhoyi. Soon, however, British authority was threatened by a spirit medium 
                     named Sasa, who had settled at the nearby sacred site of Chirorodziva. Sasa was 
                     captured and taken to the police camp with his brothers, precipitating a dramatic
                     series of events still recounted by 
                     his descendants. Among them is Sekuru Tute Chigamba, a renowned performer of the Zimbabwean 
                     <em class="term">mbira dzavadzimu</em>, or mbira of the ancestral spirits. In Chigamba's telling, 
                     the British forces demanded that Sasa prove his legitimacy by making rain fall within the hour. Positioned 
                     beneath the hot sun, the brothers began to sing, “Kakore tenderera, kemvura 
                     tenderera”, or, “Little cloud, circle around, full of rain, circle around”. Soon, 
                     a small cloud appeared in the sky. The ensuing downpour lasted more than a day, and
                     after begging Sasa 
                     to halt the deluge, the British ordered him to resettle near the British encampment.
                     As Chigamba recounts, 
                     “The British said to Sasa, ‘Whenever we need rain, we will come 
                     to you. You are the… [best] rainmaker in Rhodesia’. … And people were coming to them
                     to ask for rain”.

                     a series of Chigamba's oral narratives through a born-digital project titled <cite class="title italic">Sekuru's 
                        Stories</cite> (<a href="http://sekuru.org/" onclick="window.open('http://sekuru.org/'); return false" class="ref">sekuru.org</a>). <cite class="title italic">Sekuru's Stories</cite> 
                     brings together a multimedia ethnographic archive of photographs, musical transcriptions,
                     maps, audio and visual 
                     recordings, and narrative text, making it a project ideally suited for digital as
                     opposed to manuscript publication 
                     (see Figure 1). This digital project was co-authored with Chigamba, who is often referred to by the 
                     honorific title <em class="term">Sekuru</em>, or “Grandfather”. Born in 1939, Sekuru Chigamba 
                     grew up immersed in the ritual life of northeastern Zimbabwe, where his father served as an interpreter 
                     for a senior clan spirit, or <em class="term">mhondoro</em>. Yet his father also worked as a cook on a succession 
                     of commercial farms owned by white Rhodesian settlers, giving the young Chigamba an intimate view of 
                     everyday colonial entanglements. Echoing one of the world's most recurring twentieth-century
                     narratives, 
                     Sekuru Chigamba migrated to the colonial capital in 1962. Here, he gained employment in a shop owned
                     by 
                     Albert Amato, a Jewish refugee who fled Rhodes Island during the Holocaust. During this time, 
                     Sekuru Chigamba also began teaching himself to play the <span class="foreign i">mbira dzavadzimu</span>. 
                     Now considered one of the world's foremost mbira musicians, Sekuru Chigamba has toured widely in 
                     Europe, North America, and beyond.

                     several of the nation's oral poetic genres, with emphasis on the resilience and contemporary
                     import of African 
                     languages and cultures. Among these genres were <span class="foreign i">tsumo</span> proverbs 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#hamutyinei1987">Hamutyinei 1987</a>], <span class="foreign i">nhetembo</span> praise poetry

                     By comparison, <span class="foreign i">nhoroondo</span> have received scant scholarly attention. This may be partly 
                     because the term <em class="term">nhoroondo</em> can refer to various ways of narrating the past, including 
                     legends and myths, specific historical accounts, individual life histories, and academic
                     narratives. A variety of 
                     other expressive forms, including songs, folktales, proverbs, and even dream narratives,
                     are also frequently caught 
                     up within <em class="term">nhoroondo</em>. As exemplified in Sekuru Chigamba's account of 
                     Sasa's encounter with British authorities, the narrative genre of 
                     <span class="foreign i">nhoroondo</span> brings together multiple strands of scholarly interest, including 
                     relationships between mediumship and musical performance [<a class="ref" href="#berliner1993">Berliner 1993</a>], ritual and place

                  <div class="ptext" id="p4">Through digital engagement with Sekuru Chigamba's narratives, <cite class="title italic">Sekuru's 
                        Stories</cite> takes up <span class="foreign i">nhoroondo</span> as a multivalent and polyphonic form, offering 
                     a new way of approaching Zimbabwean history, biography, and memoir. Following Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 
                     I consider Sekuru Chigamba's oral narratives through the larger framework of decoloniality, marked by an 
                     “epistemological movement gesturing towards…  the different ways of knowing by which
                     people across 
                     the human globe provide meaning to their existence” [<a class="ref" href="#ndlovu-gatsheni2019">Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2019</a>, 4]. This is 
                     especially significant in light of published accounts of Zimbabwe's colonial and postcolonial history, 
                     which includes a recent spate of both scholarly and popular memoirs [<a class="ref" href="#fuller2003">Fuller 2003</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#godwin2007">Godwin 2007</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#meldrum2005">Meldrum 2005</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#ranger2013">Ranger 2013</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#todd2007">Todd 2007</a>]. With 
                     the exception of the account of a few black nationalists [<a class="ref" href="#marembo2014">Marembo 2014</a>] [<a class="ref" href="#mayowe2015">Mayowe 2015</a>] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#msipa2015">Msipa 2015</a>], however, these memoirs overwhelmingly portray the experiences of expatriates and
                     white 
                     Zimbabweans.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e412">[1]</a> 
                     In this context, the digital presentation of Sekuru Chigamba's oral histories offers precisely the type 
                     of “counterstories” that “narrate away from the center of the digital humanities which
                     has been consistently and frequently imagined as a white, male, able-bodied, cisgendered,
                     heternormative space” (Kim 2018: 25-26). </div>

                     knowing, and doing” (Kim 2018: 4).<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e431">[2]</a> My account highlights specific strategies and approaches in building <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span>. Among them, I advocate for building accessible, robust, and sustainable digital
                     projects, making content available in indigenous languages, cultivating readerships

                     of Sekuru Chigamba's primary instrument, the <span class="hi italic">mbira dzavadzimu</span> (or mbira of the ancestral spirits), which has come to be one of Zimbabwe's most

                  <div class="ptext" id="p7">One of many types of mbira played throughout Southern Africa, the mbira dzavadzimu
                     features between 22 and 28 keys mounted on a wooden soundboard, or gwariva (see <span class="hi bold">Figure </span><span class="hi bold">2</span>). These keys are organized into three separate registers, with the highest register
                     on the instrument's right-hand side, a middle register on the instrument's upper left-hand
                     side, and the lowest register on the instrument's lower left-hand side. Played during
                     all-night ceremonies called mapira, the mbira is instrumental in summoning the ancestral
                     spirits to possess living mediums, known as masvikiro. The mbira's unique timbre is
                     produced by shells, bottle tops, or wire beads affixed to the instrument's soundboard,
                     which produce a gentle buzzing sound integral to generating states of trance. During
                     performance, the mbira is often placed inside a calabash resonator, or deze, which
                     amplifies its sound. Within a typical ensemble, mbira players are joined by at least

                     generally feature two interlocking parts, known as kushaura and kutsinhira, which
                     are played simultaneously by two or more musicians. The interplay between these parts
                     produces the complex polyphonic and polyrhythmic musical relationships characteristic
                     of mbira music. Because Sekuru Chigamba actively composes new songs for the <span class="hi italic">mbira</span>, his stories offer examples of innovation within a musical tradition often described
                     as inherently conservative in its orientation toward the past (Berliner 1993; Turino

                     support from the University of Rochester's Digital Scholarship, led by director Emily
                     Sherwood. With the backing of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, as well as dedicated
                     institutional investment, the University of Rochester is a leader in the field of
                     digital humanities. Many born-digital research projects supported by Digital Scholarship,
                     such as the Blake Archive, The Seward Family Archive, and The Bragdon Train Station,
                     have come to successful fruition. Through Digital Scholarship, I had access to a team
                     of tech professionals that included programmers, archivists, GIS research specialists,
                     visual technologists, and specialists in metadata, information discovery, and digitization.
                     After evaluating three different platforms - Omeka, Scalar, and Wordpress - we selected
                     Wordpress as best suited for broad, international accessibility. The team then helped
                     me select and customize a Wordpress theme that suited the project's requirements.
                     Along the way, we took care to minimize our use of plug-ins and external links to
                     ensure long-term sustainability. The team's initial contributions enabled me to work

                     relatively few digital humanities projects present monograph-length scholarly work
                     in the form of an interactive website. While many university presses now work digitally,
                     for example, they tend to employ the conventional format of e-books, which seldom

                  <div class="ptext" id="p12">In the first section of <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span>, titled “Early Years,” Sekuru Chigamba relates stories from his early years in Guruve,
                     beginning with his birth in 1939 and ending with his departure as a migrant laborer
                     in 1957. The stories in this section offer vivid oral testimony about the detrimental
                     effects of colonialization as experienced by an ordinary Zimbabwean family. At the
                     same time, the vibrant world of Zimbabwean musical practice within these stories illustrates
                     the vitality and resiliency of indigenous lifeways even under trying circumstances.
                     In the second section, titled “Musical Life,” he recounts stories about his life in
                     the urban capital, from his attendance at ceremonies in the early 1960s to his family's
                     experiences of extreme hardship in the late 1970s. Here, Sekuru's oral narratives
                     challenge conventional portrayals of the mbira dzavadzimu as an inherently conservative
                     musical tradition. Rather, his stories depict the mbira dzavadzimu as a vibrant musical
                     practice characterized by relentless innovation, creativity, and change.</div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p13">The third section of <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span>, titled “Independence,” begins at the pivotal moment of political decolonization,
                     which in turn paved the way for Sekuru Chigamba's emergence as an international touring
                     artist. The stories in this section illustrate how seemingly opposed spiritual figures
                     important during Zimbabwe's liberation struggle interact within a worldview that understands
                     political and religious authority as interrelated. Through his involvement as a mbira
                     musician, Sekuru Chigamba brought this worldview to life in many forms. These include
                     his work composing mbira songs and lyrics dedicated to senior ancestral spirits, his
                     creative arrangements of songs performed by Apostolic Christian leaders and their
                     followers, and his active musical participation in ceremonies organized by traditionalists
                     and Apostolic sects alike. In the process, Sekuru Chigamba's musical engagement and
                     oral histories have participated in what anthropologist Joost Fontein has called the
                     creation of “alternative, moral visions of the past, present and future” (2006: 178).

                     gwenyambira. This section includes a catalogue of various songs from the mbira's extensive
                     repertory, with audio examples and Sekuru Chigamba's explanation of each song's meaning
                     and significance. Here, Sekuru Chigamba's oral narratives describe constant practices
                     of innovation, revealing the creativity, experimentation, and innovation inherent
                     in indigenous ritual and musical traditions. In the fifth section, Sekuru Chigamba
                     turns to the ancestor spirits for whom the mbira has historically been performed.
                     The fifth section, titled “Ancestors,” presents Sekuru's Chigamba's understanding

                     <span class="hi italic">hungwe</span> (see Figure 6). Long held sacred by Shona speakers, the fish eagle is closely associated
                     with the pre-colonial empire of Great Zimbabwe in Masvingo, where several soapstone
                     carvings of fish eagles rose prominently from the imposing stone walls of the kingdom's
                     many enclosures. In the nineteenth century, colonial explorers removed these carvings
                     from the sacred site of Great Zimbabwe and sent them to various museums in apartheid
                     South Africa and Europe for display. Following independence, the carvings were subsequently
                     returned to Zimbabwe, with an initial group of four birds returned by South Africa
                     in the early 1980s, and a final sculpture returned by the German government in 2003
                     (Ranger 2004). The carvings' history has rendered them metonyms of national history

                     from Great Zimbabwe at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth
                     century, and final return to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s has come almost to symbolise
                     the cultural colonisation of Zimbabwe, and the ultimate victory of independence” (2006:

                     with as much national symbolic sentiment as these birds. They have become an intricate
                     part of the spiritual and historical basis of the state of Zimbabwe” (2006: 782).

                     carving has come to be known simply as the “Zimbabwe Bird.” It continues to serve
                     as the most prominent symbol of Zimbabwe's political independence, leading Sekuru
                     Chigamba to remark on how its image “continues to appear on all things related to
                     Zimbabwe.”<a class="noteRef" href="#d4e607">[4]</a> Indeed, the Zimbabwe Bird is rendered in various ways on the nation's currency and

                     <span class="hi italic">mutupo</span>. Indeed, Sekuru Chigamba was first motivated to carve the Zimbabwe Bird on the back

                     the fish eagle.' And then I added it. I said, ‘I am adding an image of my mother'”
                     (Interview with author, 18 May 2017). Shortly thereafter, Chigamba's fellow mbira
                     maker Chris Mhlanga noticed the carving, and encouraged him to begin carving it on
                     all of the instruments he made and sold. As Chigamba recalled, “Mhlanga saw it, and
                     said, ‘Oh, your mbira has an image of the fish eagle. Why?' I said, ‘That is my mother's
                     totem.' He said, ‘Put it on all your mbira.' Yes, and I said, ‘That's a great idea.'
                     Then I put an image of the fish eagle on all my mbira” (Interview with author, 18
                     May 2017). Sekuru Chigamba's carving of the Zimbabwe Bird thus functions both as a
                     widely recognized icon of political decolonization, and as an intimate remembrance
                     of his maternal lineage, history, and kinship networks.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p19">The elongated shape, unique patterning, and lack of color in Sekuru Chigamba's rendition
                     of the fish eagle clearly distinguish his carvings from the Zimbabwe Bird featured
                     on the nation's flag. In <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span>, his carving is rendered as a simple, black and white line drawing. While this color
                     scheme echoes the coloring of the fish eagle itself, black and white  also have particular
                     significance for mbira players, spirit mediums, and other ritual specialists. As Zimbabwean
                     scholar A.C. Hodza explains, “<span class="hi italic">Hungwe </span>(fish eagle) becomes sacred because of its two colours, namely, white and black… the
                     two colours are likened to two black and white pieces of cloth given to a spirit medium.
                     When the two pieces are sewn together, and have become one, it is called <span class="hi italic">jira rehungwe </span>or <span class="hi italic">fuko remudzimu</span>” (Roberts, Wylie, and Hodza 1982: 57). This color combination likewise inspired the
                     overall aesthetic of <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span>. Apart from photographs, the site's design largely features simple black text set
                     against a clean, white background, with shades of gray and tan used for most borders,
                     buttons, and hyperlinks. Like its logo, the color palette of <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> thus references both the black and white coloring of the fish eagle and the <span class="hi italic">jira rehungwe</span> cloths worn by mediums during spirit possession ceremonies, which are in turn the
                     subject of many of the oral narratives presented in this digital project.  </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p20">As critical digital pedagogy scholar Jesse Stommel has observed, “Making scholarly
                     work legible to the public and helping it find audiences is a form of outreach, community
                     building, and advocacy” (2018: 81). Early on, I made the decision to build <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> publicly, giving readers access to the site as I created it. In doing so, I sought
                     to build an audience for the project from the beginning, rather than waiting for the
                     project's completion. At the same time, I understood that readers would be more likely
                     to engage with the project's extensive materials piece by piece. Through the subscription
                     function on Wordpress, I sent out weekly emails informing subscribers about newly
                     published pages. I also shared new material on Facebook through my personal page,
                     and in groups for the global Zimbabwean music community. Finally, I circulated the
                     project through the Society for Ethnomusicology listserv, and various Zimbabwean music
                     community listservs. People began reading <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> immediately, with 162 users on the first day. These numbers picked up quickly with
                     more than three hundred readers in the first week, five hundred in the first month,
                     and twenty-two hundred in the first year, for a total of over twenty thousand individual
                     page views. <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> was also assigned in graduate and undergraduate classes in ethnomusicology during
                     the build phase. Presently, over fourteen thousand individual users have accessed
                     the site since I launched it in January 2019. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p21">During the build phase, the major readership for <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories </span>was in the United States and Canada, followed by a secondary concentration in Southern
                     Africa. Gradually, however, this situation has reversed, and most readers are now
                     located in Zimbabwe and South Africa, followed by the US and the UK. In one recent
                     month, for example, just over eleven hundred users visited <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span>. Fully seven hundred of them were in Zimbabwe, representing 65.23% of the site's
                     recent readership. And of the fourteen thousand individual users who have accessed
                     the site since its inception, nearly five thousand have been in Zimbabwe, with another
                     two thousand readers in South Africa. Together, this represents roughly half of the
                     total readership for the project. The US and the UK, on the other hand, jointly account
                     for just over four thousand discrete users, or roughly a third of the project's total

                  <div class="ptext" id="p22">Anthropology and related disciplines have increasingly recognized that ethnography
                     involves work “with real, everyday people who deserve to know what we are up to and
                     how we are interpreting their lives” (Lassiter 2005: 121). Enacting this premise in
                     a digital realm, <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> is designed for both scholars and general audiences, including a world-wide community
                     comprised of students and performers of the mbira dzavadzimu and related Zimbabwean
                     musical traditions. <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> is also specifically designed to appeal to both English and Shona speakers, as well
                     as readers with an interest in learning the Shona language. Many of Sekuru Chigamba's
                     stories are available in both Shona and English versions, with a button enabling viewers
                     to easily move between the two languages (see Figure 3). Combined with platform choices
                     and a public build, this Shona-language component has contributed significantly to
                     making <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> accessible to audiences in Zimbabwe and its associated diaspora. </div>

                  <div class="ptext" id="p23">As Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang remind us, decolonization is not a metaphor; rather,
                     it is the struggle for the “the repatriation of Indigenous land and life” (Tuck and
                     Yang 2012: 1) While co-authorship conveys some limited benefits within the international
                     framework of intellectual property rights, it does little to change material inequalities.
                     To this end, after receiving an ACLS Fellowship for <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span>, I found it important to share this funding with Sekuru Chigamba. With slightly over
                     half of the fellowship money, Sekuru Chigamba purchased a four-bedroom home for his
                     wife and young children. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I then began teaching online
                     community mbira classes to support my three primary mbira teachers, Musekiwa Chingodza,
                     Patience Munjeri, and Sekuru Chigamba, all of whom were affected through canceled
                     tours, closed post offices, and the demise of international travel. Over fifteen months,
                     these classes raised a total of around $35,000. Sekuru Chigamba's share of these funds
                     has enabled him to install solar panels and dig a generator-operated borehole, providing
                     the family with both electricity and running water. </div>

                     with whom we work” (Lassiter 2005: 83). In addition to writing articles, teaching
                     classes, and presenting at conferences, I have sought to privilege working with my
                     teachers on projects in which they derive significant economic benefit. The struggle
                     for the repatriation of indigenous life and land remains incomplete; as such, our
                     efforts to work toward collaborative projects must remain ongoing, and subject to
                     critique and revision at all times. Digital, online, and applied approaches to ethnomusicology
                     hold great promise for those of us who are committed to the co-creative process of

                     With funding from the University of Rochester Humanities Center, he also came to workshop
                     the material with Darien Lamen, Tony Perman, and Stefan Fiol, all of whom he knew
                     from their previous travel to Zimbabwe as graduate students in ethnomusicology. Our

                     in the Global North, without the participation of institutions and individuals working
                     in the digital humanities in Zimbabwe. This was largely due to the combined pressures
                     of balancing the demands of a tenure-track academic career and family life. In the
                     first place, I built <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> while raising my young, Black son as a single parent and full-time academic, with
                     limited working hours and ability to travel. At the same time, I conceived the project
                     while still a junior faculty member, which hindered my ability to envision and execute
                     complex collaborative projects spanning multiple institutions and continents. The
                     circumstances under which I built <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> reflect Kim's observations regarding how women and people of color may find themselves
                     “doing double or triple the work” as they seek to engage in the necessary “labor —
                     political, social, and cultural capital — to work ethically and with respect for various
                     communities” (2018: 486). They do not, however, erase critical distinctions between
                     the content of Sekuru's Stories, which was produced through a long-term, collaborative
                     effort between Sekuru Chigamba and myself, and the project's design, which I undertook

                     for future projects. This includes their capacity to present narrative content in
                     multiple languages, ability to integrate special interactive features, compatibility
                     with online music platforms such as Soundcloud and Bandcamp, and accessibility for
                     readerships located in the global south. Yet, the digital humanities continue to occupy
                     an uneasy space in academic scholarship. The ACLS Fellowship I received for <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> confirmed the project's scholarly importance and served a function akin to peer review.
                     <span class="hi italic">Sekuru's Stories</span> has also been favorably reviewed in many academic journals, including Reviews in
                     Digital Humanities 1(1), Journal of the American Musicological Society 73(2), African
                     Music 11(2), Yearbook for Traditional Music 52, and Ethnomusicology Forum 29(3). In
                     the absence of a formal peer-review process for digital humanities projects, fellowships
                     and scholarly reviews are two modes of providing evidence of a project's scholarly

                     These might include actions at the level of our professional societies such as creating
                     prizes specifically for digital projects, as well as opening existing prizes to digital
                     work as well as printed publications. Of equal if not greater importance, professional
                     societies should develop guidelines for evaluating work in digital humanities for
                     the purposes of hiring, tenure, and promotion. Such guidelines have been adopted by
                     some organizations, such as the American Musicological Society, the Modern Language

                     Association nearly a decade ago, in 2012. By developing their own detailed guidelines
                     for the evaluation of digital projects, professional societies can establish useful
                     baselines both within the disciplines, and for individual universities dealing with
                     questions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. </div>
