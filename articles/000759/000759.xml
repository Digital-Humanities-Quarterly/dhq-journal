          <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Shortly after arriving in Zimbabwean territory in the mid-1890s, the British South Africa Police established a small camp in the town of Chinhoyi. Soon, however, British authority was threatened by a spirit medium named Sasa, who had settled at the nearby sacred site of Chirorodziva. Sasa was captured and taken to the police camp with his brothers, precipitating a dramatic series of events still recounted by his descendants. Among them is Sekuru Tute Chigamba, a renowned performer of the Zimbabwean <hi rend="italic">mbira dzavadzimu</hi>, or mbira of the ancestral spirits. In Chigamba’s telling, the British forces demanded that Sasa prove his legitimacy by making rain fall within the hour. Positioned beneath the hot sun, the brothers began to sing, “<hi rend="italic">Kakore tenderera, kemvura tenderera</hi>,” or, “Little cloud, circle around, full of rain, circle around.” Soon, a small cloud appeared in the sky. The ensuing downpour lasted more than a day, and after begging Sasa to halt the deluge, the British ordered him to resettle near the British encampment. As Chigamba recounts, “The British said to Sasa, ‘Whenever we need rain, we will come to you. You are the… [best] rainmaker in Rhodesia.’… And people were coming to them to ask for rain.” </p>
            <p>Chigamba’s fascinating account of this colonial encounter belongs to the Shona narrative genre of <hi rend="italic">nhoroondo,</hi> or stories about the past. Drawing on decades of ethnographic work, I present a series of Chigamba’s oral narratives through a born-digital project titled <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> (<ref target="http://sekuru.org/">sekuru.org</ref>). <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories </hi>brings together a multimedia ethnographic archive of photographs, musical transcriptions, maps, audio and visual recordings, and narrative text, making it a project ideally suited for digital as opposed to manuscript publication (see Figure 1). This digital project was co-authored with Chigamba, who is often referred to by the honorific title <hi rend="italic">Sekuru</hi>, or “Grandfather.” Born in 1939, Sekuru Chigamba grew up immersed in the ritual life of northeastern Zimbabwe, where his father served as an interpreter for a senior clan spirit, or mhondoro. Yet his father also worked as a cook on a succession of commercial farms owned by white Rhodesian settlers, giving the young Chigamba an intimate view of everyday colonial entanglements. Echoing one of the world’s most recurring twentieth-century narratives, Sekuru Chigamba migrated to the colonial capital in 1962. Here, he gained employment in a shop owned by Albert Amato, a Jewish refugee who had fled Rhodes Island during the Holocaust. During this time, Sekuru Chigamba also began teaching himself to play the <hi rend="italic">mbira dzavadzimu</hi>. Now considered one of the world’s foremost mbira musicians, Sekuru Chigamba has toured widely in Europe, North America, and beyond. </p>

            <p>Around the time of Zimbabwe’s political independence, a rising tide of decolonial scholarship analyzed several of the nation’s oral poetic genres, with emphasis on the resilience and contemporary import of African languages and cultures. Among these genres were <hi rend="italic">tsumo</hi> proverbs (Hamutyinei 1987), <hi rend="italic">nhetembo</hi> praise poetry (Hodza and Fortune 1979), <hi rend="italic">ngano </hi>folktales (Hodza 1980), song lyrics (Pongweni 1982), and the didactic and narrative poetic forms of <hi rend="italic">nhango</hi> and<hi rend="italic"> ndyaringo </hi>(Fortune 1974). By comparison, <hi rend="italic">nhoroondo </hi>have received scant scholarly attention. This may be partly because the term <hi rend="italic">nhoroondo</hi> can refer to various ways of narrating the past, including legends and myths, specific historical accounts, individual life histories, and academic narratives. A variety of other expressive forms, including songs, folktales, proverbs, and even dream narratives, are also frequently caught up within <hi rend="italic">nhoroondo</hi>. As exemplified in Sekuru Chigamba’s account of Sasa’s encounter with British authorities, the narrative genre of <hi rend="italic">nhoroondo</hi> brings together multiple strands of scholarly interest, including relationships between mediumship and musical performance (Berliner 1993), ritual and place (Ranger 1999), and the problems of navigating different forms of power (Werbner 1991). </p>
            <p>Through digital engagement with Sekuru Chigamba’s narratives, <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> takes up <hi rend="italic">nhoroondo </hi>as a multivalent and polyphonic form, offering a new way of approaching Zimbabwean history, biography, and memoir. Following Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni, I consider Sekuru Chigamba’s oral narratives through the larger framework of decoloniality, marked by an “epistemological movement gesturing towards…  the different ways of knowing by which people across the human globe provide meaning to their existence” (2019: 4). This is especially significant in light of published accounts of Zimbabwe’s colonial and postcolonial history, which includes a recent spate of both scholarly and popular memoirs (Fuller 2003; Godwin 2007; Meldrum 2005; Ranger 2013; Todd 2007). With the exception of the account of a few black nationalists (Marembo 2014; Mayowe 2015; Msipa 2015), however, these memoirs overwhelmingly portray the experiences of expatriates and white Zimbabweans.<note> One notable exception is a memoir published by third-generation Chinese Zimbabwean Fay Chung, who played an important role in the nationalist movement (Chung 2006). </note> In this context, the digital presentation of Sekuru Chigamba’s oral histories offers precisely the type of “counterstories” that “narrate away from the center of the digital humanities which has been consistently and frequently imagined as a white, male, able-bodied, cisgendered, heternormative space” (Kim 2018: 25-26). </p>
            <p>Mhoze Chikowero has described the reclamation of ancestral figures as an important means of producing “usable pasts,” in which “the departed and the living, the past and the present, cooperated in a concerted self-liberations struggle” (2015: 213).</p>
            <p>Based in my experience creating <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, I discuss some of the many ways in which carefully designed digital publications can contribute to the decoloniality of knowledge by presenting new ways “of thinking, knowing, and doing” (Kim 2018: 4).<note> I take the idea of decoloniality of knowledge specifically from the work of Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni (2019). Echoing Kim’s formulation, Ndlovu-Gatsheni likewise emphasizes the importance of “the emergence of another-thinking, another-logic, and another-world view” (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2018: 16).</note> My account highlights specific strategies and approaches in building <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>. Among them, I advocate for building accessible, robust, and sustainable digital projects, making content available in indigenous languages, cultivating readerships outside North America and Europe, and integrating non-linear as well as linear paths through digital humanities projects. I also discuss how specific design elements in <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, notably its logo and color scheme, both reflect and contribute to the project’s decolonial goals. Before turning to the project itself, however, I offer a brief description of Sekuru Chigamba’s primary instrument, the <hi rend="italic">mbira dzavadzimu</hi> (or mbira of the ancestral spirits), which has come to be one of Zimbabwe’s most iconic musical traditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>The Mbira Dzavadzimu</head>
            <p>One of many types of mbira played throughout Southern Africa, the mbira dzavadzimu features between 22 and 28 keys mounted on a wooden soundboard, or gwariva (see <hi rend="bold">Figure </hi><hi rend="bold">2</hi>). These keys are organized into three separate registers, with the highest register on the instrument’s right-hand side, a middle register on the instrument’s upper left-hand side, and the lowest register on the instrument’s lower left-hand side. Played during all-night ceremonies called mapira, the mbira is instrumental in summoning the ancestral spirits to possess living mediums, known as masvikiro. The mbira’s unique timbre is produced by shells, bottle tops, or wire beads affixed to the instrument’s soundboard, which produce a gentle buzzing sound integral to generating states of trance. During performance, the mbira is often placed inside a calabash resonator, or deze, which amplifies its sound. Within a typical ensemble, mbira players are joined by at least one musician playing the <hi rend="italic">hosho</hi> shakers, which are responsible for maintaining a steady triplet pulse. The hosho also contribute a dense, distinctive timbral quality that complements the buzzing tone of the mbira.</p>

              <graphic url="resources/images/figure02.png"></graphic>
            </figure>
            <p>The repertory of the mbira dzavadzimu includes well over a hundred songs. While some are specific to particular regions, families, or individuals, others are widely shared, immediately enabling musicians from different areas to play together. Mbira songs generally feature two interlocking parts, known as kushaura and kutsinhira, which are played simultaneously by two or more musicians. The interplay between these parts produces the complex polyphonic and polyrhythmic musical relationships characteristic of mbira music. Because Sekuru Chigamba actively composes new songs for the <hi rend="italic">mbira</hi>, his stories offer examples of innovation within a musical tradition often described as inherently conservative in its orientation toward the past (Berliner 1993; Turino 2000). In addition, <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> presents a range of other musical practices, from twentieth-century acoustic guitar playing to endangered Zimbabwean musical bows such as the <hi rend="italic">mukube</hi>, <hi rend="italic">chipendani,</hi> and the groundbow.</p>

          <head>Building Sekuru’s Stories</head>
            <p>I developed <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> between April 2018 and September 2019 with funding from an ACLS Fellowship and institutional support from the University of Rochester’s Digital Scholarship, led by director Emily Sherwood. With the backing of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, as well as dedicated institutional investment, the University of Rochester is a leader in the field of digital humanities. Many born-digital research projects supported by Digital Scholarship, such as the Blake Archive, The Seward Family Archive, and The Bragdon Train Station, have come to successful fruition. Through Digital Scholarship, I had access to a team of tech professionals that included programmers, archivists, GIS research specialists, visual technologists, and specialists in metadata, information discovery, and digitization. After evaluating three different platforms - Omeka, Scalar, and Wordpress - we selected Wordpress as best suited for broad, international accessibility. The team then helped me select and customize a Wordpress theme that suited the project’s requirements. Along the way, we took care to minimize our use of plug-ins and external links to ensure long-term sustainability. The team’s initial contributions enabled me to work independently throughout the rest of the year as I built the project’s internal structure and added content.</p>

          <head>Structuring a Digital Monograph</head>	
            <p>Designed as a digital monograph, <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> is organized into five sections roughly akin to chapters, allowing readers to page sequentially through its content. Reflecting this project’s structure as a digital monograph, its initial landing page is designed to look like the digital analogue of a physical book cover (see Figure 4). Despite growing interest in the digital humanities, relatively few digital humanities projects present monograph-length scholarly work in the form of an interactive website. While many university presses now work digitally, for example, they tend to employ the conventional format of e-books, which seldom accommodate extensive multi-media features. Projects such as digital archives, on the other hand, often focus primarily on curating primary source materials rather than presenting detailed interpretation and analysis. With its distinctive format as a born-digital monograph, <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> has proven exceptionally successful in garnering readers in Southern Africa and in the Global North.   </p>

            </figure>
            <p>Reflecting the multivalent nature of Sekuru Chigamba’s oral narratives, <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> is designed to encourage various modes of engagement, making it accessible and engaging for general audiences and specialists alike. Organized in chronological order, the first three sections of the project – Early Years, Musical Life, and Independence – chart the trajectory of Sekuru’s Chigamba’s life. Two other sections – Mbira and Ancestors – present Sekuru Chigamba’s specialized knowledge of Zimbabwean music and history. Each section of the project is accessible through the top navigation bar, which serves as an analogue to the table of contents in a physical book. Within each section are the actual stories, which may be read individually or sequentially, and are accessible through drop-down menus. In addition, each section of the site features introductory and concluding essays framing the stories within that section for readers. </p>
            <p>In the first section of <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, titled “Early Years,” Sekuru Chigamba relates stories from his early years in Guruve, beginning with his birth in 1939 and ending with his departure as a migrant laborer in 1957. The stories in this section offer vivid oral testimony about the detrimental effects of colonialization as experienced by an ordinary Zimbabwean family. At the same time, the vibrant world of Zimbabwean musical practice within these stories illustrates the vitality and resiliency of indigenous lifeways even under trying circumstances. In the second section, titled “Musical Life,” he recounts stories about his life in the urban capital, from his attendance at ceremonies in the early 1960s to his family’s experiences of extreme hardship in the late 1970s. Here, Sekuru’s oral narratives challenge conventional portrayals of the mbira dzavadzimu as an inherently conservative musical tradition. Rather, his stories depict the mbira dzavadzimu as a vibrant musical practice characterized by relentless innovation, creativity, and change.</p>
            <p>The third section of <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, titled “Independence,” begins at the pivotal moment of political decolonization, which in turn paved the way for Sekuru Chigamba’s emergence as an international touring artist. The stories in this section illustrate how seemingly opposed spiritual figures important during Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle interact within a worldview that understands political and religious authority as interrelated. Through his involvement as a mbira musician, Sekuru Chigamba brought this worldview to life in many forms. These include his work composing mbira songs and lyrics dedicated to senior ancestral spirits, his creative arrangements of songs performed by Apostolic Christian leaders and their followers, and his active musical participation in ceremonies organized by traditionalists and Apostolic sects alike. In the process, Sekuru Chigamba’s musical engagement and oral histories have participated in what anthropologist Joost Fontein has called the creation of “alternative, moral visions of the past, present and future” (2006: 178). </p>
            <p>In the fourth section of the project, titled “Mbira,” Sekuru Chigamba offers a detailed account of his primary instrument, the mbira dzavadzimu, exploring topics such as the mbira’s origins, the law of mbira, and the social role of the mbira player, or gwenyambira. This section includes a catalogue of various songs from the mbira’s extensive repertory, with audio examples and Sekuru Chigamba’s explanation of each song’s meaning and significance. Here, Sekuru Chigamba’s oral narratives describe constant practices of innovation, revealing the creativity, experimentation, and innovation inherent in indigenous ritual and musical traditions. In the fifth section, Sekuru Chigamba turns to the ancestor spirits for whom the mbira has historically been performed. The fifth section, titled “Ancestors,” presents Sekuru’s Chigamba’s understanding of the long perspective of Zimbabwean history. </p>
            <p>The last section of the site, titled “Explore,” invites readers into the project through completely different modes of engagement (see Figure 5). This section offers several non-linear paths through the site, inviting viewers to engage with an extensive image gallery, musical archive, and other special features. These include a 3-D viewer of one of Sekuru Chigamba’s oldest instruments, online audio streaming through a SoundCloud playlist, free digital audio downloads through Bandcamp, an interactive family tree and timeline, and individual pages describing several indigenous Zimbabwean instruments.</p>

          <head>Design choices in Sekuru’s Stories</head>
            <p>The single most prominent design element in <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> is its logo, which depicts a stylized version of a fish eagle, known in Shona as <hi rend="italic">hungwe</hi> (see Figure 6). Long held sacred by Shona speakers, the fish eagle is closely associated with the pre-colonial empire of Great Zimbabwe in Masvingo, where several soapstone carvings of fish eagles rose prominently from the imposing stone walls of the kingdom’s many enclosures. In the nineteenth century, colonial explorers removed these carvings from the sacred site of Great Zimbabwe and sent them to various museums in apartheid South Africa and Europe for display. Following independence, the carvings were subsequently returned to Zimbabwe, with an initial group of four birds returned by South Africa in the early 1980s, and a final sculpture returned by the German government in 2003 (Ranger 2004). The carvings’ history has rendered them metonyms of national history writ large, In the words of anthropologist Joost Fontein, “The story of their removal from Great Zimbabwe at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century, and final return to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s has come almost to symbolise the cultural colonisation of Zimbabwe, and the ultimate victory of independence” (2006: 782).</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>Fontein procedes to observe, “Apart from Great Zimbabwe itself, nothing has been invested with as much national symbolic sentiment as these birds. They have become an intricate part of the spiritual and historical basis of the state of Zimbabwe” (2006: 782). Epitomizing these associations, the national flag hoisted to replace the British Union Jack on the eve of Zimbabwe’s independence — April 18, 1980 — featured a black-and-yellow line drawing of the fish eagle, based on the most iconic of the Great Zimbabwe sculptures.<note> In addition to its depiction on the flag, a more intricate rendering of the same sculpture has also frequently appears on Zimbabwe’s currency.</note> Inherently tied to the moment of the nation’s political decolonization, this particular carving has come to be known simply as the “Zimbabwe Bird.” It continues to serve as the most prominent symbol of Zimbabwe’s political independence, leading Sekuru Chigamba to remark on how its image “continues to appear on all things related to Zimbabwe.”<note> Kyker, Jennifer and Tute Chigamba. 2018. “Masvingo’s Rise and Fall,” <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> (sekuru.org)</note> Indeed, the Zimbabwe Bird is rendered in various ways on the nation’s currency and coat of arms, as well as in parastatal and private company logos (Fontein 2006: 782). </p>
            <p>Centrally positioned in the static header that appears on all pages on the site (see Figure 7), the logo for <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> features Sekuru Chigamba’s own rendition of the Zimbabwe Bird, which he began carving into the wooden soundboard of mbira instruments shortly after it was adopted as a symbol of the new nation in the early 1980s. Yet Sekuru Chigamba also holds the fish eagle particularly meaningful on a personal level, as it was his mother’s totem, or <hi rend="italic">mutupo</hi>. Indeed, Sekuru Chigamba was first motivated to carve the Zimbabwe Bird on the back of his own personal instrument as a form of remembrance, or <hi rend="italic">mucherechedzo</hi>. As he told me, “It was a form of remembrance. I did it for my mother, who is of the Shiri (bird) totem, that fish eagle… I just thought, ‘Let me add the image of the fish eagle.’ And then I added it. I said, ‘I am adding an image of my mother’” (Interview with author, 18 May 2017). Shortly thereafter, Chigamba’s fellow mbira maker Chris Mhlanga noticed the carving, and encouraged him to begin carving it on all of the instruments he made and sold. As Chigamba recalled, “Mhlanga saw it, and said, ‘Oh, your mbira has an image of the fish eagle. Why?’ I said, ‘That is my mother’s totem.’ He said, ‘Put it on all your mbira.’ Yes, and I said, ‘That’s a great idea.’ Then I put an image of the fish eagle on all my mbira” (Interview with author, 18 May 2017). Sekuru Chigamba’s carving of the Zimbabwe Bird thus functions both as a widely recognized icon of political decolonization, and as an intimate remembrance of his maternal lineage, history, and kinship networks.  </p>

            <p>The elongated shape, unique patterning, and lack of color in Sekuru Chigamba’s rendition of the fish eagle clearly distinguish his carvings from the Zimbabwe Bird featured on the nation’s flag. In <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, his carving is rendered as a simple, black and white line drawing. While this color scheme echoes the coloring of the fish eagle itself, black and white  also have particular significance for mbira players, spirit mediums, and other ritual specialists. As Zimbabwean scholar A.C. Hodza explains, “<hi rend="italic">Hungwe </hi>(fish eagle) becomes sacred because of its two colours, namely, white and black… the two colours are likened to two black and white pieces of cloth given to a spirit medium. When the two pieces are sewn together, and have become one, it is called <hi rend="italic">jira rehungwe </hi>or <hi rend="italic">fuko remudzimu</hi>” (Roberts, Wylie, and Hodza 1982: 57). This color combination likewise inspired the overall aesthetic of <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>. Apart from photographs, the site’s design largely features simple black text set against a clean, white background, with shades of gray and tan used for most borders, buttons, and hyperlinks. Like its logo, the color palette of <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> thus references both the black and white coloring of the fish eagle and the <hi rend="italic">jira rehungwe</hi> cloths worn by mediums during spirit possession ceremonies, which are in turn the subject of many of the oral narratives presented in this digital project.  </p>

          <head>Cultivating readership in the Global South</head>
            <p>As critical digital pedagogy scholar Jesse Stommel has observed, “Making scholarly work legible to the public and helping it find audiences is a form of outreach, community building, and advocacy” (2018: 81). Early on, I made the decision to build <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> publicly, giving readers access to the site as I created it. In doing so, I sought to build an audience for the project from the beginning, rather than waiting for the project’s completion. At the same time, I understood that readers would be more likely to engage with the project’s extensive materials piece by piece. Through the subscription function on Wordpress, I sent out weekly emails informing subscribers about newly published pages. I also shared new material on Facebook through my personal page, and in groups for the global Zimbabwean music community. Finally, I circulated the project through the Society for Ethnomusicology listserv, and various Zimbabwean music community listservs. People began reading <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> immediately, with 162 users on the first day. These numbers picked up quickly with more than three hundred readers in the first week, five hundred in the first month, and twenty-two hundred in the first year, for a total of over twenty thousand individual page views. <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> was also assigned in graduate and undergraduate classes in ethnomusicology during the build phase. Presently, over fourteen thousand individual users have accessed the site since I launched it in January 2019. </p>
            <p>During the build phase, the major readership for <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories </hi>was in the United States and Canada, followed by a secondary concentration in Southern Africa. Gradually, however, this situation has reversed, and most readers are now located in Zimbabwe and South Africa, followed by the US and the UK. In one recent month, for example, just over eleven hundred users visited <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>. Fully seven hundred of them were in Zimbabwe, representing 65.23% of the site’s recent readership. And of the fourteen thousand individual users who have accessed the site since its inception, nearly five thousand have been in Zimbabwe, with another two thousand readers in South Africa. Together, this represents roughly half of the total readership for the project. The US and the UK, on the other hand, jointly account for just over four thousand discrete users, or roughly a third of the project’s total readership. </p>
            <p>Anthropology and related disciplines have increasingly recognized that ethnography involves work “with real, everyday people who deserve to know what we are up to and how we are interpreting their lives” (Lassiter 2005: 121). Enacting this premise in a digital realm, <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> is designed for both scholars and general audiences, including a world-wide community comprised of students and performers of the mbira dzavadzimu and related Zimbabwean musical traditions. <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> is also specifically designed to appeal to both English and Shona speakers, as well as readers with an interest in learning the Shona language. Many of Sekuru Chigamba’s stories are available in both Shona and English versions, with a button enabling viewers to easily move between the two languages (see Figure 3). Combined with platform choices and a public build, this Shona-language component has contributed significantly to making <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> accessible to audiences in Zimbabwe and its associated diaspora. </p>

          <head>Decolonization and fieldwork ethics</head>
            <p>As Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang remind us, decolonization is not a metaphor; rather, it is the struggle for the “the repatriation of Indigenous land and life” (Tuck and Yang 2012: 1) While co-authorship conveys some limited benefits within the international framework of intellectual property rights, it does little to change material inequalities. To this end, after receiving an ACLS Fellowship for <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, I found it important to share this funding with Sekuru Chigamba. With slightly over half of the fellowship money, Sekuru Chigamba purchased a four-bedroom home for his wife and young children. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, I then began teaching online community mbira classes to support my three primary mbira teachers, Musekiwa Chingodza, Patience Munjeri, and Sekuru Chigamba, all of whom were affected through canceled tours, closed post offices, and the demise of international travel. Over fifteen months, these classes raised a total of around $35,000. Sekuru Chigamba’s share of these funds has enabled him to install solar panels and dig a generator-operated borehole, providing the family with both electricity and running water. </p>
            <p>My collaborative, digital projects with Sekuru Chigamba and other Zimbabwean musicians reflect my conviction that our “primary responsibility is to the community consultants with whom we work” (Lassiter 2005: 83). In addition to writing articles, teaching classes, and presenting at conferences, I have sought to privilege working with my teachers on projects in which they derive significant economic benefit. The struggle for the repatriation of indigenous life and land remains incomplete; as such, our efforts to work toward collaborative projects must remain ongoing, and subject to critique and revision at all times. Digital, online, and applied approaches to ethnomusicology hold great promise for those of us who are committed to the co-creative process of this ethical imperative.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Moving forward</head>
            <p>The digital humanities offer unique opportunities for ethnomusicologists to work toward innovative projects with our research collaborators. As we worked together on developing <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, Sekuru Chigamba read over and commented upon all my transcriptions and translations. With funding from the University of Rochester Humanities Center, he also came to workshop the material with Darien Lamen, Tony Perman, and Stefan Fiol, all of whom he knew from their previous travel to Zimbabwe as graduate students in ethnomusicology. Our discussions at this workshop proved essential in enabling me to develop the theoretical framing for the individual stories on the site and brought our voices together much more closely than if I had worked on this material independently. </p>
            <p>While <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> was co-authored, one of the project’s limitations is a design team based entirely in the Global North, without the participation of institutions and individuals working in the digital humanities in Zimbabwe. This was largely due to the combined pressures of balancing the demands of a tenure-track academic career and family life. In the first place, I built <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> while raising my young, Black son as a single parent and full-time academic, with limited working hours and ability to travel. At the same time, I conceived the project while still a junior faculty member, which hindered my ability to envision and execute complex collaborative projects spanning multiple institutions and continents. The circumstances under which I built <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> reflect Kim’s observations regarding how women and people of color may find themselves “doing double or triple the work” as they seek to engage in the necessary “labor — political, social, and cultural capital — to work ethically and with respect for various communities” (2018: 486). They do not, however, erase critical distinctions between the content of Sekuru’s Stories, which was produced through a long-term, collaborative effort between Sekuru Chigamba and myself, and the project’s design, which I undertook largely on my own.    </p>
            <p>Following directly on <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, I am currently working toward a second digital project that will bridge various departments at the University of Rochester and the University of Zimbabwe, representing a more sustained, collaborative foray into the digital humanities. Provisionally titled <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Zimbabwe/Mufananidzo weZimbabwe</hi>, this project will curate and present an extensive selection of images from the Chicago Dzviti Photographic Archive.<note><ref target="https://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/finding-aids/D537">https://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/finding-aids/D537</ref></note> Several of these images were also featured in <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> (see Figure 8), paving the way for this new project. The design team for <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Zimbabwe/Mufananidzo weZimbabwe</hi> will include Dr. Bridget Chinouriri in the Department of Creative Media and Communication and Dr. Reggemore Marongedze in the Department of History, Heritage, and Knowledge Systems. Through a multimedia approach linking Dzviti’s photographs of Zimbabwean musicians to audio examples, physical instruments, and ephemera, our collaborative digital humanities project will offer a unique depiction of Zimbabwean musical life as viewed through the eyes of a pioneering Zimbabwean visual artist. Expanding my initial work on <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Zimbabwe/Mufananidzo weZimbabwe</hi> represents a more complex and sustained collaborative effort in digital publication, in which scholars located on both sides of the Atlantic engage as digital subjects and producers.<note> I thank an anonymous reviewer for this wording.  </note></p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> illustrates several promising facets of the digital humanities, with great significance for future projects. This includes their capacity to present narrative content in multiple languages, ability to integrate special interactive features, compatibility with online music platforms such as Soundcloud and Bandcamp, and accessibility for readerships located in the global south. Yet, the digital humanities continue to occupy an uneasy space in academic scholarship. The ACLS Fellowship I received for <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> confirmed the project’s scholarly importance and served a function akin to peer review. <hi rend="italic">Sekuru’s Stories</hi> has also been favorably reviewed in many academic journals, including Reviews in Digital Humanities 1(1), Journal of the American Musicological Society 73(2), African Music 11(2), Yearbook for Traditional Music 52, and Ethnomusicology Forum 29(3). In the absence of a formal peer-review process for digital humanities projects, fellowships and scholarly reviews are two modes of providing evidence of a project’s scholarly rigor.</p>
            <p>There are many other ways in which ethnomusicology and other academic disciplines can and should work toward facilitating full acceptance of digital humanities projects. These might include actions at the level of our professional societies such as creating prizes specifically for digital projects, as well as opening existing prizes to digital work as well as printed publications. Of equal if not greater importance, professional societies should develop guidelines for evaluating work in digital humanities for the purposes of hiring, tenure, and promotion. Such guidelines have been adopted by some organizations, such as the American Musicological Society, the Modern Language Association, and the American Historical Association. Yet many of these statements do little more than refer readers back to guidelines developed by the Modern Language Association nearly a decade ago, in 2012. By developing their own detailed guidelines for the evaluation of digital projects, professional societies can establish useful baselines both within the disciplines, and for individual universities dealing with questions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. </p>
